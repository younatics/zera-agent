"This is the battered face of an 81-year-old great grandfather and war veteran who dared to challenge a gang of young thugs. Having survived three years as a prisoner of war in Korea, Barney Alcock wasn’t scared to confront the youngsters he found throwing fruit at his window. The result was a beating which left him with savage cuts and bruises to his face, and so traumatised that he has had little to eat or drink for a week. 'Shouting': Veteran Barney Alcock, 81, had left his house in Grimsby to plead with the group of young boys to stop throwing fruit at his windows . His wife Thelma, 76, who was on the . phone to police reporting the youngsters when he was attacked, found him . lying face down on the ground with his glasses broken and vest drenched . in blood. Police later arrested a 14-year-old boy over the attack. The teenager was allegedly among a . group of youths who had spent the evening hanging around the street in . Grimsby, Lincolnshire, shouting abuse and throwing berries at the . elderly couple’s window. Mrs Alcock said she had gone outside to tell them off and Mr Alcock, a former army corporal, was woken up and did the same. Mrs Alcock said: ‘There is no such thing as respect for elders nowadays. I was horrified to find what they had done to Barney.’ She said Mr Alcock, who suffers from . dementia, had quickly forgotten what had happened to him and repeatedly . asked her why he was covered in blood. ‘He is in so much agony and  keeps . touching his head asking why it hurts. He has hardly eaten or drunk . anything since this happened. It’s really affected him deep inside. ‘He’s afraid to go out and for people to see his injuries in the street.’ Distress: Mr Alcock, 81, has struggled to eat or drink in the wake of the attack in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, his wife said . Attack: The youths turned on Mr Alcock when he tried to reason with them in Winchester Avenue, near his home in Grimsby . Mrs Alcock said when she  realised . they were hurling berries at the window she stood at the front door . telling them to stop. When I threatened to call the police, they swore . and said “call the police and see if we care”. Barney was in bed and was woken by their constant swearing and shouting.’ Mr Alcock stood at his gate for ten . minutes talking to the youths, who walked off. But soon after they . returned and Mr Alcock went outside again and was assaulted. ‘He crossed the road to ask them to . leave as I watched from the front window and called the police,’ said . Mrs Alcock. ‘I turned back from the phone to see Barney lying on the . ground covered in blood and the boys running away.’ She added: ‘I was absolutely . petrified, shaking and didn’t  know what to do. We’ve never had any sort . of trouble on this estate and we’ve lived here over 50 years.’ Barney and Thelma Alcock pictured on their wedding day in 1956 . After surviving being a prisoner of . war in the 1950s, Mr Alcock worked as a builder and lorry driver and has . six children, 15 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren. He said yesterday: ‘I’ve suffered . worse injuries than this in the Korean war. I’ve had a lot of people . ringing me up to see how I am.’ Mrs Alcock said: ‘He is a . happy-go-lucky bloke. He has a good sense of humour and loves being with . kids. It’s just awful to think that a gang of kids would do something . like this. How would they feel if it was their grandad?’ A Humberside Police spokesman said the 14-year-old boy arrested has been released on police bail. Detective Chief Inspector Craig . Scaife said: ‘Our efforts will be concentrated on establishing the . circumstances leading to this attack.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Barney Alcock, 81, had tried to reason with gang of eight or nine boys .

"Some people are excited by the prospect of driverless cars, which allow passengers to kick back and enjoy the ride without a care in the world. But others worry that the technology could lead to diminished responsibility on the roads. In a bid to strike a balance and speed up the development of the technology while keeping motorists safe, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) will grant licenses to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as September. Driving test: The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) will grant licenses to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as September. A Google self-driving car, a white Lexus, is pictured . Cars could be driving themselves down European streets far sooner than expected, thanks to a change in a global treaty backed by European countries. A little-noticed amendment to the United Nations Convention on Road Traffic agreed last month would let drivers take their hands off the wheel of self-driving cars. It was pushed by Germany, Italy and France, whose high-end carmakers believe they are ready to zoom past American tech pioneers and bring the first 'autonomous vehicles' to market. Moving from test drives to marketable products was held back by Article 8 of the 1968 Convention on Road Traffic, which stipulates: 'Every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals.' The amendment agreed last month by the U.N. Working Party on Road Traffic Safety would allow a car to drive itself, as long as the system 'can be overridden or switched off by the driver'. A driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time. Provided the amendment clears all bureaucratic hurdles, all 72 countries that are party to the convention would have to work the new rules into their laws. The convention covers European countries, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Russia, although not the United States, Japan or China. The licenses will cost $150 (£89) for 10 vehicles and up to 20 ‘test’ drivers, but they are designed for the testing of the technology by manufacturers such as Google, rather than members of the public. The terms of the licence are strict and say that a car ‘needs to be insured for at least $5,000,000 (£3million) against personal injury, death, or property damage.’ The rules say that test drivers must sit in the driver's seat and be capable of immediately taking control of the vehicle. They will also have to have complete a training programme and obey all the usual rules of the road. ‘The test driver must have been a licensed driver for at least three years, with no more than one point on their license and no accidents that resulted in injuries,’ the DMV said. The rules also state that any accidents that occur while operating an autonomous car, which result in damage or injury, must be reported to the authorities within 10 days. Currently the states of California, Nevada, Florida and Michigan allow the testing of Google's autonomous vehicles on their roads. Applications for the license open in July and the first licenses are set to be granted in September. However, . members of the public will have to wait longer before they are let . loose on public roads hands-free as their car drives for them. ‘Rules . governing public operation of autonomous vehicles are currently being . developed by DMV and are expected to be adopted by January 1, 2015,’ the . department said. Easy rider: The licences only apply to employees of autonomous vehicle manufacturers  and say that a car 'needs to be insured for at least $5,000,000 against personal injury, death, or property damage.'

"Shoplifters are being sent to food banks as part of a crackdown on crime as police raise concerns that hunger is behind the rising number of offences across Britain. Police chiefs around the country have raised concerns over a sharp rise in the numbers of first-time offenders stealing from supermarkets. Quarterly crime figures due to be released next week are expected to show an increasing number of shoplifting offences recorded by 37 of Britain's 43 police forces, according to The Times. Austerity crime: Shoplifters are being sent to food banks as part of a crack down on crime as police raise concerns that hunger is behind the rising number of offences across Britain . However, the country's overall crime rate is falling as the success of London's Metropolitan Police - which accounts for around 20 per cent of all recorded crime - is obscuring rising figures in other areas. According to The Times the new figures from the Office for National Statistics will show that crime in the capital has fallen by around six per cent, while other forces experience a rise. 'Without this progress in London, it . might not be possible for the Home Office to laud a national crime . reduction this year,' London's deputy mayor for policing and crime Stephen Greenhalgh told the newspaper. In 2012-13 there were 36,500 shoplifting offences in the capital, compared with 42,000 in 2009-10. Mr Greenhalgh said Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe should be credited for the falling crime rate. 'Criminals here are on the back foot . because the cops are working harder and smarter, not because more people . are in work,' he added. Trend: In North Wales instances of shoplifting have increased by 21.7 per cent compared with last year . Help: North Wales PCC Winston Roddick said arrested shoplifters would be directed to food banks in the hope that ensuring people were not hungry would reduce the number of thefts . Assistant Commissioner Helen King, from the Metropolitan Police Service, said: 'We are committed to cutting crime, with burglary at its lowest in 40 years and robbery at its lowest in 15 years. We’ve also had some excellent results in tackling gangs, weapon-related crime and youth violence. 'This has been achieved as a result of a lot of hard work by our officers across London with the support from our partners and the public to bring offenders to justice and improve our service to victims. 'We are moving in the right direction, but there’s still a great deal of work to do to cut crime further. I hope the people of London will be reassured by these successes and our commitment to making our city a safe and great place to be.' But while the capital is leading the country's economic recovery, police in other areas have blamed austerity for rising numbers of shoplifting offences. In North Wales instances of shoplifting have increased by 21.7 per cent compared with last year, and the area's police and crime commissioner said such thefts now accounted for 10 per cent of all crime in the region. Winston Roddick said he believed hunger is an underlying cause of the offences, and told business leaders at a meeting last week that arrested shoplifters would be directed to food banks in the hope that ensuring people were not hungry would reduce the number of thefts. 'Officers tell me that interviews of offenders and . analysis of types of items stolen suggest many offences are committed to . raise money to feed a drug habit or to obtain food,' he told the North Wales . Business Club and the Institute of Directors. Research from The Trussell Trust suggests that the number of adults and children using food banks has now exceeded 900,000. The charity said that 913,000 people, 330,205 of them children, had received at least  three-days' emergency help during 2013-14, with researchers claiming the 162 per cent jump in people seeking assistance is due to rising living . costs combined with low pay and problems over welfare payments. The Trussell Trust now has more than 400 food banks across the UK, and aims to have one in every town. The banks were opening at a rate of two a week to cope with the number of people facing food shortages, but this is now down to one. The government introduced tougher rules aimed at benefit claimants last October including raising the minimum sanction for violations from one to four weeks. More than 20 charities, including the Trussell Trust have written to the government accusing them of violating people's basic right to food. However, the Department of Work and Pensions said it was the growth in the number of food banks which has increased demand rather than new benefit regulations. A letter signed by 600 church leaders including 36 Anglican bishops earlier this year called on the Government to deal with what it described as a ‘national crisis’ of poverty and people living below the bread line. But their concerns contradict findings by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which show food poverty in Britain has reduced dramatically. Only 8.1 per cent reported struggling to afford food in 2012 – down from 9.8 per cent in 2007, before the economic crisis. 'More work is required to quantify the impact which the current economic climate and benefit changes are having on crime levels. 'In . the meantime, work is taking place to identify the location and . operating hours of food banks and other support services. This . information will then be made available in local communities and handed . to those arrested for shoplifting.' Mr Roddick added that stores would be encouraged to issue civil banning orders for offenders as part of a crack down on shoplifting. Earlier this year Northumbria's PCC Vera Baird blamed welfare cuts for a rise in shoplifting by women., saying there was growing evidence that women were being driven to steal nappies and food because they were getting fewer benefits. Referring to crime figures in the North-East, the . senior barrister declared: ‘At the end of last year, it was apparent . that people were starting to steal items they could once afford. 'There’s . been growing evidence to suggest this is due to the impact of both . poverty and welfare reform, with people stealing what they were once . able to take for granted and just go out and buy. ‘The growth in . the number of first-time women shoplifting offenders would suggest it’s . affecting the poorer women in our communities, those who are . experiencing the impact of the welfare reforms.’ Adrian Curtis, the foodbank network for the Trussell Trust - a charity which co-ordinates the only nationwide network of food banks in the country - said police had referred people to its food banks, but not necessarily for shoplifting. 'For many years our food banks have partnered with a wide variety of local organisations, whether that's charities or the police,' he told MailOnline. 'From time to time they will see people in genuine crisis who have no option but to go to food banks, they could be the victims of crime, and we trust the judgement of people who refer them to us. 'They may be stealing for different reasons, and with regards to what the PCC was saying, he's talking I would presume about basic items such as bread and milk rather than high end electricals. 'We would trust the police's judgement to sign post people to charities who are best place to support people in a variety of crises.' He added: 'I have launched a food bank in South Wales, we partner with the local police team and from time to time we get referrals but very very few have been down to shoplifting. 'Over the years we have fed more than 10,000 people and less than a handful have come to us with shoplifting issues. 'We have seen an elderly person come to us after committing shoplifting, who was incredibly embarrassed and it was the first time they had committed and offence. They were embarrassed to ask for help.' Volunteer: Felicia Boshorin, the Project Manager at the Southwark Food bank prepares shopping bags of food for those in need . Figures from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, released in April, showed that crime in England and Wales fell by 15 per cent last year compared with 2012. The survey, which tracks all crimes committed by interviewing victims, and as a result includes offences not reported to the police, showed there were 7.5million offences in 2013, down from almost 9million in 2012. There was a 22 per cent fall in household theft, a 15 per cent fall in vandalism and a 4 per cent drop in burglary. However, fraud rose by 25 per cent and shoplifting was up 6 per cent. The Home Office has not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.","New figures to show increase in shoplifting by 37 of Britain's 43 police forces .

"Stephen Sutton, the teenager whose positive approach to life saw him lead one of the biggest ever fundraising campaigns for research into cancer, has been awarded a posthumous MBE by the Queen. His mother accepted the honour at Buckingham Palace on behalf of the teenager, who died in May this year after a four year battle with cancer during which he inspired people around the world with his determination to make a difference. Jane Sutton revealed her 19-year-old son described the award as 'awesome,' after he learned he would be named in the Queen's Birthday Honours list just days before his death. The inspirational teenager from Burntwood in Staffordshire was diagnosed with colorectal cancer at the age of 15. But rather than let the disease beat him he decided to turn his diagnosis and treatment into something positive, eventually raising more than £5million for research into cancer. Jane Sutton received an MBE, awarded to her son Stephen posthumously, on behalf of the teenager today . Stephen Sutton, who inspired millions of people to donate to Teenage Cancer Trust, was recognised with a posthumous MBE, collected by his mother from the Queen today. He died at 19, after a 4 year battle with cancer . Today Mrs Sutton collected the posthumous MBE on her son's behalf at Buckingham Palace - an occasion she described as 'bitter sweet' because she wished he had been there to collect it himself. She revealed that her teenage son was told days before his death that he was on the Queen's Birthday Honours list. She described today as 'a very proud moment but a bitter sweet occasion.' 'I'm feeling so proud to be collecting the award on behalf of Stephen but obviously wish he had been here to collect it himself,' she added. 'But it's just so nice that he knew about this award before he passed away, I'm so pleased about that. 'When he found out about it he did use the word ""awesome"", he thought it was awesome. I remember he was in the hospital bed and he had a big smile on his face. 'He knew how important this was and how high an honour this was.' Mrs Sutton, who was accompanied by her parents and Stephen's younger brother, Christopher, said the Queen was 'very impressed' with the amount of money Stephen had raised and told her she must be very proud. She added: 'He's touched the hearts of so many people and inspired so many people. Jane Sutton (centre left) accepted the MBE on her son's behalf and was at Buckingham Palace today with Stephen's grandfather Tony Reeves (left), his brother Chris (centre right) and grandmother Ann Reeves (right) Mrs Sutton accepted the MBE on the teenager's behalf but said she wished her son had been there himself . Mrs Sutton said the Queen said she had been impressed by the amount Stephen had raised for charity . Stephen found out he was on the Queen's Birthday Honours list before he died and said the it was 'awesome' 'His fundraising is just part of his legacy. I don't think that's the only important thing because he also taught people to make the most of their lives and seize every opportunity. 'It's incredible. I know how many people Stephen touched, but he was just being Stephen.' Stephen was told his cancer was terminal in 2012, but refused to let his illness change his life and completed his GCSEs and AS Levels. He documented his treatment and struggle with cancer in a blog called Stephen's Story which was shared around the world and promoted by celebrities. He also drew up a list of 46 weird and wonderful things he wanted to do - including doing a skydive and playing the drums in front of an audience of 90,000 at Wembley. Among this list was to raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trust - a pledge that inspired the biggest ever fundraiser the charity has ever seen. Stephen originally set out to raise a modest £10,000 for the charity but increased his goal to £1million after he posted his 'final thumbs up' selfie on Facebook in April. His story and the image captured the interest of celebrities and the public, and was shared around the world and people started donating in droves. Before he died on May 14 at the age of 19, the teenager has raised more than £3million and donations continued to be made after his death, tipping £5million. Stephen created a 'bucket list' of 46 things he wanted to do before he died, including to complete a skydive . The teenager also listed 'hug an animal that is bigger than me' among his weird and wonderful things to do . Stephen wanted to crowd surf at a gig, and is pictured at Slam Dunk Festival at Wolverhampton Civic Hall . The money raised for the Teenage Cancer Trusts will go towards funding new teenage cancer units at seven NHS hospitals as well as creating Stephen Sutton scholarships for Coventry University's Postgraduate Certificate in Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Care. The scholarships have been set up in recognition of Stephen's ambition to pursue a medical career. He will also now be recognised posthumously with an honorary degree from Coventry University. David Cameron and comedian Jason Manford were among the supporters of his fundraising campaign. Stephen's positive approach to his diagnosis has led him to be awarded a posthumous MBE by the Queen today . Stephen's campaign generated a lot of interest and he was visited by the Prime Minister, David Cameron . Stephen was known for his fun approach to life and his determination to helping others. Before he died he said: 'I don't see the point in measuring life in terms of time any more.'I'd rather measure life in terms of making a difference.' More than 7,000 people attended at two day vigil at Lichfield Cathedral in Staffordshire to remember the teenager. Dozens donned yellow ribbons and gave a 'thumbs up' to his coffin that became synonymous with the teenager's campaign. Coventry University said the honorary degree will be accepted by Stephen's mother, Jane Sutton, in a ceremony at Coventry Cathedral on November 18. In the same week, the university will award honorary doctorates to a number of other individuals, including film director Ken Loach, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and former Sainsbury's chief Justin King. Stephen's ambition to drum in front of a large crowd was achieved when he played before 90,000 at Wembley . Stephen listed meeting both Frank Lampard (left) and Jimmy Carr (right)as  things to do before he died . Dozens of people attended a two day vigil in memory of the teenager and did a thumbs up, including his brother Chris (centre) who was at the memorial with his mother Jane Sutton (left), held at Lichfield Cathedral . Stephen is pictured with his consultant Prof Gary Middleton (left), his mother Jane Sutton (second left) and David Cameron (right) after the Prime Minister visited him at Birmingham Queen Elizabeth Hospital . The university's vice-chancellor, John Latham, said: 'Our honorary graduates have all excelled in or contributed to their respective fields in a way that deserves the utmost respect and admiration, so it is a pleasure to be commending them alongside our own graduands during the graduation ceremonies next week. 'I hope our students will be inspired by the passion and perseverance of these individuals as they embark on their own careers. 'Stephen's commendation is particularly fitting, not only in light of his wish to pursue a medical career, but also coming soon after the Teenage Cancer Trust announced it would be using part of the money he raised to fund scholarships for professionals to train at Coventry University. We're delighted to be supporting Stephen's legacy in this way.'","Jane Sutton accepted Stephen Sutton's posthumous MBE from Queen today .

"A homeless veteran who jumped a White House fence before storming the executive mansion had more than 800 rounds of ammunition, a machete and two hatchets in his car, prosecutors have said. Omar J. Gonzalez, 42, appeared in federal court on Monday to face charges of unlawfully entering restricted grounds while carrying a weapon. He could get 10 years in prison if convicted. As he appeared in court, Virginia authorities also revealed he had been arrested last July and charged with possession of a sawed-off shot gun and eluding police, ABC News reported. At the proceedings on Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney David Mudd said Gonzalez, who has been homeless for three months following a decade in the army, was a danger to the president. Scroll down for video . 'Threat': Omar Gonzalez, pictured left in his camo and right in his mug shot, had ammo, a machete and two hatchets in his car when he jumped over a White House fence and entered the executive mansion . But relatives have insisted that Gonzalez, from Copperas Cove, Texas, suffers from post traumatic stress disorder after serving three tours in Iraq. He retired after losing part of his foot in an IED blast. Jerry Murphy, whose mother was married to Gonzalez, said relatives always knew Gonzalez owned a small arsenal of weapons but said they doubted he intended to hurt Obama. 'I know he's got heavy artillery, you know? He's got all kinds of weapons and he was trained to use them,' Murphy said. 'I believe if he wanted to make a scene or cause problems, he very well could have. But it's clear that he didn't.' Gonzalez was arrested Friday inside the Presidential residence with a knife in his pants after making it over the fence and running across the lawn, the Secret Service said. According to agents who arrested him, Gonzalez said that he was desperate to see the President to warn him about 'the atmosphere collapsing'. President Obama and his daughters had left for Camp David via helicopter just minutes before Gonzalez allegedly rushed the northern entrance. Running for it: The intruder can be seen running across the lawn and towards the White House on Friday . According to a criminal complaint obtained by ABC News, authorities found 'several assault rifles' in a vehicle when he was arrested after speeding and eluding state police in Virginia in July. After nearly crashing, Gonzalez was eventually pulled over. Virginia State Police told ABC that he had a map of D.C. with a circle drawn around the White House when he was arrested. They also allegedly found 11 different weapons in his car. Then on August 25, he was stopped while walking along the fence of the White House. In that incident, authorities found he had a hatchet in his waist band, according to ABC. He allowed cops to search his car, but they found no further weapons or ammo and he was not arrested. The Army said Gonzalez enlisted in July 1997 and was assigned to the 10th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, at Fort Hood, Texas. At the time, he listed his home as Puerto Rico. Heightened security: Uniformed Secret Service officers walk along the fence on the North side of the White House in Washington after the intruder scaled the fence, jumped over and ran towards the mansion . He was discharged in September 2003 after completing his service obligation. Gonzalez enlisted a second time, in July 2005, and served until his retirement in late 2012. Gonzalez served in Iraq from October 2006 to January 2008. Samantha Bell, Gonzalez's ex-wife, said that after his second tour in Iraq, Gonzalez began carrying a .45 on his hip at all times. He would also kept three or four rifles and shotguns behind the doors in their home, said Bell, who remarried and now lives in southern Indiana. She claims she split up with him in 2010 because of his worsening mental condition . Bell described how Gonzalez kept the blinds drawn and would repeatedly go downstairs during the night to make sure the doors were locked and the oven was off. She said she once woke up in the middle of the night to find Gonzalez standing at the foot of the bed and staring at her. She said he told her he was simply watching her sleep. 'It was really odd and I didn't know how to take that,' she said. 'I just couldn't deal with it. I didn't want to deal with it, I couldn't — that's the whole reason I left. He was so paranoid he was starting to make me paranoid. 'Omar is a good guy, he's just got some issues that he needs help with. I think this is a cry out for help, what he's done. He really does need help. I just hope he can get it.' Second arrest: Kevin Carr, 19, was taken in by officers on Saturday after allegedly driving a car up to a screening point outside the White House and then refusing to leave when he was asked . In the wake of his attempt on the White House, the Secret Service announced new, tougher security. The agency was criticized for not apprehending Gonzalez sooner, and admitted their performance was 'not acceptable,' leading to new measures being put in place. In a statement, Secret Service officials said: 'The challenge of securing the White House complex from security threats is ever present. 'Although last night the officers showed tremendous restraint and discipline in dealing with this subject, the location of Gonzalez's arrest is not acceptable. 'In addition to the criminal investigation of Gonzalez by the Secret Service's Washington Field Office, Director Julia Pierson immediately ordered the Secret Service's Office of Professional Responsibility to conduct a comprehensive after action review of the incident.' The statement continued: 'In the interim, Director Pierson has ordered the immediate enhancement of officer patrols and surveillance capabilities along the Pennsylvania Avenue fence line around the White House complex. These measures went into effect last night.' In court: Gonzalez appeared at a federal court proceeding at this courthouse in Washington D.C. on Monday . President Obama has backed the agency. A White House spokesman said: 'The president has full confidence in the Secret Service and is grateful to the men and women who day in and day out protect himself, his family and the White House.' However, press secretary Josh Earnest stressed that providing security to The White House was a 'complicated business' because of the number of tourists that visit on a daily basis. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson also encouraged the public 'not second-guess the judgment of security officers who had only seconds to act.' He insisted in a statement issued today that the public should wait 'until all the facts are in' before passing judgement on the security services. Barriers:  The Secret Service announced that 'officer patrols and surveillance capabilities' would be enhanced in the wake of the two attempts by intruders to reach the White House . Increased security: The measures came into affect along the Pennsylvania Avenue fence line around the White House complex last night . The two-block stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House's north gates has been closed to vehicle traffic since May 1995. President Bill Clinton ordered its immediate closure in an effort to prevent a potential car- or truck-bomb attack. Even so, there have been a number of recent breaches that have caused the Secret Service and Capitol Police to step. Last September a man was arrested and accused of throwing firecrackers over the fence on the north lawn. A few weeks later a Connecticut woman sparked a police chase through downtown Washington after ramming a security checkpoint. Miriam Carey, 34, was shot and killed after the bizarre incident. Another man was apprehended on September 11 before the anniversary commemorations after he jumped the White House fence . He was charged last week in local court for unlawful entry, according to the Secret Service and is set to appear in court in October.

"The bodies of an elderly woman, her son and his friend have been found in what appears to be a double-murder suicide - but police are struggling to find a motive for the killings. Gloria Bono, 72, and her son Michael Bono, 45, were found dead with multiple gunshot wounds at a property in the luxury Yacht and Country Club in Stuart, Florida, yesterday. The body of Robert Gulick - who is believed to be Michael's friend - was discovered  at a Best Western hotel room on Sunday, with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Gloria Bono (left), 72, and her son Michael Bono (left), 45, were found dead with multiple gunshot wounds . Investigators believe Gulick killed the Bonos before turning a gun on himself, WPTV reported. Martin County Sheriff Will Snyder told the news channel that police found Gloria Bono's car parked at the Best Western, after receiving a phone call from her daughter. The woman said she had not heard from her mother or brother for several hours and she was concerned for their safety. Robert Gulick was found at a Best Western with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound . 'With a little more investigation they found out that the person who had driven that car was at a room at the Best Western,' Snyder said. 'Stuart police made entry to the room and found Mr Gulnick deceased.' 'It appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, he added. 'So we began helping them in a search that ultimately led us to here the Stuart Yacht and Country Club, where we found Mrs Bono and her son deceased apparently shot multiple times.' Neither of the victims lived in the home, but it is thought that Gulnick occasionally did maintenance work for the property so may have had access to the luxury gated community. Investigators believe that the Bonos may have been at the residence after arranging to meet Gulnick there. The owner of the property lives out of state and told police that no one should have been in the home at the time of the killings, The Palm Beach Post reported. Police believe that Gulnick and Michael Bono were friends, but they have not yet identified a motive for the killings. Snyder said he believed more would be known after an autopsy later today. He added: 'They were apparently together last night and why the Bonos were shot and killed here is something we are still working on. 'So it's really not possible for us right now to determine a motive. And why they were shot we don't know.'

"Vanessa Mae has been given a four-year ban by the International Ski Federation for taking part in races which were fixed to help her qualify for the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. The governing body said its hearing panel found 'to its comfortable satisfaction' that the results of a series of races in Slovenia in January were manipulated in order for Mae to achieve the qualifying points required to compete at the Games. Representing Thailand and competing under the name Vanessa Vanakorn, the classical violinist took part in the women's giant-slalom in Sochi and finished last out of the 67 competitors. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Vanessa Mae on the slopes preparing for Sochi . It has been ruled that race results in Slovenia were fixed to ensure Mae qualified for Sochi . Vanessa Mae skis at the Sochi Winter Olympics on her way to finishing last out of 67 competitors . Mae - who resides in the United Kingdom - is best known for being a classical violinst . An FIS statement read: 'After considering written submissions and testimony at a hearing on 3rd October 2014, the Hearing Panel found to its comfortable satisfaction that the results of the four ladies giant slalom races that took place on 18th and 19th January 18 2014 at Krvavec (SLO) were manipulated, resulting in the calculation of FIS Points that do not reflect the true performance of the competitors that participated in those events and in particular the points awarded to Vanessa Vanakorn (Mae).' FIS found the races in Slovenia were organised at the request of Mae's management company and the Thailand Olympic Committee in order to enable her to meet the qualifying criteria. In July, the Slovenian Ski Association suspended four of its officials and announced an investigation into alleged improprieties regarding the results of the races concerned. Mae performs on stage at the Royal Albert Hall at the fifth annual Classical Brit Awards in 2004 . FIS upheld the Slovenians' findings, revealing that the results lists of two giant-slalom races which took place on January 19 included the name of a competitor who was not present. Another competitor was placed second in one race despite falling, and her finishing time is understood to have been adjusted by over 10 seconds. Among a number of other discrepancies, FIS found that the weather conditions were so bad that the races concerned would in usual circumstances have been cancelled. Ranking points accrued by all competitors in the respective races have been annulled. FIS confirmed that without the points in question, Mae would not have been eligible to compete in Sochi.

"They fell in love in Sydney, had two daughters and when things turned sour their babies went back to family in China. Last weekend, the couple who called each other 'Carlos and Carrie' were on their way to join them. The photos and playful messages posted on social media by Gu Naijun and Li Yuan before they boarded Flight MH 370 to be reunited with their small daughters are heartwarming. Fleeing a dream gone wrong in Australia, where Ms Gu and Mr Li had to sell up after their business went into liquidation, the couple teased each other with adoring remarks and photos of their little 'princesses'. Scroll down for video . Missing: Sydney mother Gu Naijun used her microblogging site to post photos of her self and her two young daughters to husband Li Yuan when he was away on business in China, with teasing messages, but when their dream life in Australia went wrong their two little girls went back to China and were with relatives waiting for their parents to join them when Flight MH 370 vanished . The couple posted what is likely to to be their last conversation in words and pictures about their children on Ms Gu's microblogging account on Weibo, one of China's most popular social media sites, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. Ms Gu can been seen posing with her little girls, a baby and a toddler, in a series of happy family shots, going to lunch, at the swimming pool, dressing up in frilly clothes. Ms Gu, 31, appeared to be using the microblog to share her daughters' day with husband, Li Yuan, 32, who travelled to China for his job as a partner in startup software firm, Beijing Landysoft Technology. 'Dad, I'm playing on the slide now,' reads the caption on a photograph taken at a playground. 'You'll be rolling all over the floor,' was the reply. Relatives of Gu Naijun and Li Yuan were reportedly minding their grandaughters in China, and like the families of all 239 passangers on the missing flight are now waiting anxiously for news. Mr Li was born in Beijing and Ms Gu in Shanghai. Carlos and Carrie, the anglicised names chosen by the couple, met as university students in Sydney, fell in love and married. Little princesses: The Chinese born Sydney couple who called themselves 'Carlos and Carrie' posted adoring words and photos (above) on social media site Weibo of their two little girls they were returning to China to see after their Asutarlia dream went wrong and they were forced to sell up . The couple bought a home in the southern Sydney suburb of Sylvania, and the Metro petrol station at nearby Miranda in 2007. Ms Gu remained in touch with friends and family back in China. She gave birth to two daughters, and the couple worked hard. But their financial situation appeared to turn bad following a terrible accident at the petrol station, in which a 24-year-old electrician, Peter Wahhab, was electrocuted after he fell from a ladder while installing an air conditioner. The business was placed into liquidation by administrators, and the bank repossessed their home, forcing the couple to move into a smaller, rented apartment. Meanwhile, Mr Li had branched out with the software business back in a new industrial park in China. At some point, their daughters went to stay with their Chinese relatives. It is not clear whether the husband and wife were returning to live in China or visiting when they made their fateful trip. The relatives of the 153 Chinese passengers on the flight have gathered at Beijing's Lido Hotel to wait out the investigation into the missing plane in rooms set up by authorities with television screens and regular news reports. Forced to sell up in Sydney, Gu Naijin (pictured with her daughter) and Li Yuan boarded doomed flight MH 370 to fly back to China where their two little girls were waiting to be reunited with the couple, who fell in love as university students in Sydney .","Sydney couple on MH370 posted loving messages to daughters in China .

"A grainy sonar image captured off an uninhabited Pacific island could show the remains of Amelia Earhart’s doomed plane which disappeared in 1937. The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) say the latest evidence could be a step closer to finding out the mystery behind her disappearance. Earhart, then 39, was on the final stage of an . an ambitious around-the-world flight along the equator in a twin-engine . Lockheed Electra when she and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared. The image was captured off an uninhabited tropical island in the southwestern Pacific republic of Kiribati and showed an 'anomaly' at a depth of 600 feet in the waters. Discovery: A grainy sonar image captured off an uninhabited Pacific island could show the remains of Amelia Earhart's doomed plane which disappeared in 1937 . Aim: The purpose of the expedition was to test the hypothesis that the Earhart aircraft, after landing on the reef at Gardner Island (now Nikumaroro), was subsequently washed over the reef edge, broke up in the surf, and sank . Location: The anomaly is in the catchment area at the base of the second cliff . 'What initially got our attention is that there is no other sonar return like it in the entire body of data collected,' Ric Gillespie, executive director of TIGHAR, told Discovery News. 'It is truly an anomaly, and when you're looking for man-made objects against a natural background, anomalies are good,' he added. TIGHAR  have spent years investigating Earhart's . last, fateful flight and now according to their researchers, a sonar image shows a strong return from a narrow object roughly 22 feet long oriented southwest/northeast on the slope near the base of an underwater cliff. This ties in with a theory that Earhart . was able to put her aircraft down safely on the reef, but it was washed . off the edge before aircraft searching for her were able to spot it. Analysis: A graphic shows the area looked at by TIGHAR team . Area: A map showing an aerial view of the distance between the debris field and the Bevington Object- seen in a  1937 photo taken by British Colonial Service Officer Eric Bevington . High tech: Tools utilised by TIGHAR included a multi-beam sonar hull-mounted onto an expedition vessel . Nikumaroro, uninhabited in Earhart's . time, and a mere 3.7 miles long by 1.2 miles wide, is about 300 miles . southeast of Howland Island. The holder of several aeronautical records, including the first woman to cross the Atlantic by air, Earhart had set off from New Guinea to refuel at Howland Island for a final long-distance hop to California. In what turned out to be her final radio message, she declared she was unable to find Howland and that fuel was running low. Several search-and-rescue missions . ordered the next day by then-president Franklin Roosevelt turned up no . trace of Earhart or Noonan, who were eventually presumed dead at sea. Enduring riddle: American aviator Amelia Earhart, posing by her plane in Long Beach, California, in 1930, disappeared while flying over the Pacific in 1937 . Fate: The Electra taking off from Oakland Airport at Alameda, California, on the first leg of her proposed world spanning flight . Nikumaroro Island: Researchers will scour the island for clues and crash debris . TIGHAR are operating under the hypothesis . that the duo survived the crash, reached Gardner Island - which was . then a British possession and now known as Nikumaroro - and managed to . survive there for an unknown period of time. TIGHAR believe that some key components of Earharts aircraft- . such as the heavy Pratt & Whitney engines may still be left. Last year they returned to the island again equipped with a multi-beam sonar array mounted on a ship to construct a map of the underwater topography off the western end of the atoll. They also used a Autonomous Underwater Vehicle to collect data along the west end of Nikumaroro, as well as a Remote Operated Vehicle capable of reaching depths of 3,000 feet, which produced hours upon hours of high-definition video. Missing: Earhart and Fred Noonan, left, before they set off on their doomed flight. Right: Earhart as a young pilot . Celebrated: Earhart posing in Southampton after completing a successful flight across the Atlantic Ocean . But their recent expedition faced a number of technical problems coupled by the atoll’s difficult environment. When the search failed to turn up dramatic and conclusive evidence proving that Earhart perished on the island, some media outlets were quick to declare the $2.2million mission a failure. But on reflection the team realised they had found an 'anomaly' in the vast data they had collected. Discussing the discovery on their website this week, they wrote: 'The better a piece of evidence looks, the harder you have to try to disqualify it. So far, the harder we’ve looked at this anomaly, the better it looks. Maybe the anomaly is a coral feature that just happens to give a sonar return unlike any other coral feature on the entire reef slope. Discovery: This bottle of St Joseph's lineament was found on a desert island in the area Amelia Earhart is believed to have crashed on an ill-fated voyage around the world in 1937 . Clue: This hunk of glass is from a bottle of Campania's Italian balm made in 1933 . Amelia's freckles: Reassembled jar fragments (left) found alongside other artifacts on an island have been found to resemble a freckle ointment (right) possibly used by Earhart . Cosmetic: One of the substances found on the island was identified as rouge from the early 20th century . 'Maybe it’s a sunken fishing boat that isn’t mentioned in any of the historical literature. Maybe it’s the boat nobody knows about that that brought the castaway nobody missed who died at the Seven Site. Maybe it’s pure coincidence that it‘s the right size and shape to be the Electra wreckage.' Sustaining the search are clues worthy of detective story, including items from the 1930s previously discovered on the island such as a jar of face cream, a penknife blade, the heel of a woman's shoe and a bit of Plexiglas - all believed to belong to Earhart and her plane. Skeletons of birds apparently cooked over a campfire have also contributed to the mystery, and settlers who reached Nikumaroro after 1937 have spoken of the existence of aircraft wreckage. Conspiracy theories about Earhart's final moments have flourished for years. One contended that Earhart was held by Japanese imperial forces as a spy. Another claimed she completed her flight, but changed her identity and settled in New Jersey. Earhart's story - as well as her mysterious demise - have captivated America for decades. She has been portrayed on the big screen by A-List actresses like Diane Keaton, Amy Adams and Hillary Swank. Intrigue: In her day, Earhart was extremely popular, but her mysterious death has kept that fame alive 75 years later . The most widely accepted theory is that the aircraft ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea. There have been several searches by many different professionals eager to solve the mystery, but none have been proven. Another popular theory is that they landed on the island of Nikumaroro in the Pheonix Islands, 350 miles southeast of Howland Island and fended for themselves for several months until they succumbed to injury or disease. Improvised tools and bits of Plexiglas that are consistent with that of an Electra window were found on the island. A few theorists reckon that she Earhart was spying on Japan and had been captured and executed. This theory has been discounted by the American authorities and press. A rumour claimed that she was one of many women sending messages on Tokyo Rose, an English-language Japanese propaganda station designed to attack the Allies' morale. An Australian aircraft engineer said he found a map that showed Earhart and Noonan may have turned round to try and refuel but crashed before getting to an airstrip. The most whacky theory is that she was still alive and had a different identity. A woman from New Jersey successfully sued for $1.5m in damages from the author of a book who pursued this theory.","Famous aviator disappeared as she attempted an around the world flight .

"Chinese officials have sealed off large parts of a city after a resident who was bitten by a rodent died of bubonic plague. The 38-year-old victim from the city of Yumen in Gansu province was infected by a marmot, a wild rodent, last week. Reports suggested the marmot was already dead but he chopped it up and fed it to his dog and began suffering from a fever later that day. Around 30,000 residents have now been told they cannot leave  and police at roadblocks on the perimeter of the city are telling motorists to find alternative routes. Quarantine zones: Police have set up roadblocks around the city of Yumen after a resident was infected with bubonic plague. Around 30,000 residents have been quarantined by an epidemic prevention team (right) Empty: Officers on the perimeter of the city are telling motorists to find alternative routes, leaving the roads deserted . It said 151 people who came into direct contact with the victim have also been placed in quarantine and are being analysed by epidemic prevention teams deployed around the city. Reports by China Central television say that those in quarantine are in a stable condition and there have been no further cases. The city is said to have enough rice, flour and oil to supply all its residents for up to one month after setting aside 1 million yuan ($161,200) for emergency vaccinations. The plague is a bacterial disease spread by the fleas of wild rodents such as marmots. While the disease can be effectively treated, patients can die 24 hours after the initial infection, the World Health Organisation says. Outbreaks in China have been rare in recent years, and most have happened in remote rural areas of the west. China's state broadcaster said there were 12 diagnosed cases and three deaths in the province of Qinghai in 2009, and one in Sichuan in 2012. Beijing's disease control centre sought to dispel worries about a wider outbreak of the disease in China, saying on its website  that the risk of the disease spreading to the capital was minimal . Prepared: Hundreds of extra emergency service personnel are on standby to try and prevent the outbreak from spreading . Precautions: Epidemic prevention team trucks have been deployed around the city to prevent an outbreak. The victim was bitten by a wild marmot (file picture right) Black death: A town crier says 'bring out your dead' Bubonic plague is one of the most devastating diseases in history, having killed around 100million people during the 'Black Death' in the 14th century. Drawings and paintings from the outbreak, which wiped out about a third of the European population, depict town criers saying 'bring out your dead' while dragging trailers piled with infected corpses. It is caused by a bacterium known as Yersinia pestis, which uses the flea as a host and is usually transmitted to humans via rats. The disease causes grotesque symptoms such as gangrene and the appearance of large swellings on the groin, armpits or neck, known as 'buboes'. It kills up to two thirds of sufferers within just four days if it is not treated, although if antibiotics are administered within 24 hours of infection patients are highly likely to survive. After the Black Death arrived in 1347 plague became a common phenomenon in Europe, with outbreaks recurring regularly until the 18th century. Bubonic plague has almost completely vanished from the rich world, with 90 per cent of all cases now found in Africa. However, there have been a few non-fatal cases in the U.S. in recent years, while in August 2013 a 15-year-old boy died in Kyrgyzstan after eating a groundhog infected with the disease. Three months later, an outbreak  in a Madagascan killed at least 20 people in a week. A year before 60 people died as a result of the infection, more than in any other country in the world. Outbreaks in China have been rare in recent years, and most have happened in remote rural areas of the west. China's state broadcaster said there were 12 diagnosed cases and three deaths in the province of Qinghai in 2009, and one in Sichuan in 2012. In the United States between five and 15 people die every year as a result, mostly in western states.","Around 30,000 people from Yumen have been sent to quarantine zones .

"He is more used to building exclusive, minimalist buildings. However, New York architect Ben Pell has turned his hand to a very different kind of structure - a pillow fort. Following exhaustive testing with his two children, he has revealed the best way to construct a living room hideaway. New York architect Ben Pell found there were three different types of fort - tunnel forts, buttress forts and compound forts. Architect Ben Pell identified three types of fort - tunnel, buttress and compound. Tunnel forts are usually too small for adults to get into . Buttress or compound forts are not limited by the furniture - but involve moving things around (and even using the family dog) Writing on the blog Fatherly, he explained there are three different types of fort - tunnel forts, buttress forts and compound forts. He also believes that many children manage to trap themselves inside forts. “Kids, left to their own devices, pile up pillows and then figure out how to get inside. 'Or, they’ll build it around themselves and then they can’t leave without destroying it.' Pell, who in his day job work for Pell Overton, urged children to think like an architect. He warned prospective builders should first sort the available pillows based on which ones are best for walls and which ones are a good for laying on inside the finished fort. Over the past twenty years, he has worked on a variety of projects, and also taught on the design faculty of the Syracuse University School of Architecture and the Pratt Institute, and has been a regular member of the Yale School of Architecture faculty since 2005. However, for this project, he believes that using the available space is key. 'Tunnel forts are usually too small to get into, so that’s what my kids build if they want their own little fort. Tunnel forts are usually too small for adults to get into - something children seem to prefer . 'With a buttress or compound fort, you’re not limited by the furniture, but you might have to move things around a little bit to create space.' He also advised people to take advantage of any unusual materials that happen to be nearby - such as the family dog. “He’s a lazy old lab, so sometimes we just tuck the sheets under him while he’s sleeping. 'They make good weights.'

"When Geraldine Rowing was told by doctors she needed a liver transplant she feared she would face a long wait for a donor organ. At an appointment with her doctor she mentioned in passing that she was a non-identical twin. It was a long shot, but he suggested her sister, Annemarie Atha, be tested to see if she was a match. The results shocked the sisters - despite not looking the same and their mother telling them they were non-identical - the pair were in fact genetically identical. They have now become the first identical twins to undergo a live liver transplant in the UK. When Geraldine Rowing, left, was put on the transplant list she feared she would have to wait for a donor organ. But her non-identical twin Annemarie Atha, right, was prepared to be tested to see if she was a match . The results revealed the sisters, who had always believed they were non-identical because they don't look the same, were in fact, genetically identical. Annemarie, left, donated part of her liver to her sister in the first live liver transplant between identical twins, carried out in the UK . Ms Atha, 48, said she did not think twice about donating part of her liver to her twin, when she became ill. She said it was an added bonus to discover, despite everything they had been told, that they were genetically identical. It meant Ms Rowing does not need to take a cocktail of drugs to stop her body rejecting the new organ. 'I would just like to say thank you very much Annemarie,' Ms Rowing said as she hugged her sister at St James's Hospital, in Leeds, where the operation took place. 'Thank you from the bottom of my heart.' Ms Rowing's liver had been damaged by cancer a few years ago, prompting doctors to recommend she was added to the transplant list. She told her doctor she was a non-identical twin and he suggested doing tests. The results revealed the sisters, who live in Rothwell, near Leeds, were genetically identical despite not looking exactly the same. 'Mum always said that because there were two placentas when we were born, we weren't identical,' said Ms Atha. 'So we've grown up believing we're not identical because Geraldine's got a wider smile than me and she's got a squarer face than me. Geraldine, second left, and Annemarie, second right, are pictured with consultant liver surgeons Raj Prasad, left and Ernest Hidalgo, who performed the operation at Leeds' St James University Hospital . 'We've both got the silly same nose and I'm a teeny, teeny bit taller than Geraldine. So mum always said ""you're not identical"". 'But they said you're identical enough to do the transplant.' The sisters went through the operation in April and Ms Rowing said she is feeling much better. 'I'm feeling better by the day,' she said. 'It was a while ago and I still get tired but I can't thank everybody enough. 'I walk round and nobody knows that I've had a liver transplant.' Ms Atha said: 'It's nice to have Geraldine back to normal again.' Consultant liver surgeon Raj Prasad, who did the operation, said live liver transplants - where the donor is a living person who donates a section of their organ for the operation - are getting more common. He said St James's did their first one in 2007 and will do around 20 this year - around one in seven of all liver transplants. Mr Prasad said the main problem was putting the donor - an otherwise healthy person - through a major and potentially life-threatening operation. But he said it meant the ill person did not have to wait for an organ to become available from a dead donor. He added the benefits of identical twins having the operation was massive. He said it was even more so in the case of Ms Rowing as taking immuno-suppressant drugs would increase her risk of further cancer. Mr Prasad said: 'It's an absolutely massive advantage which is God or nature's gift. It's a dream.' Genetics expert, Dr Anand Saggar, a senior consultant in clinical genetics at St George's in London said Ms Rowing and Ms Atha's case is 'surprising but not unheard of'. He said non-identical twins are formed from two eggs, which are fertilised by two different sperm. 'Effectively they are siblings that just happen to be born in one womb at the same time,' Dr Saggar told MailOnline. 'They are two completely different siblings born separately.' In the case of identical twins, one egg is fertilised by one sperm, creating an embryo that splits in two in the womb. The fact Annemarie and Geraldine were found to be genetically identical meant Geraldine didn't have to take anti-rejection drugs as her body accepted the new organ as if it was her own . Dr Saggar said the twins' mother's justification that they had two placentas does not mean they were non-identical. If the embryo divides early on in the pregnancy, each baby will be grow within its own placenta. The later the split happens, the more likely it is identical twins will grow in one, single placenta. 'The fact they had two placentas means the split happened early on. The later the embryo divides the less likely it is there will be two placentas,' Dr Saggar said. Once an embryo has split to create twins, there are a number of factors that will determine how each baby will look later in life. Dr Saggar told MailOnline: 'People naively perhaps, believe identical twins should be absolutely identical because they have the same genes. 'But that assumes that every element that controls us is dictated by a coding sequence. 'You have to view the coding sequence and the human body as  a complicated orchestra of genes. 'The way a piece of music is played can alter the sound you get. 'Let's take a piece by Mozart, two different orchestras will play the same piece differently. 'There are different things that influence the expression of the same genes. Genetics expert, Dr Anand Saggar, a senior consultant in clinical genetics at St George's in London said Ms Rowing and Ms Atha's case is 'surprising but not unheard of'. He said many aspects will affect how identical twins look, and once an embryo has divided it is possible different gene mutations affect differing siblings . 'Epigenetics is the big thing everyone is talking about at the moment. The coating, layering or shielding on genes which can express now or later. 'And then there are spontaneous mutations that occur. 'Of course where a single embryo splits in two a spontaneous mutation could occur in just one half of the divide. 'If the mutation happens before the embryo splits, it will depend on which half the mutation ends up as to which baby will be affected by it. 'Yes, of course we should expect twins to have similar hair colour and facial features. 'But there are also other issues that can affect visual appearance. 'Nutrition influences growth, the risk of cardiovascular disease, so why not how big a person's nose is. 'Different placentas will mean different levels of nutrition. 'There is also sometimes a situation known as blood stealing from one placenta to another which can alter things including growth rates. 'Yes, this is a surprising case but it is not unheard of.'","Geraldine Rowing was placed on the transplant list after cancer damaged her liver a few years ago .

"New storm: Katie Hopkins was a called a racist after a series of controversial tweets were sent from her Twitter account . A number of anti-Muslim rants were sent from Katie Hopkins' Twitter account last night including one that called Palestinians 'filthy rodents'. The former Apprentice contestant, 39, also demanded that Israel 'restart the bombing campaign' on Gaza after two Israelis were stabbed to death in separate knife attacks in Tel Aviv yesterday. The messages have sparked demands for Hopkins to be arrested, but it is not clear whether her Twitter account had been hacked. The bizarre tweets from her account, where she refers to herself as 'telling it like it is', were branded Islamophobic today and started at around 9pm last night. A number were about the ongoing crisis in the Middle East and the series of stabbings apparently carried out by an Arab man on two Israelis who eventually died yesterday. Tweets from Ms Hopkins' account said: 'Palestinians busy knifing Israelis. 2 state solution my a***. Filthy rodents burrowing beneath Israel. Time to restart the bombing campaign. 'Arab terrorists fired rockets from schools and hospitals. They brought down Israeli fire on to their own people. See behind the pictures'. Referring to the Channel 4 show 24 Hours in Police Custody last night a message said: 'Father beats his daughter with an iron bar. But he is a good Muslim, prays in his cell & attends the mosque. So that's all happy days then. 'The police are singing from the same hymn sheet. Mohammed is going DAAAAAAAN. Allahu Akbar'. This was based on last night's show where a father  pleaded guilty to attacking his daughter with an iron, leading to a three-year jail sentence. One follower replied: 'Oh my, please Katie that's racist', which she retweeted. Dozens accused her of inciting racial hatred and demanded the police take action. One Twitter follower asked if she was anti-Muslim and tweets from her account  said: 'Allah doesn't guide me. He is not a dog and I am not blind. I see that all religion is evil'. Controversial: A tweet from Katie Hopkins' account last night demanded Israel started bombing Palestine again and called the Palestinian's 'filthy rodents' TV habits: This tweet and the one below was a reference to an attack by a Muslim father featured on Channel 4 last night . Falling flat: These tweets changed the lyrics of the Band Aid single to poke fun at Ebola . Tweets from her account also made jokes about Ebola after news that a Band Aid single would be released this year on its 30th anniversary. The favourite for the Christmas number one slot will raise millions to combat the disease. A modified lyrics tweet sent from Hopkins' account said: 'But say a prayer, Pray for the other ones, At Christmastime it's hard, when you're bleeding from the bum #BandAid30 totes inappropes. '& in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy, throw your arms around the world at Xmastime. #BandAid30 Dodgy advice for Ebola'. MailOnline has repeatedly contacted Ms Hopkins for a comment today but her agent is yet to respond to the request. Since her appearance on The Apprentice 39-year-old Hopkins Katie has become an outspooken celebrity. There are rumours that she has accepted £400,000 to appear in the next series of Celebrity Big Brother. In September she was criticised for 'fatshaming' after revealing how she put on four stone just to prove she can lose it again. The controversial columnist went on TV yesterday morning to tell how she has gone from from 8st 8lb to 12st so she can attempt to show how easy it is for overweight people to diet. Family: Katie Hopkins,  pictured with her three children India  Hopkins, right, Max, centre and Poppy, six. She is married for a second time . Found fame: Katie became a star on the Apprentice and later went on to do I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here . Upset: Twitter users were furious after the tweets sent from Hopkins' account . Her regular appearances on This Morning allow her to offer her opinion on controversial subjects including 'common' children's names and why the obese are unemployable. Katie famously embarrassed herself when she claimed that she did not like 'geographical names' when appearing on This Morning to claim that names are linked to class. Philip Schofield then pointed out that her own daughter was called India.

"President Barack Obama and 20 other world leaders participated in a tree-planting ceremony near Beijing on Tuesday, but the trees had already been planted by the Chinese government. The fake photo-op came after a session of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. '‎When the plenary was done, the leaders took part in a tree planting near the conference center,' a White House pool reporter wrote while Washington slept 13 time zones away. 'Actually, the evergreens were already planted when they got there – one tree for each country in APEC, each with a little pile of dirt and a shovel next to it.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . FAKE PLANTING: Obama dug a 'hole' in the dirt for a tree 'planting' -- but the already-planted evergreens can be seen behind him . NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION: Obama strode to his ceremonial shovel with his hands behind his back, while Russian president Vladimir Putin swaggered to his already-planted tree . 'RAPPER': Chinese citizens slammed Obama on Tuesday for casually emerging from his limo at the APEC summit while chewing gum – which may have been his favorite stop-smoking aid . The result was 'a little future forest of eight-foot evergreens along a path of astro-turf.' Photos show the president smirking as he grips a shovel and plunges it into a symbolic pile of dirt. Russia's president, by contrast, swaggered to his tree,' according to the pool report. And Obama 'walked up with his hands clasped behind his back.' After the tree 'planting,' Obama was heard telling a fellow head of state: 'Success!' The laid-back president took a moment to banter with a Spanish-language camera crew who called for his attention. 'Hey, hombre!' he shouted with a wave. Obama's casual style has attracted online criticism from the Chinese people, who are accustomed to seeing their president, Xi Jinping maintain a strictly formal demeanor. Live TV coverage broadcast on state-run networks showed him emerging from his limousine chewing gum. Some users of the Sina Weibo microblogging service, a Chinese clone of Twitter,called him an impolite 'idler' and a careless 'rapper,' according to USA Today. 'We made this meeting so luxurious, with singing and dancing, but see Obama, stepping out of his car chewing gum like an idler,' wrote Yin Hong, a professor of journalism at Beijing's Tsinghua University. The gum may have been Obama's way of coping with the stress of international diplomacy as he faces a rough final two years in the White House: He's known in Washington as a prolific user of nicotine gum as a stop-smoking measure. Fake flora on the grounds of the Yanqi Lake convention center, about 45 miles from central Beijing, include more than just pre-set evergreen trees. The pool reporter noted 'lots of out of season flowers in the flower beds.' 'On close inspection, you see that they're in plastic flats or stuffed into green styrofoam.' Leaders of the 21 APEC countries gathered in Beijing for a 'family photo' after talking through trade issues . It a tree is planted in a forest and no one sees it go in the ground, is it really planted? A Chinese pagoda towers over the Yanqi Lake convention center grounds as world leaders participate in the staged pageantry . 'SUCCESS!': Obama 'planted' his 'tree' and then chatted with Chilean president Michelle Bachelet . Obama told APEC attendees that the annual event 'has been able to provide an extraordinarily important forum for generating ideas that boost regional and then global integration, and has helped to provide jobs and support growth in all of our economies.' He will leave Beijing on Wednesday for Naypyitaw, Myanmar, the site of this year's East Asia Summit. The White House's official announcements have referred to that country as 'Burma,' in a hat-tip to pro-Democracy leaders there who resent the 1989 official name-change by an unelected military regime. Obama's remaining schedule for the week calls for G20 summit events in Brisbane, Australia and a speech at the University of Queensland. There are no additional tree-plantings on his calendar.","'Success!' the president was heard telling a fellow head of state after the fake photo-op .

"Students seeing red: Student leaders at  the University of Las Vegas have called on Hillary Clinton to return the $225,000 speaking fee she is expected to receive for a keynote address . Two student leaders at  the University of Las Vegas have called on Hillary Clinton to return the $225,000 speaking fee she is expected to receive for delivering a keynote address at an upcoming event. UNLV student body president Elias Benjelloun and the student government’s public relations director Daniel Waqar appeared on a local talk show Friday, condemning UNLV's foundation for paying Clinton an 'outrageous' sum of money for speaking at a fundraiser in October. ‘We really appreciate anybody who would come to raise money for the university. But anybody who's being paid $225,000 to come speak, we think that's a little bit outrageous,’ Waqar told political journalist Jon Ralston, the host of News3's Ralston Reports. ‘And we'd like Secretary Clinton — respectfully — to gracefully return the money to the university or the foundation.’ The massive payout to the former secretary of state was confirmed just weeks after the university formalized a 4 per cent tuition increase for each of the next four years. Rate hikes have nearly tripled tuition costs there since 2004. Waqar, 19, added  that a letter will go out to Mrs. Clinton asking her to ‘donate the money back to students.’ Scroll down for video . Going public: UNLV student body president Elias Benjelloun (left) and the student government's public relations director Daniel Waqar (right) appeared on a local talk show Friday, condemning UNLV's foundation for the speaking fee flap . Bold request: The UNLV students told political journalist Jon Ralston (left) that Mrs Clinton should return the money to the university or the foundation . 'Donating the money back would be an example of her standing for higher education and standing for students,’ the UNLV junior said. He pointed out that $225,000 is enough to award 225 students scholarships of $1,000 each. The Republican National Committee released a statement Friday saying Clinton’s UNLV speaking fee is four times the amount of the medical household income in Nevada in 2012, . Clinton will deliver the keynote address at an invitation-only gala for philanthropists and other high-dollar donors who support UNLV. The university said private funds are being used to cover her six-figure speaking fee. But students see a zero-sum financial gain in which that money could have chipped away at tuition increases. Cashing in: Former Secretary of State and first lady Hillary Clinton is promoting her memoirs in a nationwide book tour, but will drop by Sin City in October for a $225,000 payday . 'Not really well off': Following a blistering 2012 presidential campaign in which Democrats pilloried Republican Mitt Romney for being super-wealthy and out of touch, Clinton risks falling into that category . '$225,000? That's obscene!' UNLV student Jordan Mason told MailOnline earlier this week. 'And the money is all fungible, right? Even if some CEO is writing the check, that's money that the person probably would have given to the university in some other way.' 'I like Hillary,' Mason added, 'but if she's not willing to support us without all that money changing hands, maybe they should book someone else who won't add to the reasons we're paying more for school.' Benjelloun, UNLV’s undergraduate student body president, told the Las Vegas Sun this month that the school's trustees were trying to improve its offerings 'on the backs of students.' Diplomatic: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who is co-sponsoring a clean energy conference in September where Mrs Clinton is expected to speak for free, sidestepped the UNLV scandal, saying it was not his decision . It is important to note that a month before the October fundraiser, Mrs Clinton is expected to speak for free at an energy conference that is being sponsored by the university and Senator Harry Reid. On Thursday, the U.S. Senate majority leader diplomatically sidestepped the speaking fee flap when interviewed by Las Vegas Review-Journal. ‘Anything we can do to focus attention on UNLV, that’s extremely important to do, and this certainly will focus attention on UNLV, and that’s why they have these people come,’ Reid said. The Nevada Democrat went on to describe Bill and Hillary Clinton are his good friends as a way to explain the former secretary of state’s willingness to address the Clean Energy Summit on September 4 without requiring payment. He then added that Mrs Clinton has long been committed to the cause of promoting clean energy. Mr Reid also noted that it is not unusual from public figures and former political leaders to charge speaking fees. ‘It's part of our free-enterprise system,' he said. Clinton has attracted eye-rolls and guffaws from Republicans, Democrats and TV anchors alike for her recent claims that she and her husband Bill Clinton are 'not truly well off' and were 'dead broke' hen they left the White House in 2001. She told the Guardian last Saturday that Americans won't hold her big paydays against her because she and bill pay 'ordinary income tax, unlike a lot of people who are truly well off – not to name names.' 'And we've done it through dint of hard work.' The UNLV Foundation Board of Trustees is paying Clinton's $225,000 speaking fee to the Harry Walker Agency, which books her public appearances, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The event was confirmed on behalf of the Bill, Hillary, & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, but a UNLV spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday that the money will not go to the Clintons' family philanthropy. The $200 per plate dinner will include some attendees paying as much as $20,000 for special sponsorships that include a private photo session with Hillary Clinton. The UNLV Foundation, which will collect the money, took in $49million in its last fiscal year and ended up with $228million in assets, according to tax records. Seems like only yesterday: Hillary Clinton's last high-profile visit to UNLV was in November 2007 at a CNN-hosted Democratic presidential primary debate against future President Barack Obama and a slate of other also-rans . High roller? The University of Nevada, Las Vegas is just blocks away from Sin City's famous casino district (background), but it's doubtful Hillary Clinton will cash in her $225,000 check for poker chips . Tim Miller, executive director of the conservative America Rising political action committee, said last week that 'if Hillary is going to run for President she might be advised to take a lengthy sabbatical from her $200K per pop speaking tour and private shopping sprees at Bergdorfs to try and reconnect with what’s happening back here on Earth.' The Clintons own stately homes in Washington, D.C. and upstate New York, along with a pricey apartment in New York City. According to 24/7 Wall Street, they are the wealthiest living former first couple. Democrats, especially those likely to be loyal to Vice President Joe Biden in the 2016 presidential race, are now joining with Republicans in bashing the former first lady for being financially tone deaf in a bad economy. 'I don't know whether it’s just that she’s been ""Madam Secretary"" for so long, but she’s generating an imperial image,' former South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Dick Harpootlian told The Washington Post on Sunday. 'She’s been living 30, going on 40 years with somebody bringing your coffee to you every morning. Is it more Downton Abbey than it is America?'","Two University of Las Vegas student government leaders appeared on local TV asking the ex-secretary of state to give the money back to the college .

"Britain's cheese lovers are paying well over the odds for their favourite food after supermarkets failed to pass on cuts to wholesale prices. A report yesterday showed that the retail price of many popular cheeses has actually increased despite a slump in the wholesale dairy market. In the case of cheddar the average retail price of a kilo of cheese has risen 1.8 per cent over the past 12 months to £8.99. But if prices had moved in line with wholesale costs - down 18.6 per cent year on year - a kilo would cost only £7.19, £1.80 less than the current price. A real luxury: The average price of a kilo of cheddar cheese has risen 1.8 per cent over the past 12 months to £8.99. But if prices had followed the 18.6 per cent fall in wholesale costs a kilo would cost only £7.19 . Trade magazine The Grocer says that retail price hikes have been even steeper in own-label cheddar, up 3 per cent to £7.45, while promotional activity has kept a lid on the price of the major brands. Across three of Britain's largest cheddar brands - Cathedral City, Seriously Strong and Pilgrims Choice - the average price has risen 0.3 per cent year on year to £10.81. Data from commodities analyst Mintec showed turmoil in the global dairy markets - made worse by the Russian import ban - has contributed to wholesale price drops such as European skimmed milk powder falling 39 per cent year on year in the 12 months to the end of September. At the same time, dairy farmer protests are targeting processors and retailers over a spate of cuts to the price they are paid for their milk. Yet The Grocer says that a snapshot of the retail price of lines sold in the big four supermarkets on 4 November 2014, compared with the same products 12 months ago, shows many have actually increased. 'Industry insiders say this suggests retailers have been guarding their margins on Cheddar despite the price war raging in the aisles - though they expect retail prices to come down should wholesale prices continue to fall,' The Grocer said. Dairy farmer Rob Harrison, chairman of the National Farmers Union dairy board, told The Telegraph: 'Retailers make an awful lot of money on cheese and it seems they are trying to increase their margins further.' Hardest hit: Fans of blue cheese are paying on average 6.1 per cent more than a year ago, at £11.87 a kilo. Even steeper retail price increases have been seen on territorial cheese - again driven by increases in own-label lines. Across the category, prices have risen 4.5 per cent to £8.54 a kilo with branded products up 4.1 per cent to £8.62. Fans of blue cheese have been hardest hit and are paying on average 6.1 per cent more than a year ago, at £11.87 a kilo. The report says there is better news for bargain-hunting shoppers in the Continental cheese category - if they stick to own-label lines. On average, own-label Continental cheese has fallen 1.6 per cent to £10.93 while branded lines have risen 2.7 per cent to £9.78. Processed cheese, meanwhile, has risen 3.2 per cent.","Cheddar up 1.8 per cent in past year despite steep falls in wholesale costs .

"A 20-year-old woman from Washington state was charged with cyberstalking after police say she threatened to shoot up Seattle Pacific University because a student there broke up with her. Samantha Otis allegedly wrote in a text message to her ex-boyfriend that she wanted to 'repeat’ the June 5 rampage at SPU that left one student dead and two others injured. As a result of the threat, the college went on lockdown at around 2pm on October 31, which was lifted an hour later. Otis was taken into custody outside of Burlington that same day. Another threat: Samantha Otis, 20, is accused of threatening to commit a mass shooting at Seattle Pacific University after her boyfriend broke up with her. The college was the site of a June 5 rampage (pictured) Skagit County sheriff's deputies said that Miss Otis told her former flame that she would kill him and his friends, and claimed to be on campus with a gun. 'It was quickly determined she was not anywhere near the campus,' police said. According to charging documents released to Seattle PI Monday, Otis sent her ex-boyfriend a series of menacing texts beginning October 30 after he failed to contact her. 'Who do I have to kill to get you to answer?' Otis wrote in one message, according to court documents. In another she said: 'Maybe a loaded gun to your head would make you listen.' A third missive from Otis cited in the charging papers read: 'I finally understand why the school shooters do it.' The college went on lockdown October 31 after Otis' boyfriend received a series of menacing texts from her saying she wants to repeat the June tragedy. Pictured here are police securing the crime scene in June . School shooting: The June incident left one student dead and two others wounded . A Seattle Police Department detective stated that the 20-year-old then issued a threat to shoot students as SPU unless her ex got back together with her. The woman allegedly went so far as to say that she was parked across the street from campus and ready to open fire. Otis' ex-boyfriend contacted police to report the threat resulting in a brief lockdown. Otis, who was quickly determined to be some 60 miles away from the college, was quickly arrested and hauled off to King County Jail. Aaron Ybarra, 26, pictured in court June 6, has been charged with premeditated murder and attempted murder . She has since been released on $75,000 bail. The incident served as a frightening reminder of the deadly June 5 shooting in which 26-year-old Aaron Ybarra allegedly walked into a building on campus armed with a shotgun and opened fire. Ybarra has been charged with premeditated murder and attempted murder in what prosecutors said was part of a long-planned act of mass violence.","Samantha Otis, 20, charged with cyberstalking for allegedly threatening her ex-boyfriend and sparking lockdown on Seattle Pacific University campus .

"The grandfather of the murdered McStay family has said that if he was left alone in a room with the man arrested and charged with their violent murders, he would kill him. Patrick McStay, whose son, daughter-in-law and their two sons were killed and buried in the desert, said that Charles 'Chase' Merritt would not survive a one-on-one encounter. McStay also said that hearing Merritt - a business partner and close friend of his son Joseph - had been arrested over the killings was 'like a boulder falling on me'. Scroll down for video . Anger: Patrick McStay, left, said that he would be the only one to leave the room if he and Charles 'Chase' Merritt, right, were left alone . Speaking to CNN, he pointed out how Merritt had 'perfectly' described the area of the Mojave desert where the McStays - Joseph, 40, wife Summer, 43, Gianni, four and Joseph Junior, three - were dug up almost a year ago. The family disappeared in February 2010, leaving investigators baffled until the bodies were found by chance. It then took another year before the Sheriff's department in San Bernadino County, California, moved to arrest Merrit. He has now been charged with all four murders, and is being held in jail without bail, and has appeared briefly in court without making a plea. Investigators believe the McStays were killed in their home in Fallbrook, California, by what they describe as 'blunt force trauma'. Burdened: McStay, pictured speaking with CNN, said Merritt's arrest hit him like a falling boulder . Charged: Charles Merritt, pictured being arrested on November 5, has previously denied any involvement in the deaths . If convicted of their murders, Merritt could face the death penalty, prosecutors said. Patrick McStay's uncompromising intentions towards Merritt were revealed when he was asked on CNN what he would ask Merritt if he were alone with him. He simply replied: 'I wouldn't ask him anything. There'd be one person coming out of that room.' When asked whether he truly believed Merritt was capable of the murders, McStay reserved his judgement, saying: 'After all I've seen through the years and the information we've found, I still can't say yes - but I can definitely say I wonder.' Authorities have not yet disclosed a motive for Merritt's alleged murders. But McStay has suggested money was at the heart of the crime - saying that Joseph was on the cusp of dropping Merritt as his business partner due to sloppy work. Joseph McStay was reportedly on the cusp of closing a $9million deal for his garden accessory business. If it came off, Merritt, whose model waterfalls McStay often bought, would profit, too. Shallow graves: The McStay family were found buried in the Mojave desert near the freeway. Pictured are the graves being filled in . Murder scene: Authorities now say they believe the McStay family were killed at their home in Fallbrook, California . But according to Patrick McStay the relationship had soured. In an earlier interview with NBC Los Angeles, McStay, from Houston, Texas, said: 'Chase was always somebody, you know, chasing the dollar and I think that's what it was, it was all about the money.' Another relative, Joseph McStay's brother Michael, has also spoken publicly about Merritt. At a news conference announcing his arrest, he said: 'Joseph was a great brother, a great father, he would've done anything to protect those boys and Summer and he tried to help Chase and provide work for this guy - and this is how he was repaid.' 'I know he's in a better place - I know that sounds a little trite but this gives our family a little more closure, the opportunity to heal and move forward and he'll get what he's got coming to him.' Merritt himself has always denied the murders - and spoke at length with MailOnline last year about the McStay family. He claimed to have taken and passed a lie detector test to remove himself from suspicion. He also said he hoped authorities would: 'find the a*******s who did this'.","Patrick McStay if left alone with murder suspect only one would leave .

"A drugs gang tried to smuggle £16million of cocaine into Scotland using a James Bond-style underwater craft, a court was told yesterday. The plot involved an ‘enormous’ amount of high-purity cocaine stashed in the hull of a Colombian ship off the North Ayrshire coast. Prosecutors say Dutch smugglers planned to use diving gear and a high-speed submarine vehicle to sneak in a haul so massive it could have affected the entire UK drugs market. The drugs gang tried to smuggle £16million of cocaine into Scotland using a boat and an underwater craft . The James Bond-style underwater craft (pictured) was going to be used to sneak in a drugs haul so massive it could have affected the entire UK drugs market . At Leeds Crown Court, barrister Paul Mitchell was opening the case against four Dutch nationals charged with conspiring to import 238lb of the Class A drug (pictured) into the UK through Hunterston, south of Largs . At Leeds Crown Court, barrister Paul Mitchell was opening the case against four Dutch nationals charged with conspiring to import 238lb of the Class A drug into the UK through Hunterston, south of Largs. Mr Mitchell told the jury that Henri van Doesburg, 68, his son Roderick, 23, grandson Darryl-Jay, 22, and Arnold van Milt, 49, were all involved in the alleged conspiracy. Mr Mitchell said the three younger men obtained sophisticated underwater equipment with the intention of removing the drugs stashed in the rudder housing of the motor vessel Cape Maria, moored in the Clyde, and bringing it ashore. But the cocaine haul was discovered by investigators before the men could get their hands on it, the prosecutor said. A police search of a car and an inflatable boat uncovered specialised dry diving suits and ‘equipment you might have seen used by James Bond and his adversaries that you would use if you wanted to travel underwater at high speed,’ Mr Mitchell told the jury. It is understood the men had a Seabob submersible, a motorised vehicle designed to allow a diver to travel considerable distances. A police search of a car and an inflatable boat uncovered specialised dry diving suits and ‘equipment you might have seen used by James Bond' The trio were arrested on May 9 in Seamill near Hunterston, North Ayrshire, where the Cape Maria was docked . Mr Mitchell said the cocaine would have been accessible in a submerged recess in the ship’s hull from outside the boat to someone with access to scuba-diving equipment. The court was told the four defendants travelled from Rotterdam in the Netherlands, first stopping in Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, before continuing on their journey to Scotland. While in England, said Mr Mitchell, the defendants based themselves at a campsite and took various trips on a rubber dinghy boat around the Lincolnshire shores. Roderick and Darryl-Jay van Doesburg then left Cleethorpes on May 5 and drove with van Milt to Scotland in a black Ford Explorer they had purchased under the name Ray Monty, Mr Mitchell said. The jury heard Henri van Doesburg then flew back to Holland where he was later arrested after searches on a computer at his address found ‘significant’ links between the four and the vessel importing the drugs. The plot involved moving the drugs through a hole in the boat (pictured) before taking them ashore . Specialist diving gear and drugs recovered from the Cape Maria. Prosecutors say Dutch smugglers planned to use diving gear and a high-speed submarine vehicle to sneak in the massive haul of cocaine to Scotland . Mr Mitchell said: ‘At 9pm that evening, the three defendants checked into Brisbane House Hotel in Largs, close to the mooring place of the Cape Maria. They enquired about hiring diving equipment for three men. ‘The Cape Maria, having travelled from Colombia, was at Hunterston with the drugs stored in the back. ‘Officers searched the rudder trunk space, also accessible from the outside, where they found five large black packages containing 55 smaller packages containing cocaine as high as 80 per cent purity.’ Mr Mitchell added: ‘The street value of this cocaine was £16.2million. These are extraordinary profits. This is an enormous amount of the drug which would have had a significant effect on the drugs market in the country as a whole.’ The trio were arrested on May 9 at the four-star Hydro hotel in Seamill near Hunterston, North Ayrshire, where the Cape Maria was docked. Mr Mitchell added: ‘The three defendants each had diving equipment, and van Milt’s telephone had a document clearly relating to the Cape Maria, the boat with the drugs in.’ The drugs were found in the rudder area of Cape Maria which had sailed from Colombia to Hunterston . Henri van Doesburg was arrested the next day in the Netherlands for his alleged part in the plot between February and May this year. Mr Mitchell added: ‘A Customs officer happened to be staying at the hotel. He happened to notice the men and the inflatable boat outside the hotel. ‘That same afternoon that police found the drugs, the defendants were still around in the area. ‘Is it all just a coincidence? The Crown say that it isn’t. These are the men who were behind the attempt to import the drugs.’ All four men deny conspiracy to evade the prohibition on the importation of controlled drugs. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Plot involved ‘enormous’ amount of cocaine stashed in a Colombian ship .

"Mauricio Pochettino is set to return to former club Espanyol for defender Hector Moreno. The Tottenham manager wants to give his struggling side a facelift following a disappointing start to his reign. And the Argentine has identified Moreno, 26, as a target in his attempts to strengthen his back four. Hector Moreno represented Mexico at the World Cup. Here he is in action against Holland's Arjen Robben . Moreno has 57 caps for Mexico and formerly worked with Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino at Espanyol . The central defender, who has 57 caps for Mexico, worked under Pochettino at Espanyol during the manager's time with the Spanish club. Pochettino originally signed Moreno from AZ Alkmaar in 2011. Manchester United have also been linked with a move for him. Meanwhile, the Spurs boss is ready to use his under-performing stars as makeweights in plans to strengthen his squad in January. He watched his side slump to an embarrassing defeat to Stoke on Sunday as the club's disappointing start to their Barclays Premier League season continued. The Mexico international in action against Barcelona's Lionel Messi last season . Morgan Schneiderlin (right) has enjoyed another impressive campaign for Southampton this season . Pochettino is determined to strengthen his squad once the January transfer window reopens. But as he found out in the summer, he will not be handed a vast transfer budget to sign the players he feels he needs to turn Spurs' season around. Pochettino wants to sign two new strikers in the next window, Southampton's Jay Rodriguez being one of those. He retains an interest in Rodriguez's team-mate Morgan Schneiderlin. Both players could cost Spurs in-excess of £40million. Andros Townsend, in action during Tottenham's defeat against Stoke, could be sold by the club in January . And Pochettino is prepared to use a number of his fringe and under-performing players to supplement his January transfer budget. Among those who maybe deemed surplus to requirements by Pochettino include Paulinho, Andros Townsend, Aaron Lennon and Vlad Chiriches. The quartet have made just four Premier League starts between them this season, and have not had the impact Pochettino would have hoped. In his search for new talent, Pochettino has also been scouring the South American market for potential new signings. River Plate striker Teo Gutierrez, who played for Colombia in the World Cup, has been watched by Spurs scouts.","Pochettino has identified Moreno  in a bid to strengthen the Spurs defence .

"Newly-released videos have revealed the chaotic, last minutes of a team of 'hotshot' firefighters before they were killed while battling the Yarnell Hill Fire in June 2013. The Arizona State Forestry Division posted the clips on its website this week that were recorded by other firefighters on the day that 19 Granite Mountain Hotshots died. Some footage, including that which showed the bodies of the Granite Mountain crew, was redacted by the Forest Service. The clips revealed the immense danger being faced by the hotshots as they were surrounded by walls of fast-moving flames and 2000F heat. Scroll down for video . Newly-released video footage from the day that 19 'hotshot' firefighters died while fighting the Yarnell Hill Fire in Arizona reveals their bravery in the final minutes. Voices of the firefighters can be heard on the tapes . Videos released this week revealed the chaotic last-minute attempts to save 19 firefighters (some are pictured here) on Granite Mountain before they were consumed by 2000F heat and walls of fire . The firefighters raced in to battle the fire but were overwhelmed by the flames in June 2013 and died when they tried to shelter in place . The aftermath of the brutal forest fire. Some footage, including that which showed the bodies of the Granite Mountain crew, was redacted by the Forest Service . Winds from a thunderstorm fanned flames towards the crew and made communicating difficult and patchy. At one point, another firefighter is heard asking for the cell phone number of a hotshot because he is having trouble reaching him via radio, CBS reported. The clips range from 30 seconds to more than seven minutes. They include one previously released clip that showed firefighters listening to radio traffic between the Granite Mountain crew and command staff. The crew seemed puzzled about what was going on. One said he thought the crew was in a safety zone. On one of the last transmissions from the hotshots came from Eric Marsh, the superintendent of the Granite Mountain crew, who is heard saying: 'Our escape route has been cut off. We are preparing a deployment site and we are burning out around ourselves in the brush and I'll give you a call when we are under ... the shelters.' The clip ended with command staffers trying repeatedly to reach the crew by radio. The calls go unanswered. Other videos showed firefighters planning their attempt to rescue the Granite Mountain crew and making their way to the area. Once the bodies were found, the emotion in the clips is apparent. At one point, a voice utters a profanity and confirms that the bodies of the crew have been found. Another voice is heard over the radio, reporting solemnly that there were no survivors. A rescuer said: 'Yeah Todd, on scene. 18 confirmed.' A total of 19 firefighters died, making the tragedy the deadly blaze marked the greatest loss of life from a U.S. wildfire since 1933. As other fire crews made it to where the 19 'hotshots' had been fighting the blaze, one voice can be heard on the radio saying: 'Yeah Todd on scene. 18 confirmed'. 19 firefighters in total died . The deadly blaze in Yarnell, Arizona marked the greatest loss of life during a U.S. wildfire since 1933 . Roxanne Warneke, whose husband, Billy Warneke, was one of the 19 men killed, watched the videos in her Marana home. For her, there still are questions. In one clip, a man's voice is heard saying: 'I don't have anybody else that I feel comfortable sending that way.' Mrs Warneke said that sounds as if someone had specifically sent the Granite Mountain crew into the area where they were trapped and killed. 'We'll never understand. We will always ask why,' said Tammy Misner of Santa Ynez, California, whose son, Sean Misner, was a Granite Mountain hotshot. Mrs Misner heard the bewilderment, the fear and then sadness in the men's voices as she watched the videos, which include images recorded before the hotshots were overcome and after their bodies were found. Winds from a thunderstorm fanned the flames toward the tragic 19 hotshots, but fire chiefs did not pull out their men in time . She said: 'It was just disturbing to look at and watch, but at the same time I don't think I heard anything that would make any changes to what we already feel we know happened. 'You're watching this, and you know what's going on. Our guys are gone.' Attorney Patrick McGroder, who represents families of the fallen hotshots in wrongful-death and benefit legal cases, had not seen the footage. He criticized the forestry division's handling of the release, saying officials were insensitive and lacked decency. A few weeks ago, families of the Granite Mountain Hotshots had been warned by J.P. Vicente, a Prescott fire captain, that the videos might be released. Families had asked that no footage of the bodies of their loved ones or photographs be made public.

"Those children born to teenage mothers tend not to perform as well academically as the children of older mothers, a new study has found. A team of scientists at the University of Michigan found the level of education a mother attains can predict her children's success in reading and maths. Their findings showed that success is greater if a mother had her child later in life. Sandra Tang, the study's lead author, said children born to mothers aged 19 or older usually enter kindergarten with higher levels of achievement. She said the researchers found these children continued to excel in maths and reading at higher levels by the time they reach 13 to 14, when compared to those children of mothers 18 and younger. Scientists at the University of Michigan found children to mothers aged 19 or older usually enter kindergarten with higher levels of achievement. File picture . 'These results provide compelling evidence that having a child during adolescence has enduring negative consequences for the achievement of the next generation,' Dr Tang said. The negative consequences of teen mothers were found not only to affect the child born when the mother was an adolescent, but also any subsequent children. Professor Pamela Davis-Kean, of the Institute for Social Research and Center for Human Growth and Development, said the findings present good news and bad news. 'The good news is that the children of teen mothers who continue their education after having children do better academically than children of teen moms who did not continue,' she said. 'However, these children-and other children born to the mother when she wasn't an adolescent-never catch up in achievement across time to children whose mothers had them after completing their education. 'This group continues to carry a risk for lower achievement.' The study's data was taken from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort, a nationally representative sample of children who were first assessed upon entering kindergarten in 1998 and were interviewed through spring 2007. In 14,279 cases, the children's maths and reading scores were collected in third, fifth and eighth grades. Lead author Sandra Tang said the researchers found these children continued to excel in maths and reading at higher levels by 14, when compared to those children of mothers 18 and younger. File picture . Researchers used this data to compare achievement trajectories of children born either to teen mothers aged 18 or younger to adult mothers, aged 19 and older. The analyses took into account mothers' educational expectations for their children, the home environment and other characteristics, such as household income, that may influence children's achievement. Trends indicate that mothers who give birth during adolescence have much lower rates of high school completion and college enrollment in comparison to their counterparts who delay pregnancy. Dr Tang said given that growth in achievement generally stays the same across time for math and reading for all children in the sample, these patterns highlight the importance of investing in early interventions that target adolescent mothers and provide them with the skills needed to promote their children's learning.","Scientists found children born to mothers aged 19 or older usually enter kindergarten with higher levels of achievement .

"The country’s biggest education authority has revived plans to open the first new grammar school in 50 years. Kent County Council has asked Education Secretary Nicky Morgan to approve its plans to open a ‘satellite’ grammar school to meet demand from a rising population. Earlier proposals submitted by the authority were rejected by her predecessor Michael Gove. Kent County Council has asked Education Secretary Nicky Morgan to sanction a new grammar school . The plans emerged as London Mayor Boris Johnson described the decline of selection as a ‘tragedy’. Kent’s proposals involve opening a grammar school in the town of Sevenoaks, which would operate as an ‘annexe’ to the existing Weald of Kent grammar nine miles away. Mrs Morgan is expected to rule on the plans before the election, throwing the spotlight on the bitterly-contested issue of academic selection in schools. Theresa May, the Home Secretary is already backing plans for a new grammar school annexe in her Maidstone constituency. Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary and MP for Sevenoaks, has also supported the Kent school plan, saying it was ‘deeply unfair to parents in my constituency’ that the town did not have a grammar school. It came as Mr Johnson added his voice to calls for an expansion of selection, telling LBC Radio: ‘I think they are a very important part of the mix in our educational system, I think that they work very well in many areas and they should be supported. ‘I think that the decision to get rid of them was a real tragedy for this country.’ Labour passed laws in 1998 banning the opening of any more grammars because of the party’s long-standing opposition to academic selection. But the Coalition made it easier for the 163 remaining state grammar schools to open satellites to meet demand from parents for more places. Kent’s original proposal was rejected last year because the annexe was considered too different from the ‘parent’ school. It had planned to admit both boys and girls, despite being sponsored by a single-sex girls’ school. Mayor of London Boris Johnson, pictured, described the decline of selection at schools as 'a tragedy' Under the revised plan, the new school will only admit girls and will be more closely linked to its sponsor school. Paul Carter, the council leader, said: ‘I am delighted that we now have a robust proposal to put to the Secretary of State for her sign-off. ‘School rolls are rising dramatically and we must be allowed to expand grammar schools in line with all other categories and types of school. ‘This is good news for parents with daughters and we will continue to work in earnest to find a solution for their sons. ‘I am also delighted by the support from Theresa May and Michael Fallon for the establishment of further grammar school provision in their constituencies.’ A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘We want good schools to be able to expand but they have to do so within the law. Every application will have to be considered on its own merits.’","Nicky Morgan is considering plans for the first grammar school in 50 years .

"The quadruple amputee on the run after the November 4 murder of both his parents killed himself Monday night during a routine Memphis traffic stop. Sean Petrozzino was over 800 miles from his slain parents' Orlando home when he made an illegal u-turn that caught the attention of Tennessee cops, reports WMC. As those officers approached Petrozzino's father's missing red Toyota, they heard a gun discharge. In side the car was the body of the handless, legless 30-year-old. Recent photo: Police on Wednesday released this surveillance shot of Petrozzino from when he withdrew cash at an ATM on Tuesday . Victims: Michael (left) and Nancy Petrozzino (right) were found dead in their Orange County, Florida home the morning of November 7 . Drove off? Police believed Sean was driving this red Toyota with a license plate number of 112VZY. Neighbors say it was Sean's father's can. Memphis cops allegedly pulled Sean over in the car on Monday evening . Petrozinno was Orange County, Florida investigators' only 'person of interest' in the murder of school teacher Nancy Petrozzino, 54, and Disney World employee Michael Petrozzino, 63, reports the Orlando Sentinel. He was never named as a suspect but police warned the public he was armed and possibly dangerous as he made his way out of Orange County. It was initially believed that Petrozzino might have been heading south toward Southern Florida last week. Presumably what was the final photo taken of Petrozzino was at an Orlando ATM, where he withdrew cash around the time of his parents' death. The Orange County Sheriff's Office said just before noon Tuesday that Memphis authorities had not yet confirmed Petrozzino's death, thus it remained unknown whether the murder investigation would continue. Sean (right) reportedly moved back home with his parents last week after breaking up with his wife Cynthia (left) Petrozzino's inspirational battle with the disease made the headlines when he was a teenager with news crews visiting him in hospital and during events. Recent posts on social media suggests he and his family were happy. Some pictures were taken at Disney World where his father worked. But earlier this year he broke up with his wife Cynthia and moved in with his parents only a week before they were found dead. Soon after making the gruesome discovery, the Orange County Sheriff's Office held a press conference, asking about the whereabouts of the couple's son Sean Petrozzino, 30. They said he may be driving a red Toyota with a license plate number of 112VZY, which neighbors say is his father's car. Sean and his great Dane moved back in with his parents last week after separating from his wife. The former couple's home in Georgia is allegedly in foreclosure. Sean is also a quadruple amputee after a teenage bout with bacterial meningitis. In 2000, he underwent 13 surgeries to remove the infection which resulted in the loss of both his legs and he only has part of one hand left.  He is able to walk with the use of prosthetic limbs. 'I've known Sean since he was 16 years old,' mother in law Cathleen Horne told the Sentinel. 'This just seems bizarre. It seems like a bad dream.' 'We met Sean about a week-and-a-half ago,' neighbor Richard Ellwood told My Fox Orlando. 'He was introduced to me by Nancy as their son.' Mr Ellwood went on to describe the couple as nice people who had lived in the neighborhood for several years. 'It's difficult to imagine someone who would have that much rage, whoever did this,' he told WKMG. The Orlando Sentinel spoke to Jerry L. Saunders of ABC Prosthetics and Orthotics, who verified that handless people indeed have the ability to fire a weapon. It's also known that Sean Petrozzino is able to manage other finer tasks such as using an ATM. Police verified this late Wednesday when they released surveillance footage of Petrozzino as he used an Orlando cash machine on Tuesday, most likely after his parents were slain. What's more, police are searching for Petrozzino as he's thought to potentially be on his way to South Florida and behind the wheel of his father's red Toyota.

"Celebrity chef Rick Stein pioneered its revival, Gordon Ramsay is planning on opening his own and Michelin-starred chef Tom Kerridge said his 'last meal on earth' would be cod and chips from his local takeaway. The humble British chippy is enjoying a revival as endorsement by celebrity chefs and upmarket restaurants make fish and chips fashionable again. And the number of chippies in the UK had risen to 10,500 by last year, outnumbering both McDonald's (1,200), and KFC (840). Fish and chips from the Tom Kerridge's Hand & Flowers pub and restaurant in Marlow, Buckinhamshire . More than 2,000 new chippies have opened in the last decade, according to the National Federation of Fish Friers (NFFF). Andrew Crook, treasurer of NFFF, said: 'It's great to see such high profile people talking about fish and chips and it demonstrates how far the industry has come. 'We are seeing a change in the demographic of fish and chip shop owners as younger people are coming into the trade, all bringing new ideas.' The industry has seen a major shift away from greasy corner-shops to well-organised, clean and professional establishments. Rick Stein was an early adopter of the trend, opening a busy fish and chip bar in Padstow, Cornwall . Posh versions of the dish in gastro-pubs and restaurants has added to the affect, along with the current trend for simple and natural food. Rick Stein was an early adopter, opening a busy fish and chip bar in Padstow, Cornwall, along with a number of fish-inspired restaurants and shops in the town. Gordon Ramsay is getting in on the trend, with plans for a fish and chip restaurant in Las Vegas Nevada, named 'Gordon Ramsay's Fish & Chips' in spring 2015. And in an interview with the Mail on Sunday Masterchef star Tom Kerridge - who runs the two-Michelin starred Hand and Flowers in Marlow, Buckinghamshire -  said his last meal would be fish and chips from his boyhood chippy, Danny Dykes of Linden, Gloucestershire, washed down with a can of Lilt. Celeb endorsement: Both Mr Stein (left)  and Gordon Ramsey (right) are fans of Brit classic fish and chips . Classic and simple: Posh versions of the dish in restaurants has added to its popularity . Erini Panayi, co-manager of Danny Dykes Fish & Chip Shop, said: 'It was great to be given that recognition from Tom because we've worked hard for 23 years, we've been constantly on the go. 'It's a really filling food and it's not that expensive. Where else can you get a meal for £3.84? 'Often people come from abroad and they can't wait to try fish and chips. It's a traditional English meal. 'It's also healthy - we have customers who have lived up to 100-years-old coming in every day.' Britain currently spends £1.2bn on fish and chips, which equates to 382 million portions or six servings for every man, woman and child every year. Tom Kerridge said that his 'last meal' would be from his local takeaway, Danny Dykes Fish & Chip Shop . Mr Crook, of the NAFF, added: 'Fish and chips are so engrained in the hearts of the British public. 'And with so many celebrity chefs keen to serve our iconic dish, fish and chips are here to stay.' The popularity of fish and chips peaked in Britain in the 1920s, when there were around 30,000 fish and chip shops in the UK. But this had dipped to just 8,600 by 2003 amid concerns over the high fat content and other fast food outlets grew in popularity. However, the number of chippies had risen to 10,500 by last year, outnumbering both McDonald's, with 1,200, and KFC, with 840.","Rick Stein, Gordon Ramsey and Tom Kerridge are fans of the battered fish .

"Atlanta police are being accused of embellishing the case against a father whose son died in a hot car last month after significant discrepancies allegedly emerged during a review of the evidence. The Atlanta Journal Constitution has carefully looked through some the evidence, including a surveillance video that captured Justin Ross Harris outside the Home Depot where he worked, and the newspaper claims authorities overstated some of their case at a July 3 hearing. According to the AJC, the tape contradicts some of the testimony given by Cobb County detective Phil Stoddard. Also, in an exclusive interview, Harris' brother told the paper that he and Harris were planning a cruise together and that Harris had specifically requested one with facilities for children. Scroll down for video . Family: The Atlanta Journal Constitution claims there are discrepancies int he evidence in the case of Justin Ross Harris, pictured right with his wife and late son Cooper . During the July 3 hearing, Stoddard, prompted by prosecutor Chuck Boring, strongly insinuated that Harris sat in his parked car outside of his work on the morning on June 18 for 30 seconds before getting out and walking inside. Boring reiterated this during closing arguments, saying 'That morning, he waits 30 seconds in that car... 30 seconds with that child right beside him.' However, the AJC claims the security video in fact shows Harris remained in the Hyundai for less that 15 seconds before exiting the car, during which time he put the car in park, turned off the engine and gathered his belongings. Harris returned to the SUV at lunchtime to put a package of light bulbs inside and Stoddard. During the brief trip to the car, Stoddard and Boring said the father had a 'clear view' of the inside of the car. However, after reviewing the video, the AJC claims only Harris' arm and shoulder are seen reaching inside the vehicle, and that his eyes remain above the SUV's roof at all times. It also shows it took just three seconds for him to open the door, put the package inside and shut the door again. According to the AJC, a surveillance video contradicts some of the testimony given by Cobb County detective Phil Stoddard, pictured on July 3 . Mom: Police have not named Leanna Harris as a suspect and she has not been charged with any crime . The third piece of allegedly overstated evidence presented by authorities is the claim that Harris paused during . his walk back to the office, because he apparently was concerned a . passerby would see his son inside the car. While . the tape does show Harris pass a man in the parking lot, and pause . briefly, his eyes are on his cell phone, which he is poking at with his . free hand and he doesn't appear to notice the man at all. The man in fact walks the length of . Harris' parked car and would have almost certainly seen the child if . he'd turned his head, the AJC claims. Michael . Baygents, Harris' half-brother, told the newspaper that he and Harris . were excitedly planning to take their families on a cruise in October . after Harris suggested the two families vacation together. He said they settled on Carnival Cruise Lines because a carnival ship had water slides for children. Baygents said he was frustrated to see the way the police were portraying his brother's case. 'I'm . very angry with them. I think they rushed to judgment. I think Stoddard . rushed to judgment. I think he made a terrible mistake,' he told the . AJC. The claims come after the lawyer for the Harris' wife said she was devastated by the loss of little Cooper. Peaceful: Harris described Cooper as peaceful with his . eyes closed, when this wasn't the case, according to Stoddard. He . allegedly also told his wife: 'I dreaded how he would look' Criminal defense attorney Lawrence . Zimmerman said Leanna Harris is 'living every parent's nightmare' after . the death of her 22-month-old son. The woman's husband, Justin Ross Harris, 33, was arrested on charges of murder and child cruelty after the boy's death June 18. The . father told police he left his son in the backseat of his SUV for about . seven hours after forgetting to drop him off at day care and going to . work, investigators in the Atlanta suburb of Cobb County have said. Leanna Harris has not been charged in the case. Zimmerman criticized media coverage of . her reaction to her son's death, saying speculation over a perceived . lack of emotion in the case thus far is similar to what 1996 Olympic . bombing hero Richard Jewell faced after an attack that year on the . summer games in Atlanta. Jewell led people away from a suspicious backpack before a blast killed one and left more than 100 people injured. He . became the target of intense scrutiny after an unattributed news report . said he was the focus of the investigation into the attack. Jewell's name was cleared in 2006 and he died the following year at age 44. Investigation: Cobb County police investigate the SUV where toddler Cooper Harris died near Marietta, Ga., when his father Ross forgot to drop his child off at day care and went to work . 'Newspapers, . television and online media have fostered a poisonous atmosphere in . which Leanna's every word, action and emotion — or failure to cry in . front of a crowd — is scrutinized for some supposed hidden meaning,' Zimmerman said. He . added that the media has dug into his client's upbringing, marriage and . sex life. Zimmerman also said Leanna Harris has been unable to return . to work and she's asking to be allowed to mourn her son out of the . public eye. 'She will never be able to tuck him into bed at night and return later to check on him. 'She . mourns Cooper's death deeply, in her own private way,' the lawyer . stated. 'She takes comfort from a strong faith in God, but the loss is . still overwhelming. Getting through each day seems almost impossible.' During . an hourslong probable cause hearing on July 3, prosecutors said . evidence shows Justin Ross Harris had been leading a double life and was . sending nude photos with several women — including at least one . teenager — even on the day his son died. The . couple had two life insurance policies for the toddler, one for $2,000 . and one for $25,000. After his son's death, Harris talked with relatives . about what they needed to do to file claims, investigators have said. Harris' defense attorney Maddox Kilgore has argued that evidence in the case is . insufficient and the boy's death was a tragic accident. Justin Ross Harris remains jailed without bond. Police recently said a . toxicology tests on the body of 22-month-old Cooper had negative . results, but they didn't say what substances they tested for. No bond: Justin Ross Harris, the Georgia man charged with murder after his toddler son died inside of a hot SUV, was refused bond on July 3 and will now remain in jail until he is tried . Toxicology tests typically are used to detect foreign substances such as drugs in a person's system. A . growing number of questions are being asked about Leanna Harris' unusual behavior in the wake of young Cooper’s horrific death inside a . sweltering SUV last month. Harris, . a 30-year-old dietitian, expressed little emotion throughout her . husband's preliminary hearing last week, despite a number of shocking . allegations including that her husband had been sexting with six . different women, some teenagers, on the day their young son had passed . away. As . prosecutors said her husband was practically leading a double life and . should not be granted bond, Leanna Harris chewed gum and stared blankly . ahead. During last Thursday's proceedings, investigators described her own behavior on the day her son died as odd, if not suspicious. When informed by workers at her son's . day care facility that Cooper had never been dropped off, she calmly . responded, 'Ross must have left him in the car. There's no other . explanation,' according to Cobb County Police Detective Phil Stoddard's . testimony. Then, when . reunited with her husband at police headquarters after he had been . charged with murder, Leanna Harris asked him, 'Did you say too much?' according to Stoddard. When she called home June 18 with the . grim news of Cooper's death, her mother could be overheard on the phone . saying: 'Why aren't you crying? Why aren't you reacting?' Heartbreaking details: Detective Stoddard testified that there was scratch marks on Cooper Harris' face and abrasions on the back of the toddler's head . Justin Ross Harris is accused of leaving his 22-month-old son Cooper to die in a scorching hot SUV on June 18 . Her response, according to Stoddard: 'I must be in shock.' Police . had previously disclosed that, like her husband, she had researched . children dying in hot vehicles prior to her son Cooper's death, telling . officers it was her 'worst fear.' At Cooper's funeral - and with her husband listening from jail on speaker phone - she said she held no anger toward him. 'Ross . is and was a wonderful father,' she told mourners, before telling her . husband of seven years: 'I love you and I'm doing this for you.' Some of Leanna Harris' comments during her eulogy at Cooper’s funeral have also raised suspicions. 'Some of you might wonder how I'm standing here today and I ask myself the same question,' the deeply religious mother said. 'I should be crumpled into a pile of tears and snot on the ground. (The Lord) is standing behind me, holding me up.' The . 250 or so mourners who gathered at University Church of Christ gave her . two rounds of applause as she said she wouldn’t bring her son back, . even if she could. 'He's in the most peaceful, wonderful place there is.' Justin Ross Harris was denied bond by a judge who called it a 'possible death penalty case.' He remains in jail on murder and child cruelty charges and prosecutors may seek to use Leanna Harris as a witness. In . Georgia, the spousal privilege shielding a wife from testifying against . her husband, doesn't apply in cases of the death of a child.","The Atlanta Journal Constitution has reviewed some of the evidence, including a surveillance video that captured Justin Ross Harris outside the Home Depot where he worked .

"Four members of an Amish family died after their hired van was struck by a cement truck as they traveled home from a funeral in central Pennsylvania. The York County coroner's office said the fourth victim, Elizabeth Esh, 22, was pronounced dead Tuesday, a day after she delivered a stillborn boy. Her brother-in-laws Emmanuel Esh, 73, and Melvin Esh, 66, were also pronounced dead at the scene of the wreck Monday afternoon in rural southeastern York County. Firefighters direct traffic away from the crash that killed four members of an Amish family on Monday . State police said the victims were passengers in a van, operated by 49-year-old Connie Lally, that turned into the path of a concrete truck driven by John Ehrhart, 60. The truck then struck a third vehicle, a sedan. The coroner's office said Emmanuel and Melvin Esh are related to Elizabeth Esh by marriage. Officials said after autopsies on Tuesday that the three adults died from multiple blunt-force trauma. They said more testing was needed in order to determine the child's cause of death. Police said the van's three other occupants were injured and some required hospital treatment. No information was available from police about the condition of Ehrhart or the third vehicle's driver. A message left for Lally on Tuesday was not immediately returned. Police said any decision about possible charges in the crash will be made after the investigation is completed. The Amish are a religious group that generally does not permit the ownership of automobiles or many other modern conveniences, instead traveling by horse and buggy. They may not have driver's licenses so often hire vehicles driven by non-Amish for longer trips.","Elizabeth Esh, 22, was pronounced dead at the scene, a day after she delivered a stillborn boy .

"A woman who spent $500,000 creating a one-of-a-kind three-story closet has opened the luxury space up to the public for a children's cancer charity fundraiser - three months after a burglar broke into the 'she cave' and stole $1million worth of luxury goods which have yet to be returned to her. Despite her experience, Theresa Roemer, from Houston, Texas, didn't hesitate to offer up the luxury wardrobe as a venue for charity Kids Need More, who run a special holiday camp where adolescent cancer patients can escape the harsh realities of their diagnosis and let loose for a week of fun. 'I'm a woman of my word, and I told everyone this closet was built for fundraising and that's what it's intended for,' Ms Roemer told ABC Eyewitness News. 'Why would I let someone who wasn't invited to my home ruin that?' The world's most coveted closet: Theresa Roemer first opened up her wardrobe to the world during a segment on Good Morning America in July . Fashion favorites: The former beauty queen had several irreplaceable items stolen from the three-story space . Ms Roemer's own son died in a car accident in 2006 and she is eager to work alongside any charities that will better the lives of children. 'Ever since my son passed away, and I wanted to fill that gaping hole in my heart; it just seems like if I can help kids, it helps fill that void a little bit,' she added. 'I just feel like my son didn't get his chance to build his legacy in life, so I'm going to do it for him.' Shortly after the robbery, Ms Roemer was contacted by the thief who claimed that many of the designer items stolen from her wardrobe were actually fakes. He demanded that she pay him $500,000 or face being exposed to the press. After refusing to bow to his demands, the fashion lover discovered that the stolen items had been sent to the local press, before being turned over to the police. Carry on as normal: Theresa (L) was determined that her fundraising plans would continue, starting with an event to raise money for children's cancer charity Kids Need More . 'This closet was built for fundraising': Despite the robbery, Ms Roemer is determined to use her wardrobe as a means of raising money for charity . Now, all she can do is wait until officials determine who is responsible for the crime - and whether the recovered goods are in fact the actual stolen items. 'They tend to think they're from Houston, and they're gang-related because of where the cell phones have pinged from,' she revealed. But of all the items taken from her, the one that she is most eager to recover is a priceless locket which contains a piece of her late son's hair and is now being used by the police as evidence. Caught on camera: The thief can been seen on CCTV going through and taking the most valuable goods . Gone but not forgotten: Of all the items taken, Ms Roemer is most eager to recover a locket which contains a piece of her late son's hair. Pictured, her son, who died in a car accident in 2006 . The former Miss Texas is also eager to clear up any rumors or misconceptions about the robbery - and about the legitimacy of her other remaining designer items. She insists that spending $500,000 designing the unique storage space, only to then fill it with fake handbags and jewels would make her 'the dumbest person in the world' and adds that the police and her insurance company have been provided with receipts proving the value - and authenticity - of the stolen items. Since the robbery, which took place while her home was undergoing renovations, Ms Roemer has increased her security in the hopes of preventing future incidents.","A burglar stole $1million worth of designer goods from Theresa Romer's closet in August, after seeing three-story space on Good Morning America .

"Last week the newly refurbished hotel opened its doors for the first time in over five years, after undergoing a multi-million dollar renovation and rebranding from the Ritz Carlton. Now it has been revealed that the InterContinental Sydney Double Bay is certainly keen to keep the exclusivity previously afforded to the hotel. And if Sydneysiders are hoping to grab a drink on it's stunning rooftop bar, there's a high price to pay. Scroll down for video . The rooftop bar at the newly refurbished InterContinental Double Bay in Sydney will charge patrons $250 just to enter the establishment . It features an infinity pool and cabana setting on the roof of the establishment (pictured is another of the hotel's pools) After midday on any given day each patron will have to pay $250 just to step through the doors of the exclusive watering hole, if they are not already a paying guest staying at the hotel. They are asked to swipe their credit card at reception, where they are given an access card to the rooftop bar. The bill is settled after the meal and the $250 price tag is in place as a minimum spend, rather than a fee on top of the price of any food or drinks consumed. InterContinental Double Bay confirmed the fee to Daily Mail Australia, and General Manager of the hotel Frederic Brohez told The Daily Telegraph that the space is designed to be luxurious. 'From noon to close, visitors can experience a variety of dining packages such as champagne and caviar or ­select their choice of dishes and beverages from the menu, with personalised service and a minimum spend on dining options,' he said. Although the fee is implemented as a minimum spend per person, the idea is to keep the bar exclusive . Drinks are available in the rooms for guests at the hotel, but on the roof start at around $14 . Drinks and food at the rooftop abode - which features a cabana setting and a spectacular infinity pool - start around the $14 mark. The menu ranges from simpler dishes such as salted caramel popcorn and an antipasto board to the signature dish of Osetra caviar - one of the most prized and expensive of its kind. In its previous life, the likes of Princess Diana, Madonna, Bill Clinton and Sir Elton John all graced the coveted rooms of what was the Ritz Carlton in Sydney's Double Bay. InterContinental Double Bay General Manager Frederic Brohez (left) said the space is designed to be exclusive . The hotel's Stillery gin bar is anticipated to be one of the city's hottest new haunts among celebrities . It was the hotel of choice for the stars in the nineties and the infamous final resting place of INXS frontman Michael Hutchence. The hotel still boasts 140 rooms, including 15 suites, with most opening out onto private balconies that offer sweeping views of Double Bay. The pinnacle of the hotel's dining options is Stockroom, headed by executive chef Julien Pouteau and the exclusive Stillery gin bar has also been restored. Special opening prices ranged from $390 per night for a classic room to a cool $5,000 for the upmarket Royal Suite.","After midday patrons must pay $250 just to access the rooftop bar .

"Missouri Governor .

Nixon said he would bring in police from around the state . and have the National Guard on stand-by for the grand jury . decision that is likely to come in mid to late November. The August shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by Darren Wilson . sparked weeks of street protests demonstrations and some groups . have threatened extensive protests if the officer is not charged . with a crime. Scroll down for video . Missouri Governor Jay Nixon (pictured on August 16) said on Tuesday that law enforcement officials have been working around the clock to make sure residents and businesses are kept safe once prosecutors announce whether a suburban St. Louis police officer will face charges for fatally shooting 18-year-old Michael Brown . 'That ugliness was not representative of Missouri and it . cannot be repeated,' Nixon said at a news conference. 'The National Guard has been and will continue to be part of . our contingency planning,' he said, adding that the state will . work to keep people safe. Rumors of an impending decision on the indictment have . flooded social media for days, prompting St. Louis County . Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch on Monday to reiterate his . expectation that the grand jury would not make a decision until . mid-to-late November. McCulloch, whose prosecutors have been presenting evidence . to the grand jury, said his office would advise the public when . a determination has been made .

Weeks of protests followed the August 9 shooting of Brown nd officials are trying to make sure things remain calm once the grand jury decision is announced. Nixon said looting and violence that marred mostly peaceful protests will not be tolerated. Nixon said that once the decision is announced, the state highway patrol will work with St. Louis County and city police as one unified command. The National Guard will also be available if needed. During the protests after the shooting, police donned riot gear and patrolled in armored vehicles, drawing widespread criticism and raising questions about a program that supplies surplus military equipment to local police departments. A small number of protesters in those first few days attacked squad cars, tossed molotov cocktails at officers and, in a few cases, shot guns in the direction of police and looted local businesses. Police responded with tear gas, smoke canisters and rubber bullets. On many nights, dozens were arrested. Severe: The world was shocked by the use of heavy weaponry and riot gear in response to the protests . Severe: Ranks of armed officers faced down protesters, who were buffeted with tear gas and stun grenades . St. Louis County police initially handled security, but criticism of their tactics prompted Nixon to put Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson in charge. He and other police leaders said the response was necessary to protect officers, protesters and the public. Some protest organizers fear police will be heavy-handed after the grand jury announcement. Ashley Yates of St. Louis, co-creator of the group Millennial Activists United noted that the vast majority of protests have been peaceful and said Nixon should focus on addressing the systemic problems faced by minority communities, ""not reactionary policing techniques."" It isn't just law enforcement getting ready for the announcement. Organizers of Yates' group and other protesters gathered Tuesday for training that includes how to take notes and shoot video of police actions on the streets. ""There is a significant effort to make sure that people's rights are protected and that there's no violence on either side,"" said Andy Stepanian, a spokesman for several protest groups.

"Her mother is a former top model, her father is a legendary property developer from Sydney's moneyed Eastern Suburbs and her half-brother is a confidante of Australia's most famous billionaire family, the Packers. Sophia Tilley, the young woman at the centre of the high-level corruption controversy gripping the country, has been portrayed just as the girlfriend of Stephen Wyllie, the son of top female crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen who is embroiled in the row. But the glamorous 25-year-old has serious connections with Australia's wealthy and social elite, and a family pedigree which means the Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry into her May car crash is the talk of the town. Scroll down for video . Well connected: Sophia Tilley, 25, (pictured at a Sydney court on Friday) the woman at the centre of the ICAC controversy embroiling star crown prosecutor, Margaret Cunneen, is the daughter of Eastern Suburbs property developer, Barry Tilley, and former top model, Georgia Riley .

Wealthy background: Sophia Tilley (pictured after she appeared in court on traffic infringements last Friday and had her driver's licence suspended) grew up in Sydney elite Eastern Suburbs, attending a private school . Ms Tilley is the daughter of 1970s model Georgia Riley and Sydney Eastern Suburbs property identity and developer, Barry Tilley. Mr Tilley and his former second wife, who is now known as Georgia Fuller, accompanied their daughter when she attended court on Friday to face traffic infringements amid the legal wrangle which has engulfed her, Mr Wyllie and the NSW Deputy chief Crown prosecutor, Ms Cunneen. Ms Tilley, who has a glamorous sister Olivia and several other siblings, is also the half-sister of Ben Tilley.

Ben Tilley, who was a school friend of Australian billionaire, James Packer, was also the gambling partner and confidante of James' late father, the legendary Kerry Packer. Tilley, a freakishly talented poker player and multi-millionaire who lives in the elite Sydney suburb of Point Piper with his socialite wife, Tiffany, once travelled the world with Kerry Packer, staying on his luxury yacht on the French Riviera every Australian winter. Ben is also an old school friend of Nine Network boss, David Gyngell. Sophia's two older half-brothers are financier Adam Tilley and businessman and former wine executive, Simon Tilley. Lives interrupted: Despite being the children of a prominent Sydney property developer and Australia's star female crown prosecutor, Sophia Tilley (above, left) and her boyfriend, Stephen Wyllei (above, right) flew under the radar until ICAC decided to investigate a car crash in which Ms Tilley was driving a vehicle belonging to Mr Wyllie's mother, Margaret Cunenen . Sophia Tilley, who lives in an apartment in the multi-million dollar high rise Horizon building, works as the executive sales and marketing co-ordinator for Laing & Simmons real estate agency in  exclusive Double Bay, in Sydney's east. Ms Tilley was relatively unknown outside Sydney's wealthy and connected affluent suburbs before the Independent Commission Against Corruption launched an inquiry into Margaret Cunneen two weeks ago. The inquiry centres on a the aftermath of a car accident on May 31 this year when Ms Tilley was driving Ms Cunneen's Ford Mondeo and was hit by another vehicle in Willoughby, on Sydney's north shore. Big connections: When Sophia Tilley was growing up her half-brother, Ben Tilley, who went to school with Packer family connection, now Channel Nine boss, David Gyngell (above, left), was flying around the world, playing poker with Australia's richest man, Kerry Packer (above, right) and staying on his luxury yacht in the French Riviera . In the accident, the Mondeo was knocked onto its side and Ms Tilley was trapped in her seat belt for some time and experienced chest pain, fearing that her breast implants may have been ruptured. After Ms Tilley was trapped in her seat belt, she telephoned Mr Wyllie and he and his father, Greg Wyllie, attended the scene. Ms Tilley was not at fault in the accident and a blood test conducted afterwards on her at Royal North Shore Hospital showed no alcohol in her system. However, two months after the accident ICAC investigators seized the mobile telephones of Ms Cunneen, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley in unannounced morning raids at their respective homes two months after the accident, on July 30.

Stephen Wyllie and Sophie Tilley (pictured together) have unwittingly become the subjects of an inquiry by the Independent Commission Against Corruption into a May 31 car crash involving Ms Tilley, who was not at fault, nor was she drink driving . In August, Ms Cunneen faced a private hearing over the allegations. ICAC made allegations that Ms Cunneen and Stephen Wyllie had coached Ms Tilley to fake chest pains to avoid a blood alcohol test. Ms Cunneen launched action in the NSW Supreme Court to halt the ICAC inquiry, which she has described as 'malicious' and inappropriately focussed on a personal matter in her private life. Justice Clifton Hoeben ruled on Friday that the inquiry could go ahead. On the same day, Ms Tilley faced the Downing Centre Local court over traffic infringements and had her driver's license suspended for two months. The ICAC inquiry has been postponed as Ms Cunneen launches an appeal, which will be heard next Tuesday, November 18 in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal.","Sophia Tilley is the glamorous 25-year-old at the centre of the ICAC inquiry .

"An internet pirate who set up a music sharing website which cost industry bosses more than £240 million has been jailed. Kane Robinson, 26, of Wyndham Way, North Shields in North Tyneside founded dancingjesus.com, a website which attracted more than 70 million users and allowed them to listen to almost any song or album before its release date. The website boasted it was unrivalled in providing unreleased material from artists such as Adele, Kanye West and the Arctic Monkeys. Kane Robinson (pictured) has been jailed after admitting two offences related to his illegal music website . Despite Robinson's efforts to remain anonymous, a joint enterprise by British Phonographic investigators, City of London police and US authorities - including Homeland security - managed to obtain court orders to find out who had registered the site's domain name. A court has heard Robinson was also behind a similar music service site called CHOONZM8 which was linked to his Facebook profile page. The court heard during the 2006 to 2011 existence of dancingjesus.com it contained almost every recording released by the music industry and had a catalogue of more than a quarter of a million tracks. Newcastle Crown Court was told what little money Robinson made from the illegal enterprise was spent on upkeep of the site and his main motivation was the 'kudos' of releasing music first. Robinson admitted two offences under the Copyright Act and was jailed for 32 months. Contributor Richard Graham, 22, of Station Road, Leicester, who shared thousands of illegal songs on the site, admitted similar offences and was jailed for 21 months. Judge Deborah Sherwin said: 'It is easy to think of activities such as this as victimless crime but I have seen evidence that it is far from being the case. Robinson admitted two offences under the Copyright Act and was jailed for 32 months at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) 'The music industry in the UK loses around a billion pounds per annum.This effects the industry's ability to find and promote new artists. 'Existing artists are deprived of royalties and while some may be wealthy and successful, many are not so and struggle to earn a living.' Industry experts claim the site cost the music industry an estimated £242 million in losses. Prosecutor David Groome told the court dancingjesus.com was an internet forum where users logged in to share, discuss and request music they wanted to hear. Users would click on a link where they could get free songs on slow download or pay for fast speed. Singer Adele (pictured) was one of the artists who had unreleased material leaked on the website . Mr Groome said: 'Dancingjesus.com had singles and albums prior to the official release dates and claimed to be unrivalled in that. 'It was perceived by the industry as presenting a real and serious threat to their economic interests. 'In 2010 and 2011, out of the best selling 50 singles worldwide, 46 were leaked first via the dancingjesus.com website.' Robinson admitted what he had been doing when police raided his home and shut down the site in 2011. Defence barristers said both men work hard in legitimate jobs and were very young during the illegal internet activities. The Director of BPI's Copyright Protection Unit, David Wood, said: 'Today's sentencing sends a clear message to the operators and users of illegal music sites that online piracy is a criminal activity that will not be tolerated by law enforcement in the UK or overseas. 'Piracy - particularly pre-release - can make or break an artist's career, and can determine whether a record label is able to invest in that crucial second or third album. 'In this day and age with so many quality digital music services available offering access to millions of tracks through free and premium tiers, there is no good reason to use pirate sites that give nothing back to artists and offer a sub-standard experience for consumers. 'Speaking as a music fan, it just doesn't make sense to help criminals when you can support artists.' Jeremy Banks, IFPI Director of Anti-Piracy, added: 'This case is an excellent example of law enforcement agencies cooperating to tackle online criminal activity, which has a real impact on record companies and their ability to invest in artists. 'The illegal uploading of pre-release music can have a potentially devastating impact on the commercial success of an artist, making it more difficult for them to maintain a career in music. 'I would like to thank the authorities in the UK and the US for their work in resolving this case.' Huw Watkins, Head of the Intellectual Property Office Intelligence Hub, said: 'The IPO is committed to supporting rights holders in enforcing IP rights and this sentence shows how seriously the court takes such activity. 'This case demonstrates how successful intelligence and enforcement agencies working in partnership can be in stopping IP infringement.'","Kane Robinson, 26, founded illegal music site dancingjesus.com .

However, this can continue even when a number is switched to an Android phone, without access to the service, meaning if anyone sends an iMessage to that number it doesn't get converted to a text, and ultimately ends up lost in the ether. When a person registers an iPhone, their number is typically linked to iMessage. When they then swap to a new device, these messages are not always converted to text, and become lost. The tool (pictured) lets previous iPhone owners enter their phone number to deregister it from the service . If you still have the iPhone you were using before you switched, transfer your SIM card temporarily back into the iOS device. Make sure the phone is connected to a network. Click Settings, Messages and turn iMessage off. If you no longer have the iPhone, open Apple's new tool. Select the correct country from the drop-down menu and type in the number. Click 'Send code'. Enter the six-digit code that is sent to that number into the box below, and select Submit. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California said Apple must face plaintiff Adrienne Moore's claim that the message blocking interfered with her contract with Verizon Wireless for wireless service, which she kept after switching in April to a Samsung  Galaxy S5 from an iPhone 4. Moore, who seeks class-action status and unspecified damages, claimed that Apple failed to disclose how its iOS 5 software operating system would obstruct the delivery of 'countless' messages from other Apple device users if iPhone users switched to non-Apple devices. In a Monday night decision, Koh said Moore deserved a chance to show Apple disrupted her wireless service contract and violated a California unfair competition law, by blocking messages meant for her. 'Plaintiff does not have to allege an absolute right to receive every text message in order to allege that Apple's intentional acts have caused an actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship,' Koh wrote. The judge also dismissed some claims tied to another California consumer protection law. Apple did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment. Roy Katriel, a lawyer for Moore, did not immediately respond to similar requests. In court papers, Apple said it never claimed that its iMessage service and Messages application, which ran with iOS 5, would recognize when iPhone users switched to rival devices. 'Apple takes customer satisfaction extremely seriously, but the law does not provide a remedy when, as here, technology simply does not function as plaintiff subjectively believes it should,' the Cupertino, California-based company said. Earlier this week Apple released a tool that will help people deregister their number from iMessage, or disable the service, to stop this from happening. The tool, first spotted by a Reddit user, lets current or previous iPhone owners enter their phone number to deregister it from iMessage. They are then sent a six-digit code to confirm they want to remove it. Alternatively, people who still own an iPhone and are selling it, or want to simply switch the service off, can click Settings, Messages and Turn iMessage off. When purchasing an iPhone, a number is typically linked to the firm's iMessage service upon registration. When a message is sent between enabled iOS devices, Apple sends it as an iMessage - rather than as a text. iMessages are sent using a web connection, rather than a network connection. But, when a person switches their number to a new phone, such as an Android, that particular number can remain linked to iMessage. When an iOS user then sends that mobile number a message, Apple can end up routing it through its web service. But without access to iMessages, the recipient doesn't receive it unless the sender resends it as a text. Previously, the only solution was to deregister the old device completely from their Apple accounts. The bug can also affect iPads that have a 3G connection and use a number. In May, Apple said it was addressing bugs within its iMessaging system that caused text messages to become lost when the recipient switched to a non-Apple phone. Alternatively, people who still own an iPhone and are selling it, or want to simply switch the service off, can click Settings, Messages and Turn iMessage off. iMessages are sent using a web connection, rather than a network connection. But, when a person switches their number to a new phone that number can remain linked . But one disgruntled customer was so annoyed about missing messages, she filed a lawsuit against the firm. Adrienne Moore claimed the company failed to disclose its knowledge of the problem. The issue does not appear to affect all previous iPhone users, but Apple issued a statement that it had 'fixed a server-side iMessage bug which was causing an issue for some users,' and was working on an additional fix for future software updates. This latest tool offers such a fix.","When a person registers an iPhone, their number is linked to iMessage .
This means that when someone messages from another iPhone, they receive it as an iMessage rather than a text .
If a person switches their number to a non-Apple phone, it can remain linked .

"Four British languages are under threat of extinction, unless drastic measures are taken to preserve them. A new map, showing Europe's 'endangered list' of languages, has highlighted the minority tongues that are most likely to disappear in the UK. Jersey French, Guernsey French, Manx and Cornish are all under threat, with numbers of people who speak them seriously dwindling. Cornwall, where Cornish has been listed critically endangered with just 574 speakers . The latter two's situation is most perilous, with both being listed as 'critically endangered,' while Jersey French and Guernsey French are considered 'severely endangered', according to a detailed study by Dr Christopher Moseley at the UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies. One travel website has worked with Dr Moseley to create a map of Europe showing where the most critically-endangered languages are spoken in a bid to encourage visitors to go and explore the areas. Based on data from the Unesco Languages in Danger project, launched in 1993, the study found 90 per cent of the 250 languages spoken in Europe are endangered and that by the end of the century over half of the languages in the world will be extinct. Of the 24 critically and severely endangered languages on the European infographic, Livonian in Latvia, has no first-language speakers left - just 40-50 second-language speakers. Livonian is spoken in a medieval town with a population of just 1,682, and the last first-language speaker of the language, Grizelda Kristina died last year at the age of 103. Ter Sami is the most easterly of all the endangered Sami dialects (spoken by the Sami people, traditionally known in English as Laplanders). And, the unusual language of Gottscheerisch, a language which, despite its Slovenian origins, is still spoken by a small community in Queens, New York, also makes it onto the European list. Four UK languages have been placed on the 'endangered list', but could be revived with the help of tourism . Naren Shaam, CEO of GoEuro, said: 'Ethical tourism has been practised for many years and is typically associated with travelling to far-flung parts of the globe, but we are hoping that this linguistic interpretation of the idea – allowing people to choose to directly benefit regions in which centuries-old languages are on the cusp of extinction – will allow tourists to have unique cultural experiences much closer to home. 'We certainly hope the information that we are providing to users will encourage more tourism to these often under-explored Continental destinations, and contribute to the preservation of Europe’s endangered languages.' The company has posted a blog online to help travellers plan visits to some of the remote outposts where the endangered languages are spoken in a bid to encourage tourism to the areas. There are believed to be 1,700 Manx speakers left, and more worryingly only 574 Cornish speakers. Guernsey French has 1,327 speakers, while Jersey French has around 2,000. However, the outlook is most hopeful for Cornish and Manx, with an organised approach to teaching the two languages in schools to keep them alive. 'It was an uphill battle because Manx had reached the point where the last first-language speaker died in 1974. Since then they've been running classes and they have a school,' said Dr Moseley.","Jersey French, Guernsey French, Manx and Cornish all at risk .
But researcher believes tourism can help revitalise languages .

"A prisoner has escaped from a minimum-security prison in Victoria and remains to be on the run from police, who suspect he may have left with a woman believed to be his partner. Stuart Holmes, 35, absconded from Dhurringile Prison, 160 km north of Melbourne, in Northern Victoria at approximately 3.30pm on Monday. Police now want to speak with a woman named Kelly Doolan or Kelly Macdonald, and believe the pair were riding in a 2003 silver Nissan Pulsar with registration SKO-268. The incident joins a string of escapes from the prison-farm this year, sparking concerns among the surrounding communities that the facility needs to improve its security. Stuart Holmes, 35, absconded from Dhurringile Prison in Northern Victoria at approximately 3.30pm on Monday . Kelly Macdonald, who is wanted for questioning by police regarding the escape of Mr Holmes, and is believed to have picked him up in a 2003 silver Nissan Pulsar . Victorian police are currently scouring the surrounding areas to find Mr Holmes. Investigators have released photographs and a description of the prisoner, who they said is ‘of Pacific Islander appearance and around 178cm tall with a solid build, brown eyes and short cropped greying hair.’ Mr Holmes is believed to have last been seen wearing prison greens, and may have escaped the area in a car. Ms Macdonald is believed to be a 37-year-old from Benalla, and is described as Causcasian, 157cm tall with brown eyes and long blonde hair. Durringhale Prison, a minimum security prison farm, is currently undergoing a government expansion program, including a growth in the prisoners being housed there, which is believed to be behind the rise in escapes. Daily Mail Australia has learned the majority of recent escaped prisoners have left during times of romantic or familial complications, and apart from Mr Holmes, all of the escaped prisoners have been apprehended. There is believed to have been 10 escapees in the past 14 months. On April 30, the regional Director of the Justice Department addressed Dhurringile residents amidst growing concerns. He assured the community that the type of prisoners being accepted into the facility, whom are classified as low risk, have not changed in their risk grading. In August, 20 restricted minimum security inmates were transferred from Dhurringile to Loddon Prison in central Victoria after fears of the rising rates of escapees. Mr Holmes escape joins a string of similar incidents from the Dhurringal Prison this year, sparking concerns amongst the surrounding communities that the facility needs to improve its security . From left to right: Say Hour,Singh Vikramjit , and Matthew James Boland, all of whom have escaped Dhurringale since January . Mr Edward O'Donohue, the Victorian Minister of Corrections, said the department will wait for police to apprehend Mr Holmes . Many locals have voiced their concern over the topic. Frank Niglia, a resident of Dhurringile, told Daily Mail Australia: . ‘The community is very concerned. There has been a direct correlation between the increase in prisoners and the increase in escapes. Both have been steadily rising over the past decade,’ he said. ‘We’re meeting with the prison regularly, and submitted a review several months ago to look at the rise in escapes. We are meeting with the Minister for Corrections later this month.’ A spokesperson for Mr Edward O'Donohue, the Victorian Minister of Corrections, said 'Occasionally an offender will abscond. They are always caught and, when they are, they go straight back to medium or maximum security prisons and serve extra time if the courts order it.' 'In this case, residents were informed immediately under the system implemented this year through discussions with the Department of Justice,' Mr O'Donohue said. 'We will now wait for Victoria Police to do the job of finding and apprehending this offender.' Victorian Police have said there is still no sign or Mr Holmes at the time of publication.","Stuart Holmes escaped from Dhurringile prison in Victoria on Monday .

"For the last ten years, Sarah Wulchak has been one very busy woman - and her sad decline and radical physical transformation is illustrated in 23 mugshots from her arrests over 10 years. From grand theft auto to trespass and aggravated battery, the 34-year-old woman from DeLand, Florida, has managed to be arrested 23 times since 2003 - all in Volusia County. In her first mugshot taken in 2003, she appears with glasses and relatively healthy looking, but ten years later is as shadow of her former self. While many of her charges are common misdemeanors, Wulchak made headlines in January 2013 after she allegedly bit off a chunk of her boyfriends ear, according to WPBF.com. Her boyfriend, Steve Bolin, 53, called police and said Wulchak had attacked him in his bedroom. Familiar face: Sarah Wulchak, 34, has been arrested 23 times since 2003.

According to deputies at the time, Bolin was eating a bowl of spaghetti at his home in DeLand when an argument started. When the argument turned physical, Bolin said he retreated to his room, however Wulchak came after him and jumped on his back. Bolin stated he felt a sharp pain in his left ear and tried to pull away, hitting Wulchak as he tired to pull away. After the altercation she assessed his injuries and notices the top of his ear was missing and he had severe scratches to his face, deputies said. Wulchak was arrested at a local hotel where she had gone after the fight. 2010: Sarah Wulchak was arrested six times in 2010 alone, at the age of 29, her face almost unrecognizable from the young woman captured in her first mugshots . June 25, 2013 . Most recent: December 5, 2013 . She has been arrested four more times following the ear-biting incident. In February, she was arrested for allegedly possessing paraphernalia. In June, she was arrested on a battery charge. In September, she was accused of domestic battery and in December she was hit with another battery charge. It seems 2010 was her busiest year however, with six arrests in 12 months. Wulchak's arrest records show she has been charged with grand theft four times, three of which involved motor vehicles. She has also been arrested with trespass after warning and aggravated battery. Many of her charges are still pending.","Sarah Wulchak, 34, of DeLand, Florida, has been arrested 23 times .

"From furniture and food to fine art, members of the Obama administration received thousands of dollars in gifts from foreign leaders, but first lady Michelle Obama appears to have received the most expensive gift last year. The State Department reported Tuesday that the queen of Brunei gave Mrs Obama jewelry worth $71,468 in 2013. The flower-shaped white gold earrings, ring and necklace were studded with yellow sapphires and diamonds, according to the department's annual accounting of gifts published in the Federal Register. Under federal ethics rules, the presents must be turned over to the government for storage or official use unless the recipient chooses to purchase the items from the General Services Administration. Few choose to do so. One person who kept a gift was former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, according to the list. Clinton was so taken with a black two-strand pearl necklace with gemstones given to her by Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi that she bought it for $970. Scroll down for video . Generous: The queen of Brunei, Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Hajah Saleha, gave Mrs. Obama jewelry worth $71,468. The Obamas are seen with the queen and Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah in this file photo . Luxury: The jewelry  given to Mrs. Obama is almost seven times more valuable than the most expensive gift for her husband, a  sculpture of a falcon on a branch worth $10,400 from Qatar's ambassador to the U.S . Baubles: Clinton was so taken with a black two-strand pearl necklace with gemstones given to her by Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi that she bought it for $970 (September 2012 file photo) Gift giver:  Aung San Suu Kyi is seen with Clinton in this November 2012 file photo . That necklace was presented to her in 2012 while Clinton was still in government, but was recorded in the accounting of 2013 gifts because the State Department's Office of Protocol, which compiles the list, did not have the information in time to include it in the earlier report. Teresa Heinz Kerry, wife of current Secretary of State John Kerry, similarly purchased a silver and coral jewelry set presented to her by the president of Yemen for $425, according to the list. Mrs. Obama's necklace was almost seven times more valuable than the most expensive gift received by President Barack Obama, a glass amber-colored sculpture of a falcon on a branch worth $10,400 from Qatar's ambassador to the U.S. Not that the president fared poorly. He also received a large Azerbaijani rug with red, white and blue geometric designs worth $6,560 from the ambassador of Azerbaijan; a silver platter engraved with major world cities, their global positioning coordinates and distance from Qatar from that country's emir, valued at $6,500; a full felt-mounted zebra skin, a painting and sculpture worth $4,000 from the president of Tanzania; and a $4,000 brown upholstered chair from the prime minister of Singapore, according to the records. All smiles: Pope Francis and Obama gave one another presents in March 2014 . Gift: Members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Nation presented Obama with a gift in June 2014 . Present: In March 2013 Obama got a present at the Church of the Nativity during a meeting with Greek Orthodox Patriarch Theopilos III . Diplomatic gifts are often chosen for their symbolism and rarely for their monetary value, something evident from the 2013 report. Amid tensions with Israel even as Obama visited the country in 2013, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented Obama with a display case containing a tiny engraved chip with side-by-side texts of the U.S. and Israeli declarations of independence affixed to a Jerusalem stone. The gift, which included a magnifying viewpiece, was valued at $2,700. On the same trip, Israeli President Shimon Peres gave Obama a clock depicting U.S. and Israel time and temperatures worth $835, along with several books, including a leather-bound Hebrew translation of Obama's 'Dreams from My Father' memoir, valued at $1,045. Friendly greeting: Obama is seen with the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani in this April 2013 file photo.  Obama's most expensive gift was a sculpture of a falcon  worth $10,400 from Qatar's ambassador to the U.S . Treasure: Obama takes off a gift of a gold necklace called the King Abdul Aziz Order of Merit, the country's highest honor, for safekeeping after it was given to him by Saudi King Abdullah (June 2009 file photo) Not to be outdone, perhaps, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas gave the president a painting juxtaposing Obama and President Abraham Lincoln, a photo album of Obama's visit to the West Bank and a photograph of Palestinian-American veterans marching in a Chicago parade along with manger scene carved in olive wood. Those gifts were valued at $414. The rift between the United States and Russia over Ukraine was not yet in full swing in 2013, and Russian President Vladimir Putin gave Obama and his family a porcelain espresso and tea cup sets along with a set of porcelain plates depicting scenes in Russian cities worth about $1,500. The president of Zanzibar went for the personal, giving Obama a wooden chest containing 20 green kente cloths, 21 blue kente cloths and 20 white baseball caps, all emblazoned with Obama's image. Those, along with 19 black hats, 18 navy and 10 white polo shirts, and several decorative cloths were valued at $1,926.","The queen of Brunei gave Mrs. Obama jewelry worth $71,468 in 2013, the State Department reported Tuesday .

"A wanted man who taunted detectives by posting a series of selfies online showing him outside police stations and next to marked cars has been arrested after two weeks on the run. Aaron Bee, 22, mocked Lincolnshire Police's attempts to track him down after the force revealed he was wanted in connection with an assault and domestic violence. The father of one, from Lincoln, goaded the force by posting a series of taunting selfies on Facebook captioned with 'catch me if you can'. He also bragged that he 'always liked playing hide and seek.' Aaron Bee, 22, mocked Lincolnshire Police's attempts to track him down by posting a number of selfies on Facebook showing him outside various police stations in the county with captions such as 'catch me if you can' The 22-year-old, wanted in connection with an assault and domestic violence, posted pictures of himself outside five different police stations including Lincoln (above) during his time on the run from detectives . Since Lincolnshire Police announced officers were hunting Bee on October 29, he has visited five police stations across the county and posted photographs of himself outside each one online. In one status update to his 1,635 friends, he wrote: 'Just a quick selfie outside Lincoln police station '£theystillcarntcatchme (sic)'. In another, he uploaded an image taken from a car window of a female officer standing by a roadside with the caption: 'Hello is it me your looking for (sic)'. Additional pictures uploaded include Bee standing next to a police van with the heading 'my new motor haha' and another one of him stood outside Lincolnshire Police's headquarters. However, officers revealed today that they had finally caught up with Bee and arrested him at a cafe in Lincoln after almost two weeks of looking for him. A spokesman for the force said: 'A 22-year-old Lincoln man wanted in connection with domestic violence and assault has been arrested. Bee took to social media after Lincolnshire Police launched a bid to find him on October 29, saying he 'always liked playing hide and seek'. He later joked that the authorities' efforts to track him down were 'fun and games' In one status update, he posted a picture of himself next to a police car with the caption: 'My new motor haha' In another, he could be seen stood posing outside Lincolnshire Police's headquarters in the dark . In his most recent status update, prior to his arrest, Bee said he had walked into Tesco and bought some food . 'He is currently in police custody and will be questioned by officers concerning an assault and an incident of domestic violence which occurred in October in the Lincoln area.' In his latest post, just hours before he was caught, Bee had bragged: 'To say I am that WANTED I have just walked into Tesco to buy a doughnut and to buy some new bits for rabbit hutch carnt be that wanted surely lmao (sic).' Lincolnshire Police launched their appeal to find Bee a fortnight ago and released his mugshot in an attempt to get the public to help with their hunt. But, Bee took to social media to mock the force's attempts to trace him and branded the pursuit as 'fun and games'. Speaking last week, he said: 'I did it because it's funny. It's just a bit of fun really. 'If I got one message for them it's still very much catch me if you can.

"Tributes have poured in for the Bahamas' most famous minister after he was killed along with eight others when his private jet crashed. Dr Myles Munroe died in the accident, believed to have been caused by turbulent weather. He was traveling in the Lear 36 Executive Jet with his wife Ruth and several members of their Evangelical congregation to Grand Bahama to attend the 2014 Global Leadership Forum that he organized. Final picture: Dr Myles Munroe, left of center in a gray jacket, poses with his wife, second left, and members of their congregation. The picture was taken two years ago . But as the pilot attempted to land in Freeport, the craft careered into a shipping container crane, killing everyone on board. Foreign Minister Fred Mitchell said that a commercial Bahamasair flight making the same route, from Nassau to Freeport, at the same time had turned back because it was unable to land. Civil aviation authorities launched an investigation on Monday. The death of Munroe, one of the most prominent pastors in predominantly Christian Bahamas, stunned the country. 'It is utterly impossible to measure the magnitude of Dr. Munroe's loss to the Bahamas and to the world,' Prime Minister Perry Christie said. 'He was indisputably one of the most globally recognizable religious figures our nation has ever produced.' Born in 1954 in the islands' capital of Nassau, Munroe founded Bahamas Faith Ministries International in the early 1980s after studying at Oral Roberts University, a Christian liberal arts school in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Preacher and his wife: Dr Myles Munroe and his wife Ruth were killed in a plane crash in Grand Bahama. The plane crashed while making an approach for landing at Grand Bahama International Airport . Wreckage: The crash took place on Sunday afternoon and killed all nine people on board the private jet. The plane  struck a crane at the Grand Bahama Ship Yard, exploding on impact and crashing into the ground near a junkyard area . Stunned: The Department of Civil Aviation reported that the plane was a Lear 36 executive jet which departed the Lynden Pindling International Airport (LPIA) for the Grand Bahama International Airport . Life's work: Monroe, 60, was president and founder of Bahamas Faith Ministries International and was traveling to Grand Bahamas to attend the 2014 Global Leadership Forum . In shock Tearful mourners gathered at Bahamas Faith Ministries last night soon after they learned that Dr Myles Munroe died in a plane crash on Grand Bahama with eight others yesterday . The charismatic pastor quickly became an influential religious leader among many evangelical Christians, giving sermons around the world and occasionally appearing on televangelist Benny Hinn's popular programs. He was also a motivational speaker and the author of numerous books, including the 2008 best-seller 'God's Big Idea: Reclaiming God's Original Purpose for Your Life.' As news of the plane crash spread, members of his church were shown weeping on a Bahamas TV station or raising their hands in prayer. Fellow Christian pastors expressed shock. 'At times like these, I don't try to figure things out, I just know that all things ultimately figure into a larger and higher purpose that we may never fully understand in this present limited reality,' Bishop Carlton Pearson, a high-profile U.S. minister who was a friend of Munroe's for 40 years, wrote on his Facebook page. Well-known: Dr. Myles Munroe, a prominent pastor, and his wife, Ruth, were among those killed in the crash. Munroe was the founder of Bahamas Faith Ministries International Fellowship which has extended from the shores of the Bahamas to Africa and Asia . Personality: Dr Munroe is a well-known author and motivational speaker who visited various African countries. Tough conditions: Heavy rain was buffeting the region when the Lear 36 Executive Jet struck a shipping container crane in Freeport on landing . Munroe, 60, and his entourage were traveling to Grand Bahama to attend the 2014 Global Leadership Forum that he organized. He planned to have dinner in Freeport about 90 minutes after his plane's scheduling landing with former United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young, a speaker at the event, Mitchell said. Munroe's wife, Ruth, was also on the plane, along with the pastor considered second-in-command at Bahamas Faith Ministries, Richard Pinder, as well as the group's youth minister and his wife and child. Munroe, who grew up poor in the Bahamas, was considered an inspiration for many people in the island chain and abroad, the foreign minister said. 'He has really put his name on the world stage and helped the Bahamas achieve recognition for talent,' the foreign minister said. 'He was a leader in our country,' said Christopher Duncan. 'He spoke at a number of national events. I've read some of his books. Just the way he viewed life and the way he understood God's purpose for our lives made you look at life a different way.' 'Dr. Munroe was a spiritual fiber of our country,' added Monique Dorsett, who lives in the Bahamas but is vacationing in Miami. 'He epitomized Christianity and the way he lived. He was international .'

Daniel Ek said in an open letter that while he agrees with Swift's belief that music is art and has real value, he was upset with how her comments made it seem as if his service does not compensate artists. He then stated that Spotify has 'paid more than $2billion to labels, publishers and collecting societies for distribution to songwriters and recording artists.' Scroll down for video .

'Taylor Swift is absolutely right: music is art, art has real value, and artists deserve to be paid for it,' Ek starts off his letter. 'We started Spotify because we love music and piracy was killing it.' Ek then points out that it is piracy that is ruining music and hurting musicians, and that no one has made any money at all from piracy, while Spotify has paid out the aforementioned $2billion to members of the music industry. He then goes into his problem with the artists who complain about his service. 'When I hear stories about artists and songwriters who say they’ve seen little or no money from streaming and are naturally angry and frustrated, I’m really frustrated too,' he says. 'As I said, we’ve already paid more than $2 billion in royalties to the music industry and if that money is not flowing to the creative community in a timely and transparent way, that’s a big problem.' He then breaks down some of the myths people believe to be true, like the fact that artists don't really get paid by services like Spotify. 'Unlike other free music options – from piracy to YouTube to SoundCloud – we pay artists and rights holders every time a song is played on our free service,' he explains. Record numbers: Ek (left) says his service has paid $2billion to the music industry since its start, and that the real enemy to musicians like Swift (right) is piracy . He then takes on the claim that no artist could ever earn a living from their music playing on Spotify because they pay so little per play, comparing his service to radio. 'If a song has been listened to 500 thousand times on Spotify, that’s the same as it having been played once on a U.S. radio station with a moderate sized audience of 500 thousand people. Which would pay the recording artist precisely … nothing at all. But the equivalent of that one play and it’s 500 thousand listens on Spotify would pay out between three and four thousand dollars.' Ek then shades Swift a bit by listing the artists who have successfully promoted their albums on Spotify before their release, including her pal Ed Sheeran and diva pop star Ariana Grande, and pointing out that the most pirated album in the world last week was Swift's newest release, 1989. Despite those piracy numbers, Swift did still manage to shatter single week sales records when she moved 1.3 million copies of the album in its debut week, the most since 2002. Wait a minute: major artists like Adele (left) and Beyonce (right) have withheld new music from the streaming service for months after its release . Ek closes his letter by saying of Spotify, 'We’re not just streaming, we’re mainstreaming now, and that’s good for music makers and music lovers around the world.' Swift is not the first artist to withhold music from Spotify, with big name artists including Adele and Beyonce waiting months to release their albums in full to the service. Other artists have been more vocal about their dislike for the way the site operates, including Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke who took Spotify to task over their business model. Yorke wrote on Twitter, 'Make no mistake, new artists you discover on Spotify will not get paid. Meanwhile shareholders will shortly be rolling in it. Simples' He then added in another tweet, 'New artists get paid fu*k all with this model.' Angry bird: Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke (left) has expressed his disdain for the service and how it does not help new artists, while investor Sean Parker (right) was called an 'a**hole"" and a 'thief' by Black Keys singer Patrick Carney . Black Keys frontman Patrick Carney also voiced his disdain for the service, and one of its original investors, infamous tech entrepreneur and Napster founder Sean Parker, who he labeled an 'a**hole.' 'That guy has $2 billion that he made from figuring out ways to steal royalties from artists, and that’s the bottom line,' said Carney. 'You can’t really trust anybody like that.'","Daniel Ek, the CEO of Spotify, has written an open letter about his streaming service and the refusal of Taylor Swift to let them use any of her albums .
Ek says he is 'really frustrated' with artists like Swift, and reveals Spotify has paid out $2billion to members of the music industry .
He adds that the real enemy of artists is piracy, and said Spotify has actually been a tool for people like Swift's pal Ed Sheeran to promote new work .

"Mo Farah dealt the Commonwealth Games a significant blow on Thursday by withdrawing just three days before he was due to attempt a 5,000 and 10,000 metres double. The world and Olympic champion’s ‘tough decision’ was hardly a surprise, given Farah spent two days in hospital with abdominal pains only three weeks ago and missed a substantial block of training, but his timing left fans and Games organisers disappointed.

Farah’s withdrawal is another setback for Team England’s chances of success at Hampden Park. Katarina Johnson-Thompson, the favourite for  heptathlon gold in the absence of new mother Jessica Ennis-Hill, has been forced to pull out with a left foot injury and world 400m champion Christine Ohuruogu only runs in the 4x400m relay. Farah’s withdrawal means that, of the three athletes who won Olympic gold on ‘Super Saturday’ at London 2012, only long jumper Greg Rutherford is here. Glasgow 2014 chief executive, David Grevemberg, said: ‘There’s no question we’re disappointed that Mo Farah announced he would be withdrawing. We’re very disappointed for Mo. We knew how much he wanted to be here. ‘I’m sure there will be some  disappointed people, but there are plenty of great athletes here.’ Farah, 31, has opted to stay at his training base at altitude in Font Romeu in France, rather than travel to Glasgow, after finally deciding on Wednesday night he is not in good enough shape. It is understood he considered forfeiting the 5,000m on Sunday to give him five days’ extra recovery for the 10,000m on Friday, but  ultimately opted to sidestep  the Games altogether after  discussions with his coach, Alberto Salazar, and British Athletics  performance director Neil Black. Farah said in a statement: ‘I  have taken the tough decision to  withdraw from the Commonwealth Games. The sickness I had two weeks ago was a big setback for me.

"An investment banker in the middle over a very public divorce with his wife that included claims of drug use and sexual promiscuity has settled out of court for a very pricey sum. Sage Kelly, a $7 million-a-year Manhattan banker who worked at Jefferies & Co., settled with his wife Christina for an undisclosed amount of money. The settlement also includes joint custody of the couples two daughters, 10-year-old Cameron and 6-year-old Logan. Moving on: Sage Kelly has settled his divorce with wife Christina (above with their two daughters) out of court for a very pricey, and undisclosed, sum . Reunited: As past of the settlement agreement, the couple will share joint custody of their two daughters (above) Speaking with the New York Post, Christina said, 'I’m thrilled, thrilled to have had this resolved.' She then added, 'This was never about the money, I just wanted joint custody of my children.' Sage's lifestyle became very public knowledge in October when Christina’s 26-page affidavit in their divorce was made public, which described in detail her husband's alleged cocaine use and sexual hijinks. At one point Christina, 39, graphically detailed a cocaine-fueled foursome she and Sage had with the head of Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Marc Beer, and his girlfriend at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston. Christina said Sage wanted her involved to get Beer's business for his company, and that she engaged with both Beer and his girlfriend in sexual activity. Battling spouses: Christina counter-sued Sage in August of this year after he won full custody of their daughters when he filmed her doing cocaine in the Manhattan apartment . Revenge affidavit: Christina filed a 26-page affidavit accusing her husband of sexual promiscuity and rampant drug use . Getting dragged in: Christina claimed she and Sage had a cocaine-fuled foursome with pharemcutical big wig Marc Beer (left) and his girlfriend, and that Sage's boss at Jefferies, Ben Lorello (right), used cocaine . In her affidavit Christina also claims that Sage slept with the wife of a coworker while her husband was sleeping in their guest bedroom and that he hosted a Mushroom Day at their swanky Sag Harbor vacation home, where guests all ingested the hallucinogenic fungi. Christina also accused a number of Sage's friends, including his boss at Jefferies, Ben Lorello, of using cocaine. Sage, 42, who has denied all of his wife's allegations, would not comment on the divorce settlement. He did previously admit that he and his wife had used drugs 'at certain social events in the past,'  but stated 'the Wolf of Wall Street tale [Christina] tells this court is a work of fiction.' Christina has had her own problems with the law, having been caught on video inside the couple's house doing cocaine just this past July and being charged with felony DWI and endangering the welfare of a child after she crashed her Range Rover into a telephone pole in May 2010 while her two young daughters were in the backseat. Shattered past: Christina admits now that she has a drug and alcohol problem that she is working on, having been charged with DWI in 2010 (mugshot on left) while he daughters were in the car, while Sage claims his wife's affidavit is a work of 'fiction' Because of this, Sage won custody of their two daughters, which led his wife to counter-sue and her affidavit to become public. Now it seems that both parties are ready to move on and enjoy a more private life. Said Christina, 'I’d like to put this behind us and move forward with a new chapter in my life as Christina di Mauro.' A source close to the case also revealed that Christina said in a statement that Sage is 'a great father who greatly loves our children' and that the two are 'both fully committed to co-parenting our children.' Christina also apologized to those who had been affected by this very public battle, specifically 'those at Jefferies and those associated with Jefferies.' She also said this 'amicable' settlement 'ensures loving homes for our children.'","Sage Kelly, the $7million-a-year head of health care investment at Jefferies & Co. in New York City, has settled his pricey divorce out of court .

"As the gears start to turn on his wife's potential 2016 campaign for the White House,  Bill Clinton seems more interested in new baby granddaughter Charlotte Clinton-Mezvinsky than more politics. The former president was more than happy to dish about life as a grandfather during an appearance on the Ellen Show on Tuesday, talking in detail about how it's been 'a hoot' to watch baby Charlotte grow in the last six weeks. 'It's amazing,' Clinton said. 'Hillary and I only have one child and she's quite wonderful, but it's been a long time since she's been that age.' 'It's just a joyful experience. I love it.

"Jack Wilshere has been full of praise for Mario Balotelli ahead of England's World Cup opener against Italy on Saturday. However, despite describing Balotelli as a great player, Wilshere is confident England's defensive players will be able to cope with the Italy frontman.

"In most communities around the world, goddesses are symbolic of a spiritual world. But in Nepal, these sacred females live and breathe. Handpicked from birth, these pre-pubescent girls are known as Kumaris and are believed to be incarnations of . the Hindu Goddess of Power, Kali. From the moment they are chosen for their role, and pass a rigorous 32-stage test, these living goddesses are propelled to immortal-like status, deemed to be protectors from evil by thousands of adoring Hindus and Buddhists. But for these girls, it is not just a name and status that they are given - their whole life changes. Kumaris - which means virgin in Nepalese - are forced to leave their homes and are hidden away in temples as a living deity, only able to leave when they are required at festivals and processions as the subject of worship. These Kumaris are even considered too special to walk, instead being carried in chariots, thrones and other people's arms - sometimes meaning they do not learn to walk until they retire. And the girls are banned from going to school or taking part in day-to-day society, only appearing outside their homes or temples up to 13 times a year. But once they reach puberty, everything changes for these Kumaris. After menstruation starts, the girls are put through a 12-day 'Gufa' ritual, after which their life as a Kumari ends - and they return to an ordinary life that they have never known. Kumaris are chosen as infants in Nepal to become living goddesses, who are then worshipped by thousands of Hindus and Buddhists until they reach puberty.  Here, one Kumari, Samita Bajracharya, is worshipped by a devotee at a festival . during one of her nine public appearances throughout the year . Once the Kumaris start menstruating, they retire from their goddess-like status. After a 12-day 'Gufa' ritual, the Kumari will go to a nearby river, untie her hair and wash off a third eye which has been painted on her forehead. She then returns to normal life, just as shown here with Kumari Samita Bajracharya . The Gufu ceremony is a grand occasion and marks the start of a time when the child can go to school, return to their families and live in public, after years of being unable to do all those things. Here, Purna Shova, left, unties the hair of her daughter, Kumari Samita Bajracharya, . at Bagmati river in . Patan, Nepal .

"A luxury car salesman knew something smelled fishy when a customer paid him in AUD$17,063.38 (SGD$18,997.28) in stinking coins. Last Tuesday, Ong Boon Lin, 34, entered Exotic Motor, a shop specialising in Ferraris and Bentleys, pushing a white box on a trolley. Things took a turn for the weird when he toppled the box over, covering the  shop in a mountain of coins - all of which reportedly reeked of fish. Scroll down for video . Ong Boon Lin, 34, entered Luxury Motor, a shop specialising in Ferraris and Bentleys, pushing a white box on a trolley . Mr Lin then toppled the box over, covering the shop in a mountain of coins-all of which were reportedly soaked in fish juices . Mr Lin, 34, lost a lawsuit against the dealership over money he claimed was owed to him over an Aston Martin V8 Vantage he bought from Exotic Motor, a luxury car dealership in Singapore. The court ordered he repay the car's road tax and insurance, as well as reimburse the shop for legal fees, reports Stuff NZ. So in a statement of disapproval over the decision, Mr Bin paid the money he was owed in about 100 kilograms of smelly coins, from numerous different currencies. The coins were valued at 10, 20 and 50 cents, with some from Malaysia and Thailand. The car dealership's workers were left to  pack the money into about ten bags, which were then carted into a car boot - but not without leaving an overwhelmingly fishy odour that's not likely to go away soon. The owner of the shop, Tang Siu Tong, said: 'The coins were soaked in market juices, and smelled of fish. It stank up the whole place and I had to hire professionals to get rid of it. But the smell is still there.' 'I am keeping the coins in 10 separate bags ... My lawyers are arranging to have it returned, I am definitely not going to accept it.' Staff at the car dealership were left to pack the money into ten bags, but they still left a fishy smell in the showroom . The owner of Exotic Motor, Tang Siu Tong, said the shop still smelt awful despite showing his dealership in air fresheners for three days. He believes he may even have to replace the carpet . Media Corp reported that the shop still smelled awful after three days of using air fresheners, and they are now considering replacing the carpet, which will cost him $4000. Mr Tong also claimed the coin dumping incident has seen him lose  80 per cent of his customers. Mr Lin's lawyer had allegedly told the shop his client would drop off the money that day. The 34 year old businessman says he doesn't see anything wrong with his method of payment. He told local tabloid The New Paper that he did it because he was upset with the shop. 'Was it too much? I was really unhappy with his business practice and I paid the amount in full. So, no,' Mr Lin said. Under Singapore's Currency Laws, coins of a denomination smaller than 50 cents can only be payed for an amount of up to $2, while only $1 dollar coins and larger can be used for a bigger sum.

"A cancer sufferer running a gruelling marathon was forced to stop by officials after just eight miles - because she was 'too slow.' Single mother Anne Pharo travelled to Germany to compete in the Frankfurt Marathon but was left humiliated when she was ordered to stop running. The 41-year-old, who is battling breast cancer, even claims officials and police followed her closely for four miles demanding her to 'run faster or give up.' Ms Pharo, of Leigh Park, Hampshire, was diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time in January this year. Furious: Cancer sufferer Anne Pharo (pictured holding medals from previously successful fund-raising events) claims she was forced to stop running the Frankfurt marathon because officials said she was 'too slow' While training in June, Ms Pharo broke her foot but was determined to complete the 26-mile Frankfurt event. She says she would have taken six-and-a-half hours to complete the marathon if she had continued, but she said the way she was treated was tantamount to bullying. Ms Pharo, who works in e-banking, said: 'It has been a tough year. In January this year, I was told my cancer had returned in my other breast. 'I had surgery and reconstruction but unfortunately the reconstruction did not work. 'I got a serious infection and had to have a second surgery to remove the implant. 'In June, I broke my foot but I kept going with training. So, to be told to stop running because I was too slow was devastating. 'From four miles the organisers and police in vans, cars and on motorbikes were behind us, ushering us to ""run faster or give up"". Fundraisers: Runners cross a bridge during the 26th Frankfurt Marathon in 2007 . 'But I was pacing myself so that I could finish the race. 'At eight miles, they said we were not allowed to continue because they needed to clean the streets. This was just bullying. 'They didn't offer us an alternative route on the pavement and, once we stopped, they drove off and left us there. 'We had no idea where we were and I was devastated.' Two years ago, Ms Pharo completed the London Marathon and raised over £2,000  for a breast cancer charity. She said: 'I completed the London Marathon in 2012 in 5hrs 19mins. Perhaps I was a bit slow, but I raised over £2,000  for Breakthrough Breastcancer. 'When my friend suggested last year that we do Frankfurt I thought I'd go for it.' She says that she has read the rules and there is no cut-off point. However athletics expert Colin Goater, race director for the Great South Run, said a cut-off time was normal for marathons. He said: 'There are various reasons for it. Road closure orders only last a certain period of time. 'The administrators will be concerned about traffic problems. There is the insurance to think about. If a collision occurred it would be a difficult situation.' The organisers of the Frankfurt Marathon have not yet responded to a request for comment from MailOnline.","Anne Pharo, 41, claims she was humiliated while running Frankfurt 26-miler .

Armstrong, 42, recently told reporters he was weighing his options as the people in charge of Livestrong consider his potential future involvement. He told the Des Moines Register that 'if I'm not welcome' he would likely either start a new foundation 'which is probably the most likely scenario, or just be willing and able to help, wherever I'm asked.' Scroll down for video . Armstrong, 42, recently told reporters he was weighing his options as the people in charge of Livestrong consider his potential future involvement . Livestrong President Doug Ulman recently told Esquire that Armstrong could potentially return to the foundation. However Chairman Jeff Garvey said that a reconciliation was 'not on the table.' Armstrong was removed from the charity in November 2012 just one month after the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency hit him with a lifetime competition ban and he was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles. He founded the Lance Armstrong Foundation after his own battle with testicular cancer in 1997. Based in his hometown of Austin, Texas, it's raised more than an estimated $500 million. He claims to have used $7 million to $8 million of his own money to seed the foundation. Armstrong may start a new cancer foundation if he is not allowed to return to the iconic Livestrong brand . Armstrong said that even the possibility of a return was shocking. 'I . was surprised by that. That was never the impression I'd been given,' Armstrong said. 'To see the follow-up statement by the chairman, Jeff Garvey, . that was more in line with where I think they are. 'That's beyond . my control. I can't force that issue. But what I can do (is) stay . committed to the fight, stay committed to the cause.' Armstrong said he was still uncertain how he would respond to an invitation to return and that any answer would 'involve a lot of conversation.' 'I'm a big believer in the whole (author) Jim . Collins theory of 'Who's on the bus? Who'd been on the bus? Who wanted . to get off the bus? Who wants to get off the bus now?' he said. 'So we might have . to look at who's on the bus.' Armstrong said he used $7 million to $8 million of his own money to seed the foundation before he was removed following his doping scandal . However he acknowledge it was, at best, a remote possibility. 'I don't see that happening anytime soon. In fact, I'm almost certain that's not going to happen,' he said. He refuses to let that stop him from engaging with people battling cancer. 'I think it's convenient for them to put me on the sidelines,' he said.

"Shocking footage has emerged showing a Palestinian knifeman murdering a young Israeli woman, as it was revealed she survived a similar terrorist knife attack at the same location nine years ago. The video shows Dalia Lemkus, 25, being run over and repeatedly stabbed by a man identified as 30-year-old Mahar al-Hashmalud outside the Jewish settlement of Alon Shvut in the Gush Etzion area of the West Bank yesterday. Two others were injured in al-Hashmalud's knife rampage, which took place shortly after another Palestinian stabbed an Israeli soldier to death in a separate attack at a Tel Aviv train station. The disturbing CCTV footage emerged as it was revealed South Africa-born Miss Lemkus had survived a terrorist stabbing in Gush Etzion in 2006, when she was among a group of three hitchhikers attacked by a Palestinian extremist.

Victim: South Africa-born Dalia Lemkus, 25, had previously survived a terrorist stabbing in Gush Etzion in 2006, when she was among a group of three hitchhikers attacked by a Palestinian extremist . The sickening footage of Miss Lemkus' murder shows a man identified by the International Business Times as Mahar al-Hashmalud driving a white people carrier-style vehicle at high speed towards a group of people waiting at a bus stop. At least one person is seen being struck by the car, which comes close to overturning before disappearing out of shot. It is believed Miss Lemkus was the person hit by the vehicle. Al-Hashmalud, who hails from the West Bank city of Hebron, is then seen running back to the bus stop, standing over the stricken Miss Lemkus and repeatedly stabbing her in the neck, before turning his knife on a passer-by who tries to intervene. The knifeman then charges at a third person who pulled his car over in the hope of stopping the attack. As a fight breaks out between the two men, a security guard arrives and shoots al-Hashmalud, who attempts to makes off down the street. He was shot several more times in the chest while attempting to flee and was taken to hospital in a serious condition.

Her funeral took place earlier this morning, with hundreds turning out to pay their last respects to the ambulance driver and medical care volunteer. Miss Lemkus' death came shortly after an Israeli soldier was stabbed to death in a separate incident at a train station in Tel Aviv yesterday, and shortly before a third attempted stabbing in Jerusalem. In the latter incident a Palestinian man attempted to stab a security guard on the Light Rail system but was caught and arrested. The attacks are said to be in response to tensions over a holy site in the city of Jerusalem, which sits on the border of Israel and the West Bank. Israeli-Palestinian tensions have festered over access to a Jerusalem compound housing Islam's third holiest site, and where Biblical Jewish temples once stood.

"A bride who spent her wedding night in a cell next door to her new husband has admitted she racially abused and assaulted a hotel doorman after her credit card was declined. Kirsty Bigland, 30, was still in her white wedding dress when she called the Asian security guard a 'p*** b******'  before spitting in his face and punching and kicking him. The attack happened at the £300-a-night Hilton Hotel, on Deansgate, Manchester, on May 31 when Bigland and her husband Nicholas, 25, were due to spend their wedding night. Wedding troubles: Kirsty Bigland, 30, spent the night in a neighbouring cell to her new husband Nicholas, right, after she racially abused and assaulted a security guard after they tried to book in for their wedding night . Magic moment: The couple had just enjoyed one of the biggest days of their lives but it turned sour after their credit card was declined . Aftermath: This picture taken on the night shows police talking to Bigland while she wore her wedding dress . But when they tried to check in after their reception they were told that their credit card had been refused and sparked a vicious row  between the couple and members of staff. Police arrived at the  hotel - a favourite of the city's Premier League footballers, musicians and other stars - and arrested both bride and groom to a nearby police station where they spent the night in neighbouring cells. Manchester Magistrates' Court heard staff had tried to usher them out of the Hilton but Ms Bigland  began running at them swearing and spitting. During attempts to restrain her, she shouted 'get off me you black p*** b******' then attempted to punch one member of staff and spat on his shirt and jacket before yelled: 'F***  you - you should not be in this country'. She then spat in the guard's his face, punched him in the chest and kicked him once. Guilt: Mother-of-four Bigland was due to to stand trial today but changed her plea to a charge of racially aggravated assault to guilty. Her husband admitted a public order offence in September . Assault: Mrs Bigland was still in her wedding dress when she spat at and punched and kicked the security guard at the Deansgate Hilton in Manchester, before she called him a 'p*** b******' Her new husband stood in the way of a hotel barrier so cars could not leave and eventually had to be pinned down by security staff after he shouted: 'come on you k***heads - I will knock you out.' After they were detained they spent their first night of marriage in separate police cells. Mother-of-four Bigland was due to to stand trial today but changed her plea to a charge of racially aggravated assault to guilty. One charge of harassment and one public order charge were withdrawn by Sabrina Sohota, prosecuting. Bigland's husband admitted a public order offence when he appeared before magistrates in September. Prosecutor Miss Ruth Mann said: ‘A member of reception staff was dealing with the couple. At first he could not locate the booking and when he did find it the credit card was then denied. Payment was required before the room could be allocated. ‘‘The receptionist then heard Nicholas refer to another member of staff as a “f***ing idiot”. The defendant was using his mobile phone at the time and swearing to who he was talking to. Punishment: The couple, of Salford, are due to be sentenced on December 9 and were bailed on condition they do not contact witnesses or go near the hotel . ‘Kirsty was heard saying “f***ing monkeys” then “f***ing P***s”. He took this remark as a reference to the ethnicity of himself and colleagues and the couple were not allowed to remain in the hotel due to their behaviour.’ She added: ‘Kirsty ran at the staff swearing and spitting at them. Nicholas then made comments that he would assault them if they touched his wife. He was pinned down and stopped from hitting anyone. Kirsty ran towards the staff. They stopped her and she said “get off me your P*** b******”. She attempted to punch him and spat on his shirt and jacket. ‘The defendant clearly most responsible here is Kirsty Bigland.’ The couple, of Salford, are due to be sentenced on December 9 and were bailed on condition they do not contact witnesses or go near the hotel.","Nick and Kirsty Bigland rowed with Hilton Hotel staff on wedding night .

"A dementia sufferer was left locked on a bus for almost three hours after staff from the Alzheimer’s Society forgot to drop her off at home. The unnamed woman, believed to be in her 80s, had used the free shuttle service which takes patients with dementia from their homes to day care services. However, staff on board the bus forgot to ensure she got off the vehicle and she remained locked inside when it returned to the Middlefields depot in South Shields, South Tyneside. Stranded: A dementia sufferer was left locked on a bus inside this depot in South Shields, South Tyneside, for almost three hours after staff from the Alzheimer’s Society forgot to drop her off at home . She was eventually found by workers at the depot, after they heard her screams and shouts for help. The vehicle is thought to have been parked up by a worker from charity Alzheimer’s Society at around 4pm and the woman was discovered at 6.30pm. Even then her ordeal was still not over and she was not able to return home for another two hours because council staff had to be called to release her from the minibus. A council employee, who asked not to be named, said: 'She was screaming and shouting and she was really upset, crying and cold. 'She had been there for hours. If someone hadn’t have found her, she wouldn’t have lasted the night. If it was my mother or nana, I would be absolutely disgusted.' Locked in: The vehicle is thought to have been parked up at the depot by a worker from charity Alzheimer’s Society at around 4pm and the woman was discovered at 6.30pm. Two workers from the Alzheimer’s Society have been suspended while an investigation is carried out. The charity has carried out an initial report into what happened to the woman on Tuesday, November 4, but is continuing to investigate. 'Alzheimer’s Society takes the wellbeing and safety of everyone using our services very seriously,' said Alzheimer’s Society regional director Helen Foster. 'On this occasion mistakes were made that led to this very unfortunate incident.

A spokesman for South Tyneside Council said: 'From the moment we became aware of this incident, we took action and continue to take the matter extremely seriously. 'We have been in communication with the Alzheimer’s Society from an early stage and have urged them to identify exactly what went wrong on this occasion and to review procedures in consultation with our officers. 'Our priority is to ensure that users of services funded by the council are well looked after and safe.

"When former front man of the Lostprophets Ian Watkins was sentenced to a minimum of 29 years in jail after admitting 13 serious sexual offences, those who had been close to him were shocked beyond belief. Now a former lover of the singer - who went on to become the manager of the now disbanded rock group - has spoken for the first time about her relationship with Watkins. Karen Ruttner, 32, from New York, dated Watkins casually for three years between 2007 and 2010. Speaking to Krissi Murison of the Sunday Times Magazine, Karen reveals she had no idea about Watkin’s depraved crimes during the time she was having a relationship with him, and was deeply shocked at his admission of guilt. Scroll down for related video . Karen Ruttner (left), had an on-off relationship with Watkins (right) who was jailed for 29 years after admitting a string of child sex offences, from 2007 to 2010 . ‘This person that I had been so close with at that point, for six years, was… capable of this? I thought I knew when he was lying. I thought I knew what his demons were,' she told Murison in an interview. Karen says she knew about Ian’s drug problems, which included crystal meth and cocaine abuse. She also says she was happy for him to sleep with other women during their ‘open relationship’. She believed him to be addicted to sex: ‘There were no alarm bells. I just knew that he had a ferocious sexual appetite.’ Karan, who met Watkins in 2006 at the club she ran in New York, said that Watkins’ arrogance and intelligence attracted her to the star immediately. However his drug dependency worsened in the years she knew him, causing problems in his career as well as exacerbating his sexual appetites. Speaking of his addiction to cyrstal meth, she said: 'It upped his appetite. Oh, my God. His judgement went out the window,’ recalls Karen, who says that Watkin’s continued spiral into addiction left him ‘disgusting’. Karen says that Watkins' drug abuse  increased his libido and made him 'disgusting' Watkins, 36, from Pontypridd, was jailed for a minimum of 29 years for 13 child sex offences at Cardiff Crown Court in December last year. Karen believes that being able to easily connect with fans online was an factor in Watkins’ crimes. Karen says, ‘If you take someone like Ian, and then you give him access to all these oversexed young women and men online it’s a recipe for disaster.’ The star was described as a 'determined and committed paedophile' by judge after he admitted 13 offences, including two counts of attempted rape of a baby. Karen became a manager of  Lostprophets (from left-  Lee Gaze, Stuart Richardson, Mike Lewis, Ian Watkins and Luke Johnson) who have now split up . His two accomplices - fans who he met online, who can only be named as Woman A and Woman B for legal reasons - were jailed for 14 years and 16 years respectively. He encouraged the second woman to abuse her child during a webcam chat and secretly stashed child porn videos, some of which he had made himself. Sentencing judge Mr Justice Royce told Watkins: 'Those who have appeared in these courts over many years see a large number of horrific cases. This case, however, breaks new ground. 'I am satisfied that you are a deeply corrupting influence, you are highly manipulative, you are a sexual predator, you are dangerous. 'The public and, in particular, young females need protection from you.' Lostprophets were founded in Pontypridd in 1997 and the band sold about 3.5 million albums worldwide. His former bandmates have turned their back on him, saying they are 'heartbroken, angry, and disgusted' at his crimes. They have urged more of his victims to contact police.","Karen Ruttner had an on-off relationship with Watkins from 2007 to 2010 .

"Police are hunting for a gunman after the shooting murders of a man and woman, whose bodies were discovered on the side of a road in the NSW border town Moama. NSW police have established Strike Force Kennedia to investigate their deaths and detectives have been sent to the town to locate the person or people responsible. In a media conference, police said that the victims are yet to be identified but both lived locally and 'obviously knew each other'. The man was found dead inside of a white sedan, whilst the woman was positioned halfway out of the vehicle. Each had been shot multiple times. The bodies were discovered by a local resident on a bush track four kilometres outside of the Moama township. Scroll down for video . The bodies of a man and a woman were found in a white sedan on the side of the road (pictured). The man was inside the vehicle and the woman was in the process of exiting the vehicle . NSW Police media confirmed that the deaths are being treated as suspicious and urged members of the public to come forward with any information. 'This crime has occurred in your community and we are sure that people have knowledge of what happened and why,' said Superintendent Paul Condon of Deniliquin Local Area Command. The Mayor of the town, Thomas Weyrich told Daily Mail Australia that he is greatly concerned about the safety of the residents in Moama. 'My greatest concern is that we have somebody walking around who is armed and is capable of multiple homicides,' said Mr Weyrich. 'I am extremely concerned, the people of Moama need to be very, very careful who they talk to and communicate with. Police have cordoned the street off after the double murder of a man and woman on the side of the road in NSW border town Moama . 'Police are heavily involved and treating the case with the greatest urgency. The sooner the perpetrator or perpetrators are brought into custody the better.' Councillor Weyrich said that he and the community are shocked, as nothing like this has ever happened before. 'We are a quiet little New South Wales town. This is a very safe place and we don't by and large have any criminal activity. 'This has come out of left field.' The mayor did confirm that there is a bikie presence in the town. 'We do have a Bandidos clubhouse across the river and a member that lives close by, but I am not saying that they are involved.' A man and a woman have been found dead in the NSW town of Moama . Resident Kylie Spencer said she was driving into town about 9.20am on Wednesday and noticed a white car pulled off the road. 'I didn't know there were bodies,' Ms Spencer, who lives on the road, told AAP. 'I drove past thinking they had a punctured tyre. You do 100km/h down that road. 'It was just pulled over on the road, nothing suspicious at all.' Ms Spencer said there was another car pulled over next to the white vehicle. She assumed the motorist was helping out. Ms Spencer, a resident of 12 years, said the cars weren't local to that road. Emergency services, including police and paramedics, were called to the scene at Old Deniliquin Road on Tuesday morning. 'At 9.26am paramedics were initially called out to what we were told was a car accident,' a Victoria Rural Ambulance Service spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'When the paramedics arrived they confirmed two people were deceased. 'Police have now established a crime scene.' Shots were reportedly heard before the bodies were found.

"Special guest: Labour MP panellist Pater Hain was flown to South Africa for the show, and part of his journey was in business class . The BBC spent thousands sending eight staff to South Africa for a special Question Time last night while Labour panellist Peter Hain was flown business class, MailOnline can reveal today. Viewers have repeatedly slammed the Corporation's 'excessive' coverage of Nelson Mandela's death and last night the BBC programme presented by David Dimbleby was broadcast from Johannesburg. Producers say the decision was taken to give Britain 'an insight into the personal and political views of people in South Africa in a way that would not have been possible in a broadcast from the UK'. But critics have accused bosses of 'wasting massive amounts of money', and maintain the show should have stayed here. MailOnline has learned that MP for Neath Peter Hain, a well-known anti-apartheid campaigner, was flown out at the BBC's expense to appear on the show. He spoke alongside five South Africans including Pik Botha, the country's foreign minister during the 1980s. Mr Hain was flown direct to Johannesburg from the UK and came home via Amsterdam. His journey from South Africa to Holland was in business class, the BBC admitted. But they refused to reveal how much his flights, and the flights for the eight production staff, cost them. Presenter David Dimbleby flew to the country with the wider BBC team after Mandela died, but it is not known which class he travelled in. The Question Time set, cameras and other equipment was provided by the South African studio they rented. Tory member of the culture, media and sport select committee, Philip Davies said: 'It just proves how overfunded the BBC is if they can spend money on this kind of largesse. 'The BBC is spending other people's money and that is why it doesn't matter to them. They are spending the money of many people who are struggling to pay their licence fee.' Question Time: The show was shown on British television, but not in South Africa, and the set and equipment was sourced from the Johannesburg studios . Programme: David Dimbleby was already in South Africa before Question Time, which also had Pik Botha on the panel . Derek Sim wrote on Twitter: 'The BBC spend even more money in arranging Question Time in South Africa, why and for whose benefit? Certainly not us. What a waste. @deffo55 wrote: 'Dear BBC, Why do you have Question Time from South Africa? Not relevant for the UK license fee payer....what a waste of money....shameful'. The other panellists were Lindiwe Zulu, an advisor to President Zuma, Andile Mngxitama, a member of the . Economic Freedom Fighters group in South Africa, Lindiwe Mazibuko, leader of the country's opposition . party and Eusebius . McKeizer, a journalist. They were asked about issues like whether it was wrong to boo Jacob Zuma at Nelson Mendela's memorial on Tuesday and whether 'racism is over' in the country. BBC bosses are already under fire after it emerged it sent  nearly three times as many staff to South Africa than all of its rival . British broadcasters put together. After Mandela's death the corporation sent a total of 140 presenters and crew members to South . Africa, while Sky News had the second highest number of the British . broadcasters with 15. Other panellists: (top left to bottom right) Lindiwe Zulu, advisor to President Zuma, Andile Mngxitama,  member of the Economic Freedom Fighters group, Lindiwe Mazibuko, leader of opposition party National Assembly of the Democratic Alliance and Eusebius McKeizer, a journalist and political analyst . The BBC said it expected to have deployed about 120 journalists, . technicians and support staff to work on the story over a ten-day . period. The BBC World . Service is also reported to have sent a further 20 staff, whose expenses . will not be paid for by licence-fee payers. ITV and Channel 4 sent nine people to cover the event in South Africa, while Channel 5 sent four. This week it revealed it had received nearly 1,700 complaints over its 'excessive' coverage and Ofcom has also been contacted by disgruntled viewers. The BBC has . defended its coverage and said Mandela's death was of 'considerable . interest' to audiences in the UK and across the rest of the world. A spokesman said: 'Nelson Mandela’s death was a hugely significant global story and the programme gave viewers an insight into the personal and political views of people in South Africa in a way that would not have been possible in a broadcast from the UK. Barack Obama gives his eulogy at Nelson Mandela's memorial service as seen on the BBC, which has sent 120 staff to cover the late South African leader's death . The number of BBC staff sent to South Africa was far greater than its rivals, including ITV which reportedly despatched just nine crew to cover proceedings . A team of eight production staff went to Johannesburg and all the set and equipment was locally sourced. 'Peter Hain was an integral part of the panel, bringing the UK government’s involvement into the wider story. We felt his inclusion was important and so we did pay for his flights but we kept costs as low as we could. Touching on the number of staff the corporation has sent to South Africa, the spokesman added: 'Unlike other UK networks, we’ve been providing coverage across numerous domestic and global outlets from a number of different locations for TV, radio and online, including live broadcasts on BBC Two, rolling news on the News Channel and World News, BBC Breakfast, three daily news bulletins, coverage across a number of radio programmes and bulletins on 5live, Radio 4 and Radio 2.

Tanks fired rockets on two large Sunni Muslim neighbourhoods this morning, as attacks carried on into a second week. The continued bloodshed led Arab League foreign ministers to pledge for the first time to aid the . opposition 'with all forms of political and material support' to overthrow Assad. And . British Foreign Secretary William Hague said plans to send a joint UN . and League peacekeeping force in to Syria, once Assad stops his . crackdown, must be discussed 'urgently'. At yesterday's meeting in Cairo, . Arab League foreign ministers vowed to aid the . opposition battling to overthrow Assad and called on the UN . Security Council to authorise a peacekeeping force. They approved a resolution calling for 'opening communication channels with the . Syrian opposition and providing all forms of political and material . support to it'. Scars: Doctors said they are treating dozens of young Syrians injured during the violence at a hospital run by Paris-based Medecins Sans Frontieres in Amman . Horrific: The images show the human cost of President Bashar Assad's ongoing brutal military crackdown against opposition . It is seen . as a remarkable statement from a body, which has turned against Assad . because of its resentment of his ties to Iran, which was once known for . keeping out of the internal affairs of its members. It is not clear whether its proposed joint U.N.-Arab . peacekeeping force would involve armed troops, or whether the aid . offered to the opposition would include weapons. If . so, it would be the second time in less than a year the Arab League had . called for outside intervention in an Arab state. Its decision to back a . no-fly zone in Libya last March led to Western bombing that helped . bring down Muammar Gaddafi. William Hague, speaking after yesterday's meeting, said he welcomed the formation of the Group of Friends of Syria, which is expected to include exiled opposition leaders. He said: 'Such a mission could have . an important role to play in saving lives, providing the Assad regime . ends the violence against civilians, withdraws its forces from towns and . cities and establishes a credible ceasefire.' He . added that 'significant steps' were taken at the meeting to increase . the 'diplomatic and economic isolation' faced by the Syrian regime. Attack: Syrian forces today continued to rain bombs on the city of Homs as President Assad continues his crackdown on opposition . Plea: A young girl, holding her doll, tells the world what she thinks of President Bashar Assad during a demonstration yesterday . Opposition: Armed Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters march through the streets of Idlib today . And . he said the UK would play a 'very active part' in the new Group of . Friends of Syria, which has been established to increase political and . financial support to opposition leaders in Syria. The group will meet . again on February 24. Mr . Hague added: 'President Assad must be in no doubt of the determination . of his neighbours and the international community to bring an end to the . violence in Syria. 'The . Arab League could not have sent a clearer message to Syria than the one . it sent yesterday and we look forward to working closely with them in . the coming days and weeks.' And he added today that any peacekeeping troops in Syria should come from non-Western countries. He . said: 'I don’t see the way forward in Syria as being Western boots on . the ground in any form, including in any peacekeeping form. 'I . think they would need to come from other countries, rather than Western . nations. Of course, if such a concept can be made viable, we will be . supporting it in all the usual ways.' Mass movement: Demonstrators gather to protest against President Assad in Hula, near Homs . No end in sight: Black smoke rises in the Baba Amr district of Homs . Injured: Rebels retreat after being hit with fire from army troops in Homs . Another victim: The dead body of a rebel is carried through the streets of Homs . Critical: British Foreign Secretary William Hague said plans to send a joint UN and League peacekeeping force in to Syria, once Assad stops the crackdown, must be discussed 'urgently' In Homs yesterday, government troops concentrated their fire on Baba Amro in the south of the city and al-Waer in the West, which borders the Military College, a main assembly point for tanks and government troops, opposition campaigners said. Activist Mohammad al-Hassan said: 'Tank shelling has been non-stop on Baba Amro and the bombardment on al-Wear began overnight.' He . said al-Waer, scene of large pro-democracy demonstrations for months, . had come under attack in the last several days from pro-Assad militia . known as shabbiha. And he . added: 'We heard the Free Syrian Army has started responding by . attacking roadblocks being manned by shabbiha. Communications with . al-Waer have been cut off and the sound of shelling can be now heard.' The Free Syrian Army, led by defectors, has taken the main role in armed opposition to Assad's government. Syria's . uprising, in which the United Nations says more than 5,000 people have . died, has become one of the bloodiest of the Arab Spring revolts . sweeping the region since the end of 2010. Any . peacekeeping mission would require consensus from foreign powers, who . have been divided on how to resolve a conflict that is descending into a . civil war. Moscow and Beijing drew strong . criticism from the West after they prevented the Security Council from . backing an Arab plan that called for Assad to give up his powers. However, . Western powers so far have shown no appetite for military action, . despite their condemnation of the repression of the uprising. Shelling: In this online video, tanks fire in the Baba Amro neighbourhood in the flashpoint city of Homs . Cowering: A group of blood-spattered children, with bandages on their heads, hide in the basement of a Homs home trying to avoid being caught in the bombardment . Syria called the League's resolution . 'a flagrant departure from the group's charter and a hostile act that . targets Syria's security and stability'. Assad's . government says it is fighting an insurgency by militants funded from . abroad, and Arab states have turned against it as part of a regional . power grab. At . the UN, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's spokesperson said he supported . the 'efforts of the League of Arab States to stop the violence in Syria . and to seek a peaceful resolution of the crisis that meets the . democratic and legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people'. Earlier . yesterday, Tunisia said it would host the first meeting on February 24 . of a 'Friends of Syria' contact group made up of Arab and other states . and backed by the West. A similar Libya contact group played a . vital role in coordinating Western and Arab aid to that country's . rebels last year. Bloodshed: More than 300 people including this man have died in Homs in the past week . Panic: Citizens flee as a home in Homs is set on fire after being hit by a rocket . Victim: A woman in Homs, where activists say they are 'all going to die', stares vacantly after she was injured by Syrian troops .","Arab League pledges to aid opposition battling to overthrow Assad .

"A small-time criminal who scooped £6.5million on the lottery but ended up homeless told yesterday how the win had been a ‘curse’. Lee Ryan spent two years sleeping rough after blowing his fortune. He now rents a two-room flat and earns less than £10,000 a year – but insists that he is happier today than when he was a millionaire. Lee Ryan with his £235,000 JetRanger helicopter - he was ordered to pay £7,000 after being found guilty of buzzing homes . Mr Ryan, 54, hit the jackpot in March 1995. At the time he was awaiting trial for handling stolen cars. Nicknamed the Lotto Lag, he was jailed for 18 months for the offence six months after landing the jackpot. The first British lottery millionaire to end up in prison, he served nine months of his sentence. He says he was ‘a monster then’ and his win saved him from descending into serious crime, claiming he had been on the verge of carrying out an armed robbery. Lee Ryan hit the jackpot in March 1995 - at the time he was awaiting trial for handling stolen cars. Pictured with his first wife Karen in 1995 . Mr Ryan, then a used car trader, won £6,527,880 with girlfriend Karen Taylor just 17 weeks after the launch of the National Lottery. At the time, the couple lived in a council house in Braunston, Leicester, with their three children. They married that summer and Mr Ryan splashed out on a £1million country mansion and a fleet of cars, including a Bentley, a Ferrari, a Porsche and BMW with personalised number plates LEE 1, LEE 2, LEE 3 and LEE 4. He also bought two Ducati superbikes, a £125,000 plane and a £235,000 Bell JetRanger helicopter. He was later fined for using the aircraft to buzz homes. In a newspaper interview yesterday, Mr Ryan told how he had prayed to God to make him a millionaire while serving a prison sentence in 1986 for stealing cars. Lee Ryan pictured in Cannes in 1998 during the 51st Cannes Film Festival . ‘My cellmate warned me to be careful what I wished for,’ he told The Sun. ‘The money was cursed.’ He and Miss Taylor split in 2003 after he cheated on her. He moved to London, where he met 24-year-old student Jyldyz Djangaracheva, known as Jika. They moved to her homeland, the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia, with their baby daughter. But Mr Ryan lost around £2million in failed business ventures and property investments. One venture to build a fish farm in the central Asian republic fell foul of local mafia bosses. He claims crooked officials cheated him out of his cash in another scheme, a text message-based lottery in China. Mr Ryan splashed out on a £1 million country mansion(pictured) and a fleet of cars, including a Bentley, a Ferrari, a Porsche and BMW with personalised number plates LEE 1, LEE 2, LEE 3 and LEE 4 . Lottery winner Lee Ryan parking one of his brand new cars, with a personalized number plate, outside court in 1995 . By 2010, he had divorced Jika and returned to Britain with nothing but a sleeping bag. He says he spent the next two years sleeping rough – on park benches, in cemeteries or in doorways. He added: ‘I travelled all over the country. I bumped into what I call “living angels” where I am not asking anybody for anything and someone turns up saying, “Are you all right, mate?”’ Mr Ryan now lives in a rented flat in South London – where he claims to take in the homeless as guests – and works as a cameraman. He said he would probably have ended up spending life in prison if his lottery numbers had not come up and revealed that he had once threatened Miss Taylor with a shotgun. Lee Ryan arriving at Stafford Prison, where he was sentenced to nine months imprisonment for handling stolen cars after having won the lottery . At the time of the lottery win, he claimed, he was in the advanced stages of planning an armed robbery – ‘a really big job’ – in Belgium. He said he had planned to carry a loaded gun, adding: ‘If they [the robbery victims] wanted to play silly b*****s, they’d get it in the knees at the very least.’ He added: ‘I’m not that person now but I was a monster then. 'There’s also no doubt that the lottery saved me as a person and saved the lives of my potential victims. The win saved me from that fate – and someone else from being my victim.’ Mr Ryan leaving prison in 1996 - in a newspaper interview Mr Ryan has now told how he had prayed to God to make him a millionaire while serving a different prison sentence in 1986 for stealing cars . Yesterday, Miss Taylor, 55, said she was no longer in contact with Mr Ryan, adding: ‘Neither are our children, as far as I know.’ She declined to comment further. The couple’s youngest child, Nile, 26, also declined to comment. In May 2001, ex-RAF engineer Nigel Gardner-Hale became the second lottery millionaire to be jailed. Mr Gardner-Hale, who won £3.4million on a Lucky Dip ticket, was arrested when police raided a party at his home in Maesteg, South Wales. He admitted possessing 44 ecstasy tablets, supplying the drug, and letting guests smoke cannabis. He was jailed for 12 months.

"Click here to see Nos 50-41 . The centre forward: The leader from the front, the No 9, the provider, the talisman, the goalscorer. Since 1992, the Premier League has been blessed with the best, from homegrown talents Alan Shearer and Andy Cole, to foreign imports Tony Yeboah and Thierry Henry. In this international week, we are begging for goals, and these lot put the ball in the back of the net and make it look easy. Here, Sportsmail runs you through Nos 40-31 of the best strikers to have ever graced the Premier League... do you agree? 40. Darren Bent (Ipswich Town, Charlton Athletic, Tottenham, Sunderland, Aston Villa, Fulham) Powerful and prolific, Bent proved he had all the attributes needed to lead an attack at a number of Premier League clubs and, for a time, England too. He proved himself with three free-scoring seasons in the second-tier with Ipswich and it was a matter of time before he was snapped up by a Premier League side. That team was Charlton and Bent proved his worth with goals in his first four games for the club and 31 overall. Tottenham believed in his potential and splashed out a club record £16.5million in 2007 but he moved on to Sunderland after two seasons. Twenty-four goals in the 2009-10 season reaffirmed his class. Bent then joined Villa for another big transfer fee though his best could never be recaptured. In all, he has 106 Premier League goals. Darren Bent proved his worth at Charlton Athletic with goals in his first four games for the club and 31 overall . Tottenham believed in his potential and splashed out a club record £16.5million in 2007, but he then moved on to Sunderland . 39. Eidur Gudjohnsen (Chelsea, Tottenham, Stoke City, Fulham) The 'Ice Man' is fondly remembered by Chelsea fans for his goalscoring exploits in the years immediately before Roman Abramovich arrived. Signed by Gianluca Vialli for £4m from Bolton in 2000, he soon formed a potent strike partnership with Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink at Stamford Bridge. His first campaign saw him score 10 and set up many more for the Dutchman. As well as 54 goals for Chelsea, Gudjohnsen also contributed 60 assists, underlining his all-round ability. His best was probably that overhead kick against Leeds United in 2002-2003. His worth was also shown by the fact Jose Mourinho continued to play him for some time ahead of expensive acquisitions Adrian Mutu, Didier Drogba and Hernan Crespo. Eidur Gudjohnsen is fondly remembered by Chelsea fans for his goalscoring exploits after being signed for £4m by Gianluca Vialli in 2000 . The Iceland striker scores the first goal of the Jose Mourinho era, beating Tim Howard to seal a 1-0 win over Manchester United . 38. Niall Quinn (Manchester City, Sunderland) Quinn was already an established First Divison player with Arsenal and Manchester City before enjoying his profitable time at Sunderland around the turn of the Millennium. He was signed for a club record £1.3m in August 1996 and helped them return and then establish themselves in the top flight, forming a deadly strike partnership with Kevin Phillips. Standing 6ft 4in tall, Quinn was the perfect target man and his many flick-ons and knock-downs helped Phillips profit. A true club legend, the Irishman also served as chairman and, briefly, manager. Niall Quinn was already an established First Divison player with Arsenal and Man City before enjoying his profitable time at Sunderland . Quinn scores one of his most memorable goals against Newcastle in Sunderland's first season back in the Premier League in 1999 . 37. Craig Bellamy (Coventry City, Newcastle United, Blackburn Rovers, Liverpool, West Ham, Manchester City, Cardiff City) The Welsh goal-grabber forged a successful career in the Premier League and couldn’t be faulted on his record despite some controversial moments. He first shot to prominence at Norwich before Coventry acquired him for a club record fee of £6m in 2000, but it wasn’t the happiest period as they suffered relegation. Newcastle rescued his top-flight ambitions but his time in the North East was overshadowed by fallings-out and he scored just 28 goals in four seasons. His most successful spell was his one season at Blackburn with 13 league goals, the greatest moment arguably his double at Old Trafford for Man City in September 2009. Craig Bellamy first shot to prominence at Norwich before Coventry acquired him for a club record fee of £6m in 2000 . Bellamy's trademark was speed and finishing, and here he scores for Newcastle against West Ham in January 2003 . 36. Emmanuel Adebayor (Arsenal, Manchester City, Tottenham) Togolese tower Adebayor was brought to Arsenal from Ligue 1 for £3m in 2006 and proved his worth with the winning goal at Old Trafford and two strikes against Tottenham in the derby the following season. His stunning volleyed second in that game won Goal of the Season. He joined moneyed Machester City for £25m in 2009, running the full length of the field to celebrate in front of the Arsenal fans after scoring against them at the Etihad. The arrivals of Carlos Tevez, Mario Balotelli and Edin Dzeko forced him out but profitable loan spells at Real Madrid and Tottenham led to his joining the north London club permanently. He has 35 league goals in total for Spurs. Emmanuel Adebayor scored 46 Premier League goals for Arsenal before his move to Manchester City in 2009 . The Togolose striker is seen here scoring for Manchester City and celebrating in front of the Arsenal fans, much to their anger . 35. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (Manchester United) The master of the late sucker-punch, Norwegian import Solskjaer was the ultimate ‘super sub.’ While there were no goals more famous than his stoppage time winning for Manchester United in the 1999 Champions League final, he did contribute a total of 91 in the Premier League during his time at the club, many late on. He famously netted four after coming on in an 8-1 thrashing of Nottingham Forest in 1999 and he returned 17 goals in 2001-02. Solskjaer suffered a torrid time with injuries during his later Old Trafford career but that outstretched leg in Barcelona, securing United’s unprecedented Treble triumph, ensured he will forever remain a club legend. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is a legend at Manchester United, and here he nets against bitter rivals Liverpool in 2000 . Solskjaer, the baby-faced assassin. contributed a total of 91 Premier League goals, including this one at Charlton in 2002 . 34. Duncan Ferguson (Everton, Newcastle United) Towering and uncompromising Scot who could be almost impossible to keep track of in the box, ‘Big Dunc’ Ferguson was and remains a popular figure at Everton. He moved to Merseyside from Rangers in 1994 but it took a little time to find his best form. He enjoyed two excellent seasons between 1996 and 1998, earning affection from the Goodison Park faithful for his commitments and combative performances. Injuries ruined his chances after moving to Newcastle and he returned to Everton after just two seasons on Tyneside. He would play six more seasons and is the highest-scoring Scot in the Premier League.

Ferguson had a fiery side and (left) throttles Steffen Freund in 2004 and (right) in a scrap with Liverpool's Jason McAteer in 1997 . 33. Mark Hughes (Manchester United, Chelsea, Southampton, Everton, Blackburn Rovers) One of the finest British strikers of the modern era, Hughes was well-established as a prolific scorer at Manchester United by the time the Premier League started in 1992. ‘Sparky’ helped United end their long title drought with 28 goals in the first two seasons of the new competition, both won by United. The Welshman scored a memorable goal in United’s 1994 FA Cup semi-final with Oldham and also netted in the final, a 4-0 win over Chelsea, the club he would unexpectedly join in 1995. Despite many believing his best days were behind him, Hughes formed an effective strike partnership with Gianfranco Zola, scoring 25 league goals for the London club and winning the FA Cup, League Cup and European Cup-Winners’ Cup. Mark Hughes (left) helped Manchester United to two titles and scored 28 PL goals - here he volleys in against Arsenal in 1995 . Hughes, seen here in action for Chelsea, also played for Southampton, Everton and Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League . 32. Jermain Defoe (West Ham, Tottenham, Portsmouth) Speedy and nerveless in front of goal, Defoe reached 124 Premier League goals for his three clubs and also scored 19 in 55 appearances for England. His 2004 departure from West Ham, for whom he scored 18 times in the top-flight drew some criticism but he shrugged it off to perform very well in his initial five seasons with Tottenham following a £6m move. Though lots of his appearances came as a substitute, Defoe still managed 43 goals before spending two years at Portsmouth. Spurs wanted him back and paid considerably more than what they sold him for. The 2009-10 campaign featured many highlights, including an overhead kick against Manchester United and a five-goal haul in a 9-1 thrashing of Wigan. In all, he scored 47 Premier League goals during his second spell at White Hart Lane. Jermain Defoe celebrates scoring for West Ham; the Englishman has 124 Premier League goals for three clubs in total . Defoe scored 90 Premier League goals during his two spells at White Hart Lane; here is his fourth of five against Wigan in 2009 . 31. Dion Dublin (Manchester United, Coventry City, Aston Villa) Dublin had made his name as a free-scoring striker for Cambridge United, prompting Manchester United to sign him right at the start of the Premier League era. But his opportunities were limited by injury and the excellence of Eric Cantona and a move to Coventry in 1994 proved the making of him. He scored 13 in his first season at Highfield Road, followed by 14, 14 and a career-high 18. This came in 1997-98, as Dublin shared the top scorer award with Michael Owen and Chris Sutton. Having failed to break into the England side, Dublin moved to Villa for £5.75m in 1998, scoring seven goals in his first three games. A broken neck, suffered in December 1999, set him back though Dublin did go on to represent Leicester, Celtic and Norwich. Dion Dublin scored 13 in his first season at Highfield Road, followed by 14, 14 and a career-high 18 in the 1997-98 campaign .

"A Russian billionaire whose partner complained she was struggling to live on £10,000-a-week has gone to the High Court in a bid to lift a freezing order on his assets. Sergei Pugachev was made the subject of a strict court order which caps his and his partner, Alexandra Tolstoy's, spending at £10,000-a-week due to an investigation being carried out in Russia. Ms Tolstoy recently told the Mail on Sunday the order made it difficult for the couple to manage their homes and staff - who include three nannies, two housekeepers, two drivers and a personal trainer. Today, Mr Pugachev challenged a global order freezing on his £1.1billion assets by the High Court in London, which was made earlier this year after an application by Russian authorities investigating his role in the collapse of a bank in 2010. Sergei Pugachev and his partner Alexandra Tolstoy, have complained about a court order which restricts their spending to £10,000 a week . Russia's ASV — the Deposit Insurance Agency, in translation, which monitors and safeguards Russian banks — is looking into the collapse of his Mezprombank in 2010. The freeze prevents the couple - who have three children - from selling their two London homes or their villa in the south of France or doing anything to diminish their value. But it was a stipulation that their budget be limited to £10,000-a-week which Ms Tolstoy - a distant relation of the famous Russian writer - branded 'draconian'. She said it prevents them from maintaining their historic chateau in the hills overlooking Nice which is set in 15 acres and whose neighbours include Elton John. She said: ‘The budget for that house alone is £1.2 million a year (£23,000 a week), hence the legal appeal. It’s like maintaining a stately home.’ She added: ‘Apart from the five of us, we have live-in nannies and a live-in Bulgarian doctor, because Sergei has a heart problem.’ Ms Tolstoy said the order made it difficult for the couple to run their two London houses, their 'stately home' in the south of France and employ their team of nannies, security staff and housekeepers . There are three nannies who work in rotation - English, French, and Russian - to enhance the children’s language skills. Each one lives with the family for a week before the next one takes over. Ms Tolstoy wouldn't disclose salaries, but given that sought-after nannies can command £40,000 a year, while housekeeping and security staff may be on roughly £25,000, the couple could well be spending about £250,000 a year on staff just for their London home. At the time of the interview, with the Mail on Sunday, it was reported that the family also had five cars to maintain and run in London, including a Rolls-Royce and Bentley, and two yachts in France. It was also reported that their eldest children, aged four and five, were due to start at a French-speaking private school in London in September, at a total cost of about £30,000 a year. Ms Tolstoy also admitted to being ‘a clothes-aholic’ but said she believes in buying investment fashion items in London, Paris and Monaco, rather than cheap High Street ‘tat'. She revealed that she likes French and Italian ‘pretty’ designers, such as Chanel and Valentino, and cutting-edge British designers like Christopher Kane and Jonathan Saunders. She said of the staff payroll: ‘People might think that’s a crazy amount of money, but why is it a bad thing for Sergei to pay that into the English economy? ‘Those people might otherwise be unemployed. And why should the people who work for us lose their jobs because of some political thing the Russians are doing? ‘We feed them and pay for all their travel - we’re good employers. Hopefully they will all come in under the £10,000-a-week budget.’ Mr Pugachev started High Court action today against the order, which was brought in at the request of Russian financial investigators . Mr Pugachev - once called the ‘Kremlin’s banker’ - insists the investigation into the collapse of his former bank is politically motivated. Despite once looking after the money of president Vladimir Putin’s inner circle, he fell out of favour in 2010 and was eventually forced to flee the country. He launched a bid to overturn the freezing order today in a High Court case which is expected to last six days. The Russian DIA dispute his claims that the investigation is a campaign ordered by the Kremlin and insist Mezprombank was given ample opportunity to pay Russian authorities. It issued a statement saying: 'The DIA believes that it has strong claims against Mr Pugachev, who is accused of extracting very significant sums (in excess of US$ 2 billion) from Mezhdunarodny Promyshlenniy Bank CJSC to the detriment of its creditors. 'The DIA will contend that the freezing injunction was rightly granted and should be maintained. 'Also, the DIA rejects Mr Pugachev's allegations, which have been widely reported in the media, that the proceedings are politically motivated and that it is an untrustworthy or corrupt organisation. 'The DIA takes its responsibilities very seriously and believes that it is in the best interests of the Bank's creditors to pursue the litigation against Mr Pugachev. “In relation to Mr Pugachev's challenge to the jurisdiction of the English Court, the DIA brought proceedings against Mr Pugachev in England because until recently he had not engaged in any way in the Russian proceedings and also because he permanently resides in England. 'Provided that S.V. Pugachev formally submits to the jurisdiction of the Russian court and defends the case on the merits, the DIA is prepared to agree, subject to certain conditions, that the claim in Russia should go ahead first. 'What is most important is that Mr Pugachev faces justice, whether in England or in Russia, and that any judgment ultimately obtained by the DIA can be enforced against Mr Pugachev's assets outside Russia.'","Sergei Pugachev had his £1.1billion assets frozen over Russian probe .

"From early ice skates made from bone to the secret of designing the perfect pair of salopettes, the history of stylish snow gear is almost as fascinating as the sports themselves. Now some of the world's oldest winter wear is to go on display - alongside some unique modern pieces that include a chilly-looking gown made from white plastic. Fashioning Winter, a new exhibition dedicated to all things ski and snow, also includes a pair of skates dating from the 1930s and a ski that once belonged to Sir Arnold Lunn, the man who pioneered the downhill slalom race. Striking: A 1910 illustration showing the Parisian approach to cold weather dressing at the time . Other highlights include delicate vintage postcards of Parisians showing how stylish cold weather dressing is done and a 1962 bottle of Piz Buin sunscreen. Launched to coincide with the opening of the annual festive ice rink at Somerset House, the exhibition also boasts an early Burberry snow suit as well as a poignant set of photos showing British Tommies wrapped in fur gilets as they prepared to spend their first Christmas in the trenches. Wonderful though they are, it is the ski wear that really catches the eye and points to the evolution of the sport from essential mode of transport for hardy Swiss, French and Norwegian mountain-dwellers to seriously stylish hobby beloved of the world's wealthiest. Thought to have originated more than 7,000 years ago in Russia, the modern form of skiing has its roots in Scandinavia - as does the name, which comes from the Old Norse word skíð. The Kalvträskskidan ski, the world's oldest, was unearthed in the Swedish village of Kalvträsk in 1924 and has been carbon-dated to 3300 BC, with the second-oldest, the Vefsn Nordland ski, found in neighbouring Norway. Vintage: These 1930s skates were worn by Christina Greenberry at the Streatham Ice Arena in London . Christmas in the trenches: This 1915 cutting shows British soldiers in their 'teddy coats' made for winter . Traditionally used as a means of transport during the long, dark Nordic winter, skiing also formed part of Norse mythology with Skaði, the Norse goddess of winter, frequently depicted on skis along with fellow member of the Nordic pantheon, Ullr. Later, skis were used in warfare with both Sweden and Denmark maintaining specialised ski battalions during the 15th and 16th centuries. Military skiers were also the first to take part in ski races, with records dating from 1767 detailing competitions such as downhill skiing in rough terrain, shooting while skiing and cross-country skiing while carrying a hefty backpack. By the early 1800s, skiing was becoming increasingly popular as a sport with Olaf Rye becoming the world's first ski jumper in 1809 and the first public race taking place in Tromsø in 1843. Striking: Alexander McQueen's unusual take on ski wear as seen in his A/W99 show . Colourful: A later cartoon documenting cold weather gear Parisian style in the 1920s . But despite the sport having its origins in the snowy north, the first Alpine ski resort was founded in Australia in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales. Clubs and resorts in the US and Norway followed, with the tiny province of Montenegro unveiling its own ski club in 1893. The Swiss, the traditional home of skiing as far as many Britons are concerned, didn't get its first ski resort until 1895 - 34 years after Australia. It didn't take long, however, for Switzerland to eclipse Australia and Norway as skiing destinations, thanks in no small part to tourism pioneer, Thomas Cook. Despite his best efforts, Idaho was the first place to introduce modern chair lifts - in 1936 - with the first commercial snow maker making its debut in New York State's Catskill Mountains in 1952.

"Max Clifford's ex-wife revealed today she caught him having phone sex on their honeymoon. Jo Westwood, 51, who divorced the 71-year-old  18 days after he was jailed, said she confronted him about the 'explicit call' but he laughed and called it a 'game'. Miss Westwood, who was speaking about their marriage for the first time, also revealed that her ex-husband, who she married four years ago, was trying to woo women in the run up to his trial. Scroll down for video . Former couple: Jo Westwood with her former husband Max Clifford at a court hearing in May. She later refused to attend his trial at Southwark Crown Court . Anguish: Miss Westwood revealed that her ex-husband had phone sex on their honeymoon and was wooing other women in the run up to his trial . Discussing their honeymoon she told ITV’s This Morning today: 'We were on a beach and Max said he had to go back to the room. He was gone a very long time and I became suspicious so went back too. 'He was on the phone having a phone call of an explicit nature. He denied it but I said I could tell him what he said word for word. He then said it was a game'. The millionaire celebrity publicist, who was jailed for eight years for sexually abusing teenage girls, kept sickening mementos from women he encountered during his 50-year career. Miss Westwood met Clifford while she worked as his personal assistant and were married for four years, living in West London . When asked why she did not go to court to support him she said: 'I had thought about it, seriously, because I knew it would be better for him if I was there. 'But then in the run up to the trial he continued to wine and dine these girls. I just thought he’s just showing me no respect at all'. She also said that Clifford boasted about a bin bag of sexual photographs of women he kept at his £3.5million mansion. He told his wife: ‘I just used to be able to get women to do whatever I wanted.’ Discussing his private stash of pornographic photographs she said it was ‘something he was proud to have’. ‘I felt very uncomfortable about it. It was a bag full of photographs of women. ‘I made it very clear to him that I didn’t like them being in the house and he put them somewhere, I don’t know where. ‘Some of them had faces but a lot of them didn’t… and they were sexual. And when I said to him, “How did you get all these?”, he would say, “I just used to be able to get women to do whatever I wanted”.’ Miss Westwood, who worked as his personal assistant before they married four years ago, also told investigative journalist Mark Williams-Thomas of her shock on discovering a letter from one of Clifford’s victims, which would later trigger his downfall. The woman, now using the pseudonym Cathy Johnson, wrote anonymously in 2011 asking him if he was proud of being a child abuser after she endured four months of sexual abuse at Clifford’s hands when she was 15, which ended only after the traumatised youngster threatened to commit suicide. She wrote: ‘I wondered if you remembered, as I do, the child sexual abuse you engaged in? You took pleasure in degrading me...abusing me... and returning me to my home with a story so my parents didn’t become suspicious... so they would be fooled their daughter was in safe hands and not those of a paedophile. ‘You made my life a living hell. I had no one to turn to. You were very clever. An A+ in grooming children. How proud you must be.’ On seeing the letter, Miss Westwood urged Clifford to go to the police, but instead he kept the letter by his bed like a trophy. Watch the full interview from ITV's This Morning here. Upset: In her first interview she said that Clifford had a bin liner of pornography he was 'proud' of and also bragged: ‘I just used to be able to get women to do whatever I wanted.’ She recalled: ‘He came home from work one day and said that he’d received this letter. He showed me the letter and I was horrified. I said, “Well, I think you should go to the police”, and he said, “No I’m not going to the police”. ‘I said, “What are you going to do?”, and he said, “Tear it up and put it in the bin where it belongs”. ‘I thought that’s what he’d done with it and then a little while later when I was going through the drawers I found the letter and I felt so uncomfortable about it I took a copy, because at that time I was going to leave him anyway, and this was just more evidence of some of the things I was having to put up with. ‘I just feel desperately sorry for this person.’ After Clifford’s case passed through Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London, Miss Westwood refused to attend his trial at Southwark Crown Court in May. She said: ‘I had thought seriously about going because I knew it would be better for him if I was there. ‘I just thought he’s just showing me no respect at all, and in the end I just thought I can see what you’re gaining from this, but actually I’m not gaining anything, other than trying to be a kind person and standing by you. ‘I was in a terrible state. I wasn’t eating, I wasn’t sleeping. It was a horrid time. ‘My mind was all over the place. One day I would think he’s going to walk away, he’s going to get off with this, another time I was thinking the evidence is so strong he can’t possibly. So I was very mixed up.’ Clifford was jailed in May on eight counts of indecent assault between 1977 and 1984 in which he used his celebrity connections to lure women . Clifford was jailed in May on eight counts of indecent assault between 1977 and 1984 in which he used his celebrity connections to lure women. His ex-wife said she was shocked by the sentence, which was upheld by appeal judges last week, adding: ‘It was a shock. But I expected him to call me because I think he knew I would be left in this media circus, but he didn’t and that was hard.’ Weeks later, a court granted her a divorce in just 105 seconds for his ‘unreasonable behaviour’, which has caused her stress and heart problems.","Former wife Jo Westwood said Clifford made 'explicit call' on honeymoon .

"The biggest corn maze in the world will downsize next year after frantic visitors who got lost inside had to call 911 to be rescued. The Cool Patch Pumpkins corn maze in Dixon, near Sacramento California spanned 63 acres this year, 20 more acres than last year. They've even been named largest corn maze in the Guinness Book of World records. The maze stayed open until 8pm, and NBC reports that frightened navigators of the maze made calls to the Solano County Sheriff's Department after sunset. Lost and scared: Worried visitors call 911 after getting caught in the The Cool Patch Pumpkins corn maze in California that spans a whopping 63 acres . 'Over the month that the maze was open, we got maybe seven calls, and in only three of those cases did the people actually call 911,' an officer told SF Gate. 'We tell them to relax and we put a call into the owner rather than send out a deputy.' Matt Cooley who has been running the maze for over 12 years and said that the 911 calls might be a sign that the labyrinth has become too large for people to explore. 'My brother, who designs the maze, always wants to make it bigger and better,' he said. 'But we might scale it back a little next year.' Despite the fact that maze explorers have been calling 911, this year has been quieter than others. In previous years people have passed out in the middle of the maze. 'In past years we’ve had people who have passed out in there,' he said. 'Nothing like that this year though — just a bunch of people who have gotten confused and called 911,' Cooley added. Cooley also told SF Gate that visitors are instructed not to call 911 but despite being warned, someone always gets frightened in the middle of the maze and makes the call. 'Sometimes you just know people will get out anyway so you let them figure it out, and sometimes we’ll get their number and talk them directly,' Cooley said. 'We’ve got guys who can navigate that thing in the dark,' Cooley added. 'So as a last resort, we’ll send in one of them to show them the way.'

"David Cameron left the Liberal Democrats reeling yesterday as a provocative carve-up of his Cabinet signalled a shift to the Right on law and order, the environment and Europe. Right-winger Chris Grayling was appointed to Justice as veteran Kenneth Clarke, dubbed the 'sixth Liberal Cabinet minister in the Coalition', was demoted. Owen Paterson, who has dismissed wind farms as a waste of money, became Environment Secretary.

Both Lib Dem and Tory MPs who oppose a third runway at Heathrow, along with Boris Johnson, expressed alarm as Transport Secretary Justine Greening, an implacable opponent of expansion of the airport, was brutally sidelined and moved to International Development. She was replaced after just ten months in the job by Chief Whip Patrick McLoughlin, who was said to have 'no baggage' over aviation. In another shock for the Lib Dems, arch-Thatcherite Michael Fallon, who has been a member of the Prime Minister's inner circle as Conservative deputy chairman, and Chancellor George Osborne's close ally Matthew Hancock were both sent to the Business Department as 'counterweights' to Business Secretary Vince Cable. Mr Osborne, who was booed by spectators at the Paralympics on Monday night, was also seen to have been bruised by the reshuffle as former Chancellor Clarke was compensated for his demotion with a roaming brief – which will focus in part on the economy. And a proposed switch to Justice for Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, mooted by Mr Osborne's allies after the two men clashed over plans to cut more from the welfare budget, failed to come off. In an embarrassing blow to the Prime Minister's authority, Mr Duncan Smith flatly turned down the move. In what was dubbed a 'morning of the blunt knives', Mr Cameron dispatched only three members of his Cabinet altogether: Commons Leader Sir George Young, Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman and Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan, who was said to have been in tears as she was sacked. The big beasts of the Government – Mr Osborne, Foreign Secretary William Hague and Home Secretary Theresa May – kept their jobs. But aides insisted the Prime Minister had cleared away what he regarded as 'roadblocks' as the Government entered an 'implementation phase'.

MPs expressed deep unease at the Cabinet's shift to the Right – with Mr . Grayling's appointment causing particular dismay. The former shadow home secretary takes a far tougher stance on law and order than Mr Clarke, and as one of the Government's staunchest Eurosceptics is likely to pick a fight with Strasbourg over prisoners' votes and human rights law. Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell said: 'The one Cabinet appointment which Liberal Democrats will look at most carefully is that of Chris Grayling. It often seems that Ken Clarke was speaking for the Lib Dems as much as the Government both in Parliament and outside.' An aide to Nick Clegg insisted he was . content with the changes – though he admitted Mr Cable had not been . consulted about the appointments to his department.

His promotion marks a spectacular turnaround in his political fortunes and could revive his ambitions to succeed Mr Cameron as Tory leader. A clearly delighted Mr Hunt said the appointment was the 'biggest honour' of his life.Paying the price for months of controversy last year over his reforms of the Health Service, Andrew Lansley was axed in an unexpected move by David Cameron.

London 2012 Olympic chief Paul Deighton was given a key Treasury job in one of the biggest surprises of the reshuffle. The former investment banker with Goldman Sachs has been appointed Commercial Secretary with responsibility for economic delivery and will take a seat in the Lords. Mr Deighton, 56, will officially take up the role in January when his contact with London 2012 ends and he will be doing the job unpaid. A move to Health had been mooted before the controversy erupted, but was thought to have been killed off as the Government awaits the verdict of the Leveson Inquiry into media standards, at which Mr Hunt received a tough grilling. Liberal Democrats refused to back him in a Commons vote called by Labour on his future, in an episode regarded by Mr Cameron as a low point for Coalition relations. But despite the cloud hanging over Mr Hunt as Lord Leveson prepares his report, the PM is understood to believe he has 'been through the mill' and emerged stronger. The appointment comes despite potentially controversial views Mr Hunt holds on homeopathy and abortion. In 2007, he signed an Commons motion backing the work of homeopathic hospitals. He voted to reduce the abortion time limit from 24 weeks to 12 weeks in 2008. And he co-authored a book with Tory MEP Daniel Hannan which suggested the NHS might need to be 'dismantled' and claimed it was no longer 'relevant'.","Chris Grayling takes over Justice Secretary from Kenneth Clarke, dubbed the 'sixth Liberal Cabinet minister in the Coalition'

"When it comes to Jane Austen classics, most would assume any narrator of one of the novels to have a strong British accent and a somewhat regal sense about them. This however was not the case when Australian comedian Dave 'Hughesy' Hughes decided to present his own version of Pride and Prejudice on a packed train in the middle of peak-hour. On Tuesday morning the 43-year-old - while positioned right in the centre of a crowded Sydney train carriage - opened up the Austen classic and began to read the 19th century novel aloud in his thick Australian accent. Scroll down for video . Aussie comic Dave Hughes brightened the morning of many commuters on Tuesday when he began reading a Jane Austen novel aloud on the train . Footage shows the comedian holding the book up while standing in between others passengers, before - to the surprise of his fellow commuters - he breaks out into narration. 'She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him,' Hughes began, earning a few strange looks from others travelling on the City Circle loop that morning. One man standing behind the comedian stifles a smile and looks around as though he's unsure whether what he's seeing is a joke or not. Reciting passages from the Austen classic Pride and Prejudice, his thick Australian accent jarred with the old-style writing . Passengers weren't sure how to react to the stunt, and many such as the man in white (far right) stifled laughs . As Hughes continues he gets few smiles and nods from fellow passengers as he looks around the carriage. He then treats those listening to a turning point in the novel, where Mr Darcy at long last admits his love to Elizabeth Bennett. 'In vain have I struggled, it will not do. My feelings will not be repressed,' he read. 'You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you,' Hughes continued playing the part of Mr Darcy. Making for an interesting Mr Darcy, Hughes did the gig as part of a campaign for Audible Australia . Train passengers clapped and cheered for the comedian's performance before they got off the train . While some Sydneysiders took out their smartphones to capture the scene unfolding, others listened intently as The Project host continued to speak. As the train pulled up to Town Hall station commuters laughed as Hughes concluded his passage, while some cheered and others clapped as the train doors opened. 'I never took you as a Jane Austen fan,' one commuter quipped as he disembarked the train. The stunt appears to have been part of Audible.com's Australian launch, providing those Down Under with a series of audiobooks read by Aussie celebs and available for free. Hughes is known for his stand-up comedy but is also a regular host on Channel Ten's The Project .","Dave Hughes surprised Sydney train passengers on Tuesday morning .

"Psychiatrist Russ Scott and historian Ian MacFarlane discredited the romantic folklore surrounding the story of Ned Kelly . A Queensland psychiatrist and a Victorian historian have teamed up to discredit the romantic legend of Ned Kelly and claim he was a psychopath. Dr Russ Scott and Ian MacFarlane also argue that the Australian bushranger, who was hung in 1880 at 25 years of age, never uttered his famous last words 'such is life', in their article which was published in the Psychiatry, Psychology and Law journal. Instead, Scott and MacFarlane discuss the idea that the folk hero was a 'pathological liar' and 'violent psychopath' who led a 'parasitic lifestyle'. Their article, titled Ned Kelly - Stock Thief, Bank Robber, Murderer-Psychopath, analyses the mind and behaviour of the outlaw, beginning with his family life in Victoria. It claims that the early death of Kelly's father 'compounded by the absence of opportunity and advancement, would have made it difficult for an even better man, with a stronger sense of self actualisation and internalised pro-social values, to have prevailed and prospered'. 'In the chaos of an adverse early development which was devoid of nurturing and which lacked the presence of strong, responsible male role models, Kelly modelled the social delinquency and disrespect for order and authority of his extended family and their anti-social associates. 'The crushing poverty, disadvantage and insecurity that his family experienced as poor Irish-Australian selectors, can be speculated to have imbued the young Kelly with an angry, defiant disposition and an aggrieved perspective on society and its norms and rules.' Instead, they discuss the idea that the Aussie hero was a 'pathological liar' and 'violent psychopath' who led a 'parasitic lifestyle' The article summarises that Kelly had no empathy for others, such as his victims and their families and that that he 'practised at repeatedly claiming to have been wronged' Detailing his early crimes, from stealing a calf at 10-years-old to his escalation into a full-blown outlaw when he was responsible for killing three policemen 1878, the article summarises that Kelly had no empathy for others including his victims and their families. Instead, Scott and MacFarlane claim that Kelly was parasitic in that he 'practised at repeatedly claiming to have been wronged' and thus shifting blame elsewhere. They argue that this is evident in the way that he defended killing the three officers as an action of self-defence. This, in addition to arguments that he often lied and fabricated incidents and the lack of evidence that he had many friendships or intimate relationships, lead the authors to conclude that Kelly was undoubtedly a psychopath who was feared rather than loved in his community. The article detailed that his early crimes, from stealing a calf at 10-years-old, to his escalation into a full-blown outlaw when he was responsible for killing three policemen 1878 (pictured) Scott and MacFarlane wrote in their journal article, that Kelly's famous last words 'such is life', were likely to be a myth as the noise from the Catholic chaplain and footsteps on the metal floor would have meant his words were inaudible to those watching from the floor below . However, perhaps their most devastating claim is that the bushranger never uttered his famous last words 'such is life', or the alternative, 'ah well, I suppose it has come to this'. Scott and MacFarlane write: 'The footsteps and shuffling on the metal floor and the murmured prayers of Dean O'Hare, the Catholic chaplain who accompanied Kelly as he was prepared for execution, would have ensured that nothing of what Kelly may have said would have been audible to those watching from the floor below in the cavernous prison hall. 'The accounts published … are apocryphal.'","Psychiatrist Russ Scott and historian Ian MacFarlane discredit the romantic legend in their Psychiatry, Psychology and Law journal article .

"Hook-handed hate preacher: Abu Hamza was jailed for telling his followers that killing non-Muslims was justified . A group of MPs who visited hate-preacher Abu Hamza in his jail cell have published his views in an official report. Members of the home affairs select committee went to high-security Belmarsh prison to interview the cleric who was jailed after telling his followers that the murder of non-Muslims was justified 'even if there is no reason'. Their report on violent radicalism is published today and includes an uncritical summary of Hamza's comments. He is referred to respectfully throughout as 'Mr Abu Hamza'. Families of terror attack victims condemned the committee and its chairman, Labour MP Keith Vaz. Graham Foulkes, whose 22-year-old son David was murdered in the Edgware Road bombing on July 7, 2005, said the visit was 'deeply inappropriate'. He said: 'I think what they are doing by visiting him in jail is legitimising his claims and his beliefs, which are to kill and maim men and women and to destroy our society. 'The worrying thing is that as a result Hamza will tell his followers, “Look, they are taking me seriously”.' Douglas Murray of the Henry Jackson Society think-tank said: 'A substantial number of terrorist attacks at home and abroad have happened because Abu Hamza and a few others preached hate. But he basically blames us in the West for these atrocities. 'Why a select committee has to grant him an interview and then publish these views is a mystery. High security Belmarsh Prison where Hamza is being held and where MPs visited to canvass his views . 'For a report into homicide you would not go into prison and interview Ian Huntley and Dennis Nilsen.' Until his arrest, Hamza preached freely at the Finsbury Park mosque in north London, turning it into a haven for radical Islamists. Experts say his firebrand sermons influenced those behind numerous terror attacks around the world, including three of the July 7 bombers. Hamza was jailed for 11 years in 2006 for inciting murder and racial hatred after a jury heard that as well as advocating the murder of non-Muslims, he heaped praise on child suicide bombers and said the Holocaust and Hitler were sent from God to punish Jewish people. The judge said Hamza commended and encouraged suicide bombing and urged his followers to 'kill in the cause you set out for them'. The committee, whose members include Labour, Tory and Lib Dem MPs, spent around half an hour with Hamza in Belmarsh last November, and interviewed other Muslim prisoners. A summary of Hamza's views is included in an annexe to the MPs' report entitled 'The Roots of Violent Radicalisation'. It states: 'Abu Hamza believed the drivers of radicalisation to be grievance, guilt and capability. Grievances were driven by British foreign policy (relating to Palestine and Afghanistan) and a sense that the Prophet was being mocked.' Keith Vaz's committee was criticised by families of terror attacks such as Graham Foulkes, father of David (right) who was killed in the Edgware road bombing on July 7 . The report repeats, without comment, Hamza's denial that his sermons contributed to radicalisation, and his claim that he was against 'the wrong kind of violence' where third parties were injured or killed. There is only a brief mention of his convictions. Hamza has been accused of continuing to preach from his prison cell via piping in the wall. Prison staff told the MPs the cleric still had 'influence' over other inmates in the high-security unit. It says: 'In terms of radicalisation in prisons, Mr Abu Hamza noted that prisons were a good environment for contemplation and that it was usual for prisoners to seek to re-evaluate their lives.' The report published today says that Al Qaeda is trying to recruit women as suicide bombers in Britain via extremist websites. Although the 7/7 attackers were home-grown extremists, there has never been a female suicide bomber from the British mainland. Jailed: Extremist Roshonara Choudhry, 21, who attempted to stab to death Labour MP Stephen Timms . Sana'a Mehaidli, a Syrian who killed herself in Lebanon in 1985, is the first woman on record to blow herself up in an act of terror. However, officials believe it is only a matter of time before a British-born women commits such an atrocity. Female extremist Roshonara Choudhry, 21, was jailed for life in November 2010 for attempting to stab to death Labour MP Stephen Timms in his constituency. She had been radicalised online. However, the report says the internet is now the main way of recruiting terrorists as hate preachers have been driven underground. 'More resources need to be directed to . these threats and to preventing radicalisation through the Internet and . in private spaces,' committee chairman Keith Vaz said. 'These are the fertile breeding grounds for terrorism'. Attempts to launch a crackdown on extremist websites are likely to meet . an angry backlash amid fears of creeping web censorship. Internet Service Providers have also complained that they will struggle to grapple with the sheer quantity of material. Last week, prosecutors said four . Islamists, who admitted plotting to bomb the London Stock Exchange, had . been inspired by the online propaganda of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen linked to Al Qaeda's Yemeni branch who was killed last year in a . CIA drone strike. Woolwich Crown Court was told how the group had also planned to target London mayor Boris Johnson. The report concludes that violent radicalism is declining within Britain's Muslim community. It urges ministers to combat 'perceptions of Islamophobia' in Britain and 'demonstrate that the British state is not antithetical to Islam', and calls on internet providers to monitor radical sites more closely. It is thought Hamza has cost British taxpayers at least £3.5million in legal fees, NHS bills, benefits and prison costs since his arrival three decades ago. He has used a prosthetic arm since losing both arms and an eye in an explosion in Afghanistan, and his cell has been fitted with £650 taps which he can operate with his hook. He is fighting extradition to the United States on terror charges. Last night Mr Vaz said: 'In the past Belmarsh Prison has been criticised for not tackling the issue of radicalisation effectively. 'What we saw was that great strides had been made by the staff to ensure that those who may influence vulnerable people were completely isolated and monitored carefully.'","Al Qaeda is trying to recruit female suicide bombers in Britain, MPs warn .

"Thousands of National Australia Bank customers could win a share of up to $40 million after the company signalled it would settle a class action lawsuit over unfair bank fees. The bank's chief executive Andrew Thorburn said paperwork had been filed in court last week in 'a first but significant step towards reaching a potential settlement', the Herald Sun reported. NAB's decision is expected to put pressure on Australia's other big banks to settle prolonged class actions launched by customers in 2010 and 2011 in order to reclaim exorbitant bank fees, including late payment fees on credit cards. Scroll down for video . About 30,000 National Australia Bank customers could win a share of up to $40 million after the company signalled it would settle a class action lawsuit over unfair bank fees . Law firm Maurice Blackburn launched the class action against NAB, Commonwealth Bank, Westpac and Citibank in 2011 following a class action against ANZ launched in 2010 to the value of $197 million in total. The law firm said the claim affected 30,000 NAB customers, 45,000 Commonwealth Bank customers, 38,000 ANZ customers, 30,000 Westpac customers and 10,000 Citibank customers. On Tuesday night Mr Thorburn sent a letter to members of NAB's Advisory Council on Corporate Responsibility stating the bank was committed to making things right with customers. 'We are doing this because we believe this is the right thing to do for our customers and our business,' Mr Thorburn wrote. The bank's chief executive Andrew Thorburn said paperwork had been filed in court last week in 'a first but significant step towards reaching a potential settlement' 'Doing the right thing must be reflected not in our words, but in our actions.' If the class action is opened, other customers wanting to join the NAB Bank Fees Class Action and participate in any potential settlement will be able to register.

'Any announcements about this process will be made by IMF and the applicants’ solicitors Maurice Blackburn.' A Federal Court hearing has been set for November 18.

"A notorious fugitive who's been evading authorities since 1998, when he faked his own death just before his trial on child sex-abuse charges, has been captured in Montana. Daniel Clement Chafe, 55, was taken into custody Wednesday in Bozeman where he had been living under a different name, Lieutenant Gregg Hastings said. Chafe had been living in a city near Bozeman where he owned a computer business and used the alias Gwydyn Stryder Styarfyr. Captured: Daniel Clement Chafe, 55, was taken into custody Wednesday in Bozeman, Montana, where he had been living under an assumed name . The FBI said the married Chafe was recruiting girls between of the ages of 14 and 16 to form what he dubbed the 'Cobalt Clan' when he was arrested 15 years ago. 'His reported goal was to have sex with these young girls in order to produce a large number of children over which he could rule,' according to the FBI's most wanted poster. Wanted: Chafe was missing for 15 years before he was finally captured Wednesday . Police arrested him on charges of rape, sodomy and sex abuse of two teenage girls, and said they had identified other victims. Chafe moved to New Mexico during the investigation and worked as a computer technician. On September 13, 1998 - 10 days before his scheduled trial in Roseburg - a friend with whom he had gone fishing in Washington state told authorities that Chafe fell overboard and was missing. A search failed to find him, and investigators considered him a fugitive. He became the subject of several television shows, including 'America's Most Wanted,' and was in consideration for the FBI's Top 10 list, Hastings said. The friend who told authorities that Chafe went overboard has not been charged with a crime at this point, Hastings said. 'Obviously we've got to learn what's gone on over the last 15 years,' he said. Authorities in Roseburg declined to discuss the late 1990s investigation on Friday. Undersheriff Dan Springer of Gallatin County, Montana, said detectives have found no evidence that Chafe was trying to recruit Montana girls. Held: Chafe is in prison Bozeman, Montana but will be returning to Oegon his trial . 'We have no indication [of that] and we do not have any kind of investigation into charges of that nature,' he said. Chafe remains in a Montana jail pending extradition to Roseburg, where he faces six counts of third-degree rape, five counts of third-degree sexual abuse and seven counts of third-degree sodomy. Hastings said an Oregon State Police detective recently uncovered evidence that Chafe was living under an assumed name in Montana. Chafe was arrested during a traffic stop by FBI agents, the Gallatin County Sheriff's Office and the Montana Highway Patrol.","Daniel Clement Chafe, 55, has been arrested in Montana after 15 years in hiding .

"The EU was today imposing new sanctions on Russian energy giants in a move which is expected to provoke a strong response from the Kremlin. Leaks suggested that giants Rosneft, Gazpromneft and Transneft were all hit in a bid to change Vladimir Putin's policies on Ukraine. The companies are more than 50 per cent state owned. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko sings the National anthem during his visit to the Mariupol Metallurgic Plant  in the eastern Ukrainian city Mariupol . Warning: Ukraine's Yatsenyuk, right, says that President Putin wants his country to remain under Russian influence . The tough new measures against Russia will be unveiled as Ukraine today accused pro-Moscow rebels of waging fresh attacks in eastern Ukraine despite a ceasefire imposed on Friday. The sanctions are expected to prevent them raising funds for periods longer than 30 days, effectively shutting them off from EU capital markets. Action is also expected against two dozen senior Russian names including those in Mr Putin's circle. Tough new sanctions against Russia have been unveiled by the EU, with some set to target associates of President Vladimir Putin (left) and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev (right) Rosneft, an oil monolith, is run by Mr Putin's close associate Igor Sechin. Gazpromneft is an oil-production and refining subsidiary of OAO Gazprom, while Transeft is involved in oil transportation. Military linked companies Oboronprom, United Aircraft Corp. and Uralvagonzavod are also expected to be prevented from fundraising in the EU. Formal approval of the measures was expected later on Monday. They are expected to come into effect on Tuesday. It came as Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko made a surprise trip to the key southeastern city of Mariupol - a symbolic show of strength in a strategic government-held area that has come under rebel fire in recent days. Mr Poroshenko addressed hundreds of workers in hard hats at a metal plant in the embattled coastal city, and then tweeted: 'I just arrived in Mariupol. This is our Ukrainian land and we'll never give it up to anyone.

Mr Poroshenko addressed hundreds of workers in hard hats at a metal plant in the embattled coastal city, and then tweeted: 'I just arrived in Mariupol. This is our Ukrainian land and we'll never give it up to anyone. This city was, is, and will be Ukrainian.' The president spoke from a stage decorated with Ukraine's blue-and-yellow colours after leading the room in singing the national anthem. The president added that Ukraine had secured the release of 1,200  'prisoners' who had been taken captive by pro-Russian rebels during their five-month separatist uprising. Mr Poroshenko's trip to the strategic port, just days after it faced sustained rebel fire, underscored that Kiev is unlikely to willingly loosen what remains of its grip on Ukraine's rebellious east. It also came as a tenuous cease-fire appeared to be holding Monday between the Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian troops in eastern Ukraine. A defence spokesman earlier said that Ukrainian positions were still coming under sporadic attack despite the ceasefire.

Russia has placed 64 tanks and 100 armoured vehicles at the border of Crimea and Kherson region, said National Security and Defence Council spokesman Andriy Lysenko. He claimed that near the town of Chernomorsk in annexed Crimea a field hospital had been set up, and that seven large assault landing ships are located in the Black Sea. Russian and U.S. officials will meet in Moscow on Thursday to discuss a nuclear arms treaty whose future is in doubt. Washington and Moscow have questioned each other's commitment to the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty and their relationship has deteriorated over the Ukraine crisis. Interfax new agency quoted Mikhail Ulyanov, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's non-proliferation and arms control department, as saying talks  would take place this week involving Rose Gottemoeller, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. The INF treaty eliminated nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of 300-3,400 miles near the end of the Cold War. The U.S. says Russia has violated the treaty by testing a ground-launched cruise missile that is banned under the accord. Meanwhile Russia has questioned Washington's observation of the treaty, saying U.S. use of armed drones amounted to a violation of its terms. He also alleged that Russia had massed military hardware at Sloviyanoserbsk in Lugansk region. After representatives of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) left a roadblock of the Ukrainian National Guard there, it was surrounded by four T-72 Russian tanks, two airborne combat vehicles, two armoured infantry vehicles, four mechanized infantry combat vehicles and about 70 soldiers. EU President Herman Van Rompuy said the new sanctions due to be approved on Monday could be reviewed if the ceasefire was 'durable'. 'We have noted that Russia only consented with difficulty to serious negotiations. The ceasefire is an important step, but it is only a step,' he said. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has vowed to respond to any new sanctions, hinting that Western air companies would be barred from using Siberian airspace for flights between Europe and Asia. If the Russian energy and financial industries are hit, then 'we will have to respond asymmetrically - for example, with restrictions in the transport sphere.' If European airlines are forced to fly around Russian airspace - for example on routes to and from Asia on which they overfly Siberia - it could threaten their viability, he said. 'It may lead to bankruptcy of many airlines that are teetering on the brink of survival,' he said. 'We would just like our partners to realise that', he said. And in a further development, there were new fears for the Ukraine ceasefire today as premier Arseniy Yatsenyuk accused Vladimir Putin of sucking his country's blood while warning Kiev would impose martial law. Fragile ceasefire: Ukrainian soldiers guard a checkpoint as the tense truce entered its third day . The premier alleged Mr Putin's plan remained unchanged - to dismember Ukraine as a country - despite a truce which is already under strain three days after it was signed. He said that If the ceasefire breaks, Ukraine would impose martial law despite Western objections. 'This means that the entire country will be running on entirely military lines, starting from civil defence and ending with the military command having full power on Ukrainian territory,' he said in an interview on Kiev's One Plus One TV. People take advantage of a break in fighting to queue for food outside a Red Cross building in Mariupol . 'This is war. We have one now. It has not been legally declared. But it's war.' He forecast the West would object because martial law would close off talks on a peace plan and resolving the crisis by non-military methods, but he questioned Mr Putin's sincerity over Ukraine. 'Do I believe the Russian Federation and its president? Categorically, no,' he said. 'Has President Putin changed his plans? Under no circumstances. 'His plan is to return Ukraine to the Russian sphere of influence by any means - by conquering it militarily or politically, or by destroying the state as such.' The port city of Mariupol, above, has been hit by shelling in recent days despite the ongoing ceasefire . President Putin's aim was to turn eastern Ukraine into 'unrecognised republics' like Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia or Transnistria in Moldova, where Russia holds sway, and grave damage has been done already to Lugansk and Donetsk, he said. 'He wants to control and via his mercenaries suck Ukraine's blood,' he said. 'All the infrastructure is destroyed. We've reached the point where we have problems with coal, because they targeted mines with their rockets and tanks. They have blown up railways. They destroyed the energy sector as such.' Stating that Ukraine would end its dependence on Russian gas in five years as it turns towards the West, he said there could be no return to 'business as usual' with Moscow. 'The world does not have the right to forget about Russian aggression. Russia must pay the price. Yes, we are for making peace. But we are also for ensuring that those who breached the peace, who violated the UN charter, violated all possible and impossible bilateral and multilateral agreements, pay the price. And that is the Russian Federation.' He claimed the ceasefire was necessary now 'in order to save lives', allow troops to regroup. But he appeared to doubt that the conditions exist for a lasting truce, amid fighting in three cities since it came into operation. He added that the conditions were that 'the shooting stops. Second, Mr Putin withdraws his mercenaries, his army and his hardware. Third, Ukraine fully restores control over the state border.'","Ukraine says that despite ceasefire their positions are still under attack .

"Captain America, the Hulk and Iron Man relied on the incredible 'Helicarrier' to launch their planes from the air in the 2012 The Avengers film. And now, the US military is taking a leaf out of Marvel's comic after it invited people to submit ideas for future 'aircraft carriers in the sky.' The hope is that these flying fortresses will someday carry, launch and recover multiple swarms of drones anywhere in the world. Scroll down for video . Darpa has invited people to submit ideas for future 'aircraft carriers in the sky.' The hopes is that these flying fortresses will someday carry, launch and recover multiple swarms of potentially deadly drones anywhere in the world. Artist's impression pictured . According to Darpa - the Pentagon's advanced military technology research agency - military air operations typically rely on large, manned, robust aircraft. But such missions put these expensive aircraft, and their pilots, at risk. And while small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) can reduce or eliminate such risks, they lack the speed, range and endurance of larger aircraft. Darpa believes the solution is to create a flying Avengers-style platform that can rapidly carry these drones wherever needed. The concept resembles Helicarrier (pictured) used in the 2012 film The Avengers. Captain America, the Hulk and Iron Man relied on this craft to launch their planes from the air . 'We want to find ways to make smaller aircraft more effective, and one promising idea is enabling existing large aircraft, with minimal modification, to become 'aircraft carriers in the sky',' said Dan Patt, Darpa project manager. Drones that can choose to deviate from a set mission and hunt in ‘swarms’ could be patrolling skies within the next 25 years, according to a recent roadmap. Unmanned aircraft carrying stronger chemical weapons could also be on the horizon, the US Department of Defence (DoD) revealed in its Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap. While the document sets out plans for unmanned maritime, land and air vehicles, there is a lot of focus on the future capability of controversial drones, which, if the plans come to fruition, could deviate from mission commands set by humans if they spot a better target. The DoD's roadmap also features plans for deadly ‘swarms’ of drone-bombs that are launched from an unmanned ‘mothership’ to circle the skies while a human operator searches for targets for the drones to crash into, guided by the bots’ on-board cameras. 'We envision innovative launch and recovery concepts for new UAS designs that would couple with recent advances in small payload design and collaborative technologies.' The new project, called Distributed Airborne Capabilities, is likely to use a plane similar to the B-52 Stratofortress bomber, B-1B Lancer bomber or C-130 Hercules cargo plane, according to a report by The Washington Post. Darpa is also involved in another initiative, dubbed the Hydra Project, which is aiming to develop a network of undersea 'motherships', capable of deploying both underwater and aerial drones. Meanwhile, the US Air Force is developing tiny unmanned drones that will fly in swarms, hover like bees, crawl like spiders and even sneak up on unsuspecting. The Air Vehicles Directorate, a research arm of the Air Force, last year released a computer-animated video outlining the future capabilities of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). 'MAVs will become a vital element in the ever-changing war-fighting environment and will help ensure success on the battlefield of the future,' the video explained. 'Unobtrusive, pervasive, lethal - Micro Air Vehicles, enhancing the capabilities of the future war fighter.' Air Force officials have already produced tiny remote-control prototypes - but they consume so much power that can only operate for a few minutes. Researchers estimate that it will take several years of advances in battery technology to make the designs feasible. This new project, called Distributed Airborne Capabilities, is likely to use a plane similar to the B-52 Stratofortress bomber, B-1B Lancer bomber (pictured) or C-130 Hercules cargo plane . Darpa, the Pentagon's Virgina-based military research agency, claims these flying fortresses will overcome the limits of speed, range and endurance typically associated with drones .","Darpa has invited people to submit ideas for a 'flying aircraft carrier'

"Jeremy Hunt privately urged David Cameron to back Rupert Murdoch’s BSkyB takeover bid just weeks before the Prime Minister put him in charge of ruling on the issue, it emerged last night. In a bombshell email, the Culture Secretary lavished praise on the £8 billion bid. Mr Hunt said it would allow Mr Murdoch’s son James to create ‘the world’s first multi-platform media operator’ and insisted that  if it was blocked the ‘media sector will suffer for years’. Controversial: Jeremy Hunt, left, was put in charge of dealing with BSkyB bid by David Cameron, right, after Vince Cable lost the role . The Premier will now face tough questions over why he gave Mr Hunt responsibility for the bid, despite knowing that he had been privately cheerleading for the Murdochs. Critics will also question the wisdom of Mr Cameron joining Mr Murdoch and News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks for a cosy Christmas lunch just a month later where the bid was discussed. Admission: Adam Smith admitted his contacts with News Corp were too close . Harriet Harman led the charge against Mr Hunt today telling BBC Breakfast the evidence of his wrongdoing was 'absolutely massive', arguing that instead of judging the Murdochs’ bid, he was backing it. 'There are two bits of evidence, actual straightforward evidence, that Jeremy Hunt was not impartial, he was meddling before he even took over the bid and was on the side of the Murdochs,' she said. 'The first was that he had to be warned off by the civil servants not to have any more meetings with Rupert Murdoch but he kept up the contact through his special adviser, and secondly he wrote a memo to the Prime Minister.' The Culture Secretary’s message, revealed in evidence to the Leveson inquiry into media standards yesterday, told Mr Cameron it would be ‘totally wrong to cave in’ to critics of the bid, including BBC director-general Mark Thompson, Channel 4 and the Guardian newspaper. Mr Hunt said James Murdoch was ‘pretty furious’ that Business Secretary Vince Cable had referred the bid to media regulator Ofcom. He asked for a meeting with Mr Cameron, Mr Cable and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to discuss the handling of the deal. The disclosure appears directly to contradict Mr Hunt’s insistence to MPs last  month that he had made ‘absolutely no interventions seeking to influence a quasi-judicial decision that was at that time the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Business’. It piles pressure on both Mr Hunt and Mr Cameron in the row over the Government’s handling of the BSkyB bid, which other media organisations argued would hand the Murdoch empire an unassailable dominance in Britain. Downing Street admitted that the then Cabinet Secretary Gus O’Donnell was not made aware of the private message when he was asked to determine weeks later whether Mr Hunt could act as an impartial judge of the deal, given his previous statements of admiration for Mr Murdoch. Mr Cameron handed Mr Hunt responsibility for determining the bid after Mr Cable, who had previously been in charge of the issue, was caught on tape boasting that he had ‘declared war’ on News Corporation. The Culture Secretary’s representations had already been the subject of legal warnings from his own department, according to the counsel to the Leveson inquiry, Robert Jay. Revelations: Mr Hunt said James Murdoch, left was ‘pretty furious’ that Business Secretary Vince Cable, right, had referred the bid to media regulator Ofcom . He said the Department for Culture, Media and Sport’s legal director had advised that although it was not illegal for him to attempt to intervene, to do so would be ‘unwise’. A picture of the cosy relationship between the Murdoch empire and the department emerged at the inquiry yesterday, with evidence that News Corp’s chief lobbyist Frederic Michel exchanged more than 1,000 phone calls, emails and texts with the Culture Secretary’s team during News Corp’s BSkyB takeover bid. Most were to and from Mr Hunt’s special adviser Adam Smith, who has already had to quit, admitting his contacts with News Corp went beyond what had been authorised by the Culture Secretary. Mr Michel and Mr Hunt became close after their wives both gave birth at London’s Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in May 2010. By October of that year, Mr Michel was emailing Mr Smith in connection with a News Corp briefing memo for Mr Hunt on the BSkyB issues. Mr Smith answered: ‘Jeremy’s response to this – “persuasive”.’ After BBC boss Mr Thompson used a speech to the Edinburgh Television Festival to raise concerns about Sky’s dominance, Mr Hunt sent Mr Michel a message saying: ‘Because he trains his guns on you, he failed to make his case to me.’ When he assumed responsibility for determining the bid in a ‘quasi-judicial’ fashion, Mr Hunt told Mr Michel: ‘All contact with me now needs to be through official channels until decision made.’ But the pair did exchange some text messages after this. After the Culture Secretary appeared in the House of Commons, and the French-born Mr Michel texted to congratulate him, Mr Hunt replied: ‘Merci! Large drink tonight.’ When the News Corp lobbyist told Mr Hunt he had been ‘very good’ on Andrew Marr’s BBC  programme, to which he replied again: ‘Merci.’ In another text, the Culture Secretary said: ‘Merci hopefully when consultation over we can have a coffee like the old days.’ In the key memo to the Prime Minister, dated November 19, 2010, Mr Hunt, who had spoken to James Murdoch on the telephone a few days earlier, wrote: ‘James Murdoch is pretty furious at Vince’s referral to Ofcom. He does not think he will get a fair hearing from Ofcom.’ He did add the caveat that it would be ‘totally wrong’ for the Government to get involved in a competition issue, which should be decided at arms length. But he said: ‘However, I do think you, I, Vince and the DPM should meet to discuss the policy issues that are thrown up as a result.’  Government sources said the meeting never took place. Mr Smith, giving evidence to the inquiry yesterday, was initially reluctant to concede that the Culture Secretary had backed the Murdoch bid from the outset. Under lengthy questioning from Mr Jay, he eventually admitted, however, that Hunt’s ‘personal view’ was in fact favourable. A Number 10 source said all the views expressed in the memo to Mr Cameron had already been put into the public domain by the Culture Secretary, including in newspaper interviews. Gus O’Donnell advised that what personal views he had previously expressed about the Murdochs, privately or publicly, was not the key point. It was about how he would conduct himself in the future,’ the source said. A source close to Mr Hunt insisted he had not wanted to take on responsibility for the bid. ‘Nobody did,’ the source said. ‘You were either going to end up with every newspaper organisation in the land or the Murdoch empire hating you. ‘What Jeremy did at every stage was to bring in independent regulators to ensure this process was fair. He was well aware that his opinions on the bid would make people think that he wasn’t handling it fairly.’ Harriet Harman, Labour’s deputy leader said: ‘It is clear that Jeremy Hunt was not the impartial arbiter he was required to be, and he should already have resigned.’","Harriet Harman says the evidence of Hunt's wrongdoing was 'absolutely massive'

"He is known for testing audiences with his audacious and risqué jokes. But comedian Roy ‘Chubby’ Brown’s own sense of humour was pushed to its limit when he picked up a parking ticket in a hospital car park while giving a donation to its cancer unit. The comic returned to his car after handing over a £5,000 cheque to the Endeavour Unit at the James Cook University Hospital to find a £50 penalty notice on the windscreen. Brown, whose real name is Royston Vasey, was handed the fine by private company Carillion even though he had been given permission to park where he did.

The South Tees Hospital Trust yesterday apologised to the comedian, adding that he found the incident ‘highly amusing’.

Laughing off the fine, a spokeswoman for Brown said: ‘Roy reckons it must have been the same guy who put a parking ticket on the Queen’s Rolls Royce outside Buckingham Palace.’ Dr Clive Peedell, a cancer specialist at the hospital, wrote on Twitter: ‘Big thanks to Roy Chubby Brown for donating £5,000 to our cancer centre.

Video footage showed Brown driving the car with the newspaper spread across his steering wheel. He pleaded guilty by post to driving without due care and attention at Northallerton Magistrates’ Court. The Daily Mail has led a campaign against the unscrupulous and heavy-handed approach taken by some of the private parking companies that run many NHS car parks. As a result of the campaign, health secretary Jeremy Hunt promised a raft of new measures meaning that parking operators can no longer impose fines for trivial infringements. A spokesman for the trust said: ‘Mr Vasey had permission to park where he did for the duration of the cheque presentation. ‘We have apologised to Mr Vasey for the oversight, which he found highly amusing, and we are very grateful to him for the very generous donation he made.’","Comic made donation to unit that treated his throat cancer a decade ago .

"With its cascading vertical gardens and seemingly levitating levels, Sydney's mesmerising skyscraper titled One Central Park, has been declared the Best Tall Building Worldwide. The new building took out the top gong awarded by Chicago organisation, the Council on Tall Building and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), this year after being picked out from amongst 88 other entries and being recognised as the clear winner in the Asia-Australia region category. Antony Wood, CTBUH's executive director said the entry 'stopped me dead'. Sydney's One Central Park Building has been recognised as the Best Tall Building Worldwide . It features a 1,120 square metre cascading vertical garden that is made up of over 35,000 plants . 'There have been major advances in the incorporation of greenery in high-rise buildings over the past few years – but nothing on the scale of this building has been attempted or achieved,' Mr Wood said. 'One Central Park strongly points the way forward, not only for an essential naturalization of our built environment, but for a new aesthetic for our cities – an aesthetic entirely appropriate to the environmental challenges of our age.' Designed by Nobel Prize winner Jean Nouvel, the 38-floor glass building which hosts shops and apartments, features 1,120 square metres of vertical garden. This is made up of over 35,000 plants of over 250 Australian native species. Other winners from around the world included the De Rotterdam building in the Netherlands, which one the best tall building award in the European category . They are watered through a drip-irrigation system and are able to grow without soil due to being attached to a water-soaked felt and mesh base, according to The Guardian. The building's sustainable features, which include its own water recycling plant, a tri-generation power plant and a cantilevered heliostat, left the judges in awe.

"He has been praised for his star performance as the code breaker Alan Turing in his latest film role. But it seems Benedict Cumberbatch’s uncanny resemblance to his subject may be down to more than just good acting…because it turns out they are related. The actor, 38, is a distant cousin of the celebrated mathematician, who broke the German Enigma code during World War Two. Benedict Cumberbatch, pictured in a scene from The Imitation Game, is a distant cousin of the celebrated mathematician Alan Turing who broke the German Enigma code during World War Two . He plays Turing in The Imitation Game, which is released in UK cinemas on Friday. Both men share a common 15th century ancestor, John Beaufort, the Earl of Somerset, making them 17th cousins, experts from the genealogy website Ancestry said. Turing helped alter the course of the war after he created a machine that allowed the Allies to read secret German messages. Alan Turing (pictured) helped alter the course of the war after he created a machine that allowed the Allies to read secret German messages . But he was persecuted by the British Establishment because of his homosexuality and is thought to have killed himself in 1954 by eating a poisoned apple. It is not the first time Cumberbatch’s ancestry has revealed surprising parallels with his film roles. The star, who won plaudits for playing a slave owner in 12 Years A Slave last year, is also descended from a long line of slave owners in Barbados. Earlier this year, a New York City commissioner, Stacey Cumberbatch, claimed she gained her distinctive surname because her ancestors were owned by the star’s fifth great-grandfather on a sugar plantation. Cumberbatch once said his part in another anti-slavery film – Amazing Grace – was a sort of apology’ for his ancestry. He also revealed that his mother, the actress Wanda Ventham, once urged him not to use his real surname professionally in case it made him a target for reparation claims by the descendants of slaves. Miriam Silverman from Ancestry said: ‘It’s amazing to think that when stepping into the role of Alan Turing, he would not only be portraying a world class code breaker but a real life relation.’","Benedict Cumberbatch, 38, stars as Alan Turing in The Imitation Game .

"As Eurostar marks 20 years since it connected the UK and Europe with high-speed underwater rail, its numbers really are adding up. More than 145 million passengers have been taken to and from the Continent across two decades, according to a new infographic to celebrate the anniversary on November 14, 2014. Along with facts and figures, the graph reveals some of the high-profile travellers that have step foot on board the train - including One Direction, Rihanna and Madonna. On average, a Eurostar train speeds along at 186mph, not far short of the UK train speed record of 208mph set by Eurostar in 2003. The 750-person capacity of a train is that of two Boeing 747s while the combined length of the carriages is 90m longer than London landmark The Shard. In terms of power, a Eurostar train punches out 1,600kw - a figure equal to 20 of Lewis Hamilton's Formula One cars. After passengers reach its lowest depth of 75 metres beneath the Channel Tunnel, a Eurostar train can reach more than 100 destinations in six countries either directly or via connecting lines. In 2016 a new direct service will be introduced between London and Amsterdam. Each year, the catering section now delivers 150,000 Great British breakfasts and 2.15million cups of coffes are served on board, while 33,000 bottles of champagne were opened in business class last year. And the numbers are still racking up - in 2015 Eurostar welcome a new fleet of e320 trains which will boast 20 per cent more capacity and be able to hit an average of 200mph (320kmh).","Eurostar is celebrating its 20th anniversary on November 14, 2014 .

"Reformer: Nick Boles want to revamp planning reforms to boost economy . David Cameron will signal a fresh row over the green belt today with the appointment of a minister who describes opponents of planning reform as ‘hysterical, scare- mongering latter-day Luddites’. In a clear statement of intent, the Prime Minister will make prominent Tory moderniser Nick Boles his planning minister, despite mounting concern on the Conservative benches that tearing up planning rules could cost the party dear at the next election. Mr Boles has a track record as a radical thinker who wants to slash red tape to boost the economy. In a speech to the influential Tory Reform Group this year he launched an attack on a campaign against the Government’s planning revamp, led by the National Trust. ‘Business investment is deterred by the bureaucratic rigidity of our outdated planning regime,’ he said. So it is essential that we press on with our planning reforms and do not allow the hysterical scare-mongering of latter-day Luddites to strangle developments that will boost living standards.’ George Osborne, who is championing a series of changes to the planning system, is thought to have played a key role in Mr Boles’s appointment. Speaking at the weekend, the Chancellor raised the prospect that developers could build on green belt land, provided other areas of land were designated for protection. Change: Speaking at the weekend, the Chancellor raised the prospect that developers could build on green belt land, provided other areas of land were designated for protection . He said councils would be encouraged to use existing powers in cases where green belt development was the best option. Mr Osborne is also pressing for the law to be changed to speed up the planning system so that major infrastructure projects such as runways and nuclear power stations can be fast-tracked. He said the planning system leads to unnecessary delays and vowed to make it harder for residents to object to building proposals. Concern: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles is cautious about re-opening the controversial issue so soon . The drive comes just months after the Government ended a bruising battle over planning with the National Trust and other conservation bodies. A National Planning Policy Framework agreed this year introduced a ‘presumption in favour of sustainable development’ and slashed official planning guidance from more than 1,000 pages to just 50. But the country’s top planning officer criticised the Chancellor’s plans, and said they could backfire. Malcolm Sharp, president of the Planning . Officers’ Society, said it was developers’ lack of finance and the weak economy that prevented development, not red tape. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who is in charge of the planning system, is cautious about re-opening the controversial issue so soon, and argues that the Government has achieved big changes that should boost the economy. He is said to have asked for a statement guaranteeing that laws protecting the green belt will not be changed. Mr Osborne’s intervention has prompted alarm on the Tory back benches. Right-winger Philip Davies said: ‘I am all for simplifying planning procedures for developments in inner city sites, but I am opposed to anything that makes it easier to build on green belt. ‘That is utterly unacceptable and I think it is already too easy.’ Fellow Tory Julian Lewis said the scars left by the last planning row should be given time to heal. He also questioned whether it was right to make lasting changes to the planning system in the hope of achieving short-term economic gains. He added: ‘This is a very sensitive issue for a government that prides itself on its environmental credentials. Economic crises come and go but you can only spoil your environment once. ‘It is very hard to reverse the damage if it has been sacrificed for short-term economic reasons.’ Heather Wheeler, a member of the Commons communities and local government committee, said: ‘I would be very surprised if ministers revoked any protection from the green belt, given the promises that have been made in the past.’",Mr Boles has a track record as a radical thinker who wants to slash red tape to boost the economy.
"Gay marriages are a 'Trojan horse' that 'fundamentally weakens' the institution of the family, a senior Roman Catholic cardinal has warned. The Catholic Church has been at war over the acceptance of same sex unions following an unprecedented Vatican sex conference last month. A global group of bishops tasked with bringing church teachings into line with the modern world rejected proposals for wider acceptance of gay relationships, which had Pope Francis' backing. Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, the head of the Italian Bishops Conference, has said that same sex unions 'undermine' traditional family life, and said it was 'irresponsible to weaken the family by creating new forms'. Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, the head of the Italian Bishops Conference, yesterday said that civil unions between gay men and women 'confuse people' and 'undermine' traditional family life, particularly if the couples have children. He told a conference of Italian bishops in Assisi: 'It is irresponsible to weaken the family by creating new forms. 'It only confuses people and has the effect of being a sort of Trojan horse, undermining culturally and socially the core of humanity.' Children 'have a right to a mother and a father', the Cardinal said. He added: 'The family continues to be the stronghold of our country: the charitable, moral and material net that protects people from feeling abandoned and alone.' The cardinal said children had a right to a 'mother and a father' and that the family was a 'stronghold of our country'; above, same-sex couple Ariel Owens, right, and his spouse Joseph Barham after their civil union . Cardinal Bagnasco's remarks follow a war over gay marriage in Italy after the government ordered the annulment of same sex marriages conducted abroad. Gay marriage is not legal in staunchly Catholic Italy, but a number of mayors have defied ministerial orders to recognise the unions. Politicians were divided over the issue. The ruling centre left party is attempting to push through legislation to legalise gay civil unions. But Eugenia Roccella, an MP with the New Centre Right party said: 'Cardinal Bagnasco's comments on the family are, as ever, absolutely clear. 'The attempt by mayors to undermine the law and the Italian constitution by registering gay marriages performed abroad is specious and constitutes a classic Trojan horse tactic.'","Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco said gay marriage 'undermines' humanity .

"Eyesore electricity pylons which blight some of the UK’s most spectacular countryside are to be removed at a cost of £7 million each. Power lines will be buried underground as part of the £500 million National Grid scheme which aims to reverse some of the damage done by the poor planning decisions of the past. But such is the enormous cost of the engineering work required that the fund – which will ultimately be paid for by electricity customers – only has enough money to dismantle 65 pylons. Scroll down for video . Eyesore electricity pylons which blight some of the UK’s most spectacular countryside are to be removed at a cost of £7 million each . That figure is fewer than 1 in 20 of the 1,500 structures that currently stand in national parks and areas of outstanding national beauty. The eight year scheme is expected to cost the average household 22p a year. It has not yet been decided which pylons will be the ones to be removed. But yesterday a shortlist was published identifying 12 sections of overhead lines where the pylons are deemed to have the worst impact on the environment. They are in four national parks - the Brecon Beacons, Snowdonia, the New Forest and the Peak District — and four areas of outstanding natural beauty — Dorset, High Weald, Tamar Valley and the North Wessex Downs. But the huge costs expected to be taken up in the process of negotiating with landowners and digging the wide trenches required to bury the cables mean that only a fraction of the pylons in these scenic landscapes can be dealt with. The Brecon Beacons in Wales (pictured) is one of four national parks short-listed to have pylons taken down . And, controversially, there is no money left in the pot for other beauty spots including the Lake District and South Downs National Parks, and the Cotswolds, Chilterns and Blackdown Hills. Feasibility tests undertaken in early 2015 will decide exactly which pylons should be removed, with the first dismantling work set to begin in 2019. Two pylons which straddle the Tamar Valley, blighting a large section of the area between Devon and Cornwall, have been viewed to be among the worst offenders and may be the first to be removed. At the centre of the decision making process is a advisory group including representatives from the National Trust, Campaign to Protect Rural England and the Ramblers walking charity. Crucially the public, although they will in effect be footing be the bill, will not be consulted on which pylons to remove. The Peak District National Park in Derbyshire (pictured) has been shortlisted to have some of its pylons removed - but there is no money left in the pot for other beauty spots including the Cotswolds . Chris Baines, an environmentalist, author and broadcaster who chairs the group, said the biggest problem faced by the panel was the realisation that there simply wasn’t enough money in the scheme. National Grid had originally recommended spending £1.1 billion on removing pylons but Ofgem, the energy watchdog, cut the budget to £500 million. Speaking to the Times, Mr Baines said: ‘Having thought, ‘Gosh, £500 million is a huge amount of money for national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty’, the big surprise for the panel was waking up to the cost of the extreme engineering solutions and realising it is not going to stretch very far. ‘Sixty years ago, when these lines were put through, attitudes and values were different. This is a chance to go back and remedy the situation. ‘We would like this to be the first of a series of similar commitments.'","Power lines will be buried underground in £500 million National Grid scheme .

"The grieving father acquitted of shooting dead the drunken driver who killed his two sons is living in terror and can't return to his home for fear of 'revenge' attacks, he told MailOnline. David Barajas has been forced into hiding and told MailOnline that he feared people sympathetic to Jose Banda – the 20-year-old he was cleared of murdering – could now hurt him or his family. 'I am trying to protect my family – my wife, my daughter and our new baby son,' he said. 'The truth is, I am frightened. I am jumpy. We all are. Returning to our home is too much'. Relief, then fear David Barajas, who was accused of killing a driver who fatally knocked down his two sons along a rural Texas road in 2012, gets a kiss from his wife Cindy after he was acquitted of murder. But now he is living in fear of 'revenge' attacks from people who still blame him for the shooting, he told MailOnline . Intimidating: A memorial to Barajas' two sons David junior and Caleb that stands at the scene of the crash has been vandalized. Milk cartons have been thrown at it and a family friend said they may have links to witchcraft . Barajas' sons David Junior, 12, and Caleb, 11, were helping him push his stalled pick-up truck off their unlit road just before Christmas 2012 when Banda's car plowed into them. As other motorists called 911, gun shots rang out. Banda, who lived nearby, was killed instantly. Cops arrested Barajas, who had fought to revive his little boys and was covered in their blood, and threw him into jail. Two weeks ago, the 32-year-old auto mechanic was acquitted of Banda's murder after a sensational week-long trial. The triple killings have torn apart the tiny rural community of Alvin, 30 miles from Houston, Texas. And such is the anger among Banda's associates that the roadside shrine to Barajas' boys has been vandalized on numerous occasions. Empty milk containers - that some in the Hispanic community say are part of a witchcraft ritual - have been slung on the cluster of white crosses just 100 yards from the family home. When MailOnline visited one small cross had been snapped in half and balloons had been popped and shredded. Litter was thrown among the plastic flowers and several milk containers had been dumped there. The following morning, more milk containers had been dumped on top of the roadside shrine. Barajas said he worried constantly for his wife Cindy, their nine-year-old daughter Jenessah and new baby son. 'I have to look after them,' he said. 'And I am so afraid of saying anything to offend the other family. They lost somebody too. None of our lives will ever be the same again. 'These people wrote letters to the District Attorney saying they wanted me to get a life sentence. I understand because they are hurt and I was found not guilty. They don't think that is fair. 'But we all lost somebody. They lost a son, I lost my children. We will never get them back and that is something I think of every minute of the day. 'It is a hot subject around here. Some people say they would have shot a man who killed their children, some say not. I am trying to be mature and work out what is best for my family now. Flee: Barajas, 32, pictured here with Cindy, Caleb (center) and David Jr., has now had to leave behind his home and auto repair business in Alvin, Texas, with his wife, daughter and newborn baby over fears of reprisals . Scared:  David told MailOnline: 'I own my property but I cannot return to it. It isn't just the memories of the boys – and the constant reminder of the place they died across the road – it is the fear' 'I own my property but I cannot return to it. It isn't just the memories of the boys – and the constant reminder of the place they died across the road – it is the fear. 'We've been warned of some gang affiliated things. When I've gone back to my property, cars have driven by slowly. 'I fear that I could be outside one day cleaning up or something and they could come over and hurt me or my family. 'We've had to move out. I rarely go back, even though my auto repair business is there. I've let that slip, I just can't cope. We are struggling but I am doing my best to look after my family and keep my sons' memory alive. 'We can't even afford headstones for the children's graves. I'm told they will cost $15,000 and I don't think I will ever be able to afford that alone.' Banda's 22-year-old girlfriend Felicia Leija and toddler daughter Alisa live near Barajas' home. She was not in when the MailOnline called and did not return messages left on his Facebook support page. Numerous other members of Banda's family also live within a quarter-mile. A friend of Barajas, who attended the court hearing every day to show his support, said: 'David is very frightened. This other family live so near and so dothose who know them and support then and he worries about what [someone] might do. 'Then there are the milk bottles that keep getting dumped on the shrine. Some say this a witchcraft ritual. I keep telling everyone that is nonsense but it all adds to the fear. 'David dreamed of building a big five-bedroom house on his property. He wanted to look after his family, have his auto business yards from his front door and watch his children grow. 'That dream was shattered by a drunk driver just days before Christmas 2012. And then David was arrested for the drunk's murder. 'Every penny he saved went on bond money and lawyers. He has cried over me so many times. 'The police didn't even look into who else could have killed Banda.' Loved: David believes those sympathetic to Jose Banda (above with his girlfriend and baby girl), who was shot dead, may be behind the intimidation of him and his family . Hunt: A friend of David said he was angry that the police are not looking for another suspect in the 2012 incident . Barajas protested his innocence from the moment police accused him of murdering Banda as revenge for killing is boys. He insisted he did not have time to run into his house, grab a gun and kill Banda before cops arrived at the scene. Instead he says he begged passers-by to keep calling 911 as he performed CPS on his critically injured children. Two teenagers and a school cook, who had stopped to help, reported hearing gun shots on the unlit rural road but couldn't identify the shooter. In the 18 months it took before the case came to trial, relatives set up Facebook support pages for both Barajas and Banda. Life-size cardboard cutouts of the dead children were paraded outside the court house and when the trial opened 25 members of Barajas' family and 20 plus of Banda's relatives filled the public benches. Early on Judge Terri Holder ordered Barajas' relatives to remove buttons commemorating his two sons, fearing that would influence the jury. 'This is a difficult case for everyone involved. Everyone in here has lost someone they loved,' she told them. Prosecutors claimed that Barajas, consumed by grief and fury, stormed into his home after the accident, grabbed a gun, then shot Banda out of revenge. But they were hampered by the lack of physical evidence and the fact that security cameras at Barajas' home – that could have picked up his movements – were disabled. Emotional: David told MailOnline: 'These people wrote letters to the District Attorney saying they wanted me to get a life sentence. I understand because they are hurt and I was found not guilty. They don't think that is fair' Divided: The killings split the small Texas town in the 18-month lead up to the trial. Life-size cardboard cutouts of the dead children were paraded outside the court house and when the trial opened 25 members of Barajas' family and 20-plus of Banda's relatives filled the public benches . Abandoned: David said of not returning to their home, above: 'I fear that I could be outside one day cleaning up or something and they could come over and hurt me or my family' Barajas high-profile attorney Sam Cammack picked the prosecution case apart, saying there was no gunshot residue on his client's hands, police had failed to prove the murder weapon belonged to him and no witnesses could identify the shooter. It took the jury just three hours to acquit Barajas. He burst into tears as the not guilty verdict was read out. After the case, Brazorio County District Attorney Jeri Yenne said they were not looking for any other suspects.","David Barajas, 32, gave his first interview after being acquitted of David Banda's killing to reveal his fears and how he has been driven from his home .

Me and Pumpkin have never been that close... Now with her cussing me out, [saying ] ""screw you"" ""F you""... I'm just done with it.' She added that McDaniel, 53, may have originally come back into Mama June's life earlier this year because he wanted to 'surprise' Pumpkin after he got out of prison. He served 10 years after pleading guilty to child molestation following Anna's claims that he had sexually assaulted her - sometimes while Pumpkin, then three, was in bed beside her.

The 1953 match is known as the 'Matthews final' after the stunning display from the Blackpool star (left) Matthews receives his medal from Queen Elizabeth II after dazzling Wembley in the FA Cup final . But it was Matthews' FA Cup winning feat which prompted furious bidding for the much sought-after item - owned by television presenter Nick Hancock who paid just £20,000 for it in 2001. The medal had a guide price of between £30,000 and £50,000 but there was much interest in it before the auctions began. Starting at £50,000, five bidders contested the item on the phone and there were several more in the packed Book Room at Sotheby's. In the space of just three minutes that price had rocketed to £220,000. Matthews (top right) and his captain Harry Johnston were held aloft by their team-mates after beating Bolton .

It eventually went to an anonymous bidder who purchased it due to Matthews' playing for Blackpool. Matthews finally won the FA Cup with Blackpool after finishing runner-up twice in three years. In front of a 100,000-strong crowd at Wembley - in the first televised FA Cup final - he starred as Blackpool came back from 3-1 down against Bolton to win in extra time. Although Stan Mortensen netted a hat-trick, the game is known as the 'Matthews final' as he put in a magical display on the right wing and set up three goals to win it. Greaves did not play again in the tournament after featuring against Uruguay, Mexico and the French . Greaves, scoring in 5-1 win over Wales in 1960, helped himself to 44 England goals in 57 games .

Greaves' medal was up next and managed to out-do it's guide price of £20,000 to £40,000 by going for £44,000. Greaves picked up an injury in England's final group game and did not play again in the tournament - Geoff Hurst took his place.

"A thousand transgender Bangladeshis have marched in their country's first ever Pride parade to mark a year since their official recognition as a third gender. Dhaka's busy streets were brought to a standstill as the transgender women, known as hijras in Bangladesh, drew crowds with their dancing and singing. The group, many wearing colourful saris, unfurled a huge Bangladeshi flag and carried banners, one of which read: 'The days of stigma, discrimination and fear are over'. Scroll down for video . Celebration time: Transgender Bangladeshis dance in Dhaka's first-ever pride parade on Monday . Colourful: The transgender women, known as hijras, danced and sang through the capital's busy streets . National pride: They unfurled a huge Bangladeshi flag as a mark of patriotism as they marched in the streets . Happy: A hijra smiles for the camera as she helps to carry her national flag during the parade . Not quite smiliing for the camera... Hijras have been a part of life in south Asia going back to antiquity . Custom: They are mentioned in the Kama Sutra and live in communities across Bangladesh, India and Pakistan . Well made up: A hijra applies eyeliner to her heavily made up face during the parade in Dhaka on Monday . Victory: Two hijras make V for victory hand gestures at the march to mark a year since their official recognition . Convincing: Men watch as a hijra glides past carrying a vase during the Dhaka pride parade . 'I never dreamt that I would see this day in my life,' said Sonali, a 25-year-old hijra who uses one name. 'We are stigmatised everywhere. We are discriminated against. We are laughed at just because we do not feel like a man or woman. But today is different. We feel like we're normal human beings,' Sonali added. Hijras have been a part of life in south Asia going back to antiquity. They are mentioned in the Kama Sutra and live in communities across Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. Their communities have sustained themselves over generations by 'adopting' young boys who have run away from or been rejected by their families. Hijras have long suffered discrimination, particularly during the era of the British Raj when authorities labelled them 'a breach of public decency' and tried to eradicate them. But last November, in a landmark decision, the government of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina passed laws to recognise hijras as a third gender, allowing them to identify themselves as a separate gender in passports and other state papers.

Threatening: Colonial authorities labelled them 'a breach of public decency' and tried to eradicate them . Freedom: Last November Bangladesh's government passed laws to recognise hijras as a third gender . Rights: The law allows them to identify themselves as a separate gender in passports and other state papers . The government says there are around 15,000 hijras in the country. But rights groups put the number of hijras in the country at around half a million. Bangladesh has a population of around 156 million, according to recent official estimates. On Sunday the community held a seminar to discuss their rights and staged a talent show to identify the best dancers and singers. A hijra beauty contest is due to be held later this month. Leo Kenny, country director for UNAIDS, said more should be done to uphold their rights. 'Stigma and discrimination for the hijras mean this population does not have access to social services and other human rights. Ensuring the rights for hijras is important,' he said. The transgender pride march reflects a growing tolerance for the rights of sexual minorities in Hasina's secular government. Early this year the country's first magazine for lesbian, gays, bisexual and transgender people was launched with hardly any protests.","Male to female transexuals have a long history in south Asia and are called hijras .

"One-year on and Boston Strong is personified in this historic picture as the heroes of the marathon bombing come together for a moving portrait on Boylston Street. Organized by the Boston Globe, which received a Pullitzer Prize on Monday for their coverage of the deadly terror attack, the photograph features a roll call of the major players from that April 15 afternoon. Survivors, the police and firefighters who risked their lives to rush to the rescue, doctors, EMT's, runners, political figures and Red Sox players all stand proud for the inspiring and touching tribute. Scroll down for video . Proud: More than a hundred people affected by the Boston Marathon bombing, including survivors, first responders, law enforcement personnel, local business affiliates, local professional athletes, and government officials, returned to the finish line on Boylston Street for a group portrait . Up front are the Richard family, who lost their little boy Martin, 8, to the second bomb as he watched the marathon with his dad, Bill, mother, Denise, sister Jane and brother Henry. The family recently spoke of the trauma they have experienced this past year without Martin, as Denise also deals with the loss of her left eye, Jane the loss of her leg and Henry, who has suffered PTSD. A symbol of bravery is at the front of the picture too - Carlos Arrendondo - now famous for his white cowboy attack and immortalized in a dramatic photo that day of him helping save Jeff Bauman, who suffered horrific injuries to his legs in the attack. Standing tall in another cowboy hat is Red Sox player David Ortiz, who memorably unleashed a defiant swearing invective in front of the Fenway Park crowd days after the bombs - which was greeted only with the spirit in which it was meant. CARLOS ARREDONDO (wearing white cowboy hat, front left) In his native Costa Rica, Arredondo was a rodeo clown, helping get fallen riders out of the way of angry bulls. 'Years of doing that kind of adrenaline, you're rushing in and out, running up and out to get people out of there. ... In a way I was training myself for the Boston Marathon.' He was passing out American flags on the race sidelines and ran to Jeff Bauman after the blasts and encountered him mortally wounded with both his legs blown off. Emergency: Carlos Arredondo, in cowboy hat, and Boston University student Devin Wang push Jeff Bauman in a wheelchair after he was injured in one of two explosions near the finish line of the Boston Marathon one year ago . 'I thought, `How am I going to get him out of here?'' 'And then I saw this miracle woman coming with a wheelchair,' Arredondo recalled. 'And it saved his life.' Jeff didn't pose for the picture, but over the past year the two men have come to symbolize everything about the terror and rescues of that day. Bauman became one of the most recognizable and powerful symbols of Boston's resilience after the April 15 attacks - immortalized in an Associated Press photo that shows three rescuers - including Arredondo rushing him from the scene. He became a hero days later when he was able to help authorities identify one of two brothers accused of setting off pressure cooker bombs, killing two women and an 8-year-old boy and injuring more than 260 others. Bauman was standing near the finish line with two friends, waiting to cheer on Hurley as she completed the marathon, one of the most important and busiest events of the year in the city. He noticed a man who looked out of place in a crowd of revelers, and they exchanged a long stare. As Bauman describes him, he was 'all business.' Moments later, the two bombs exploded. Bauman found himself on the ground, his legs gone. People rushed in to help, but Bauman thought it was the end. Suddenly, a man in a cowboy hat appeared: Carlos Arredondo. He lifted Bauman into a wheelchair pushed by Devin Wang, a Boston University student, and they rushed toward the medical tents. They were joined along the way by Paul Mitchell, an EMT with Boston EMS. THE RICHARD FAMILY (wearing yellow t-shirts and brown jackets in the front of the picture) To mark the year anniversary of their tragic loss, the Richard family opened up about the moment their lives changed forever. In an emotional interview Bill Richard told the Boston Globe the moment the bomb went off and his son Martin died. Emotional: From front, Jane, 7, Denise, (in hat), Henry and Bill Richards appeared in the photograph to mark the year anniversary of the bombings . He described the moment he saw his daughter Jane scream when she saw her left leg had been blown off and called out for her brother, who was already dead. Bill, 43, refused to be operated on and spent 24 hours with shrapnel in his leg so he could make sure his family was OK. In the chaos afterwards doctors tried to calm him down but he told them: ‘Relax? My son is dead. How can I relax?’ His wife, Denise, 43, a librarian, was left blind in her right eye. Jane, seven, lost her left leg and Henry, 11, was physically unharmed but had deep psychological scars. As Jane described it to doctors: ‘My brother Henry only got some cuts, but was hurt in his heart’. CELESTE AND SYDNEY CORCORAN (far right, Celeste wears a fluorescent yellow coat and hat and Sydney wears a green parka jacket) Mother . and daughter Celeste, 48, and Sydney, 18, were on the finishing line . cheering on Celeste's sister Carmen Accabo when the bombs went off. Shrapnel . tore through Sydney's thigh, severing a major artery and leaving her . close to bleeding to death on the footpath. Her mother's injuries would . leave her a double amputee. The . devastating emotional and physical repercussions of that day have . shaped 2013 for the Corcoran family, as they will for the rest of their . lives. But their spirit . is the epitome of the Boston Strong slogan, and Celeste and Sydney . fought a thousand tiny battles after their horrific ordeal, and won. 'She's . not just my mom, she's one of my best friends. We've always been . really, really close but especially after such a horrific event, we just . got so much closer,' Sydney told the Boston Globe. 'She's . my mother so she's always taken care of me - I like to think I've . always taken care of her too - but now even more so. I have to help her . through the rest of her life.' Recovery: Celeste Corcoran kisses her daughter Sydney in the physical therapy room at Spaulding Rehab as she made progress in her rehabilitation . MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR DEVAL PATRICK (right, front in a baseball cap) The governor was inspirational in the aftermath of the attacks and during the trying week that followed. Indeed, he admitted over the summer that once Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had been captured he went to a restaurant alone and got 'quite drunk' out of relief. After a dinner of duck confit, french fries, soup, salad and chardonnay, Patrick said, 'I was actually quite drunk, by myself,' the Boston Herald reported in June. FORMER MAYOR THOMAS MENINO (far left in brown jacket and blue shirt) Another inspirational and strong figure for the city that difficult week, Menino has unfortunately been recently diagnosed with advanced stage cancer. He is the longest serving mayor in Boston's history and only left office in January. His strong leadership was a rock for the city during and after the attacks and when he left office he said, 'Thank you Boston. It has been the honor and thrill of a lifetime to be your Mayor. Be as good to each other as you have been to me.' Political heroes: Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and then-Boston Mayor Thomas Menino (right) stood strong for the city during its time of crisis and appeared in the year anniversary picture for the Boston Globe . RED SOX HIITER DAVID ORTIZ (back left, also in white cowboy hat) David Ortiz became a Boston hero for life when he took to the field at Fenway Park the week after the attacks and offered a resolute tribute to the city. Designated hitter David Ortiz exclaimed 'this is our f***ing city' to rapturous cheers, and some tears, after a moving video, encapsulating the horror and heroism of the bombings. 'All right, Boston,' said Ortiz. 'This jersey that we wear today, it doesn't say Red Sox. It says Boston. He continued: 'We want to thank you, Mayor Menino, Governor Patrick, the whole police department for the great job they did this past week. This is our f***ing city, and nobody is going to dictate our freedom. Stay strong.'

"All appears placid in the imaginary world of Erehwon, 'nowhere' spelled backward, a $79 million fantasy city at a U.S. military base in Virginia. In long tunics and Bedouin scarves, men kick a soccer ball in front of the imaginary U.S. consulate. Women sit and eat. Arabic music rings from the market. A bicyclist waves as he rides toward a stone church and a mosque with a green minaret in the distance. But it won't be quiet for long. This is where the State Department trains agents for its most dangerous diplomatic posts. Scroll down for video . Role-playing attackers storm a fake US Consulate during a US Diplomatic Security Service High Threat training program held at a mock town named Erehwon, 'nowhere' spelled backwards, on a rural Virginia military base . The new recruits know the worst could come at any moment. They peer through the metallic sheen of the consulate windows as snipers stand guard on the roof. The agents scan a landscape complete with the convincing exteriors of a train station, governor's office, bank, apartment building and hospital. Danger could lurk behind any of them. Two years after the deadly attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya, the Diplomatic Security Service — responsible for protecting some 100,000 Americans around the world — has dramatically expanded training. The prep course for high-threat embassies and consulates once ran for five weeks. Now it's 10. And in the final week, recruits drill alongside elite special agents and a Marine detachment, while trainers double as terrorists. Food and sleep are restricted. Explosions and paid actors playing the locals add to the experience. A member of the US Diplomatic Security Service covers the doorway inside a building during a simulated ambush . After the loss of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012, no one wants to take chances. A review ordered by then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton found security before the attack 'grossly inadequate.' It said U.S. security personnel 'performed with courage,' but faulted the agency for not having enough protection and for depending on unreliable Libyan partners. Has the situation changed? 'It has improved,' declares Paul Davies, who heads Diplomatic Security's high-threat training. Just a year ago, Davies was still in the field, leading agents and Marines in fending off an attack involving a truck bomb, militants with suicide vests and rocket fire targeting the U.S. consulate in Herat, Afghanistan. The assailants were killed, along with eight Afghan security guards. No Americans died. All diplomats were unharmed. The consulate is up and running again. To demonstrate improvements, the State Department invited The Associated Press to spend a day and a half watching preparations for the worst of scenarios. The AP agreed not to disclose the location of the training. A truck with an explosive is detonated on a street during the US Diplomatic Security Service High Threat training program . Despite the calm scene outside the fake consulate, the situation in Erehwon is uneasy. In the morning, indirect fire  interrupted the dedication of a U.S.-funded subway project. Agents take out their rifles to escort the U.S. consul general to the local mosque. Four agents accompany him on foot. Two vans follow. An advance team waits at the mosque, where the consul general meets an elderly mullah. Suddenly, screeching tires are heard. A kidnapping has occurred. But there is no cause for immediate action to protect the consulate. 'It's very easy to get drawn into all the sexy stuff — the violence, the guns, what you see on TV,' says Lance Bailey, who served as a Diplomatic Security director in Afghanistan and is now chief of special operations planning for high-threat posts. 'But what we're really trying to develop, the core skill we're trying to build, is problem solving,' he says. Later, the agents are taking the consul general to dinner when an explosion occurs, leaving all three vehicles in the caravan inoperable. The pops and sparks of gunfire — blanks — from the trees come immediately. Participants playing the roles of anti-American demonstrators burn a effigy outside a fake US Consulate . This photograph made using a military issued nightscope, shows members of the US Diplomatic Security Service boarding a helicopter during a field exercise following a simulated ambush . Evacuation of the vans is a little slow. The agents throw smoke canisters. Concealed, they retreat with the consul general to a building nearby. One agent's gun jams. Others leave their radios in the vans. When the whistles of incoming mortars sound, only some crouch for cover. The commanding agent leaves his 'go bag' of ammunition and supplies in an evacuated room. Requests for additional forces are denied. But the team makes it to a helicopter pickup site in 'record time,' Davies says. The next morning resembles the Benghazi attack. This time, the U.S. prevails. Protesters converge, beating at consulate barricades. But the demonstration subsides when the mullah persuades people to go home. Military gear used by members of the US Diplomatic Security Service is seen inside the 5-story building that represents the US Consulate . This 5-story building represents a US Consulate, shown during a US Diplomatic Security Service High Threat training program . Then a pickup truck stops near a rear gate. The driver leaves. The truck explodes. Gunmen with assault rifles rush from behind the bank, firing on the consulate. From the other side of the building, mortar fire can be heard. Unlike Benghazi, however, the compound at Erehwon is well protected. Roof snipers return fire. A second wave of attackers arrives, and a suicide bomber blows a hole in the perimeter. Agents and Marines rush forward. The militants never make it inside the gates. Back in the operations center, evacuation is underway. The Defense Department deploys a helicopter. Reinforcements are on the way. After the drill, Davies congratulates his new high-threat-post recruits, then leads a review of their performance. Embassy security is now well funded and getting the right materials and personnel, he says. Coordination with military and intelligence is deepening. And, critically, agents are being trained to do more than drive limousines or guard flanks in a motorcade. 'We're preparing leaders,' Davies says.","The fantasy city named Erehwon - 'nowhere' spelled backwards is located at a U.S. military base in Virginia .

"Hardened plaque discovered on the teeth of 1,000-year-old human skeletons has revealed the world's oldest case of gum disease . Described as a 'microbial Pompeii',  the plaque preserved bacteria and microscopic particles of food on the surfaces of teeth, effectively creating a mineral tomb for microbiomes. And it revealed that our ancestors had gum disease that was caused by the same bacteria that plagues modern man, despite major changes in diet and hygiene. Hardened plaque discovered on the teeth of 1,000 year old human skeletons has revealed not only their diets but the diseases they faced . They found that the ancient human oral microbiome already contained the basic genetic machinery for antibiotic resistance over eight centuries before the invention of antibiotics in the 1940s. DNA testing of the tartar also showed some of the things ancient humans had been eating, such a vegetables, which do not show up in fossil records. Gum disease is caused by a build-up of plaque on the teeth and is thought to affect over half of adults in the UK. Plaque is a sticky substance that contains bacteria and when it hardens it forms tartar. Unlike bone, which rapidly loses much of its molecular information when buried, calculus grows slowly in the mouth and enters the soil in a much more stable state, helping it to preserve biomolecules. Analysing this wealth of data required overcoming the major challenge of sorting and identifying millions of genetic sequences - like puzzle pieces - to reconstruct the complex biology of the ancient mouth> Pictured here is the process of isolating ancient DNA from plaque . Studying . ancient teeth may help dentists discover the evolution of the human . mouth bacteria and the origins of periodontal (gum) disease, the researchers said. Although . common in humans, domestic pets, and zoo animals, periodontal disease . does not typically develop in wild animals, leading to speculation that . it is an oral microbiome disease resulting from modern human lifestyles. But these teeth revealed that our ancestors had gum . disease that was caused by the same bacteria that plagues modern man, . despite major changes in diet and hygiene. Severe . gum disease is linked to diverse systemic diseases, including . cardiovascular disease, stroke, pulmonary disease, and type II diabetes. Researchers from the University of York, along with Swiss and Danish colleagues, said studying plaque will be more important than teeth in discovering the lifestyles of our past ancestors. It has enabled scientists to analyse ancient DNA that was not destroyed when the skeleton was buried. The study published in Nature Genetics revealed the one ancient human mouth, found in Dalheim, Germany, carried numerous opportunistic pathogens. Professor Matthew Collins, of the University of York, said: ‘We knew that calculus preserved microscopic particles of food and other debris but the level of preservation of biomolecules is remarkable. ‘A microbiome entombed and preserved in a mineral matrix, a microbial Pompeii. ‘As we learn more about the evolution of this microbiome in response to migration and changes in diet, health and medicine, I can imagine a future in which most archaeologists regard calculus as more interesting than the teeth themselves.’ Professor Christian von Mering at the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics added: ‘Dental calculus is a window into the past and may well turn out to be one of the best-preserved records of human-associated microbes.’ The pioneering research applied shotgun DNA sequencing to dental calculus for the first time. The teeth were taken from skeletons found at a site in Dalheim, Germany . Ancient plaque is magnified in this image 1,000 times. The dark red and blue areas show oral bacteria fossilised in the plaque . Shotgun sequencing, also known as shotgun cloning, is a method used for sequencing long DNA strands. During shotgun sequencing, DNA is broken up randomly into numerous small segments, which are sequenced. The idea is to pepper the DNA with sequence reads such that they overlap, and when assembled, yield thecomplete sequence of the clone. Shotgun sequencing was one of the precursor technologies that was responsible for enabling full genome sequencing. The study involved sorting and identifying millions of genetic sequences like puzzle pieces in order to reconstruct the complex biology of the ancient oral microbiome. It reconstructed the genome of a major periodontal pathogen and produced possibly the first genetic evidence of dietary biomolecules to be recovered from ancient dental calculus. Dr Christina Warinner of the University of Zurich added: ‘Dental calculus acts both as a long-term reservoir of the oral microbiome and as a trap for dietary and environmental debris. ‘This allows us to investigate health and disease, as well as reconstruct aspects of an individual's life history and activities. Never before have we been able to retrieve so much information from one small sample.’ Studying ancient teeth may help dentists discover the evolution of the human mouth bacteria and the origins of periodontal disease, the researchers. Although common in humans, domestic pets, and zoo animals, periodontal disease does not typically develop in wild animals, leading to speculation that it is an oral microbiome disease resulting from modern human lifestyles. Severe periodontal disease is linked to diverse systemic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, pulmonary disease, and type II diabetes.

This one small stretch of path running just 200 metres along the front of the factory in the city of Shenzhen in south-eastern China's Guangdong province has more than 150 bins to make sure that there is no litter. And even more have been put up at other places around the electronics factory. A Chinese factory boss who wanted to make sure visitors to his building got a good impression ordered staff to put up hundreds of litter bins out to collect rubbish . The order to install the bins came after wealthy factory owner Chan Wu, 58, complained about staff sitting on the benches in the warm summer months to eat their lunch at midday, and leaving behind litter. Saying that it gave a bad impression to visitors of his plant, and showed a sloppy work ethic by staff, he ordered the bins be installed between each of the benches to tackle the problem. Factory spokesman Shing Tseng said: 'People now have no excuse for littering. 'Anybody who fails to use the bins will face a disciplinary procedure.' However there has been little problem with the rubbish since the bins were installed, because according to staff the smell from the bins right next to the benches is so bad, hardly anybody wants to eat their lunch there anymore.

"Teachers are being paid to strike in defence of a militant union official bringing chaos to the education of 3,000 pupils. The National Union of Teachers is reimbursing members who join a walkout today in support of Julie Davies. The militant rep was suspended after headteachers accused her of ‘confrontation’, ‘obfuscation’ and encouraging ‘a climate of mistrust’. The National Union of Teachers is reimbursing members who join a walkout  in support of Julie Davies (above) Mrs Davies has organised two strikes in protest of her suspension. Pictured: An NUT march earlier this year . Parents reacted with fury to the idea of bribes for strikes and have suggested they will bill the NUT for their childcare costs. But union leaders remain defiant, threatening longer walkouts and extending the action to more schools. This is despite only 50 to 60 per cent of teachers at the two comprehensives involved having voted for strike action. Mrs Davies, 58, is a full-time NUT rep who has not taught since 2000. Schools across Haringey in north London pool their funds to pay her £45,900 salary but many heads do not want to continue the deal, with insiders saying she has been obstructive for years. Mrs Davies is leading strikes in protest, initially targeting Fortismere and Highgate Wood – the two schools she claims signed the letter denouncing her. Chris Reed, whose son attends Highgate Wood, said: ‘If the NUT are setting aside money to pay the teachers to go on strike, then what about paying the parents to sort out the childcare at the same time? People are having to take time off work.’ He is spearheading a petition calling on NUT general secretary Christine Blower to end the strikes. She is away on a business trip to Sweden. It states: ‘We believe our children are being victimised by one NUT member while she battles her disciplinary hearing and suspension. This is damaging their education, our patience, and it is significantly damaging the reputation of the NUT as a whole. Mrs Davies, 58, is a full-time NUT rep who has not taught since 2000 but who still earns a salary of over £45,000 . On Twitter, the suspended Mrs Davies describes herself as a 'teacher, union rep, psychokiller, obviously' ‘Christine Blower, you can show some leadership and do what you can to end this strike immediately, or you can stand idly by while 3,000 pupils suffer each day of strike action, and their parents get increasingly bitter with the NUT as a result of one solitary member – a member who according to media reports hasn’t done any teaching in 14 years.’ The petition has already attracted more than 50 signatures, including that of Matthew Moore, who said: ‘I have two sons at Fortismere and missing their education because professional teachers cannot agree is pathetic and such a bad example to young people on how the world should work.’ Another parent, Adi Forman, said: ‘Singling out two schools in a whole borough in order to pressure the council is unethical and hard to sympathise with. My child does not deserve this and neither do the schools.’ Schools have a legal obligation to give union officials ‘facility time’ – paid leave of absence to undertake their union duties. But the Department for Education insists that ‘taxpayers’ money should not be funding trade union reps who spend little or no time actually teaching’. It has published guidance which aims to ensure reps continue to teach alongside carrying out their union duties. Talks between the NUT and local heads are likely to begin next week. Bob Stapley, the union’s regional secretary for London, said: ‘We are considering strike action for next week. We would be delighted if we were able to resolve the dispute and not have to call that action but there is every possibility of action there and in further schools. ‘We are escalating slowly because we want to minimise disruption but they need not doubt our resolve. ‘We can’t lose – we cannot contemplate a situation in which an employer vetoes our representative. We would cease to be a free and independent union. ‘The fact that teachers are reimbursed for loss of pay does not lessen the difficulty for teachers of going on strike. ‘Our members want to work with these youngsters and get the best possible results for them but at least in some of these local disputes, the union’s resources are deployed in order to offset the loss that people would otherwise suffer.’ Parents have started a petition calling on NUT general secretary Christine Blower (above) to end the strikes . In a letter to parents, Highgate Wood’s headmaster Patrick Cozier said the school was unwilling to continue funding Mrs Davies’s post ‘until concerns had been addressed about aspects of the Haringey NUT’s behaviour’. He described today’s two-day walkout as very disappointing, adding: ‘We are clear that the NUT (and any other trade union) can elect who they wish to represent their members.’ Around 150 members are thought to have taken part in the first walk-out backing Mrs Davies last week. The English teacher was suspended in July over the concerns expressed by heads as well as over other allegations, including that she sent a tweet spreading news about a mayor ‘abusing’ her position. Haringey Council is investigating. Its leader Claire Kober said: ‘Strike action in two Haringey schools has already disrupted the education of our young people, and I’m very concerned about the negative impact that further industrial action will have on students. ‘Haringey has a proud history of championing trade unions and we want all teachers in the borough to continue to have access to appropriate union representation. Mrs Davies was released from teaching English at Northumberland Park community school in North London (pictured) to carry out ‘staff representation’ full time, while still picking up her annual pay of more than £45,000 . ‘However, the fact is that all council employees are bound by our code of conduct. It is our responsibility to fully investigate any alleged breaches of this code, and it’s important that this process is allowed to run its course.’ Teachers at another Haringey school, Park View, are being balloted over strikes and a ballot is being considered at Hornsey School for Girls. The letter from local secondary heads said: ‘Secondary school headteachers have found, and continue to find, that Ms Davies’ preferred approach and working style is one of confrontation and obfuscation. ‘Our combined experience is that she seeks to encourage a climate of mistrust, often involving the airing of her personal critiques of individual head teachers, rather than seeking to develop effective communication channels or relationships based on trust and openness.’ I’m just an ordinary teacher, says the activist who’s picked up £1/2m without who hasn’t taught a class for 14 years . Full-time activist Julie Davies, 58, has claimed she would be ready to step in front of a class ‘tomorrow’ despite not teaching a lesson for 14 years . Julie Davies claims she would be ready to step in front of a class ‘tomorrow’ – despite not teaching a lesson for 14 years even though she is drawing a full teacher’s salary. The 58-year-old activist’s critics are dubious that she would be up to the job, given all the changes in education policy and practice since she last taught. They believe she would require a lengthy training course to bring her up to speed – paid for by the taxpayer of course. However, Mrs Davies claims to be as much of a teacher as she was when she last did the job we pay her for – at the dawn of the century. ‘I’m an ordinary teacher,’ she declared a few years ago, when questions began to be asked of her role. ‘Most of my time’s spent sitting next to teachers who are being sacked or disciplined.’ She was hired to teach English at Northumberland Park Community School, but found she was spending increasing amounts of time on her union duties. To her delight – and many taxpayers’ dismay – in 2000 she was released from teaching entirely, so she could become a full-time activist. Mrs Davies says she is barred by her contract from talking to the Press, so will not say whether she enjoys the same long holidays as normal teachers. She was recently known to be spending four days a week ‘supporting National Union of Teachers members’, and a fifth as a ‘convenor’, co-ordinating between various teaching unions in the north London borough of Haringey. It is understood that her annual pay has risen from £35,000 to more than £50,000 over that time – meaning the council has paid her well over half a million pounds to not teach a single lesson. She had been flying under the radar until recently, when Communities Secretary Eric Pickles called for an end to the State’s bankrolling of union officials,. Mrs Davies, who lives with husband David, 65, and their two sons in a £500,000 house in north London, is mystified by her opponents, insisting that she plays a valuable role in resolving disputes in schools. Before the launch of strikes she helped organise, she has said: ‘I don’t spend my time organising strikes. I spend my time helping people who need support and advice. ‘Perhaps they have been assaulted by a pupil or parent, or suspended following an allegation. They might be facing redundancy or underperformance issues or being disciplined ... teachers are entitled to representation. 'Every local education authority gives union reps time to do their work. It’s a far more cost-effective way of representing NUT members ... I work really hard.’ The staunch Left-winger has opposed a raft of government reforms, such as turning schools into academies. She dislikes her own finances, background or property holdings being discussed – but wrote pompously to the Guardian several years ago that London schools’ problems are ‘beyond the understanding of a millionaire Cabinet or privately educated Education Secretary’. She also intervened in 2003, suggesting that children of failed asylum seekers should not be deported because it upsets their classmates. ‘Our schools are penalised by serving a transient community. It is distressing and further destabilising for our young people to lose their friends through deportation,’ she claimed.","The National Union of Teachers is reimbursing members who join walkout .

"Showing public executions, corpses being devoured by wild animals, the bombing of a hospital and people being shot - it’s not, some would say, a typical children's movie.

While it doesn't premiere in Australia until Friday night, the concerns around the rating have been mirrored here. Professor Elizabeth Handsley from the Australian Council on Children and the Media told Daily Mail Australia the M classification is a very broad category. 'The question is whether it sends a strong enough message to parents about the need to be careful especially with younger children,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Prof Handsley says while she hasn't seen the latest Hunger Games film, she has referred to the past two instalments, which also had a classification of M. She says there were a lot of dark scenes and she struggles to fully understand the classifications they were given. 'The M category can include romantic comedies with sex and swearing and then darker films like Hunger Games.' She questions whether Hunger Games should be in the same categories as movies like, 'He's just not that into you' and 'Hulk'.

The Australian Classification Board said in it's decision report it could not be recommended for viewing by persons who are under 15 although there are no legal restrictions on access. It stated the film was classified M as the viewing impact of the themes and violence in the film was moderate. The board says it had a moderate sense of threat and menace, referring to scenes in the film that included skeletal and mummified dead people, the execution of captives and the mental torture of captives by the capital. It argued that while there was an execution of three civilians in front of a crowd, 'it is mitigated by a lack of blood and wound detail'. The board also made reference to the bombing of a hospital and the shooting down of planes, classing them as 'moderate violence'.

The film, released on November 20 in Australia, is the third in the wildly popular series based on the children’s books by Suzanne Collins, which have sold 80 million copies. They have been so successful that there are plans for a stage show in 2016, and the first two films grossed over $60 million at the Australian box office. But both also caused controversy for their same M ratings, with some parents claiming their children had been so distressed that they had to leave the cinema early. Following the first Hunger Games film in 2012, a blogger on Mumsnet.com said, 'My 12 year old was so distressed at one particular part, not long before the end that we had to leave the cinema.' Another blogger said the film was really good but she thought it was stretching the rating. Another said her kids, who were under 13, loved it while another blogger claimed she took her 10 year old as he had read all the books and knew he would handle the film. One parent blogger also said her child had complained that the killing scenes were 'shakey' so you couldn't see what was happening.

"Morocco has been expelled from the 2015 African Cup of Nations after refusing to host the football tournament due to fears over it helping to spread the deadly Ebola virus. The North African country failed to meet yesterday's deadline to announce it would be hosting the tournament, with the Confederation of African Football saying it is now considering other nations. The news comes after Morocco's Ministry of Sport demanded the tournament be postponed for a year amid the world's worst ever Ebola outbreak - with the virus already infecting more than 13,000 people and killing almost 5,000 in the three worst-hit countries, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. Outbreak: The world's worst Ebola epidemic, which emerged  in March, has infected more than 13,000 people and killed almost 5,000 in the three worst-hit countries - Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia . CAF president Issa Hayatou is adamant that the tournament should go ahead this winter as planned . Following news that Morocco had been expelled from the tournament, the Confederation of African Football says it has received 'some applications' from possible replacement hosts. It did not say who the candidates were, but added that it had refused Morocco's request to postpone the African Cup until 2016. The Confederation went on to say that it will decide on further punishments for Morocco for breaching its contractual obligations as host. Last week it had ruled unanimously that the competition should go ahead, despite the health threat. The confederation pointed out that of the three countries worst effected by the disease, only Sierra Leone can still qualify, adding that there have been no incidents of Ebola in Morocco. Members of the Nigerian national football team are pictured celebrating their 2013 African Cup of Nations triumph  but the 2015 tournament is in doubt after Morocco refused to host it amid concerns of Ebola . Poverty:  There is concern that those travelling from or via countries hit by Ebola could contract the virus and carry it with them to Morocco. Pictured is the Ebola-hit Clara Town slum in Monrovia, Liberia . There have been reports of a drop in the numbers of new Ebola cases in Liberia, but Médecins Sans Frontières is warning against complacency, saying the outbreak is far from over. New hotspots are emerging around the country all the time, said MSF and in Guinea, where there were two significant dips in cases, the numbers have risen again. However the African Cup of Nations, which is usually held every two years, will lead to a huge pan-continental movement of people - the like of which has not been seen since the current outbreak started in the West African nation of Guinea in March. This has led to concerns that those travelling from or via countries hit by Ebola could contract the virus and carry it with them to Morocco, where they will be exposed to huge numbers of people in football stadiums, who could then spread the illness still further.","Morocco missed deadline to announce it would be hosting 2015 tournament .

"Two carjackers have been jailed after pistol-whipping one victim and threatening to shoot others in a six-week spree that saw them steal £105,000 worth of vehicles. Boustaan Adalat, 22, and Asri Hussain, 25, attacked men and women driving alone across the Small Heath, Sparkhill and Sparkbrook areas of Birmingham, before fleeing in their stolen cars. In one case, they battered a man with a gun until he handed over the keys to his Ford Focus, while in others, they put the weapon to the heads and stomachs of victims. Scroll down for video . Jailed: Asri Hussain (left) and Boustaan Adalat (right) stole £105,000 worth of vehicles during a six-week spree . Fleeing the scene: The pair attacked men and women driving alone in Small Heath, Sparkhill and Sparkbrook in Birmingham. Above, Adalat is pictured running with a gun in his hand during a police chase in March this year . They were eventually captured in a police chase after they carjacked a Mercedes from a female driver - and then crashed the vehicle. Now, the pair have been jailed for ten years each after pleading guilty to robbery, possession of an imitation firearm and conspiracy to rob at Birmingham Crown Court. The court heard that Adalat, from Kitts Green, and Hussain, from Saltley, targeted mainly lone motorists in inner-city Birmingham during February and March this year. They first struck on February 5 when they stole a £14,000 Ford Fiesta from a road in Small Heath as motorist Safiyya Bi was collecting her son from a takeaway. Hussain was carrying what looked like a small black handgun and the mother was ordered out of the vehicle as Adalat approached from the rear of the car. They then drove off with the vehicle. Ms Bi said: 'I was absolutely terrified. The men threatened me with a very real looking gun and I thought they were going to shoot me if I did not give them the car. Crash: Adalat and Hussain were eventually caught by police after they carjacked this £38,000 Mercedes from Patricia Mcintosh - and then crashed the vehicle. Ms Mcintosh later said: 'I thought I was going to be shot dead' Gun: This gas-powered pistol, loaded with ball bearings, was discarded by Adalat in a garden prior to his arrest . 'I worked hard to buy my car. I work hard in life to support my family and if we want something nice we have to work and save for it. These two people just took my car at gunpoint.' On February 11, Adalat then held up Imran Khan in another road in the area, before stealing his £3,100 Mini Cooper and warning him: 'Don't try any funny business or I will pop your legs.' Then, on February 15, the pair threatened care workers Emma Hinch and Natalie Roberts with a handgun, before dragging them from their £24,000 Audi as they visited a client in Small Heath. Four weeks later, on March 14, Hussain car-jacked Aurangzeb Saddiqui in a road in Sparkhill, and stole his brand new £19,000 Audi after threatening him with what appeared to be a gun. During the six-week spree, Adalat and Hussain stole seven cars from victims in Birmingham. These included: . February 5 - Ford Fiesta (£14,000) February 11 - Mini Cooper (£3,100) February 15 - Audi (£24,000) March 14 - Audi (£19,000) March 26 - Ford Focus . March 27 - Astra . March 29 - Mercedes (£38,000) The victim later told police: 'I really believed when he put the gun to my head that he was going to shoot me and I would be dead.' Hussain struck again on March 26 when he and another hooded male targeted retired Christopher Merchant in Kyotts Lake Road, Sparkbrook. The victim said he was pistol whipped to the ground and told to hand over the keys to his Ford Focus or he would be shot. Adalat was involved in another car-jacking on the evening of March 27 when Samuel White had his Astra stolen in Chapman Road after he was threatened with what appeared to be a revolver. But the pair's crime spree came to an end on March 29 when Patricia Mcintosh's £38,000 Mercedes was targeted. The 52-year-old was returning to her car when the thugs demanded the keys to her convertible, with Hussain putting a gun to her stomach and Adalat pushing her to the ground. In a victim statement, Ms Mcintosh said: 'At the time they robbed me I was on my own and I had been shopping in Small Heath, at shops I have spent my entire life shopping at. 'I thought I was going to be shot dead by them. I only bought the Mercedes convertible about one month before and I used to love driving the car. 'Since these two robbed me I have felt extremely vulnerable. I have not been back to Small Heath as I am scared of being a victim again. I do not like going out alone in my car. Escape: In one case, the thugs battered a man with a gun until he handed over the keys to his Ford Focus, while in others, they put weapons to the heads and stomachs of victims. Above, Hussain flees in the police chase . Caught: Adalat and Hussain have been jailed for ten years each after pleading guilty to robbery, possession of an imitation firearm and conspiracy to rob. Above, Adalat runs away from the scene of the Mercedes crash . 'Every time I get into my Mercedes it reminds me of robbery. Even through the summer I have left the convertible roof up as I am too scared to drive around with the roof down as I am worried about getting robbed again.' After stealing the vehicle, the pair fled, but were shortly spotted by a police patrol car. A pursuit followed, during which Hussain and Adalat crashed the Mercedes into a wall and fled on foot. They ran along residential streets closely followed by police. CCTV shows Adalat sprinting through a cul-de-sac with a gun still in his hands. He was arrested hiding in the bathroom of an unsuspecting homeowner's house nearby, having discarded the gun in a nearby garden. Hussain was arrested minutes later. Following a search, the gun was recovered and when examined, was found to be a gas-powered pistol, loaded with ball bearings. Imprisoned: Adalat (pictured) and Hussain were said by police to be 'motivated by money and greed' West Midlands Police's Serious Organised Crime Unit (SOCU) launched a painstaking investigation, led by senior investigating officer Detective Inspector Ben West and officer in charge Detective Constable Craig Hall. The team began to piece together Adalat and Hussain's activities during February and March and discovered the pair matched the descriptions of 13 other car-jackings. During identity parades they were picked out by drivers and with CCTV evidence, officers had enough to charge them with 14 offences. Both men had a string of previous convictions. Adalat had previously been jailed for possession of knife. In January 2011, he had been sentenced to six years after being involved in a £37,000 robbery of a jewellers. He was on licence for that offence at the time of the car-jackings. Appearing at court yesterday, Adalat's defence lawyer Daniel White said his client had shown 'genuine remorse'. He added the criminal was a cannabis user who had what he thought was undiagnosed Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Hussain had received four years for robbery in December 2006 and had also served time for theft convictions. Nicholas Berry, defending, said his client had started using cannabis at the age of 12 and later moved on to Class A drugs. Sentencing the pair, Her Honour Judge Elizabeth Stacey said: 'It's a really serious matter to rob people, even more to do so with an imitation firearm which does not look like an imitation firearm from what I have seen. These were very serious repeated robberies.' Speaking after the case, Detective Inspector Ben West said: 'These men targeted lone drivers and in the majority of cases women. They were motivated by money and greed and it would appear they stole the cars to strip and sell on for parts.' None of the cars have been recovered and both defendants refused to speak during police interview.","Boustaan Adalat, 22, and Asri Hussain, 25, targeted drivers in Birmingham .

"Tibetans were able to adapt to high altitudes thanks to a gene picked up when their ancestors mated with a now extinct early species of human. It is the first time a gene from . another species of human has been shown unequivocally to have helped . modern humans adapt to their environment, researchers said. They found the gene came from Denisovans a human relative that became extinct 40,000-50,000 years ago, around the same time as the more well-known Neanderthals. Tibetan nomads play billiards on an open grassland near Namtso Lake: Researchers have revealed the population evolved to thrive at high altitudes in just 3,000 years. The gene has been referred to as the 'superathlete' gene because at low elevations, some variants of it help athletes quickly boost hemoglobin and thus the oxygen-carrying capacity of their blood, upping endurance. At high altitudes, however, the common variants of the gene boost hemoglobin and its carrier, red blood cells, too much, increasing the thickness of the blood and leading to hypertension and heart attacks as well as low birth weight babies and increased infant mortality. The variant, or allele, found in Tibetans raises hemoglobin and red blood cell levels only slightly at high elevations, avoiding the side effects seen in most people who relocate to elevations above 13,000 feet. The unusual variant of a gene involved in regulating the body’s production of hemoglobin – the molecule that carries oxygen in the blood – became widespread in Tibetans after they moved onto the high-altitude plateau several thousand years ago. This variant allowed them to survive despite low oxygen levels at elevations of 15,000 feet or more, whereas most people develop thick blood at high altitudes, leading to cardiovascular problems. 'We have very clear evidence that this version of the gene came from Denisovans,' said principal author Rasmus Nielsen, UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology. 'This shows very clearly and directly that humans evolved and adapted to new environments by getting their genes from another species.' Nielsen and his colleagues at BGI-Shenzhen in China, the world’s largest genome sequencing center, published their research in Nature. The gene, called EPAS1, is activated when oxygen levels in the blood drop, triggering production of more hemoglobin. 'We found that part of the EPAS1 gene in Tibetans is almost identical to the gene in Denisovans and very different from all other humans,' Nielsen said. 'We can do a statistical analysis to show that this must have come from Denisovans. There is no other way of explaining the data.' Nielsen sketched out a possible scenario leading to this result: modern humans coming out of Africa interbred with Denisovan populations in Eurasia as they passed through that area into China, and their descendants still retain a small percentage – perhaps 0.1 percent – of Denisovan DNA. The tiny fragment of finger bone has enabled scientists to map out the entire genetic code of the Denisovans, a little-known ancient cousin of modern humans . The group that invaded China eventually split, with one population moving into Tibet and the other, now known as Han Chinese, dominating the lower elevations. Nielsen and his colleagues are analyzing other genomes to pin down the time of Denisovan interbreeding, which they said probably happened over a rather short period of time. 'There might be many other species from which we also got DNA, but we don’t know because we don’t have the genomes,' Nielsen said. 'The only reason we can say that this bit of DNA is Denisovan is because of this lucky accident of sequencing DNA from a little bone found in a cave in Siberia. 'We found the Denisovan species at the DNA level, but how many other species are out there that we haven’t sequenced?' Earth's highest peak, Mount Everest, in the Tibet Autonomous Region, the People's Republic of China. Researchers have now revealed how the locals have adapted to the high altitudes . Adaptation to low oxygen levels has allowed many peoples, from Andeans to Tibetans, to live at high altitude. When people from lower elevations move above about 13,000 feet, where oxygen levels are about 40 percent lower than at sea level, they typically tire easily, develop headaches, produce babies with lower birth weights and have a higher infant mortality rate. Tibetans have none of these problems, despite lower oxygen saturation in the blood and lower hemoglobin levels. Hemoglobin, which gives blood its red color, binds and transports oxygen to the body’s tissues. Previous research of the comparison of the genomes of 50 Tibetans and 40 Han Chinese shows that ethnic Tibetans split off from the Han less than 3,000 years ago and since then rapidly evolved a unique ability to thrive at high altitudes and low oxygen levels. The genome-wide comparison, performed by evolutionary biologists at the University of California, Berkeley, uncovered more than 30 genes with DNA mutations that have become more prevalent in Tibetans than Han Chinese, nearly half of which are related to how the body uses oxygen. One mutation in particular spread from fewer than 10 percent of the Han Chinese to nearly 90 percent of all Tibetans. The new findings could steer scientists to till-now unknown genes that play a role in how the body deals with decreased oxygen, and perhaps explain some diseases, including schizophrenia and epilepsy, associated with oxygen deprivation in the womb, he said. The widespread mutation in Tibetans is near a gene called EPAS1, a so-called 'super athlete gene' identified several years ago and named because some variants of the gene are associated with improved athletic performance. Researchers obtained DNA from 50 Tibetans living in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China and 40 Han Chinese from Beijing. The Tibetans lived in two villages located at elevations of 4,300 meters (14,100 feet) and 4,600 meters (15,100 feet). Chinese researchers took blood samples from the participants and measured oxygen saturation, red blood cell concentration and hemoglobin content in their blood. The analysis revealed that the common ancestors of Tibetans and Han Chinese split into two populations about 2,750 years ago, with the larger group moving to the Tibetan plateau. That group eventually shrank, while the low-elevation Han population expanded dramatically. Today, the Han Chinese are the dominant ethnic group in mainland China. The Tibetan branch either merged with the people’s already occupying the Tibetan plateau, or replaced them.","Mutation is similar to a 'super athlete' gene believed to give improved athletic performance .

"Sitting by her hospital bed and reading books and cards from well-wishers, Malala Yousafzai is a symbol of courage. The 15-year-old girl was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman in Pakistan, after she defied them by writing about the importance of education for females. Flown to Britain for surgery after the bullets grazed her brain, the inspiring teenager is now starting to recover - and began by thanking her supporters around the world for their 'inspiring' well-wishes. Scroll down for video . Malala Yousafzai, who was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman in Pakistan, has thanked people around the world for their humbling support . Thousands have signed a petition asking that the teenager, who called for female education, be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize . Her message came as thousands of people have called for her to be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for her demand for women's education in Pakistan, a right that the Taliban opposes. Speaking on behalf of Malala exactly a month after she was targeted on a school bus, her father Ziauddin Yousafzai said she wanted to thank well-wishers for helping her to 'survive and stay strong'. Malala was flown to Britain for specialist treatment at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital after escaping death by inches when a bullet 'grazed' her brain on October 9. She was in her school van on the outskirts of the city of Mingora in the Taliban-held Swat Valley when men with guns stopped the vehicle. They demanded that other girls . identify Malala who, in early 2009, had written an anonymous blog about . life under the Taliban, who had banned all girls in her area from . attending school. The . gun-weilding terrorists shot two girls, who suffered . non-life-threatening injuries, and fired at Malala, striking her in the . head and neck, according to officials. Malala was travelling home from school with two classmates when she was shot at point-blank range by extremists who boarded her school bus . Malala was flown to Britain for specialist treatment at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital after escaping death when a bullet grazed her brain . The shooting sparked international outrage and the Taliban issued a statement online saying that, if Malala were to survive, they would attack her again. Mr Yousafzai, his wife and their two sons flew to the UK last month to be with Malala, who was travelling home from school with two classmates when she was shot at point-blank range by extremists. In a statement issued by the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Mr Yousafzai said: 'She wants me to tell everyone how grateful she is and is amazed that men, women and children from across the world are interested in her well-being. 'We deeply feel the heart-touching good wishes of the people across the world of all caste, colour and creed.' Malala, . who has been praised for her courage in campaigning for the rights of . women and girls in Pakistan, has received thousands of gifts, cards and . messages of support since arriving in Birmingham on October 15. Among . the gifts are pocket money 'for sweets', the teenager’s favourite CDs, . school books, clothing, toys and jewellery, while whole classes of . pupils have written letters and messages supporting Malala’s campaign . for girls’ education. VIDEO: Malala defies the extremists from her hospital bedside . Malala Yousafzai with her father Ziauddin Yousafzai, who with his wife and their two sons flew to the UK last month to be with their injured daughter . Since arriving at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham (seen here on on October 19) the Pakistani schoolgirl has begun to make a slow recovery after being targeted for demanding education . In his statement, issued as new pictures were released showing his daughter sitting up reading a book and looking through cards sent to her, Mr Yousafzai added: 'I am awfully thankful to all the peace-loving well-wishers who strongly condemn the assassination attempt on Malala, who pray for her health and support the grand cause of peace, education, freedom of thought and freedom of expression.' Doctors have established that a bullet travelled along the left side of Malala’s jaw, damaging her skull and jaw joint. The round, which was removed by surgeons in Pakistan, initially struck Malala’s left brow, but, instead of penetrating the skull, travelled underneath the skin along the whole length of the side of her head, and into her neck. Tomorrow has been declared Malala Day . by former UK prime minister Gordon Brown in his role as UN Special Envoy . for Global Education. The . 'day of action' coincides with Mr Brown’s trip to Pakistan to deliver a . petition containing more than a million signatures to President Asif Ali . Zardari, urging him to make education a reality for all Pakistani . children, irrespective of gender. While . campaigners demand educations, more than 60,000 people are backing a . petition to nominate the brave schoolgirl for the prestigious award. Army doctors, seen moving Malala Yousafzai to an Air Ambulance destined for London, at Islamabad International Airport in Pakistan, fought to save the schoolgirl . The children's rights activist was shot in the head in an assassination attempt as she sat on a school bus . The call comes ahead of this Saturday’s global day of action marking one month since Malala was shot in the head by the Taliban. In the UK, Shahida Choudhary is campaigning for the Prime Minister and prominent politicians to write to the Nobel committee to recommend Malala. Ms Choudhary said: 'Malala doesn’t just represent one young woman, she speaks out for all those who are denied an education purely on the basis of their gender. 'There are girls like Malala in the UK and across the world. I was one of them. 'I started this petition because a Nobel Peace Prize for Malala will send a clear message that the world is watching and will support those who stand up for the right of girls to get an education.' Ms Choudhary also fought for her education when she was taken out of school in the UK aged 16 and forced into a marriage in Pakistan. She escaped back to the UK, returned to education aged 28, and now runs a network in Birmingham to support women in similar situations. The global petition to have Malala nominated, on Change.org, was started in Canada by Tarek Fatah, a writer and broadcaster. It has already achieved support from Canada’s four largest political parties and has been replicated by supporters in other countries, including France and Spain. The Nobel Committee rules states that members of national assemblies and governments are able to make nominations for the prize. Nominations close in February.","Thousands demand teenager who was shot for campaigning for education is awarded Nobel Peace Prize .

"Accused: Gary Glitter has denied committing a string of sex offences against three girls under 13 in the 1970s and 80s . Gary Glitter has denied committing a string of sex offences against three girls under 13 in the 1970s and 80s. The 70-year-old former pop star, whose real name is Paul Gadd, faces ten charges relating to the alleged historic crimes. He had already been charged with sex attacks on two girls aged under 13 and 14 in the mid 1970s but as he appeared in court today he faced the further charge in relation to the other girl. The singer listened to proceedings at south London’s Southwark Crown Court with the assistance of a hearing device and spoke only to confirm his name and enter not guilty pleas to the charges. Sporting his trademark goatee, he arrived at court wearing a fedora hat, navy blue double-breasted jacket, grey trousers, a white shirt and a silk pink tie, with dark glasses obscuring his face. The accessories have become a trademark look for the ageing rocker, who was once known for his outlandish fashion sense. Appearing under his real name, he denied administering a drug and having unlawful sexual intercourse and carrying out the four indecent assaults, and also pleaded not guilty to the other charges. Gadd, from Marylebone in central London, is accused of one count of attempted rape and another of indecent assault on a girl under the age of 13 in 1975. In relation to a second complainant, he faces four charges of indecent assault when she was under the age of 13 in 1977. He is also accused of plying the girl with drink with the intention to 'stupefy or overpower' her to have sex with him between January and May 1977. And he faces one charge of unlawful intercourse with a girl aged under 13 between the same dates and relation to the same girl. In relation to a third complainant who was under the age of 16, he is charged with two counts of indecent assault between October 1979 and December 1980. None of the alleged victims can be named for legal reasons. Charges: The 70-year-old former pop star, whose real name is Paul Gadd, faces 10 charges relating to the alleged historic crimes . Judge Alistair McCreath told Gadd he would face trial on January 12 in a case which is expected to last three weeks. The judge told him: 'You can go now on the same bail you have had up until now to return as and when you are required to but you are aware that your trial has been fixed for January 12.'

"From Michael Schumacher winning the Grand Prix to George Osborne at Margaret Thatcher's funeral - we all know big boys really can cry. But a few tears over a bad batch of buns was a step too far for fans of the Great British Bake Off, as tears from two male contestants on Tuesday's show provoked a Twitter tirade accusing both of being a '#crybaby'. First it was Glenn Cosby, the 46-year-old teacher from Teignmouth in Devon, who turned on the waterworks as he explained to the cameras after the disaster that was his almond and apricot brioches and sticky caramel kannelbullen that were so sticky they stuck to the tin. But when Howard Middleton, 51, who was ditched by judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry - and the graphic designer-turned-coucil worker from Sheffield seized the chance to show off his own lip-wobbling skills. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Welling up: Glenn, left, has a sob to the cameras... but it was Howard's turn for tears when he was voted off . Far from seeing the sweet and syrupy side to the emotional end of episode six, viewers lashed out at the blubbing bakers, accusing them - and the show - of being overly sentimental. Programmes such as ITV's The X Factor have already been slammed for relying too much on 'sob stories' in a poor attempt to stir viewers' emotions. And the BBC Two cookery contest escaped none of the abuse last night, with James Cole joining in the Twitter tirade: 'Crying is for when we lose the Ryder Cup, not when you f*** up your buns on Great British Bake-Off.' Rob Murphy tweeted; 'Big Glenn crying over his failed brioches on Great British Bake Off makes you realise what an easy life you lead. #hardship.' Gaby Ireland wrote: 'Why are people crying on bake off? It's not life or death if you've burnt your cake!' While Jack Pullein said: 'B***** hell great British bake off is turning into X Factor with all these sob stories.' Others took a more tongue-in-cheek view of the whole spectacle, with Andrew Simmonds commenting: 'Only in the UK would people cry over slightly disappointingly baked goods.' Though they were in a minority, one or two fans admitted that their own heartstrings had been tugged, with Phoebe Williams tweeting: 'Had to pretend to be texting so my mum wouldn't see that I was crying at Great British Bake Off.' Break down: Glenn's brioches did not survive his attempts to bash them out the tin . During the show, Glenn produced a series of unimpressive bakes - his caramel kannelbull earning the put-down from Paul Hollywood: 'What you've actually got is a very, very sharp, sour-tasting cinnamon. It doesn't taste good - have you tried one of these yet?' And when it came to his almond and apricot brioches, Paul said: 'Apricots have just been plonked on top like that. They look awful.' Even Mary Berry had to concede of the kannelbull: 'Sadly this is something that really hasn't worked.' Earlier, his signature bake - a 'Devonshire panettone' - was declared 'definitely underbaked'. But even this could not compete with Howard's all-too experimental signature bake - a tea loaf flavoured with hemp. Unusual: Mary Berry appears confused by the ingredients of Howard's Dale and Hemp Yorkshire loaf . And his 'peachy buns' that failed to taste of peach and Baumschnecken that were 'very dry' were the proverbial icing on the cake of his defeat. Having treated us all to a good weep before the judging, Glenn would not let himself be upstaged by Howard's dramatic exit, as he turned the taps on again in the final moments of the show to choke: 'I feel terrible – it should have been me. So now I have to do it. I have to carry on and do well.' And then came Howard. 'It’s been an absolutely fantastic experience and there are people in there who I have been very, very close to...' he sobbed. 'They are such fantastic bakers and I am dead chuffed that I was there with them.'","Great British Bake Off episode six ended in tears from two contestants .

"Dennis Plater, 82, who was found stabbed to death outside his home in Gloucestershire last Friday . Tributes have been paid to a model-railway loving pensioner who was found stabbed to death on the driveway of his bungalow in the Cotswolds. Dennis Plater, 82, was discovered last Friday at his home in Walkley Hill, in Stroud, Gloucestershire following reports that he had died. On Sunday police arrested a 47-year-old man more than 100 miles away in Southsea, Hampshire and he remains in custody while being questioned by detectives. In a statement released by his family, Mr Plater was described as a beloved husband, father, brother and grandfather. It said: 'Dennis and his wife Mary moved to Stroud in 2004 to be closer to their daughter and her family; they had come to call it home. 'Dennis enjoyed crafts, tapestry and was most happy tinkering with his model railway. 'It is incomprehensible that we have lost Dennis in this way, and the family would like to ask that you respect our privacy at this difficult time. 'We thank all the Gloucestershire Police force for their hard work, help and support.' After his body was discovered, a white forensic tent was erected on the driveway of Mr Plater's home and police covered the windows of the house with black sheets.

Another neighbour added: 'It's really sad. Apparently a neighbour found him on the drive.' Gloucestershire Police added that Mr Plater's family is being supported by police family liaison officers . 'It's tragic. This is a peaceful road. There have been a few burglaries but nothing like this. Gloucestershire Police added: 'The dead man's family has been notified and is being supported by family liaison officers as well as being kept informed of the ongoing investigation.'

"British Airways boss Willie Walsh has predicted that the much-vaunted third runway for Heathrow will never be built because dithering politicians lack the courage to make tough decisions. As a result, Heathrow will be overtaken permanently next year by Dubai as the world’s busiest airport, he said. Mr Walsh warned the situation could force airlines including BA, which has its own terminal at the airport, to base themselves elsewhere – resulting in British job losses and stunted economic growth. British Airways boss Willie Walsh (pictured) has predicted Heathrow's third runway will not happen because dithering politicians lack the courage to make tough decisions . The withering attack came just hours after Government airports tsar Sir Howard Davies launched a 12-week consultation into UK airport expansion. Three options are on the table: Two rival plans at Heathrow – one for a third runway and another to extend an existing one – and an option for a second runway at Gatwick. However, Mr Walsh, CEO of BA’s parent company, the International Airlines Group, said that ‘like many other world-class reports’, it would gather dust on a shelf and never be implemented. ‘Politicians won’t be brave enough to grasp the nettle. I don’t think we have the politicians in place who will deal with it,’ he said. Britain’s political class lacked vision and had ‘given up on world ambition,’ he added. Sir Howard also warned of the economic damage to the UK if politicians failed to act speedily on his final report due just after the general election in May next year. He said of the next Government: ‘If they duck that, they will pay. We are reaching then end of the runway.’ But Mr Walsh said: ‘Maybe I am cynical but I remain totally convinced that nothing will actually happen.’ Sir Howard’s commission says an extra runway at Heathrow or Gatwick will cost billions of pounds more than predicted - pictured is Heathrow's terminal 5 . During a Q&A session with veteran BBC broadcaster John Humphrys at the Airport Operators Association annual conference in London, Mr Walsh said he had already planned BA’s future on the basis that neither Heathrow nor Gatwick will expand. He said: ‘Growth in the UK will be constricted. Heathrow is full. But my business doesn’t just relate to Heathrow. We will continue to grow. Not all of that growth will be at Heathrow.’ He said that because BA was part of IAG, with sister Spanish airline Iberia based in Madrid, they had the flexibility to expand abroad. Mr Walsh said that the gulf state of Dubai was expanding its airports massively. ‘Next year they will overtake Heathrow as the busiest airport in the world,’ he said. Dubai International currently has two runways. In the first three months of this year it overtook Heathrow as the busiest airport in the world, before falling back because of work on its runways. Mr Walsh said Dubai's airport (pictured) will soon overtake Heathrow 'as the busiest airport in the world' Mr Walsh added: ‘Once the work has been completed they are expected to overtake us by quarterly passenger traffic early next year. That will become permanent.’ And Dubai said in September that it planned to invest £20 billion in a mega-hub airport in the desert to accommodate 240 million passengers a year, dwarfing the 72 million passengers that Heathrow serves. Mr Walsh said Dubai had support from politicians and business leaders with ‘vision and real aspiration’. He pointed out that the terms of Sir Howard’s Airport Commission consultation was to ensure that the UK remained only as the major hub ‘in Europe’. Mr Walsh said of UK politicians: ‘They have given up on world ambition. We’ve gone from world ambition to European ambition. What next? It’s disappointing.’ Sir Howard’s commission says an extra runway at Heathrow or Gatwick will cost billions of pounds more than predicted. A new Thames Estuary airport favoured by Boris Johnson has already been ruled out, although the London Mayor still insists it is the best option. AIRPORT security is becoming so extreme that passengers could be forced to walk through scanners ‘in hospital gowns’, Willie Walsh said. He claimed many checks, including rules on liquids, were unnecessary and simply caused long queues. Mr Walsh said: ‘[Security is] still the most frustrating part of the customer journey that I experience. It’s also the area that frustrates our customers most. ‘You are still taking off your shoes, which I’m sure is not necessary. We’re taking everything out of our bag when there’s technology which can deal with that.’ He added: ‘In ten years’ time you will have to go through security in a hospital gown. You won’t be allowed to wear clothes.’ He said that if security chiefs started with a blank piece of paper, they would dispense with many of the checks, and complained of confusing inconsistencies in the rules. He told the Airport Operators Association annual conference in London: ‘Sometimes you have to take your iPad out, other times you can leave it in. Some tell you to take your shoes off, others to keep them on. Belt on? Belt off. ‘Why is it I can have my iPad in my bag this time, but not the next time? These are things which don’t make sense.’ When challenged that airport bosses did not believe it was an issue, Mr Walsh retorted: ‘That’s not what my customers tell me.’","Willie Walsh has predicted third runway for Heathrow will never be built .

The menu caters to almost any diet, with vegetarian, vegan and gluten- and dairy-free options as well as meat, poultry and fish. Customers get the chance to learn basic sign language through graphics incorporated in the menu and cheat sheets placed on tables. The Canadian restaurant was founded by Anjan Manikumar, who is hoping to revolutionise the restaurant industry with his establishment that supports the deaf community. Prior to Signs, Mr Manikumar worked at another restaurant in Canada, where he noticed deaf customers were frequently let down and staff struggled to communicate with them. Instead of interacting with sign language, diners had to resort to pointing and nodding when ordering their meal. Diners at the restaurant have a deeper appreciation of the challenges the hard-of-hearing face each day . A waiter at the world's first deaf restaurant . After learning American Sign Language (ASL), Mr Manikumar mastered the basics of interacting before he decided to embark on the venture that would allow the hard-of-hearing to work and dine using sign language. Signs has a total of 50 staff, including 37 deaf employees, and manager Rachel Shemuel has been busy organising a team that can cater to the deaf community. Ms Shemuel 38, of Toronto, said: 'We wanted to create a dining experience to change the misconception that deaf people are disabled, when in fact, they just speak another language. 'For many of our members of staff, this is their very first job, so it's a new experience for them too. 'Since the restaurant opened we've been extremely busy, but the public are really enjoy coming in and dining, the atmosphere is great. Changing misconceptions: The restaurant asks customers to order food using American Sign Language (ALS) The carefully curated menu has an impressive list of dishes catering to those with food intolerances . Ms Shemuel, who does not suffer from any hearing impediments herself, has learned to sign along with the rest of the team. 'Customers are greeted at the door by a host who will explain how the restaurant works,' she said. 'Each table has a cheat book with pictures to help the customers learn how to sign to the staff. 'The cheat book includes numbers and the alphabet, which is really helpful when ordering food.' Signs offers customers a chance to learn basic sign language through  graphics incorporated in the menu, cheat sheets placed on tables and wall mounted photographs illustrating signs for common words needed in a restaurant like the names of alcoholic drinks.

Signs offers customers a chance to learn basic sign language through graphics incorporated in the menu . The 150-seat restaurant, which offers a Canadian-styled menu fused with international flavours, has received hundreds of job applications from not only Canada but from as far as India. 'The biggest challenge that we have faced so far was definitely the training of our staff,' Ms Shemuel continued. 'Most of our employees were learning skills from scratch, as well as learning how to sign and work together as a team. 'Many of our staff members have been turned away again and again from jobs, despite being fully qualified simply because they're deaf.

"The body of a teenager who disappeared after a music festival in the United States at the weekend has been recovered from a lake six days after he was last seen. Wynter Levi Emerson, from Nelson on New Zealand's South Island, was travelling in the U.S when he went missing after the Bumbershoot music and arts festival held in Seattle every Labor Day weekend. Seattle Police confirmed on Monday morning the body pulled from Lake Union, just a few kilometres from where the festival was held at the Seattle Centre,  belonged to Wynter Emerson. The body of missing New Zealand teenager Wynter Levi Emerson has been pulled from a lake in Seattle . 'We do not suspect foul play at this point,' officer Patrick Michaud told Stuff.co.nz, before adding that their investigation supported that. The teenager, who had been travelling around Canada and the United States on a gap year, was last seen on September 1 at the close of the festival. He was reported missing the next day by a friend, and his passport and wallet were reportedly handed in to police. Messages of support flowed in for Wynter's family both during their search for him and after his body was found. A social media campaign to try and locate Wynter began on Monday after his family was told he had not been seen for a number of days following Bumbershoot. According to a Facebook page set up by his brother - Help Us Find Wynter Emerson - family and friends suspected the 18-year-old may have got into some trouble after the festival. The 18-year-old went missing after Bumbershoot music and arts festival which finished on September 1 . His body was found in Lake Union, very close to where the Labor Day festival was held . 'Wynter has been reported missing now for almost a week. The last time anyone heard from him was at the Bumbershoot Festival. It was reported that he may have been slipped drugs,' a post on the page read. 'His wallet was found at a construction site near 6th & Bell. He is alone and has no idea where he is. His cellphone is not working and likely does not have any money. PLEASE if you have seen him in Seattle, send for help. 'He is from New Zealand and is not aware of his surroundings. Take the five seconds to share this post. It might just save his life. Praying that he is still okay...' the post concluded. The teenager's family were notified of the 18-year-old's death early on Tuesday morning. 'Hey everybody thanks for the support. We have just been informed that they found his body, will no longer need to find Wynter. R.I.P', Wynter's brother wrote on the page. A member in another group - Where is Wynter Emerson - also penned a post about the New Zealander's passing. 'It is with sadness that I post that earlier this morning Wynter's family was notified that Wynter has passed away,' Susan Schuler wrote. 'Our hearts and prayers are with his family and friends at this tragic time. Thank you to everyone who made efforts to try and find Wynter. RIP Wynter Emerson...you are loved.' The teenager had taken a gap year and was travelling around Canada and the US before returning home to study at the end of the year . He was discovered in Lake Union, just a few kilometres from where Bumbershoot festival was held in the Seattle Centre . On Monday the teenager's parents Shon and Ally Emerson described the ordeal of having their son go missing overseas as 'the worst day of our lives'. 'Obviously we are heart sick with worry and just want our boy to be safe, we love him so much', Ally wrote on Facebook. A fund has now been created to help Wynter's family bring him home to New Zealand. 'We're so devastated at the loss of our beloved Wynter. His body was found at Lake Union, Seattle this morning. Please take a moment to remember him and his family and donate even a penny to help his family bring Wynter home. Even the slightest amount helps. You can donate via debit/credit if you do not have a PayPal. We love you Wynter. R.I.P,' his brother wrote on Facebook.

"She might have two lovely daughters of her own but that doesn't mean Spain's Queen Letizia is immune to the charms of other people's children. The Spanish Queen looked thrilled as an adorable little girl approached her with a posy of flowers as she arrived in Luxembourg for a state visit this morning. With her was King Felipe, who looked equally smitten as he crouched down beside his wife to say hello to the child, who was warmly wrapped up against the November chill in a duck down coat and a pair of eye-catching striped tights. Scroll down for video . Smitten: Both Queen Letizia and King Felipe looked smitten by the adorable little flower girl . State visit: The Spanish royal couple are visiting Luxembourg at the invitation of Grand Duke Henri . Letizia, 42, and Felipe, 46, are in Luxembourg at the invitation of the Duchy's Grand Duke, Henri, and his Cuban wife Maria Teresa. Ever elegant, Letizia looked glamorous in a chic cream coat dress enlivened with a floral pattern created using the traditional Spanish blackwork embroidery technique. Rather more modern was her softly-waved hairstyle and the stylish grey and cream clutch she carried for her arrival at the Palais Grand Ducal in the centre of Luxembourg City. Once there, and in front of an excited crowd of well-wishers, she and Felipe were greeted by a dapper Duke Henri, 59, and his wife, who wore an elegant dip-dyed silk coat. Also in the welcoming party was Henri's heir, Crown Prince Guillaume, 33, and his Belgian wife, Stéphanie de Lannoy, 30, who comes from a family descended from the Flemish royal house of Hainault, which, among others, produced several mediaeval English Queens.

Welcome party: Crown Princess Stéphanie (far left) and Crown Prince Guillaume (right) were also there . Luxembourg's monarchy is one of the youngest in Europe and began in 1815 following the Congress of Vienna at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Full independence under the Grand Dukes came just under 20 years later, when the Treaty of London enshrined Luxembourg's existence in international law and ended years of rule by the Burgundians, French, Prussians and the Dutch. Although part of Luxembourg was later incorporated into what would, in 1839, become Belgium, the country remained intact through the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the First and Second World Wars. Indeed, Luxembourg's monarchy has enjoyed a considerably smoother run over the last century than Spain's own, which was abolished during the dictatorship of General Franco and only reinstated under King Juan Carlos in the mid 1970s. Juan Carlos, who stood down earlier this year, became the fourth monarch to abdicate in less than two years, following Pope Benedict XVI, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, and King Albert II of Belgium. The latter's heir, now King Philippe of the Belgians, 54, is first cousin to Grand Duke Henri and a regular visitor to Luxembourg. Stylish: Letizia carried a grey and white clutch and wore a dress decorated with blackwork embroidery .

"It's starred on Jeopardy, helped with cancer research and even worked in a call centre but now Watson’s next job is in the public’s hands. In February, the IBM Watson team asked firms to design mobile apps that take advantage of its supercomputer's processing power. Hundreds of submissions have now been narrowed down to 25 finalists, including an app that lets you speak to an avatar of a famous person, and one that offers advice for expectant mothers. The three winners will be awarded 90 days access to the complex computer’s developer platform. The IBM Watson Mobile Developer Challenge invited teams to design mobile apps using Watson's, pictured, cognitive computing capabilities. The 25 finalists will now submit prototypes for judging, after which only five teams will present proposals to IBM. Three winners will get access to the Watson's developer platform . The IBM Watson Mobile Developer Challenge was launched at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. It invited teams to design mobile apps using Watson’s cognitive computing capabilities to ‘analyse, discover insights and learn from Big Data’. The 25 finalists will now submit prototypes for judging, after which only five teams will present proposals to IBM. The three winners will get access to the API as well as consultations from IBM Interactive design services. The finalists are a mix of entertainment, health and innovation. For example, the Azoft team want to build an app ‘for anyone who wants to talk to an interesting and smart person, politician, scientist or celebrity’. Ultramatics: Offers personalised answers to the most important health questions. Voyager Innovations: Lets users shop surely and quickly. Ringful Health: Lets patients have informed conversations with their doctors on healthcare decisions. Majestyk Apps: A cognitive companion that improves education. GenieMD: Lets users take a more active role in managing their health. Red Ant: A sales trainer that lets employees easily identify individual customers’ likely interests. BrightMinded: A virtual personal trainer that follows users through all aspects of their fitness experience. 9W Search: The next-generation approach to the consumption of financial information. Strategia Tecnologia: Helps family farmers get answers to their questions about agriculture. Acute Dynamics: Lets users view, execute and track activities related to their work. CrayonData: Helps consumers simplify choices in every aspect of life. GoGoHealth: Lets doctors diagnose and treat patients remotely, using evidence-based protocols. Kutir: Lets hiring managers and recruiters identify potential hires and alerts candidates to openings. InXero: Lets reseller businesses more efficiently reach customers on their offerings. Instancy: A revolutionary personal learning guide. Azoft: Lets users connect with any interesting and smart person, politician, scientist or celebrity. Rumble: Newspaper and magazine apps with the highest level of user experience and personalization. Inteliwise: A user-friendly AI-powered app that connects citizens and local city councils. Biovideo: Puts the most helpful information for new and expectant mothers at their fingertips. Activepackets: A personalized automobile research app. Unified . Computer Intelligence Corp: Lets users quickly order fresh ingredients . from best-priced sources for delivery within hours. Flexport: Makes international trade more accessible and affordable. Ontodia: Concierge service lets users ask detailed questions about local government and private resources. Sense.ly/MyIdealDoctor: Lets individuals and doctors quickly access information for unmatched healthcare. Xoriant: Lets rural customers access microfinance organization and related data on the go. They propose that Watson will be able to find answers to questions asked to a users’ idol that are found in public access pages, publications, interviews and books, but which are not easy to find through standard search engines. Earlier this year Watson became a call centre worker. This graphic explains how the scheme worked . The team said: ‘Because we can focus Watson on particular sets of source materials to prepare answers and make Watson learn, it will produce an ultimate product that gives everyone a gift of real-life communication through Q&A with someone they’d only dreamt of talking to.’ ‘Users can immediately ask questions or initiate conversations with people of their interest as in a regular instant-message service. ‘At later stages, we can implement speech recognition and text-to-speech ability. Meanwhile, the Biovideo App has been designed to ‘provide the best help for new and expectant mothers at their fingertips.’ It uses the Baby 101 searchable database and plans to make the service available to all – it is currently limited by location. ‘Providing the power of Watson to the Baby 101 program provides unlimited information, insight and reach to new parents,’ explained the proposal. ‘A mother with a sick child can ask Dr. Watson what’s wrong with her baby and get a 100 per cent accurate response from data Watson has pulled from trusted sources on the internet, including scientific journals.’ Elsewhere, the GoGoHealth app would let doctors and specialists diagnose and treat patients remotely. Patients would log into their provider app, and the app makes a call to the Electronic Health Record system the doctor is using, pulls all history data, and asks the patients to specify their symptoms. In 2011 IBM's Watson computer competed against Jeopardy's two most successful contestants, Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. During the practice match Watson was given the same questions as the other contestants and could virtually press the buzzer to answer. In the majority of cases Watson beat both contestants . Based on the symptoms and history, the app would ask each patient questions to accurately assess the condition. There are also fitness apps among the finalists, such as Brightminded. According to the team behind the plans: ‘Watson can be the perfect fitness trainer, and to achieve that it needs to be with users during all aspects of their fitness journey: when they are at the gym, at the track or at the supplements shop. ‘We want to use Watson’s cognitive abilities to learn from users’ daily data - gathered from manual entry and wearable sensor technology, latest medical research and available online fitness expertise to determine what works for a user’s metabolism, physical structure, fat distribution, and hormonal profile.’ They said the Watson-powered app could change its recommendation as training progresses, or  goals change. It could also recommend the best supplement products based on reviews and requirements, for example if the user is allergic to dairy.","In February, IBM asked teams to design apps for its Watson computer .

"The Duke of Edinburgh is ‘responding well’ to hospital treatment for his recurrent bladder infection, Buckingham Palace said yesterday. The 91-year-old was taken to hospital by ambulance on Wednesday after the infection that first affected him in June – forcing him to miss part of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations – flared up again. Palace officials insisted that the move was a ‘precautionary measure’ and said doctors were likely to keep him in  Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for further treatment and observation. Scroll down for video update . Summer break: The Queen and Prince Philip were pictured arriving at Balmoral in Scotland on Sunday and the Duke of Edinburgh is believed to have had two doctors working with him for 8 months . Medics are understood to be treating his latest infection with antibiotics. A statement from the Palace said: ‘The . Duke of Edinburgh is responding well to treatment. It is unclear when . he will be discharged, but he is likely to remain in hospital for a few . more days.’ Prince Philip was staying at the Queen’s Balmoral retreat when he complained of feeling cold during a carriage-driving trip. It came within hours of his return from official engagements on the Isle of Wight. Good spirits: The Duke appeared happy and healthy during an appearance at the Cowes Regatta on the Isle of Wight last week . Monday: The Duke looked in good health as he strolled around Cowes, Isle of Wight, waving at well-wishers . Appearance: The Duke spent Monday and Tuesday on the Isle of Wight, carrying out several public engagements . The Duke had met wellwishers and strolled around the Isle of Wight during his public engagements earlier this week, but has since been hospitalised . It is the third time in eight months that he has needed hospital treatment, following successful heart surgery over Christmas. The Duke has been closely  monitored . by doctors since the scare, but his latest health problems have raised . questions about his continued workload. The Duke has carried out more than 100 . official engagements  since December – including a  gruelling Jubilee . tour of Britain  and Northern Ireland – when a stent was inserted to . clear a blocked coronary artery. He was carrying out official duties just three weeks later. Family time: The Duke with daughter Princess Anne watching Zara Phillips compete in the Olympics earlier this month . Treatment: Police stand guard outside the A&E entrance of Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, where Prince Philip has been taken . 'Precaution': The Duke's visit to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary comes after he suffered a bladder infection during the Diamond Jubilee celebrations . Despite his advancing years, he still . undertakes around 350  public engagements each year and continues to . pride himself on his active lifestyle. Royal biographer Hugo Vickers said: ‘He is the sort of person who wants to keep on going. ‘I don’t think it is part of his . make-up to slow down. I think he just wants to keep going until he . drops. He is still very interested in life. 'That is how people of their . age keep going.’ Admitted: The Duke was staying in Balmoral with the Queen when he was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary . Private residence: Philip travelled to the hospital, about 40 miles away from Balmoral, (pictured) by road . The Queen and other royals are being . kept closely informed about the Duke’s condition, but are  understood . not to have visited him in hospital.

"A bomb disposal heroine was killed when she fearlessly returned to an Afghan alleyway in an attempt to save lives by defusing a Taliban device, an inquest heard yesterday. Captain Lisa Head – who told her family that she had the ‘best job in the world’ – was commended by a coroner, who said her courage ‘cannot be praised too highly’. He also hailed her brave comrades, who ignored the threat of further improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and dashed into the alleyway to reach the mortally-wounded 29-year-old soldier. Captain Lisa Jade Head of 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment, the Royal Logistic Corps, lost her limbs in the blast in an alleyway in Helmand Province on April 18 2011 . Their actions and the immediate first aid they gave her meant she survived long enough to be evacuated to a specialist military ward at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. Her devastated family were able to be at her bedside to say goodbye before she succumbed to her catastrophic injuries the following day. Capt Head’s unit performs a similar job to the U.S. bomb disposal team in the Oscar-winning film The Hurt Locker. Recording a verdict that she was unlawfully killed in a war zone,  the coroner, Professor Paul Marks said: ‘I cannot praise too highly the courage of Lisa Head and  her colleagues. ‘The reason for this is because they are all volunteers deployed in a theatre of war far from home and family for our continuing benefit and security.’ Capt Head, from Huddersfield, was among a handful of women soldiers trained to save the lives of countless troops and civilians by finding and disarming IEDs. She had deployed to Afghanistan with the specialist 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal regiment, the Royal Logistic Corps, to tackle hidden roadside bombs. Capt Head defused one Improvised Explosive Device (IED) before retreating to a safe distance and moments later was hit by an explosion (file picture of soldier defusing bomb) On April 18 last year, she was sent on an operation in Nahr-e-Saraj, a Taliban stronghold in Helmand Province, after British troops spotted a suspicious wire protruding from the ground. Capt Head risked her life to coolly defuse one IED before retreating to a safe distance. She returned to the alleyway to take photographs of the device when a second booby-trap partially detonated, resulting in no injuries.  Instead of cancelling the mission, Capt Head made a joke and nervelessly re-entered the narrow alleyway to neutralise the device. Her comrade, Corporal Adam Tucker, told Bradford Coroner’s Court: ‘She had a few cigarettes and made light of the situation. ‘I asked Captain Head over and over again if she was happy to continue and being a stubborn Yorkshire woman as she was, she was quite happy to continue.’ Tragically, a third bomb exploded, inflicting terrible injuries. Experts said insurgents had sown a complex cluster of devices to catch out bomb disposal specialists. In 2008, Corporal Sarah Bryant, 26, of the Intelligence Corps, died along with three SAS colleagues when a roadside bomb struck their Snatch Land Rover . Cpl Tucker said he grabbed a weapon, medical kit and metal detector to search for IEDs as he approached Capt Head. But when the dust thrown up by the 5lb explosive cleared he realised there was no time to search safely. He said: ‘We took the risk and ran down to Captain Head. On arrival we realised she was a quadruple amputee and time was limited. ‘She could not speak but her eyes were open and she was responsive. I was breathing and telling her to do it with me. I helped put her on a stretcher and that was the last time I saw her.’ Capt Head was airlifted to Camp Bastion and then flown to the UK. She was the second female British soldier to be killed in Afghanistan. In 2008, Corporal Sarah Bryant, 26, of the Intelligence Corps, died when a roadside bomb struck her Snatch Land Rover. Professor Marks told Cpl Tucker: ‘At potential risk to your own lives, you went to the help of one of your fallen comrades and did your absolute best. I commend you on that.’ Colonel Gareth Collett, an Army bomb disposal expert who investigated Capt Head’s death, said the first IED had a high metal content and was placed as a ‘come on’ for coalition soldiers who found it with metal detectors. But the enemy then laid two  low metal content devices nearby to hit troops dealing with the  first device. He told the inquest: ‘Why did she decide to go back? The simple answer is that she is a professional soldier. If the alleyway had not been cleared properly local nationals would have been killed.’","Captain Lisa Head lost her limbs in the blast in an alleyway in Helmand .

"Deadly: Alethea Parker, 51, almost died and lost both her legs and one hand after inhaling the deadly bacteria while in Tuscany in Italy . When Alethea Parker arrived at her rented Tuscan farmhouse for a holiday with her husband and friends, it seemed the dream destination. But, unbeknown to the holidaymakers, the house harboured a life-threatening bacteria: legionella. Their planned happy week in Italy was to leave Alethea in intensive care for months – and cause her to lose most of her limbs. For while, to many people, legionnaire’s disease has an almost mythical status, considered little more than scare stories about toxic water in taps, it remains a very real danger. Although she can’t be sure, legionella thrives in water systems and it is most likely Alethea was infected whilst showering. Just . last week, Public Health England issued an urgent alert after a newborn . child was admitted to intensive care with the illness, thought to have . been contracted from a contaminated home birthing pool. Up . to 15 per cent of people who contract the pneumonia-type lung . infection, caused by breathing in droplets of water contaminated with . the aggressive bacteria, will die. And those who survive can be left . with lifelong disabilities, like Alethea. Although . cases of UK infection have dropped, those contracted abroad have . remained steady, accounting for more than half of  the 235 instances in . 2011, when the last statistics are available. Yet . most of us, like Alethea, barely register the risks. The 51-year-old . retail manager from Farnborough, Hampshire, arrived in Italy in July . 2010 as the final destination of a two-week driving holiday around . Europe with her husband Barry, now 66, a retired warehouse manager, and . another couple. But Alethea soon started feeling very unwell. ‘I . developed a headache and became constantly thirsty. I felt lethargic . but assumed it was lingering work stress. Then, towards the end of the . holiday, I started being sick. We thought it was food poisoning.’ Back in Britain, her condition worsened and she began slurring her words, then fainted in the shower. ‘Barry rang our doctor. When he relayed my symptoms, they told him to call an ambulance,’ says Alethea. When paramedics arrived, Alethea was struggling to breathe. She was taken to Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey, where she was so unwell that doctors put her into an induced coma while they carried out checks. Barry, along with Alethea’s mother, brother and two sisters, were told that she was very seriously ill with legionnaire’s disease. ‘I’d heard of it but had no idea  how serious it was,’ he says. ‘We all burst into tears as the doctor told us she could die.’ The consultant said the only treatment was an ECMO (extra corporeal membrane oxygenation) machine  at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester. This complex equipment works like an artificial lung, taking blood from the lungs, removing carbon dioxide and then oxygenating it, before returning it to the body. Alethea was moved to Leicester, but things didn’t improve. ‘The doctors tried different types of antibiotics but nothing helped. Then, in the second week, her hands and feet started dying – they were shrivelling and becoming hard and locked,’ says Barry. The drug given to keep her alive – noradrenaline, injected into her heart to reduce the size of the blood vessels so it is easier for the heart  to pump – can cause blood vessels in hands and feet to shut off. Life-threatening: Legionella bacteria thrives in water systems  and it is most likely Alethea was infected whilst showering . In the second week, Alethea was taken off ECMO, transferred back to intensive care at Frimley and slowly brought out of the coma. She says: ‘It was like a weird dream – even seeing my hands and legs in such a bad way. I kept telling Barry to explain my absence to work.’ As Alethea slowly recovered, doctors said they would need to amputate her left hand, both legs just below the knee, as they had gangrene, and some fingers on her right hand. ‘My left hand was so painful and useless that I knew I couldn’t keep it, but I was really upset as I didn’t know how I’d work again. I coped because I never dwell on things. I had to go forwards and do the best I could.’ Barry says: ‘Alethea cried for about 20 seconds then said, “Right, I’m not going to cry any more, let’s get on with it.” She had this strength of character that seemed able to deal with it and not crumble – the rest of us took strength from that. ‘Removing the legs required a four-hour operation, yet she was  still quite chirpy afterwards. When I arrived in recovery, she was having a cup of tea and said, “You do realise you’re married to someone disabled?” I said I’d always wanted a blue badge for parking.’ Alethea returned home in February 2011 for the first time since her collapse in the shower the summer before. She is now able to drive thanks to a special handle on her car’s steering wheel and has regained her licence from the DVLA. She still visits a rehabilitation unit for maintenance on her prosthetic legs and hand but is now medically well, with no lasting problems with her organs. ‘You get used to it,’ she says. ‘It gets on my nerves needing someone with me all the time. Barry has to come on our girls’ weekends away now but I wanted life back to as normal as possible and that’s what we used to do every year. ‘I still think, “Gosh, this really has happened to me.” It feels surreal. But I’m adapting. People don’t realise how serious legionnaire’s is. When I hear about an outbreak now it sends shivers down my spine.’","Alethea Parker, 51, was diagnosed with legionnaire's disease .

"Dressed in overalls and carrying axes, these are the women who helped the Allied forces on their way to victory during the Second World War. The women, nicknamed the 'Lumberjills' were members of the Women's Timber Corps (WTC), whose job it was to fell trees, work in sawmills and carry out other heavy land duties. They were recruited by the Forestry Commission and replaced the men, who had left their jobs in order to join the armed forces. Some of the members of the Women's Timber Corp walking to work during the Second World War. They were recruited by the Forestry Commission and replaced the men who had left to join the armed forces . The women, nicknamed 'Lumberjills' carried out work such as felling trees, working in sawmills and driving tractors . Home-produced timber was urgently required for industry and the war effort: for pit props and railway sleepers, telegraph poles, aircraft construction, ship-building, gunstocks for the troops, transport packaging for army supplies, charcoal for explosives and gas-mask filters – and coffins. It was gruelling, backbreaking work - often carried out in harsh conditions - but more than 8,000 young women, some only in their mid teens, tackled it without a peep of protest. Girls were officially recruited from the age of 17 - although some who joined were as young as 14 - and came from all kinds of backgrounds and all walks of life. And today as the nation fell silent at 11am to mark Armistice Day, former Lumberjills up and down the country were reflecting on the wartime years with the WTC. One of those who stopped to pause at 11am and remember her time working on the land was 91-year-old Christina Forrester. Then 19-year-old Christina Forrester, left, signed up to join the Women's Timber Corps in 1942. Today, right, Mrs Forrester, 91, was reflecting on her time as a Lumberjill . Mrs Forrester was just 19 when she volunteered for the Corps in 1942, when she was working in an office in Dalmarnock, Glasgow. She was then sent to Shanford Lodge in Brechin, Angus, for a month's training where she was taught how to manually cut down trees. After that she was then posted to Alyth in Perthshire along with two other girls who joined up at the same time. There were 8,700 women recruited as Lumberjills during the Second World War and it was 2008 before they received any recognition for their role . She explained: 'When I went into the WTC I didn't know what was ahead of me. 'People didn't travel much in those days and moving from the Glasgow area to Perthshire seemed far away from family and friends. 'But everyone felt the same as they came from far and wide too. We all supported each other when someone was homesick or unwell.' But despite the tough nature of being in the WTC, Mrs Forrester says she has great memories of her time with the other Lumberjills. She explained: 'You had to get used to being told what to do and when to do it although it wasn't too regimented. Leisure time was a Sunday and there was dancing on Friday and Saturday night. 'The girls all walked four miles to and from the dances except when Jimmy Shand was playing and we were allowed a lift, in all our finery, on the back of a lorry. 'When the camp was disbanded in 1944, two of us were kept on and had lodgings in the village of Alyth. That was luxury. It was a great part of my life with many fond memories.' But despite their hard work, the 8,700 Lumberjills received no recognition and it was 2008 before they receive a badge acknowledging their efforts. The Women’s Timber Corps was disbanded in August 1946, with each girl handing back her uniform and receiving a letter from Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, who was their patron. However, in 2008 they all received badges in recognition of their efforts and a year later, many were invited to Buckingham Palace for a tea party with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Last year then marked the final year the veterans of the Women’s Land Army and Timber Corps marched past the Cenotaph in central London on Remembrance Sunday.","Women were encouraged to join the Women's Timber Corps during WW2 .

"A woman has been charged with reckless manslaughter after her boyfriend's mother tried to stop them fighting and suffered a fatal heart attack. Claudia Yanira Hernandez Soriano, 25, and Juan Francisco Martinez Rojas, 28, started punching and scratching each other after they returned to their Bergen, New Jersey home following a party early on Monday. When Ana Angelina Rojas-Jovel, 45, tried to break them up, Hernandez Soriano assaulted the woman, according to the Bergen County Prosecutor. 'During the assault, the victim apparently suffered a cardiac event which resulted in her death,' Prosecutor John L. Molinelli said in a statement. Fight: Claudia Yanira Hernandez Soriano, 25, above, and her boyfriend Juan Francisco Martinez Rojas, 28, started punching and scratching each other at their home on Monday when his mother intervened . Injured: Martinez Rojas' booking shot shows the scratches on his face from the domestic dispute . A seven-year-old child also witnessed the fight, according to the prosecutor, but he did not reveal the relationship between the adults and the youngster. Police responded to a 911 call from the apartment just after 4am on Monday and when they arrived, they found Rojas-Jovel dead on a bedroom floor. 'There were no obvious signs of trauma to the victim, however... the [couple] displayed signs of injury and appeared to have been involved in a domestic assault,' the prosecutor said. In their booking photos, both Hernandez Soriano and Martinez Rojas have scratches on their faces and necks. The pair were interviewed, as were the child and other residents. Scene: Soriano allegedly then assaulted the woman, Ana Angelina Rojas-Jovel, and she suffered a cardiac arrest at the first-floor apartment at the house (pictured) and died before police arrived at the scene . The Bergen County Medical Examiner's Office conducted an autopsy on Rojas-Jovel's body, but results were pending toxicology tests, the prosecutor said. Hernandez Soriano was charged with manslaughter, endangering the welfare of a child, domestic violence simple assault and hindering apprehension, according to authorities. Molinelli said Hernandez Soriano also hid evidence - but would not detail what it was - which investigators later recovered in a search at the crime scene. She was held at the Bergen County Jail on $250,000 bail. Martinez Rojas was also charged with child endangerment and domestic violence simple assault and sent to the county jail on $75,000 bail. A court hearing has been scheduled for Thursday morning at Hackensack Superior Court.","Claudia Yanira Hernandez Soriano, 25, and Juan Francisco Martinez Rojas, 28, started fighting after returning from a party on Monday morning .

"An 80-year-old Korean War veteran who's reliant on a wheelchair and lost one of his legs in combat was attacked and robbed in his own Colorado home on Saturday. Lee Pekish, who lives in Aurora on his military pension, last remembers walking his pug in the evening before things go blank. The next thing he knows, its hours later and he's in a pool of his own blood. Shameful: 80-year-old Korean War veteran Lee Pekish who's reliant on a wheelchair was attacked and robbed in his own Colorado home on Saturday . Amnesia: Pekish lost one of his legs in combat. He'd been outside with his dog when his memory of last Satruday's events go blank . At first, Pekish feared he'd had a stroke. 'Blood is everywhere and I really didn't know what the heck had happened to me. It took me most of the night to figure out what had happened,' Pekish told CBS Denver. He told KUSA: . 'When I woke up both my cat and my dog were right beside me here. And they never left me.' He also soon discovered nearly $400 missing from his home. Pekish realized he'd been attacked when he discovered on his head a gash about the size and shape of the butt of a gun. He'd fallen out of his wheelchair and was bleeding so profusely from a wound on his toes that he nearly lost three on the remaining leg. But the war-hardened vet refused to seek medical attention, at least at first. Eventually his friend Sandy Nolan convinced him to get the police involved. ''I says, he's going to be cranky because he didn't want me to call you. So if he gets cranky I am going to stand behind you!'' she told the police. Violent: Pekish at first thought he'd had a stroke when he awoke on the floor in a pool of blood--that, perhaps, he'd fallen out of his wheelchair because of the stroke and hurt himself--but soon found a gun butt shaped wound on his head . Drug addicts? Police suspect Pekish had gone back into the house and was facing his desk when an intruder bludgeoned him. Four hundred was missing from the home and police think the robber or robbers make also have been after drugs . Even when the officer showed up, Pekish said he didn't want medical attention. Thankfully, he relented and was taken by ambulance to the hospital where he received stitches. Pekish theorizes that, after he walked his dog, he went back into the house and a thief took the opportunity to take advantage of a disabled old man. He believes he was bludgeoned and that the intruder or intruders were interested not just in cash but also in stealing drugs. The proud retired arts professor told CBS Denver that,while he's terrified something like this could happen again, he's not sure there's anything that can be done about it. 'Where else would I go? I’m lucky to have a place this size at the rate I pay,' he said. This helplessness coming from an 80-year-old who bravely served his country infuriates Pekish's friends. And with so little evidence, police don't have much hope they'll nab the guilty party. 'I was just so angry and so upset that some lowlife amoeba would come in and attack a vereran of our foreign wars,' Nolan told CBS Denver.","Lee Pekish, who lives in Aurora, Colorado on his military pension, last remembers walking his pug in the evening before things go blank .

"When it comes to pushy parents, Chinese father He Liesheng took top prize after making his son jog in the snow aged just four, before teaching him to fly a plane aged five. Now Liesheng has taken things a step further by taking son He Yide, now six, on a 1,800-mile mission across the desert in China in order to teach him survival skills. Yide spent 11 days travelling across the deadly Lop desert, where temperatures regularly drop below freezing and can reach 50C (122F), with his father and two other young boys. Scroll down for video . He Liesheng (left) has completed an 11-day expedition across China's lop desert - where temperatures regularly drop below freezing and top 50C (112F) - alongside his six-year-old son He Yide . Yide was forced to walk 62 miles on foot by his father during their mission into the desert. They travelled the rest of the way in a motorcade, as much of the terrain is impassable . Yide and his father were joined by two other boys, aged 11 and 13, who were recruited online. During the trip they learned survival skills such as how to find food and water, and how to navigate using the stars . The experience included strength training, lessons in how to find water and how to catch food, and how to navigate by reading the stars at night. One evening Liesheng even turfed the boys out of their sleeping bags and made them sleep in pits he dug in the ground. The expedition travelled most of the way in a motorcade, as the salt flats are covered in crystals  which can cut people as they walk, but Yide was still made to complete a 62-mile trek on foot. Liesheng and his son were accompanied on their travels by 11-year-old Yin Kejie and  Lai Wenliag, 13, who were both recruited online. The group traversed the Lop desert in five cars equipped with GPS equipment and medical supplies, but were otherwise left to fend for themselves. They had to telephone for help once along the way after leaving the cars with no extra clothing, food or water, when the temperature suddenly dropped below freezing, leaving them stranded. At one point during the trip, Liesheng threw the three boys out of their sleeping bags in made them sleep in pits he had dug in the ground instead . Liesheng began training Yide at just ten days old after the boy was born prematurely, leading doctors to warn him that his son could suffer physical defects . Many professional explorers have died trying to cross the Lop desert, including Peng Jiamu. The group visited a shrine to him as part of their trip, and laid a bottle of water in remembrance (pictured) Many professional explorers have died attempting to cross the desert, including Peng Jiamu, a Chinese biochemist, who died there in 1980. During their mission, Liesheng and his three companions stopped at a shrine to Jiamu, leaving behind bottles of water as a sign of remembrance. Liesheng became notorious in 2012 after Yide was pictured running outside in New York during snow in nothing but his underpants . Liesheng, a businessman based in Nanjing, capital of eastern China's Jiangsu Province, became determined to toughen his son up after the boy was born prematurely, leading doctors to warn that he might suffer physical defects. After Yide spent two months in hospital, Liesheng devised a tough training programme for him, including swimming lessons which began just 10 days after Yide came out of his incubator. Dubbing himself the 'Eagle Father', Liesheng said: 'When the baby eagle is old enough, the mother eagle would harshly push its baby down the cliff. 'When the baby eagle is plummeting, a survival instinct would make it flap its wings vigorously. Through this, the baby eagle acquires its basic survival skill - flying. 'I don't agree with the education of most of the parents. They are too protective and caring, which makes their kid lazy and with no pioneering spirit.' Other challenges for Yide included eight hours of lessons a day from the age of six months, mountain climbing from two years old, and five miles of jogging every day. Yide was also registered for classes including kung fu and kickboxing, while he took up skateboarding and bike riding of his own accord. He attends the Experimental Primary School of Nanjing University of Science and Technology and his father says he always asks to take his son out of school before completing the challenges. Liesheng said he made the education plan based on 7 years of teaching experience and more than 10 years' experience running a company. His wife was forced to quit her job in order to help turn the plan into a reality. Liesheng devised an 'eagle education' plan for his son, including swimming lessons from just 10 days outside the incubator, lessons from the age of six months, and mountain climbing from two years old . Liesheng dubbed himself the 'Eagle Father', saying mother eagles will push their chicks out of the nest in order to teach them to fly - a philosophy he adopted with his own son . Yide has never needed to visit hospital again after spending two months in an incubator after being born after just seven moths of pregnancy, according to his father . Liesheng said: 'Yide is now in very good health. Besides the two months in hospital when he was born, he never visited a hospital again.' The pair rose to public attention in 2012 after Yide was pictured running through the snow in New York in just his underwear, and doing press ups outside. Last year Yide became the youngest person to fly solo in a plane, completing a 35-minute trip over Beijing, according to his father. Liesheng apparently paid 30,000 yuan (£3,100) for private flying lessons for his son. The boy was accompanied by a professional pilot for safety reasons, but the man did not touch the controls. The name 'Eagle Father' is taken from Amy Chua's book Battle Hymn Of The Tiger Mother, in which she argued that Chinese mothers were superior to American mothers because they pushed their children harder.","He Yide born premature and doctors warned he could suffer defects .

"Police have released names and pictures of the two people who fled the scene of a fatal stabbing on Sunday night. Luke Berg, 28 and Alicia Schiller, 25, are wanted for questioning over the death of Tyrelle Evertsen-Mostert, 31, who died following an argument with two lodgers at her home in Norlane, north of Geelong. Officers have warned that the duo could be armed and are advising anyone who sees them to avoid approaching them and instead call police. Scroll down for video . Luke Berg (left), 28, and Alicia Schiller (right), 25, are wanted by police for questioning over the death of Tyrelle Evertsen-Mostert . Ms Evertsen-Mostert, 31, was stabbed to death following an argument with two lodgers at her home in Norlane, north of Geelong, on Sunday night . 'I am appealing for Luke and Alicia to come forward to us or make contact with us so we can speak to them about what occurred on Sunday evening,' homicide squad detective inspector Mick Hughes said. Mr Hughes said that the stabbing occurred following an argument between a number of people in the Geelong home. 'They went into the bedroom, there was a discussion in the bedroom, that escalated and the female we believe has been stabbed,' he told the ABC. Police would not give a description or detail Luke and Alicia's involvement in the investigation, but said the group was known to each other. The 31-year-old's mother said she called her moments after she had been stabbed on Sunday . 'They were all in the house just prior to the assault,' Det Insp Hughes said. 'They went into the bedroom and there was a discussion in the bedroom that escalated.' Police do not know what the argument was about. The victim, a mother-of three who was stabbed while her four-year-old son was in the other room, made a final phone call to her mum as she lay dying inside her home. Victorian homicide squad detectives are searching for a man and woman in their 20s who left the home in Norlane shortly after the incident . 'Tyrelle got on the phone and said 'mum I can't do this any more.'  Johanna said. 'I got there and the ambulance crew were working on her, but I could see she was already gone. 'She had a big heart. Sometimes I would even say to her she has a halfway house because anyone that wanted to stay, she'd let them stay.' Tributes have flown for the mother over social media, where friends have describe her as ' a beautiful woman with the biggest heart'. Ms Evertsen-Mostert's partner, Jason, was also injured in the attack and was taken to hospital with minor injuries . 'She was outgoing caring and full of love, she was well known for helping anyone who needed anything and always put a roof over people's heads even if she didn't know them. She gave everything to everyone and never asked in return.' Two other men who were at the house at the time were questioned by police, but have been cleared as suspects. Ms Evertsen-Mostert's partner, Jason, was also injured in the attack and was taken to hospital with minor injuries.","Tyrelle Evertsen-Mostert was stabbed following an argument with two lodgers at Norlane, north of Geelong, on Sunday .

"Under pressure: NHS chief executive Simon Stevens, pictured, warned this week that the health service needs another £8 billion a year by 2020 to keep afloat . The cash-strapped NHS is paying GPs £100,000 a year for working only weekends, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Doctors are earning ‘jaw-dropping’ pay packets for shifts that can involve simply answering the phone at the NHS’s non-emergency 111 helpline for a couple of days a week. Recruitment agencies are offering the cushy jobs to doctors to work in some of the most attractive parts of Britain, including Cornwall, Herefordshire and rural Kent. Our revelations come days after new NHS chief executive Simon Stevens warned the health service needs another £8 billion a year by 2020 to keep afloat – even if it does everything possible to cut its costs. But we have discovered the sums paid to GP locums are, in the words of a leading MP, ‘spiralling out of control’. Recruitment agencies say GPs can ‘pick and choose’ where and when to work. ‘Doctors aren’t shy of asking for higher rates,’ said one. Last week, London’s CES Locums placed an advertisement in the doctors’ magazine Pulse, promising a six-figure salary for working weekends. It read: ‘Locum Opportunities – Earn from £100k pa from weekend work only and over £200k for full-time work.’ Other firms claim locum GPs can pull in £100,000 for ‘out-of-hours’ work. To test the claim we asked a practising GP to call CES Locums. She was told: ‘You can probably add up to about £3,000 a weekend. To earn the most I would advise Cornwall, because I can give you the maximum number of hours… That’s where the money is.’ She should expect to work three or four hours on Friday evening, then all-day shifts on Saturday and Sunday, he said. The recruitment consultant claimed the firm had ‘quite a few doctors’ working in this way. ‘I’ve a doctor who works every weekend. That’s the only job that she does. She probably clears between £7,000 and £8,000 a month.’ Scroll down for video . The Cornish weekend work was ‘more like a working holiday, especially in summer’, he said: ‘If you’ve got a family it’s quite nice, it’s quite relaxed.’ CES Locums offered the GP weekend work at similar rates in Kent and Hertfordshire. Other firms confirmed it was possible for locums to earn £100,000 for weekend work. Gareth Filkins, of RMR Recruitment, said the market was ‘frankly crazy at the moment. There’s no lack of work; there’s just a lack of GPs,’ he said. What had been a ‘niche’ business had ‘grown phenomenally’ since 2004, he said. Then, Labour let GPs dump personal responsibility for out-of-hours care in return for a six per cent pay cut. Firms like Serco, Care UK and IC24 filled the gap. Roger Goss, of campaign group Patient Concern, said: ‘It puts them in the pop star category.’ Cushy job: London’s CES Locums placed an advertisement in the doctors’ magazine Pulse, promising a six-figure salary for working weekends. Other firms claim locum GPs can pull in £100,000 for ‘out-of-hours’ work . He blamed the Labour government, saying, ‘They allowed doctors to outsource, but they never thought about how much it would cost.’ Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘There must be immense scope to plan better, and cut costs.’ Dia Chakravarty, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be astonished at the jaw-dropping salaries.’ The lucrative fees a GP can earn as a stand-in mean that many clinics struggle to fill permanent positions. One in four practices has a vacancy for a GP and many patients wait weeks to see their regular doctor. David Cameron has promised to make it easier to see GPs. Some are paid £100 an hour for evening and weekend work under the Prime Minister’s ‘Challenge Fund’, a £50 million pot to improve seven-day access. The move – designed to relieve busy A&Es – could win votes, but will stretch demand further. GPs are keen to stress they pay insurance of £10,000 a year out of their earnings. And Dr Peter Swinyard, a Wiltshire GP and chairman of the Family Doctor Association, said: ‘I can’t imagine any solicitor would work for £80 an hour on a Saturday or Sunday.’ But he said locum fees were crippling surgeries – and making it harder to convince younger GPs to work for a practice full-time. Dr Swinyard, who earns £80,000 before tax, said GP partners like him were paid less than many locums, despite having to deal with NHS paperwork and carry the financial risk of running a surgery. ‘We’ve a system where there’s little incentive to work as a GP partner, and more incentive to work all around the place,’ he said. ‘But if someone’s got a serious illness, they need to see the same doctor each time.’ Dr Sarah Wollaston, a GP and Conservative chair of the Health Select Committee, said: ‘The underlying problem here is the workforce shortfall in general practice, so it’s possible for people to work for agencies for these kind of rates.’ Vacancies: The lucrative fees a GP can earn as a stand-in mean that many clinics struggle to fill permanent positions. Many patients across the UK wait weeks to see their regular doctor. Above, file image . Fellow select committee member Valerie Vaz, Labour MP for Walsall South, said: ‘I’m astounded at these figures. There are many permanent GPs who are working for much less.’ Andrew Gwynne MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Minister, said: ‘The bill for locums is spiralling out of control. Nurses and midwives, who’ve had pay frozen or cut, will find these figures galling. There are hundreds fewer family doctors: it’s no wonder people are struggling to get appointments.’ The Department of Health says the number of locums has dropped nine per cent since 2010, while there are 6,700 more doctors. A spokesman said it was up to local GPs to best arrange out-of-hours services and pointed to a £100 million scheme to pilot new ideas on extending access hours. The average salary for a GP who is a partner in a surgery is £102,000, according to the latest official statistics. There are no figures for those working solely as locums.","Shifts can simply involve answering phone at NHS non-emergency helpline .

"A 41-year-old woman who began dieting at the age of 10 has spoken out to praise the Weight Watchers healthy eating plan after it helped her to lose 150lbs in two years. Danyeil Durrant, a paralegal from Sebastian, Florida, struggled with her eating habits from an early age, but admits that it wasn't until a doctor warned her of the devastating impact her weight could have on her health that she realized she needed to take drastic action. '[Doctors told me] that I was going to have a heart attack within 10 years if I didn't change my ways,' the 41-year-old told CNN. Scroll down for video . 'I never felt like I was enough': Danyeil Durrant has managed to lose almost half her body weight during the last two years, going from 363lbs (L) to 213lbs (R) Fighting fit: Dani now visits the gym every single day and encourages her Facebook followers to do the same by posting a series of before (L) and after (R) images on the page . 'I spent 30 years of my life thinking that if I could just lose this weight, then my life could begin, then I'd make the cheerleading squad, then I could take that vacation, then I would meet the man of my dreams, etc. 'I never felt like I was enough.' In August 2012, after years of yo-yo dieting, Dani's weight had ballooned to 363lbs and it was then that she discovered Weight Watchers - after hearing what success her sister had found while following the company's unique points system. For the first time in three decades, Dani discovered how to create a healthy and balanced meal and she admits that she was surprised to discover that following such an effective weight-loss plan didn't mean giving up all of her favorite foods for good. 'In the past, if I ate what I considered non-diet food, I thought I had ruined everything, and I would quit whatever diet I was on,' she said. Never give up: The 41-year-old admits she is determined to reach her final goal weight of '150lbs of muscle' Then and now: Dani first began dieting at the age of 10 but only began to see a real change when she discovered Weight Watchers in 2012 . On a roll: Dani, pictured with her boyfriend, says she now feels 'unstoppable' 'Now I know that I can still occasionally splurge, attend celebrations, go to restaurants… because I have learned how to choose something healthy anywhere I go.' In the past two years, Dani has managed to drop almost half of her body weight and is now a healthy size 12. But her weight loss journey hasn't stopped and she is currently working towards losing a further 73lbs in order to reach her final goal weight, '150lbs of muscle'. In addition to her healthy eating plan, the fitness fan now trains at her local gym every single day, working the training regime around her day-to-day life. 'Even if I'm out of town I make sure to go before I leave or I rush back to get in my workout before midnight,' she says. 'I feel unstoppable.' 'I thought I had ruined everything': Weight Watchers' healthy eating program made Dani realize that she didn't need to abandon all unhealthy food forever . Healthy and happy: Although she is still continuing with her healthy eating and fitness plans, Dani admits she is much happier with every aspect of her life . In the hopes of inspiring other women to achieve the same success that she has - and to ensure she remains motivated - Dani created a Facebook page called Get Down with Dani which she uses to document her ongoing diet and fitness routine. The page has since amassed more than 20,000 followers, many of whom have hailed Dani has an 'inspiration' thanks to her healthy outlook on weight loss. 'What makes you beautiful is not that you have lost weight,' Heather Reisig wrote. 'What makes you beautiful is that you want to help others do something that takes a lot of dedication and time.' Pam Hall Smith added: 'Searching for inspiration...I believe I truly have found it! Thanks for sharing your story...'

"Moscow has today denied that its planes approached a Canadian warship on a NATO mission in an incident that officials in Ottawa denounced as 'unnecessarily provocative'. The Russian defence ministry said a Sukhoi Su-24 attack aircraft and an Antonov An-26 transport plane were carrying out 'planned flights over neutral waters of the Black Sea near the Russian Federation's state border'. 'The flight path of the planes of the Russian airforce ran through an area where the HMCS Toronto was located, without approaching the foreign military vessel,' Major General Konashenkov told Russian news agencies. Aerial threat: ASukhoi Su-24 attack aircraft of the type alleged to have intimated the Canadian warship . He insisted that the Russian jets were behaving 'strictly in line with international rules'. Canadian Defence Minister Rob Nicholson said on Monday that a Russian military plane had made the 'unnecessarily provocative move' of circling over the Canadian frigate HMCS Toronto. The incident took place in the Black Sea where NATO and Ukraine are currently holding naval exercises. Mr Nicholson said that the Russian aircraft 'did not in any way pose a threat to the Canadian ship'. But he added that 'their actions were unnecessarily provocative and risk escalating tensions even further' in the region. MIssion: The Canadian frigate HMCS Toronto left port in July to join the NATO exercise in the Black Sea . A Russian Air Force Antonov An-26 transport plane was also among the group said to have circled over the ship . The HMCS Toronto left Canada's Atlantic coast at the end of July with 250 sailors and Sea King helicopters on board to join the NATO mission. Russia and the West are locked in a dramatic standoff over a crisis in Ukraine where Kremlin-backed separatists are battling against pro-Western Kiev authorities. Ukraine said on Monday it had launched three-day naval exercises with US-led NATO forces in the Black Sea aimed at guaranteeing its security. Mr Nicholson said Canada and its allies are taking part in reassurance measures as a 'direct result of the Putin regime's military aggression and invasion of Ukraine'.","Moscow said planes were carrying out 'planned flights over neutral waters'

"There was a split second in the tunnel of Brazil’s Estadio da Cidadania on Sunday night that summed up perfectly the 90 minutes that had gone before. Six days out from their date with England in Manaus, Italy had overcome some defensive blips to destroy Brazilian club side Fluminense 5-3 and the Italian press pack wanted one man — Ciro Immobile. Little known outside Italy, Immobile has evoked memories of countryman Toto Schillaci, who burst on to the world stage at Italia 90 and ended up with the Golden Boot. Potential: Italy striker Ciro Immobile could emulate Toto Schillaci's impact . Golden Boot: Schillaci was top scorer at Italia '90 . New kid on the block: Mario Balotelli was totally outshone by Immobile as Italy beat Fluminese . Friendly and engaging and still . buzzing after a hat-trick and two assists in his third appearance for . Italy, Immobile held court and politely answered every question. About . three minutes in, Mario Balotelli came skulking down the same gangway, . ignoring everyone. As he walked behind the oblivious Immobile, the . Azzurri’s No 1 striker moved in to flick the rookie’s ear — and missed. It was that kind of night, for them both. While . Immobile was an all-action nuisance to Fluminense’s backline for his . stunning 60-minute cameo, Balotelli’s half-hour was highlighted by him . crumpling under a challenge and seeming to decide not to put too much . more into the game. Limited: Cesare Prandelli's Italy squad are short on striking talent but Immobile could offer another option . To be . fair, the contest was decided by that point, but it was emphatically . decided by Immobile — and manager Cesare Prandelli must now consider him . for Saturday’s Group D opener against England. Immobile . said: ‘I think I might have given him a dilemma. But it is better for . him to have a problem like this. If he finds it appropriate that I play, . I’ll be there to help for sure.’ Prandelli . added: ‘Clearly we have some healthy competition up front. Everyone has . a chance. Whoever doesn’t play will have to accept the choices. Potentially there could be a lot of stars in this squad.’ Immobile’s . surname means the same in Italian as it does in English so he has long . since got used to the jibes. But when your movement is as devastating as . his, it is easier to laugh off the immobility jokes. Heading to the top: Immobile scored three and set up two in the win against Brazilian side Fluminese . Make yourself at home: Immobile's stylish showing came in only his third game for the Azzurri . The . 24-year-old was top scorer in Serie A last season with 22 goals for . Torino, enough to persuade Jurgen Klopp to shell out almost £16million . for his services last week, bringing him to Borussia Dortmund before . others see him on the world stage. Labelled . a penalty-box striker in his homeland, that seems a touch unfair and . slightly inaccurate. Things may end in the area — his finishing, . particularly for the third goal, was beyond clinical on Sunday — but . they begin much further up the pitch. Three . of Italy’s five goals came as a result of Immobile springing the . offside trap. Twice, when clear through, he unselfishly laid off for . Arsenal target Lorenzo Insigne to grab a brace. That . too is a mark of the 6ft 1in former Juventus, Pescara and Genoa . striker. Immobile is all about the collective, his tireless displays . helping Torino to pip Balotelli’s Milan to the final European spot on . goal difference. The selfless attitude could not be more in contrast to . Italy’s enfant terrible. Prandelli . said of Balotelli last month: ‘Not only does Mario have to realise that . even in a few  minutes you can make your mark.

Hot shots: Midfielders Daniele de Rossi and Andrea Pirlo are the top goalscorers in Italy's squad . Goals . are a pressing issue for the manager. While Italy scored 19 in . qualifying, five of them from former Manchester City man Balotelli, they . have got just one in three internationals in 2014, that coming in the . pitiful 1-1 draw with Luxembourg last week. The two most prolific scorers in the squad are midfielders Andrea Pirlo and Daniele De Rossi.

"He famously renounced his hereditary title so he could remain an MP. But 50 years after Tony Benn relinquished the Viscountcy of Stansgate, his son has reclaimed the title so he can take a seat in the Lords. The maverick socialist’s eldest son, Stephen, will become the latest of Labour’s ‘red princes’ to enter Parliament if he successfully contests a hereditary by-election next month. Stephen Benn (right) has applied to reclaim the Viscountcy of Stansgate which his father Tony (left) gave up in the 1960s to continue his career as an MP. They are pictured with Stephen's daughter Emily in 2007. Tony Benn died in March this year . The 63-year-old former Labour party official, whose younger brother Hilary is shadow communities secretary in the Commons, is thought to be keen to take up a role on the opposition benches in the Upper House. Tony Benn, who died aged 88 in March, fought to change the law so he could become the first peer to renounce his title. After inheriting the title Viscount Stansgate on the death of his father in 1960, Mr Benn, who was already an MP, was disbarred from the House of Commons. He successfully campaigned for the law to be amended, allowing him to renounce his title and retake his Bristol South East seat in 1963. At the time, he said: 'I am not a reluctant peer but a persistent commoner.' His son Stephen, a lobbyist for the Society of Biology, who will now be known as the 3rd Viscount Stansgate, was today accepted on the Register of Hereditary Peers. The majority of the hereditary peers are not allowed to sit in the Lords owing to the 1999 Act that capped their numbers. But when one of the 90 to still retain a seat dies, the other peers of the deceased’s political party then vote for their new candidate in a by-election. There are currently two vacancies following the death of Viscount Allenby of Megiddo and the retirement of Lord Cobbold last month. Both peers were crossbenchers, so if Lord Benn stands in the by-election to replace them next month, he will be elected onto the crossbenches, but will then be able to move to Labour’s opposition bench. Last month it emerged that not a single penny of Tony Benn’s £5m estate went to the Labour Party, the poor, or any radical causes he supported in his will. Instead, Mr Benn, who throughout his political career was contemptuous of elitism and the privilege of inherited wealth, left almost his entire fortune to his four children. His eight-bedroom ancestral home, understood to be worth millions, had been left in a trust for his family, which is thought to have avoided them having to pay inheritance tax on it. Family affair: A Benn family portrait taken in April 1961, as Tony battled to keep his seat in the Commons after being disqualified for holding a peerage. He was pictured at his London home with his wife, Caroline, and four children (left-right): Hilary, 7, Joshua, 2, Melissa, 4, and Stephen, 9, who has now sought to reclaim the hereditary title . While his brother Stephen Benn is currently seeking a route into the Lords, Hilary Benn has already carved out a long political career. Now shadow communities secretary, he served in the Blair and Brown governments after being elected MP for Leeds Central in 1999 – a position he has held for 15 years. Since being elected, he has also served as Secretary of State for International Development (from 2003 to 2007) and as the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (from 2007 to 2010). However, Hilary is not the only Benn to have been a successful MP – his father Tony was an MP for nearly 50 years, serving in the Harold Wilson and James Callaghan Cabinets in the 1960s and 1970s. Tony stood for Bristol South East between 1950 and 2001 but was forced to stand down when he inherited a hereditary peerage on his father William Wedgwood Benn’s death. Air Commodore William was elected as a Liberal and Labour MP several times between 1906 and 1942 and was also Secretary of State for India (from 1929 to 1931) and Secretary of State for Air (from 1945 and 194). In 1942, he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Stansgate, of Stansgate in Essex. At the time, the wartime coalition government was short of working Labour peers in the upper house. Upon his death in November 1960, his son Tony inherited the peerage, becoming the 2nd Viscount Stansgate. The peerage prevented him from continuing as MP for Bristol South East but he fought to remain in the House of Commons before campaigning for the ability to renounce the title. Tony was the first peer to make use of the Act, which was given Royal Assent in July 1963. As well as William, Tony and Hilary, the Benns have long been Members of Parliament. Stephen and Hilary’s great-grandfather, Sir John Benn, was a Liberal MP from 1892-95 and 1904-10 and, another great-grandfather, Daniel Holmes, was a National Liberal MP from 1911-18. Recently, Stephen’s 25-year-old daughter Emily became a Labour councillor in Croydon. She was elected to the West Thornton ward of Croydon Borough Council and is standing to become MP in Croydon South in 2015. Born Anthony Wedgwood-Benn, Tony Benn became Britain's youngest MP when he was elected in 1950 aged 25. His father William Wedgwood Benn had been raised to become the 1st Viscount of Stansgate under Churchill and become Secretary of State for Air under Clement Attlee. When his older brother was killed on active service in World War II, Tony Benn became the heir to the viscountcy. Lord Benn’s daughter Emily, 25, has already earned herself a mocking royal title – Red Princess – as she threatens to become the fifth generation of the family to enter Parliament. She is standing for Labour in Croydon South next year. Like her fellow youthful Labour parliamentary hopefuls the ‘Red Princes’ Stephen Kinnock, son of Neil, and Will Straw, son of former Home Secretary Jack, she is believed by some to have been able to launch her political career thanks to her ancestry, rather than her ability. Already a Croydon councillor, and holding the record of being the youngest every parliamentary candidate when she was just 17, she denies any nepotism, but has boasted: ‘I was born during the Labour Party conference in 1989. My birth was announced to the floor.' William Hunt, Windsor Herald at the College of Arms, which maintains official registers of coats of arms and pedigrees, said Lord Benn had been entered onto the Register of Hereditary Peers after proving his right to succession. He said: ‘Tony Benn’s elder brother was killed in the war and Tony Benn did not want to accept the peerage because he wanted to continue to sit in the House of Commons. ‘Until the hereditary peers as a body were abolished you could not sit in the House of Commons if you had a title. ‘So Tony Benn brought in this bill to renounce peerages but it was framed such that it was renounced by whoever but not for their successors. ‘His younger son Hilary is an MP but the elder son is not, he presumably wishes to go to the Lords to participate in politics as an hereditary peer if he is elected.’ Lord Benn did not respond to requests to comment.","Socialist Tony Benn relinquished the Viscountcy of Stansgate in 1963 .

"Man hours: Andy Wilkinson spent more than 10,000 hours over 18 years hand sewing his version of the Bayeux Tapestry . A determined history buff spent more than 10,000 hours over 18 years hand sewing a tapestry longer than a tennis court. Andy Wilkinson, 51, had no sewing or drawing experience when he started the 40ft long version of the Bayeux Tapestry, a 1,000-year-old embroidery of events leading up to the Norman conquest of England. A London Underground engineer from Chatham, Kent, he intended to make the tapestry to decorate the inside of a Norman-style tent but it quickly outgrew the space when he kept on sewing until he finished the Battle of Hastings section of the historical tapestry. Mr Wilkinson has now been given the chance to display his 2:1 scale version at Battle Abbey in East Sussex, the site of the 1066 battle. A member of a historical re-enactment group, he said: ‘I work a lot of night shifts and used to come home and find myself with not a lot to do for a few hours. ‘I had seen a copied section of the tapestry at a medieval fair and thought that if they can do that so can I. ‘Having never done a tapestry before, I came home and found a picture and just started to draw and sew. I had no formal training in sewing or drawing. 'I just drew the outlines of figures and animals like the horses onto a piece of calico material and then just stitched it. ‘I have a Norman-style tent and when the tapestry was under 5ft I used it in that as a screen but that was a long time ago.’ The original Bayeux Tapestry is 230ft . long, is in eight separate pieces of linen and is exhibited in the Normandy town of Bayeux. The Battle of Hastings section is 80ft long. His sewing sessions lasted from one to . eight hours and he believes he has spent an average of two hours a day . for 14 years on the project. He also took a four year break from the . project. History buff: A member of a historical re-enactment group, Mr Wilkinson originally intended the scroll to decorate the inside of a tent until it got too big when he decided to keep sewing, adding the Battle of Hastings . Historical work: The original Bayeux Tapestry is 230ft long and is made up of eight separate pieces of linen exhibited in the Normandy town of Bayeux . The history buff used about 30 . different shades of four-ply wool and keeps the tapestry wound up like a . scroll on two wooden batons. On average, there are about 150 stitches per square inch on his tapestry. Mr Wilkinson said: ‘I haven't been able to get it insured. I have no idea what it might be worth but given the man hours I have put in, that alone works out to about £125,000. ‘Now I've conquered this one I am not going to do another one.’ 'Just started to sew': Working night shifts as a London Underground engineer, Mr Wilkinson needed a hobby when he got home from work and despite having no experience sewing or drawing, he started creating his masterpiece .

"A convicted cop killer could be released from jail after 19 years because of 'deeply flawed forensic evidence' leading to a substantial miscarriage of justice at his trial, an inquiry has found. David Eastman was convicted in 1995 for the murder of federal police assistant commissioner Colin Winchester, who was shot twice at close range as he moved to get out of his Ford car on his neighbour’s driveway in Canberra, in 1989. The man in charge of the six-month inquiry, former Northern Territory chief justice Brian Martin, says Mr Eastman did not receive a fair trial and was denied a fair chance of acquittal. Scroll down for video . David Eastman was convicted for murdering federal police assistant commissioner Colin Winchester in 1995 . A retrial, almost two decades after Mr Eastman was jailed, is no longer possible because so many of the original witnesses have died since the crime was committed. And so, in an extraordinary twist, it has been recommended that Mr Eastman be freed. 'The verdict was reached in circumstances where significant material was not disclosed by the prosecution, critical evidence was seriously flawed, evidence of a threat to kill was not properly tested,' Justice Martin says in a 477-page report released on Friday. The Australian Federal Police tried to stop the report being released on Friday but failed. Overturned: His conviction was quashed because there was a substantial miscarriage of justice at his trial . Mr Winchester (left) was shot dead in the driveway of his Canberra home in January 1989 and David Eastman's lawyer John Masters (right) leaves the Supreme Court in Canberra, Friday, May 30 . 'For these reasons I recommend that the conviction of the applicant on November 3, 1995, for the murder of the deceased be quashed,' Justice Martin concluded. Despite finding many problems with the trial, Justice Martin believes Mr Eastman, an angry sacked public servant, committed the crime. 'I am fairly certain that the applicant is guilty of the murder of the deceased, but a nagging doubt remains,' he says. However, the substantial miscarriage of justice should not be allowed to stand uncorrected, he says. Mr Winchester was shot dead on a summer's evening by his Canberra home in January 1989, a hit initially blamed on Italian organised crime figures he had been investigating. But it was a former treasury official, David Eastman, who had threatened Mr Winchester weeks before the murder, who faced trial. Mr Winchester was shot dead next to his white Ford in the driveway . Detectives inspecting the crime scene in Canberra. Justice Martin has found Mr Barnes' gunshot evidence lacked proper scientific basis . Crucial evidence related to tiny particles of gunshot residue from the boot of Mr Eastman's car . He was convicted in 1995 and sentenced to life imprisonment. The trial was marked by constant disruptions as Mr Eastman, a colourful and erratic character, sacked and rehired lawyers, sought adjournments and abused the judge and his own legal team. The prosecution case was circumstantial. Crucial evidence related to tiny particles of gunshot residue from the boot of Mr Eastman's car, which Victoria Police forensic scientist Robert Barnes testified was consistent with those found at the murder scene. Justice Martin found Mr Barnes' gunshot evidence lacked proper scientific basis. The funeral: Mr Winchester is the highest ranking police officer ever to be shot in Australia . 'Unknown to the defence, Mr Barnes, who gave critical evidence connecting the applicant's car to the scene of the murder, was far from independent and objective. He regarded himself as a police witness and was biased accordingly,' his report says. Mr Eastman's guilt was determined on the basis of deeply flawed forensic evidence, Justice Martin said. It's now up to the ACT Supreme Court to decide whether or not to order Mr Eastman's freedom, 19 years after he was locked up. Mr Winchester remains the highest ranking police officer ever to be shot in Australia.

"John Terry wants a new era of success at Chelsea . Chelsea are back where the story began, although 10 years ago Wembley was still a hard-hat area and Tottenham and an 11-year-old Harry Kane were only starting to get to know each other. John Terry and Didier Drogba will never underestimate the significance of that League Cup win in Cardiff in 2005, when Mateja Kezman scrambled the winner and Jose Mourinho told Liverpool’s fans to shush. ‘It set us on our way,’ said Terry, as he recalls his first trophy as captain, the first with Mourinho as manager and Roman Abramovich as owner. ‘It gave us all a taste of what we wanted and we wanted more. It brought us closer together.’ Two months later, Chelsea clinched their first league title for half a century and have barely stopped winning since. If they beat Tottenham in Sunday's Capital One Cup final, it will be a dozen major prizes in a decade. The 21-month wait since the last one already represents quite a drought in Abramovich terms. It would also be the launch pad for a second Mourinho era and a first Chelsea trophy for recent signings Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas, Juan Cuadrado, Filipe Luis, Thibaut Courtois and Diego Costa. Very few of Chelsea's current crop of players have won silverware at Stamford Bridge . Terry (3rd left) joins team-mates in a high spirited training session ahead of Sunday's Capital One Cup final . Eden Hazard (left) is trophy hunting after not playing in Chelsea's 2013 Europa League final win . Keepers Thibaut Courtois (left) and Petr Cech train ahead of the Wembley showdown with Tottenham . And Eden Hazard was at the club when they won the Europa League in 2013 but did not play in the final, which means the bulk of the team has yet to experience winning something together. ‘We have got to go out and win trophies to put us right up there,’ said Terry. ‘This could be the first one for a few of the new players. It has been a couple of years since we won anything and it is an important competition. It means a lot to this club. ‘People write this competition off but the manager takes it really seriously and made it clear from the outset when we were away to the smaller clubs that we were in it to win it. ‘You can see that by the teams we’ve put out all the way through and the next step is to go and win it. For me, it’s huge. We look back on that 2004-05 season and it had a huge impact on our confidence and momentum.’ Mateja Kezman celebrates scoring the winner against Liverpool in the 2005 Carling Cup final . Jose Mourinho famously gestured for Liverpool fans to be quiet (left) before going on to win the league (right) Mourinho, speaking at a press conference, is back in a Wembley final in his second stint at Stamford Bridge .

Ten years ago, Mourinho injected a winning mentality into a group of ambitious footballers hungry for success. ‘Like everyone, I felt something different,’ said Terry. ‘That was clear from day one, and it rippled through the whole club. He has brought that back this time.’ Drogba, like Mourinho, has returned and is preparing for Wembley as his 37th birthday looms, aware this trophy is equally as important as it was in his first season at the club. ‘That gave us a big boost,’ said the Ivorian. ‘To know we could win something together if we all focused and really wanted to achieve something special was a big step for us. And winning it again would be a big step for this generation of players.’ Terry has praised Mourinho for returning a winning mentality in every competition they are involved in . The Chelsea captain has challenged the club's current crop to continue their winning ways . Terry gets in a tangle with Raheem Sterling (left) during the Capital One Cup semi-final defeat of Liverpool . Chelsea have lost only once in seven domestic cup finals since Abramovich took control. The single defeat was against Spurs in this competition and at this venue in 2008. ‘It was a real disappointment,’ said Terry. ‘But you move on. We’ve won major trophies since. Sometimes it can have a positive impact because you don’t want to relive those bad memories.’ Of more concern for Mourinho’s team may be the 5-3 defeat by Tottenham two months ago. ‘Everyone is rattling on about that,’ Terry added. ‘But for me it was fairly comfortable for us at the Bridge when we won 3-0 (in December). ‘You get beat through the season. It’s not our only defeat. I don’t see it as a revenge thing. Didier Drogba agrees that winning on Sunday will provide incentive for the next generation of Chelsea stars . Didier Drogba scored in extra time in Chelsea's 2005 League Cup victory over Liverpool . Spurs danger man Harry Kane (centre) scores during Tottenham's 5-3 victory over Chelsea in January . ‘They are here to win it. They have come a long way through the competition and some tough games. We are here to win it and we have the squad to win it if we play well. But if we are not at our best and Tottenham are, we have seen they are very good.’ As for Kane, who scored two of the five at White Hart Lane on New Year’s Day, Terry added: ‘He is a very good player, his movement is fantastic and he’s in great goal-scoring form. There’s a lot of quality throughout their squad. ‘I’m surprised they’re not higher in the league. They probably deserve to be higher. They’re a really good squad and they’ll only get better. You can’t single Harry Kane out. There’s a long way to go. He’s got to do it year after year.

"For most people reaching a weight loss goal is an excuse for a celebratory night out, a spa day, or maybe even a new wardrobe. But for one brave mother-of-two losing nearly 8st meant she was finally able to take part in her dream charity event: a daring sky dive. Donna Shaw, 28, from Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, weighed more than 18st when she applied to a do a skydive to fundraise for the Alzheimer's Society after her grandmother died of the disease. Donna Shaw slimmed down from 18st (left) to a trim 10st 4lb (left) through a meal replacement diet . At her largest Donna was forced to sit on the sidelines  at a theme park as she was too large to fit on any of the rides . But after realising that her large frame meant she'd never be able to do the jump, Donna was spurred into losing 7st 12lb and slimming down to a size 10. Donna said: 'I was distraught when I found out that I was too big to do the jump - I knew I had to do something. 'Now I'm down to a healthy weight I feel so much better, and it's meant I've finally been able to raise money with my skydive.' Shop assistant Donna spent years struggling with her weight and used to gorge on takeaways for lunch and dinner. Donna's impressive weight loss was spurred on by her desire to complete a skydive for the Alzheimer's Society (pictured left holding her skydive certificate and right, in cream, heading to the plane) Donna struggled with comfort eating and despite trying many fad diets, saw her weight continue to creep up . Prior to finding out she was over the maximum weight for the skydive Donna had already been on the receiving end of an embarrassing confrontation with a ride operator at a theme park. While queueing for a ride on a day trip with friends, the attendant approached her to say that she would not be able to fit into the seats. Mortified, Donna had to stand aside and wait while her friends whizzed around on rollercoaster after rollercoaster. Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Sausages and cheesy chips or a McDonalds . Snacks: Creamy soup with six slices of bread with butter and two packets of crisps. Dinner: Takeaway: Indian or Pizza. Plus leftovers from daughter's meals. Evening snack: Cheese on toast . Breakfast: Weetabix or porridge . Lunch: Chicken salad and an apple or an orange with a yoghurt. Dinner: A Cambridge Weight Plan recipe for example: 400 calorie Toad in the hole, low fat Chile con carne, healthy lasagne. Snacks: Nothing . After applying for the skydive and realising there was no chance of her size 22 body fitting into the jumpsuits Donna began a radical diet in a bid to finally slim down. She chose the rather drastic method of using meal replacement soups and shakes from the Cambridge Weight Plan and managed to slim to a size 10, now weighing 10st 4lb. Succeeding in her weight loss meant she was finally able to do her charitysky dive, raising £450 for the Alzheimer's Society. Donna said: 'Every time my weight came to be a problem I pushed it aside and hoped it would disappear. Donna, pictured here before and after she embarked on the diet, says her weight loss has dramatically increased her energy levels . 'But after I looked into doing a skydive and realised I'd be too big I couldn't do it anymore. 'The Alzheimer's Society is a charity really close to my heart and it was awful when I found out there wasn't anything I could do. 'I was exhausted, with two children under two, and I was carrying loads of extra weight, . 'It was affecting my kids because I wasn't able to play with them as energetically as I used to. 'I was just too tired to be a good mum and even my husband Michael had noticed the difference in me. 'I was comfort eating after my grandmother's death, finishing the kids' leftovers, and before I knew it the weight has just piled on. 'I never knew when to stop and when was enough. 'I wanted to be a happy and so I took action and turned my diet, and my life, around. 'When I look back at pictures now it's crazy to see how big I was. 'Now it's such a great feeling knowing that my weight will never hold me back and I can wear whatever I want.'","Donna Shaw had struggled with weight for years, trying numerous fad diets .

"She might have been flanked by some of the biggest names in world cinema but as Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence stepped onto the red carpet outside London's Leicester Square Odeon, all eyes were on her. The reason? A stunning quilted white gown by what has become her go-to label for big events, be they premieres, fashion shows or the Oscars, French fashion house, Dior. Her polished red carpet look is a far cry from the early years of her career, which saw the gauche starlet suffer a series of wardrobe malfunctions and the odd fashion faux pas. Scroll down for video . Striking: All eyes were on Jennifer Lawrence as she arrived for the Hunger Games premiere in Leicester Square last night . Stand out style: Despite the presence of top actors at the premiere, Jennifer's stunning gown ensured she stood out . All smiles: The popular actress shared a joke with co-stars Liam Hemsworth and Natalie Dormer, and director Francis Lawrence . Who, after all, could forget the cheesecloth smocks and flowing skirts worn by the now 24-year-old for one of her early forays into fashion or, indeed, the overly revealing red Calvin Klein gown worn to the Oscars in 2011. She also managed a faux pas, quickly laughed off, when the plunging custom made Thierry Mugler gown she wore to the Bloomsbury Ballroom for the Hunger Games afterparty in London last night slipped down to reveal a flash of nipple to gleeful photographers. Nip slips notwithstanding, the last three years have seen Ms Lawrence blossom into a serious fashion player - and most of it is down to a series of well-chosen gowns by Dior, a label that also boasts Charlize Theron and Natalie Portman among its well-dressed legion of fans. Indeed, so devoted to Dior is Lawrence, she has become a regular sight on the front row at the label's shows and viewed the brand's most recent couture outing from a perch beside Dior CEO Sidney Toledano. 'Some of the greatest red carpet moments in the last couple of years have come from Jennifer Lawrence in Dior,' comments fashion expert and blogger, Simon Glazin. 'It's a very clever partnership on the brand's side - they knew they were tapping into an actress who would ""make it"". Different style: In Dior at the Cannes premiere of Jimmy P last year, at a 2012 premiere in New York and in Paris last November . Glamorous: The 24-year-old in Dior at the LA premiere of Silver Linings Playbook, at the 2013 BAFTAs and at a party in Cannes last year . Impressive: Lawrence in a show-stopping white tiered creation on the red carpet at the Golden Globe Awards in LA . 'Jennifer fits the Dior aesthetic perfectly,' he continues. 'She favours the strapless gowns, and always the bigger, voluminous shapes which in turn make her stand out every time.' Although Lawrence undoubtedly enjoys the perks of a close relationship with the fashion house - not least of which is a lucrative contract that has seen her become the face of Miss Dior - some would argue that it is Dior that has benefited most. After all, how many actresses would have the guts to take to the red carpet at the Toronto International Film Festival sporting a star-spangled tie-dye gown or would manage to pull off a sheer grey gown last seen fluttering down the catwalk during a premiere? But while Lawrence has won plaudits for her sleek look, things haven't always gone to plan, not least when the actress managed to rip her dark blue Dior gown during the SAG Awards in 2013 and tripped over the skirts of her voluminous frock during the Oscars of the same year. Nevertheless, as last night's glamorous quilted frock proved, Lawrence is now a style icon to be reckoned with and left co-stars Natalie Dormer, Elizabeth Banks and Julianne Moore looking dowdy in comparison as she appeared on the red carpet beside them. For that, there's only one label to thank - the ever glamorous House of Dior. Ooops!

"A drive to get more prisoners working in prison is branded a failure today after figures show there has barely been an increase in four years. The proportion of inmates working in public sector prisons has risen by just one per cent since the coalition was formed. And in 30 prisons the figure has fallen, leading Labour to condemn the Tories' get tough message on life in jail as 'just a load of hot air'. Ministers pledged to get more prisoners working, and not sitting idle in their cells. But there the proportion of inmates working has risen by 1 per cent since 2010 . Since 2010 the government has repeatedly vowed to turn prisons into 'places of hard work and industry'. But new figures released in Parliament show that in 2013-14 just 14 per cent of prisoners were working, up from 13 per cent in 2010-11. In 2010 the Ministry of Justice declared: 'Prisons will become places of hard work and industry, instead of enforced idleness. 'Hard work for offenders is at the heart of our plans to make punishments more rigorous. 'Prisons should not allow offenders to simply mark their time in a purposeless fashion. 'Rather, prisons should be seen as places where increasing numbers of prisoners are engaged in challenging and meaningful work.' Tory justice secretary Chris Grayling said in 20102: 'Saving money does not have to mean less work in prison and less training for offenders. 'We will continue to increase the hours prisoners spend in work and training.' Last year Nick Clegg declared: 'We are putting more and more offenders like him to work in prison every year: making sure he doesn't lie idle in his bed.' The proportion of prisoners working was lower after four years in 30 prisons, including Stafford, down from 38 per cent to 25 per cent, Guys Marsh prison, down from 30 per cent to 19 per cent, and Cardiff, down from 13 per cent to 9 per cent. Rochester, Bristol, Dartmoor, Liverpool, Leeds, Pentonville, Wormwood Scrubs and Ford prison also falls. Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said the promise to put more criminals to work was 'a load of hot air' Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: 'Yet again David Cameron fails to deliver and has broken a key promise. 'So much for the rehabilitation revolution David Cameron's government promised. 'Four years ago we were told that criminals would be put to work while in jail, but this data we have uncovered shows it was just a load of hot air. 'Not only are prisons not working, nor are prisoners. Instead of being put to work, or made to go on education and training courses, prisoners are still spending too much time behind bars idling away their days in their cells or prison landings.' He accused the government of closing down too many jails and laying off too many prison officers. 'Prisons have become overcrowded and violent as a result. None of this will help reduce re-offending, cut the number of innocent victims of crime or make our communities safer.' Many work in workshops producing items for the outside world, while some help with the upkeep of the prison, cooking food and cleaning. Justice Minister Andrew Selous said: 'Work in prisons is a key priority to ensure prisoners are engaged in real work whilst they are in custody. 'It also gives them the opportunity to learn skills and a work ethic which can increase their chances of finding employment on release, a key element to reducing reoffending.' He boasted that the number of prisoners working in public sector prisons increased from around 8,600 in 2010-11 to around 9,900 in 2013-14. However the prison population has risen over this time, meaning the proportion has barely changed. Mr Selous added: 'In that time, an additional four million hours have been worked in public prisons and in 2012-13 (the most recent figure available) a further 1,200 prisoners worked in commercial and industrial workshops in private sector prisons. 'None of these figures include the significant numbers of prisoners who work in keeping prisons clean, maintenance or cooking and serving meals.'","Ministers promised in 2010: 'Prisons will become places of hard work'
Deputy PM Nick Clegg said he wanted fewer inmates 'lying idle in his bed'
But since 2010 the proportion in work has risen from 13% to 14% .
In 30 public sector prisons the figures have fallen in four years ."

"Baldwin County Sheriff Huey Mack said Monday that the torso was dumped in water underneath a bridge . Police in Alabama have discovered a naked and headless torso a few miles from where a severed arm and hand were discovered on Sunday. Baldwin County Sheriff Huey Mack said Monday that the torso of a white male was dumped south of Magnolia Springs in water underneath Weeks Creek Bridge, three miles east of where the other body parts were discovered. He believes the remains belong to the same person and that they died in the last 72 hours. He told Al.com: 'This is a homicide. We have no reason to expect anything else at this time.' The only identifying feature so far is a tungsten ring found on the hand, the sheriff added. The body was found by a local enjoying a walk Sunday morning. Initially thinking it was an animal, they alerted authorities. The grim truth emerged later. Police are searching with a three-mile radius. The investigation will continue into the night because darkness is beneficial for certain types of forensic test. Police divers will also be used to scour the creek. 'There are chemical tests we'll conduct on the bridge tonight that are best done during darkness,' Mack said. The hand and arm were discovered by a resident living near the Magnolia River. Their dog pulled the arm from the river and the resident found the hand in a flower bed. Baldwin County District Attorney Hallie Dixon, described the case as 'horrific'. She added: 'Every murder is tragic. I've handled cases with newborn infants killed and I've seen a lot of bad stuff. This one is worse than most anything I've seen.'

"A Russian MP is making a bid to buy . the house where Adolf Hitler was born to destroy it - thus thwarting . plans by the town's mayor to renovate it into luxury apartments. Frantz Klintsevich, a lawmaker from . the ruling United Russia party, is aiming to collect £1.8m from . supporters to buy the house in the Austrian town of Braunau-am-Inn. He said: ‘I would buy this property . in the blink of an eye if I had that kind of money myself, but I do not. If I were to receive financial help, I would buy the house and destroy . it demonstratively.’ Plans: Developers want to turn the former Gasthaus zum Pommer  where Hitler was born (pictured) into apartments while Russian MP Frantz Klintsevich wants to buy the house to destroy it . Die-hard Communists, who still . remember the 27 million Soviet citizens who died in the 'Great Patriotic . War' against Hitler, are in favour of his plan. Vadim Solovyov, a member of the . Communist Party's State Duma fraction, said: ‘Everything that is . connected to fascism should be wiped off the face of the earth. ‘No one should even know that place ever existed. Austria's interior ministry has . rented the house since 1972 from the owner - a woman in her 60s who . refuses to be identified publicly - and has been careful to sublet only . to tenants with no history of admiring Hitler. As it was: Pictured in 1966, the building had been, variously, a girl's school and a public library, after World War II. Most recently it has been used as a centre for disabled people . 'Destroy it demonstratively': Russian MP Frantz Klintsevich said he would buy this property 'in the blink of an eye' if he had the money . Town mayor Hannes Waidbacher opposes a . Holocaust museum at the site and believes that turning over the former . Gasthaus zum Pommer to become family homes would be one way of . ‘de-stigmatising’ Braunau. If the plan - approved by the mayor . and proposed by a local building consortium - was accepted it would mean . the room where Hitler was born would become a bedroom in self-contained . apartments with state-of-the-art kitchens and bathrooms that would go . on the market for an estimated £400,000 each. Such a plan, say experts, would . require vigorous vetting of prospective buyers to ensure that a single . flat, indeed the entire property, did not fall into the hands of . neo-Nazis masking their real identities and purpose behind a shell . company or individuals. The little Austrian town separated . from Germany by a short bridge over the River Inn, is still visited by . hordes of far-right fanatics each year who come to pay homage at the . site where the future Fuehrer was born on April 20 1889. Up until a year ago it was the ironic . setting for a workshop for the mentally and physically handicapped; the . sort of people Hitler deemed as ‘useless eaters’ and the first to die . in the Third Reich's secret euthanasia campaign before WWII. Past: Mayor Hannes Waidbacher supports the plan for apartments that would go on the market for an estimated £400,000 each - saying it would help 'de-stigmatise' the town . But it has been empty for a year now . with the state picking up the bill for the lease and a debate raging . about what to do with the two-storey listed building. Mayor Waidbacher said: ‘Braunau has . done much to process its history over the years. It is not necessary to . build a Holocaust museum in the house as some have suggested. ‘Braunau as a town is already . stigmatised enough. Hitler spent only three years of his life here, and . they were certainly not the most formative years of his life. ‘Why should I or others take responsibility for him? I was born 21 years after the end of the war.’ The mayor said he was open to all suggestions, saying Braunau wants an ‘affordable solution for all. I can imagine all possibilities for . the house’. But he is against turning it into a 'House of Peace' or a . 'House of Responsibility' as Green Party members have advocated, . believing the town has done enough atoning over the years for its most . infamous son. Nationality: Hitler's birthplace is just a short distance from the German border. The Nazi leader returned to annex and occupy his homeland during the 'Anschluss' in 1938 . Marker: A memorial stone (pictured) was placed outside the building in 1989 as a reminder of its history. In English the inscription reads 'For Peace, Freedom and Democracy. Never Again Fascism. Millions of Dead Remind [us]' It was in a room on the first floor . of the three-storey, 2,000 square foot house at Salzburger Vorstadt 15 . that Hitler’s mother Klara gave birth to her infamous son. She and her husband Alois, a stern . local customs official, rented a suite of rooms above the pub and . continued to live in it until 1892 when they moved to Linz. Alois, a drunkard, often availed . himself often of the beer on sale in the saloon downstairs before . returning to the family home to abuse his timid wife, 24 years his . junior. The house is still owned by the . family after which the pub took its name. Owner Gelinde Pommer says she . wants to sell because she no longer wants to have the responsibility for . it. Nothing remains inside the building to indicate its link with Hitler, not even the bedroom where he was born. Pay homage: The little Austrian town of Braunau is separated from Germany by a short bridge over the River Inn, is still visited by hordes of far-right fanatics each year who come to pay homage at the site where the future Fuehrer was born on April 20 1889 . The only Nazi-era relic is on an iron . gate outside, the initials MB for Hitler’s party secretary Martin . Bormann, who had them placed there when he declared the house a national . monument after Hitler took over Austria in 1938. During the 12-year . lifespan of the Third Reich it was a must-see place of pilgrimage for . loyal Nazis. Bormann bought the house with Nazi funds and made it a cultural centre which displayed Nazi-approved art. It was given back to the Pommer . family in 1952 and served as the town’s public library until 1965 before . becoming, in turns, a school, a bank, a technical institute and finally . the home and workshop for disabled people. Those who want it turned into a site . of remembrance for Hitler's crimes are pressing central government in .

Kamm founded the Order of Saint Charbel at Cambewarra, near Nowra, on the NSW south coast in the 1980s and convinced his followers he was God's spokesman on earth. He manipulated a sect of old-line Catholic traditionalists to hand over their wives and daughters to populate his 'Royal House'. He is believed to have fathered more than 20 children and duped dozens of females, telling them they were among the 12 queens and 72 princesses chosen to repopulate the earth after judgment day. Kamm has been serving his time at Long Bay Correctional Centre in Malabar, a south-eastern suburb of Sydney. Once released from jail, the 64-year-old will be electronically monitored and must not contact children under the age of 16 without the approval of a corrections officer . Kamm was sentenced to three and a half years behind bars in 2005 after raping and assaulting a teenager in 1993, the Sydney Morning Herald previously reported. Two years later, other sex offences were added to his convictions and he was ordered to serve another seven and a half years with non-parole. Kamm was sentenced a maximum of 10 years for five counts of sexual intercourse with a minor by a person in authority, four counts of aggravated indecent assault against a minor and one count of aggravated indecent assault. He has been banned from frequenting the Shoalhaven districts or communicating with his victims for the next 11 months. In that time, the 64-year-old will be electronically monitored and must not contact children under the age of 16 without the approval of a corrections officer.

"A new biography of Louis van Gaal promises to ‘journey into the sinister recesses’ of the Manchester United manager’s character. Extracts published on Tuesday detail him treating his second wife Truus in a shocking and humiliating manner brought on by drink, a former player describing the moment Van Gaal shouted at him so fiercely the boss's dentures fell out and how the Dutchman had a string of serious car accidents brought on by the exhaustion of being a full-time PE teacher and a semi-professional footballer. It is the account of his relationship with Truus, who he married in 2008, which are most chilling. Scroll down for video . Louis van Gaal berated a player so fiercely his dentures came out, a new book on the Dutchman claims . Van Gaal  also treats his second wife Truus 'disgracefully' and humilates her in public, the book claims . ‘The way he treats Truus in company is ungentlemanly and sometimes downright disgraceful,’ claims author Hugo Borst in O, Louis: In Search Of Louis van Gaal, serialised in The Times. ‘In the company of friends and acquaintances, Louis has made comments that in nine out of 10 marriages would have been grounds for divorce. People who have lunched or dined with Louis say alcohol does not have a favourable effect on him. ‘Of course he also has sweet things to say about his wife. ""I have a lovely wife,"" he said on German TV, ""and the sex is good too"".' The author described an episode where Van Gaal and Truus were drinking wine. His wife said he always chooses good wine - he became knowledgeable about connoisseur after his managerial stint at Barcelona  - and the manager agreed. Van Gaal, pictured with Truus after Bayern won the Bundesliga in 2010, allegedly humiliates his wife in public due to drink . For AZ Alkmaar goalkeeper Khalid Sinouh claims he witnessed Van Gaal lose his dentures after shouting so fiercely at one of his team-mates in the changing room . But when she added that another vintage he chose was very good too,  Van Gaal reportedly snapped at her for not bothering to learn the name of the wine, in front of other people. Former AZ Alkmaar goalkeeper Khalid Sinouh – Van Gaal was manager of the Dutch side between 2005 and 2009 – reveals that his former boss refused to shake his players’ hand after a match unless they had won and also details an incident when Van Gaal thought his players were not training hard enough. The front cover of the new biography of the United manager, O, Louis: In Search of Louis van Gaal . ‘He had already b******ed me for it once but the second time he comes over and starts screaming at me something fierce and his dentures go flying.’ Durin the World Cup in South Africa, the manager was watching TV coverage of Nelson Mandela being driven around the stadium in Johannesburg while those around him watched in admiration. Van Gaal was reportedly not impressed, asking those present if they were under the 'spell' of the man who was instrumental in the overthrow of Apartheid, adding that he 'didn't get it'. The Van Gaal story also has examples of warmth and class, like the time he and Truus visit a famous referee (in Holland) who is dying. Medical staff extended visiting hours due to the patient enjoying Van Gaal’s company so much. Three days later the match official passed away. Borst also discovered that Van Gaal invested up to £150,000 with Dirk Scheringa, AZ’s flat broke chairman, in an astonishing display of generosity that some claimed naive in the extreme. Van Gaal’s gritty pursuit of success is exemplified by his 180-mile-a-day drive between his home and Rotterdam, where he was a semi-professional player for Sparta. And the three serious car smashes which resulted as a result of sheer exhaustion. The book also details how Van Gaal bought a bigger, better and more expensive villa in Portugal just 100 yards from the one belonging to his sworn enemy Ronald Koeman, now also a manager in England at Southampton. ‘Childish perhaps but, to start with at least, this was something Van Gaal liked to boast about,’ writes Borst. Southampton manager and fellow Dutchman Ronald Koeman (right) is Van Gaal's sworn enemy . Van Gaal was so driven for success that he suffered three serious car crashes due to exhaustion .

"From performing at the BRIT Awards to hosting Saturday Night Live for a record fifth time, singer Justin Timberlake has had a busy time of late. Now it seems that his workload is set to become a little lighter as the singer is set to sever ties with his William Rast clothing line, according to a report in the New York Post. Launched in 2005, the casual wear brand was set up with the help of Timberlake's best friend Trace Ayala who currently heads the label. Split: Justin Timberlake with best friend and business partner, Trace Ayala, at the UK launch in 2007 . Busy: Timberlake is scheduled to go on tour with rapper Jay-Z (right) later this year . Named after the pair's grandfathers, the label met with critical acclaim at the outset but sales are believed to have slumped in recent years. Timberlake's punishing work schedule, which includes an upcoming tour to promote new album 20/20 with rapper Jay-Z, and his newly wed status are also whittling down the amount of time the newly crowned 'King of Pop' has for his fashion brand. But according to the New York Post, the main reason for Timberlake's departure is the uphill struggle the brand faces in order to get back on track. 'Not a lot of retailers wanted it,' a source told the paper. 'Because the perception is [Justin’s] not involved, so why would anyone want to wear it?' Bringing funny back: Timberlake managed to spare some time to present Saturday Night Live for the fifth time .

"Daniel Day-Lewis said he was 'entirely amazed' to receive a knighthood in the Queen's Birthday Honours. The star is not short of honours - his 2012 Oscar win for Lincoln made him the first man to win three best actor statuettes. He said: 'I'm entirely amazed and utterly delighted in equal measure.' Scroll down for video . Accolade: Three-time Oscar winner Daniel Day Lewis is to receive a knighthood . Day-Lewis, the son of former poet laureate Cecil Day-Lewis and actress Jill Balcon, has been nominated five times for the best actor Oscar and has a reputation for taking his method acting very seriously. He is said to have lived in a tent on a deserted Texan oil field during the making of There Will Be Blood. To play Guildford Four member Gerry Conlon in the film In The Name Of The Father, he spent two days in a prison cell without food and water. While shooting The Ballad Of Jack And Rose, he chose to live apart from his wife Rebecca Miller and their two children - because she was the director and he was playing a conflicted family man. And he chose to stay in character as fearsome Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting even when the cameras stopped rolling on the Martin Scorsese epic Gangs Of New York. Star: The actor, who grew up in south London, won the Best Actor Oscar for his role in Lincoln, pictured . Award: He also won Best Actor for portraying Christy Brown in My Left Foot, pictured . 'He'd be sharpening his knives at lunchtime just like you'd expect Bill the Butcher to do. He's just really intense,' recalled co-star Leonardo DiCaprio. But he is also not afraid to poke fun at himself. Accepting his best actor Bafta for Lincoln, he told the audience: 'Just on the chance I might one day have to speak on an evening such as this I've actually stayed in character as myself for the last 55 years and had a various selection of Bafta sets downscaled, dating from the late fifties, placed in every single room of every house I've ever lived in and every time I rise from a chair it spontaneously unleashes a soundtrack of thunderous applause, with a few boos and some drunken hecklers.' Away from Hollywood, stories of his eccentricities abound. In 1997, he turned his back on the film industry and became a shoemaker in Florence, where he remained until Scorsese lured him back into films. Method actor: Day-Lewis is known for taking his roles very seriously - and for his role as Bill the Butcher in The Gangs of New York, pictured, he would sharpen his knives at lunchtime . The 55-year-old, who grew up in south London and has dual British and Irish citizenship, is fiercely private and lives in Co Wicklow, Ireland, with Miller - daughter of playwright Arthur Miller - and their sons. He also has a son from a previous relationship with French actress Isabelle Adjani. He is often spoken of as a recluse but has told an interviewer he needs peace and quiet to prepare for acting jobs. 'I couldn't work or get ready for a piece of work from a city base, from city life. I need deep, deep quiet and a landscape too that I can be absorbed into. 'So much of the work is in the process of aimless rumination in which things may or may not take seed,' he explained.

He told Fox: 'They were looking for tall Marines, and I was a tall guy. I was ordered to stand still and look forward. ;I knew the first lady was there, but I couldn't even see her in my field of vision.' The retired Marine was unaware until years later that he was even part of the historic scene. This weekend he was honored at a special service at Anderson Mill Road Baptist Church in Moore, South Carolina. The Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office Rifle Drill Team honored a local veteran during a special service at Anderson Mill Road Baptist Church in Moore on Sunday. Grady Thompson, who is a former detention officer, received a special salute and was given a framed photograph of his moment in history.

"It would have been career suicide for most people. But former Blue Peter presenter Richard Bacon has claimed ‘positive things came out of’ being fired for taking cocaine. The 1998 scandal reduced Bacon’s father to tears, while causing embarrassment for the BBC. Scroll down for video . Former Blue Peter presenter Richard Bacon (pictured) has claimed ‘positive things came out of’ being fired for taking cocaine - the 1998 scandal caused embarrassment for the BBC . But giving an interview 16 years after becoming the first host to be sacked from the children’s programme, the broadcaster, 38, boasted that ‘the Blue Peter thing’ served as an ‘ice-breaker’, which opened doors in other directions. Bacon said: ‘The Blue Peter thing changed the whole course of my life; the path I was going down altered dramatically. ‘Without it, I probably would’ve gone to some kind of holiday show, promoting two-night stays somewhere. It had a huge impact. It’s a fact of my life, and almost as big a part of me now as one of my limbs. ‘I’m not in any way advocating that people should try that as a career plan but, like the Japanese proverb says, out of adversity, came opportunity. Positive things came out of it.’ Bacon was just 18 months into his dream job at Blue Peter when he was fired at the age of 22 after admitting he took cocaine in a London nightclub. At the time the BBC issued a statement from Lorraine Heggessey, head of children’s programmes, which said: ‘It is sad that such a talented presenter as Richard Bacon has not only let himself and his colleagues down but, most important of all, he has let down the millions of children who watch Blue Peter.’ Left to right: Blue Peter presenters Konnie Huq, Richard Bacon, Katy Hill and Stuart Miles in 1997 . A producer told Bacon him he would never work in television again. More than a decade on, Bacon’s career has seen him present multiple television programmes for the Corporation, as well as for Channel 4 and ITV. Until it stopped broadcasting in September, he also had a regular radio show on BBC Radio 5 Live. Referring to the scandal as an ‘ice-breaker’, Bacon, who is a black card holder at private members’ club Soho House, said in an interview with the Daily Mirror: ‘It opened a whole new series of jobs, like the gig at Channel 4’s Big Breakfast. I became known as the naughty boy, working with all the other naughty kids. I never thought for a second I’d stop working because of it. Richard Bacon (pictured) with his wife, Rebecca McFarlane in 2011 . ‘I’m an extremely positive person and never thought I’d not work for the BBC again. It’s such a broad organisation that for them to speak with one voice and ban me completely seemed unlikely.’ Financially, Bacon, who was educated at £24,000 a year Worksop College, has also done well - he is in the top 1 per cent of British earners - raising questions over whether he was the ideal presenter for his latest project, Channel 4’s How Rich Are You?, which aired last night. Bacon said: ‘The show isn’t a communist manifesto but we need more equality. the gap between rich and poor has become too big. The ladder isn’t taller, the rungs have got further apart.’ The one-off documentary examined the poverty gap in Britain, with Bacon criticising a system where ‘the rich get richer and the poor get poorer’. He recently bought property in West Hollywood, where he is moving with his wife Rebecca and children, after reportedly landing a prime-time TV series in the States. Last week it emerged the privately-educated star, who has been described as belonging to the ‘smug metropolitan elite’ is renting his £3 million London property for £15,000 a month during the temporary move.","Richard Bacon was the first host to be sacked from the children’s show .

"Electric car company Tesla Motors will produce a driverless car within the next three years, according to its chief executive, Elon Musk. The move will see Tesla overtake Google, who three years ago began the race to bring driverless cars on to the road. Google’s programme, however, has been slow to get off the ground because carmakers are worried about potential liabilities from accidents, according to a source speaking to the Financial Times. Tesla Motors will produce a driverless car within the next three years, according to its chief executive, Elon Musk. Its autonomous car would allow the driver to hand over 90 per cent of the control of the car . California-based Tesla said its autonomous car would allow the driver to hand 90 per cent of the control of the car over to the vehicle's computer system. Fully autonomous cars would take longer to develop, said Musk, in an interview with the Financial Times. The self-driving car would be developed in-house using Tesla's own technology, not that of another company, Musk said in comments confirmed by a Tesla spokesperson. Tesla's online job board currently has a post for an Advanced Driver Assistance Systems Controls Engineer, who will be responsible for helping ‘Tesla's effort to pioneer fully automated driving.’ Tesla founder Elon Musk (left) and Google chief executive Larry Page (left) are now going head to head in the race to get a safe and practical self-driving car on to the road . Prior to this announcement, Tesla had been one of the leading contenders to collaborate with Google on its driverless car programme. Google has already fitted out several cars with radar-like equipment that lets them navigate roads in California and Nevada. California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law last year allowing the Mountain View-based internet giant to test its self-driving cars on the road. Google did not immediately respond to an enquiry about the status of its driverless car programme. Google has already fitted out several cars with radar-like equipment that lets them navigate roads in California and Nevada . This image from Google shows what a driverless car sees when it is roaming the streets . Musk's three-year timeline is more ambitious than those set out by other car makers, as well as analysts that say it will take 10 to 15 years before self-driving cars become a reality. Germany's Daimler AG and Japan's Nissan have both said they hope to begin selling self-driving cars by the end of the decade. Daimler already offers technology that allows for partly automated driving such as traffic jam assistance in its top-line S-Class Mercedes, which can maintain distance to other cars in stop-and-go situations. As well as technical obstacles, legal and safety issues must be overcome before driverless cars are allowed on the road. European Union laws currently call for drivers to control their cars at all times. And it is unclear whether the multi-billion dollar car insurance industry has any appetite to back the cars until the technology is proven. Elon Musk, 42, was born in Pretoria, South Africa before moving to Canada and later the U.S. By the time he reached 12 . year's old he had created and sold his first software program - a space . game called Blastar - for around $500. Musk . started Zip2 - an online content publishing software - in 1998 with his . brother, Kimbal Musk, which was bought in 1999 by Compaq's AltaVista . division for a reported $300million. Musk . then co-found X.com  and . a year later this firm merged with Confinity, which later became known . as PayPal. In October . 2002, PayPal was bought by eBay for $1.5billion in stock and Musk, the . company's largest shareholder, owned 11.7 per cent of these shares. In June 2002 Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX). SpaceX develops and manufactures space launch vehicles. SpaceX . was awarded a billion-dollar Nasacontract in December 2008, for 12 . flights of their Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the .

He is reported to have a 32 per cent stake in the car company, which is currently valued above $12 billion, as of 29 May 2013. Additionally, .

"From creating smart devices that can be operated with a phone, to retro games consoles - programmers and gadget enthusiasts can now get an even smaller slice of the Raspberry Pi microcomputer. The British engineering foundation has unveiled its latest version, called the Raspberry Pi Model A+ - a super-slim, 2.5 inch-long (6.5cm) machine costing just £15.50 in the UK, and $20 in the US. It’s described as a ‘small, energy-efficient and crazy-affordable’ way to get into computing, or to hack products and create new engineering projects for coders with more experience. Scroll down for video . A British engineering foundation has unveiled its latest computer - the Raspberry Pi Model A+ (pictured) - a super-slim 2.5 inch (6.5cm) long machine costing just £15.50 in the UK and $20 in the US . Smaller than a credit card, the Model A+ has a 700Mhz processor and 256MB of RAM. It weighs 0.8 ounces (23g) and has been designed for watching hi-definition video, programming, playing games and web browsing. This is because the tiny Linux computer has a HDMI socket to connect to a monitor or TV. Dimensions: 2.1-inch x 2.2-inch x 0.4-inches (6.5cm x 5.6cm x 1.2cm) at its thickest point. Memory: 256MB RAM . Expansion: MicroSD slot, USB port, 40  pins . Weight: 8 ounces (23g) Price: £15.50 (UK) and $20 (US) Comparison with old Model A: Model A+ is 20 per cent cheaper, 24 per cent shorter and 42 per cent thinner . There is also an audio jack, room for a micro SD card and a USB socket to connect other devices. The Model A+ is made by Raspberry Pi, a Cambridge-based charity, which launched its original cheap microcomputer in 2012. The microcomputer became a surprise hit and is now used in many schools in the UK to teach coding. The Model A+ model is its cheapest and smallest yet. James Adams, director of hardware engineering, said: ‘We want to get them into the hands of children so they can learn about computers and programming. ‘Parents might not want to let children play about on computers, but this gives them access to technology at an affordable price. The Linux microcomputer (shown) is described as ‘small, energy-efficient and crazy-affordable’ way to get into computing or to hack products and create new engineering projects, for coders with more experience . ‘It is cheap and flexible. It can be used as a desktop PC or for a robot. It is a bit like digital Lego.’ Raspberry Pi recently revamped its more powerful Model B board to a B+ with extra features, for the same $35 (£24) price tag. The engineers said the new Model A+ ‘inherits many improvements that we made to the Model B+’. The small microcomputer is $5 (£3.15) cheaper than the Model A, which the foundation describes as ‘pretty mind-bending’. In an interview with Linux Voice,  founder Eben Upton revealed that Google’s Eric Schmidt is responsible for the firm pushing for cheaper prices, because he said: ‘try and be as cheap as possible...try and get as close to free as you can.’ Google gave the Foundation $1 million (£630,000) last year to put 15,000 Raspberry Pis in UK schools in a bid to help children learn to code.

"If Emmanuel Adebayor is right and Tottenham’s poor little players are scared to play at White Hart Lane, then Daniel Levy needs to get them up the M1 to Milton Keynes as soon as possible. Adebayor’s comments are laughable and epitomise one of the biggest problems at Tottenham Hotspur. Players join Spurs for an easy ride, a quiet life. It’s been happening for years.

Adebayor jumps for the header but fails to score as Tottenham lost 2-1 at home to Stoke in the Premier League . Tottenham supporters will tell you with joy in their heart about some of the greats who they’ve seen wear the shirt. It’s not a criticism of them, but Spurs fans have been far too easily pleased over the years. They should demand more. When Jurgen Klinsmann scored a few and showed everyone his hilarious diving celebration he became a legend. Gareth Bale was brilliant, and so was Luka Modric. Gazza, Waddle, Hoddle and Ardiles. Class acts. Gary Lineker – what a finisher! How about David Ginola? And Teddy Sheringham? Some great players, but not one league title at Tottenham for any of them. And yet they’re all regarded as Spurs greats. Gareth Bale celebrates after scoring for Tottenham Hotspur against Sunderland in May 2013 . Paul Gascoigne celebrates after Spurs beat north London rivals Arsenal 3-1 in the FA Cup semi-final in 1991 . Gary Lineker takes a penalty during a Rumbelows Cup match against Swansea at White Hart Lane in 1991 . Players know that they don’t have to do too much to become a club legend at White Hart Lane. Some of them don’t even have to win any sort of trophy. And so when Tottenham fans display their frustration at the ineptitude of the current team – they’ve lost four of their last five home games in the Premier League – Adebayor starts crying. He claims to be speaking on behalf of the players so we are left to assume that all the players are upset about it, the poor lambs. Adebayor is a player who didn’t even start on Sunday because he was so useless in the previous game, and when he was due to come on as a substitute he wasn’t ready. Jon Walters (left) diverts in a cross to put Stoke 2-0 up against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday . And yet he is upset that the fans are expressing their unhappiness. Spurs haven’t won the league title for well more than 50 years. They’re meant to be a cup team but haven’t won the FA Cup for more than 20 years. They have had one season in the Champions League. The support of the fans has been brilliant in that time, but the side effect is that players and board members have all realised they only have to do the bare minimum, and they’ll either be seen as heroes or the manager will be sacked. There is no accountability at Spurs. Spurs duo Harry Kane (left) and Christian Eriksen both show their dejection after Stoke went 2-1 up . There is, however, a culture and history of underachieving. And a habit of getting some crucial decisions badly wrong. Tottenham supporters have had to live in the shadow of Arsenal for too long. Even now when the Gunners are as bad as they’ve been under Arsene Wenger, Spurs are still some way behind. That must hurt Spurs fans, and I feel for them. But it’s up to the Tottenham faithful to mobilise themselves and ask serious questions. The fans are the true owners of the club: Lewis, Pochettino, Baldini, Levy, Adebayor and all the rest will come and go. Generations of fans will be there for ever. Joe Lewis (left) and Daniel Levy have a chat during Spurs' 3-0 defeat by Liverpool earlier this season . Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino (second right) watches his side go down to Stoke on Sunday . Now is the time for Spurs fans to ask what the club identity really is and in which direction it is going. They need to stop at nothing to find out what the ultimate goal of the club is, and how they plan to get there. Or are Joe Lewis and Daniel Levy happy to just stay in the Premier League and pretend to challenge? Get some answers Spurs fans. Otherwise you’ll end up in Milton Keynes questioning your status as a big club. Booing the players is short term and ineffective.

"A convicted killer has been let off a curfew by magistrates because his history of domestic violence demands that he needs to be able to leave the house to calm down. George Holtby, 46, had been sentenced to 200 hours unpaid work for drink driving. But he was returned to court after claiming his back injury meant he was not fit to do the community work. George Holtby, 46, (left) who killed wealthy heiress Suzy Healey (right) was let off a curfew for drunk driving because his history of domestic violence means he needs to be able to leave his house to calm down . Magistrates were considering imposing an alternative punishment of a curfew, but they rejected this after being told by his probation officer that it was ‘not appropriate’. Mark Sandbrook said Holtby needed to ‘take a step back’ if he became involved in a domestic argument and it would be better if he was able to leave his home. As a result, Holtby was let off the unpaid work by Beverley Magistrates and ordered to complete an extra six months of supervision by the Probation Service instead. Presiding magistrate Michael Bowman said: ‘I am reluctant to withdraw the punishment and not replace it with another, but for the reasons we have heard, there will be no curfew put in place due to issues of domestic violence.’ Victim: Holtby was jailed for eight-and-a-half years at Hull Crown Court in 2006 for strangling his former fiancée Miss Healey to death after she taunted him during sex . Wealthy: Miss Healey was a divorced mother-of-two who came from a billionaire family . Verdict: Holtby was cleared of murdering his on-off lover in her magnificent £1.9million manor house, but found guilty of manslaughter 'by reason of provocation' Jailed: Holtby was released automatically after serving half his sentence for manslaughter . Holtby was jailed for eight-and-a-half years at Hull Crown Court in 2006 for strangling his former fiancée – wealthy heiress Suzy Healey – to death after she taunted him during sex. He was cleared of murdering his on-off lover in her magnificent £1.9million manor house, but found guilty of manslaughter ‘by reason of provocation’. Miss Healey, a divorced mother-of-two, came from a billionaire family. She had a drink problem and was regarded as an eccentric animal lover. She threw Holtby out of the house after he was made redundant. He killed her in a jealous rage when he visited her on the day she celebrated her 40th birthday. Holtby was released automatically after half his sentence. Magistrates were told on Monday that he had rebuilt his life and had been living with a new partner in South Cave, East Yorkshire. They were running a pet-sitting business together. But Holtby was sent back to prison last December because of an incident of domestic violence, details of which were not disclosed. After his release Holtby, who has a long-term drink problem, was arrested for drink driving. In May magistrates imposed a 44-month driving ban and ordered him to do 200 hours unpaid work and attend a nine-day alcohol programme. Commenting on the curfew option, Mr Sandbrook told the court: ‘I advise magistrates to continue to monitor Mr Holtby’s relationship issues as the supervision requirement. A curfew would not be deemed appropriate. ‘As with cases of domestic violence, we urge people involved to take a step back from a situation if it arises, and, with a curfew in place, Mr Holtby may be at risk of not being able to leave his home.’ The supervision order imposed on Holtby means he must attend appointments with his probation officer, responsible for discussing and supervising his behaviour. Home: Miss Healey was regarded as an eccentric animal lover, who shared her home with a menagerie of pets .

"Will Sherri Shepherd or Joy Behar be lured back to The View? One of them will, if ABC brass have anything to say about it. MailOnline can disclose that they have approached the former View hosts about the prospect of returning to the faltering show. And Rosie O'Donnell is out of the loop. The View made its fall debut on Sept. 16  to stellar ratings with the new cast of Rosie, Nicolle Wallace, Rosie Perez and returning moderator Whoopi Goldberg. But that excitement soon wore off, as viewers tuned out and ratings plunged below those of the show's last season with Goldberg, Sherri Shepherd, Barbara Walters and Jenny McCarthy. Scroll down for video . Save the day: ABC execs believe Sherri Shepherd or Joy Behar would give ratings a much needed boost . Ready for a fight: Sources says Rosie will be none too pleased if decisions are made behind her back . In a major move, ABC has shifted the show from its entertainment department and moved it to the ABC News division because the network is concerned about the show's direction. Now that ABC News is involved, executives are have been trying to get one of the show's former co-hosts to return in an effort to boost ratings. Rosie hates everything that isn't an idea of hers, but she's not aware of this, say network insiders. Rosie doesn't have the dominance over them that she did with ABC Entertainment. Sources close to ABC News tell MailOnline that the network is interested in either Sherri or Joy returning to the show to bring back former viewers. 'Both Sherri and Joy had huge followings while on the show and their familiarity could be just the thing to spark interest in the show again and generate some positive buzz,' the source explained. MailOnline previously reported that The View was being beaten by the Wendy Williams Show and The Real in the most important 18 to 34 demographic. According to The Hollywood Reporter, The View is pacing downward for the fourth straight season and is 30 percent south of where it was five years ago in that younger demo. Nielsen ratings reveal that the show is only scoring with a much older audience than the 25 to 55 demographic, not something that advertisers respond well too. 'ABC conducted focus groups on the new version of The View and found that the audience hates that the show seems so serious now so there's a charge to get back to the pop culture and social issues that younger viewers can relate to. 'That's why they're talking to Sherri about returning. She brought a fun, energetic spirit to the show and loved talking about the Kardashians and reality TV. 'Despite Rosie's reluctance to discuss that type of stuff, she doesn't have much room to fight it now that the ratings have dropped so badly,' the source explained. Guest gig: ABC News had Behar come on The View to promote her new one woman show off Broadway to see how viewers would respond to her. The feedback was tremendous . Behar has also had some big pop culture moments while on the show, as she famously asked President Barack Obama if he knew who Snooki was during an interview. 'Joy stays abreast of the latest pop culture stories and issues. And she brings a unique perspective to topics, even when she cares less about them,' the source explained, before adding: 'That's how her signature phrase: 'so what? who cares?' came to be.' ABC News had Behar come on The View to promote her new one-woman off-Broadway show - 'Me, My Mouth and I' - to see how viewers would respond to her. The feedback was tremendous. The network is trying to figure out when they can get Sherri to return, but the day they initially wanted her she passed on the opportunity to do an exclusive interview with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America instead. ABC has approached both former co-hosts agents about the possibility of returning in a more permanent capacity, and apparently Shepherd is showing resistance about coming back to the place she called home for seven years. Sherri just signed on to join the cast of TV Land's The Soul Man for 10 episodes.","ABC brass are convinced that Sherri or Joy would bring back fans who have abandoned the show .

"Health officials are investigating an outbreak of highly-contagious norovirus after some 60 people recently came down with the illness at a luxury hotel in the San Francisco Bay Area. First signs of the outbreak appeared on October 26, when those who attended a NAACP convention at the hotel the night before started getting sick and a dozen were taken to the hospital by ambulance for treatment. Norovirus spreads through contact with a infected person, as well as consuming contaminated food and water. Symptoms include stomach pain, nausea and diarrhea. Sickening: About 60 people have come down with norovirus after attending three special events at the luxury Hotel Sofitel in the San Francisco Bay Area recently . While norovrius is the leading cause of outbreaks from contaminated food in the U.S., officials inspected the hotel's kitchen and food service areas and found no violations, leaving the virus's origin a mystery. The more than 300 people who attended the NAACP's annual state conference dined on salmon  and salad. The virus continued to spread at two further special events at the hotel. However, food operations resumed on Friday after the premises were disinfected and the staff retrained on cleanliness. Officials have interviewed patients and taken samples, but testing the specimens to find a common cause could take several weeks. Meanwhile staff are being told that if they come down with virus, to stay at home until they are symptom free for 72 hours. Nasty: Norovirus is an extremely contagious sickness that spreads through human contact and consuming contaminated food or water. Symptoms include stomach pain, nausea and diarrhea . The same hotel was the site of a similar outbreak in January 2008  when 62 people contracted norovirus while attending a Chamber of Commerce event which included a chicken and salmon dinner. At the time, health officials found several code violations including the use of unsanitary clothes to wipe down kitchen equipment. Outbreaks of norovirus are common in schools, health care centers, cruise ships and anywhere else where large groups of people are kept in close proximity.","Health officials say the outbreak started October 26 - the morning after the NAACP's annual state convention which was held at the hotel .

"House Speaker John Boehner has stuck an Internet sales tax proposal in a drawer and he doesn't intend to dust it off before the end of the Christmas shopping season – if he considers it at all. The Marketplace Fairness Act, passed last year in the Senate, would allow each state to force out-of-state online retailers to collect sales taxes from its residents. But a Boehner spokesman said late Monday in a statement that the plan isn't going anywhere. SHOPPING FREEDOM? House Speaker John Boehner wants online purchases to be tax-free so retailers – including small Internet businesses – won't have to do paperwork for all 45 states that collect sales taxes . 'The speaker has made clear in the past he has significant concerns about the bill, and it won’t move forward this year,” said spokesman Kevin Smith. 'The Judiciary Committee continues to examine the measure and the broader issue. In the meantime, the House and Senate should work together to extend the moratorium on Internet taxation without further delay.' The committee, chaired by Virginia Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte, has sat on the Marketplace Fairness Act since early in 2013. A congressional aide told MailOnline that Goodlatte fears forcing Internet stores to collect sales taxes could create new tax-compliance nightmares. They would have to manage the requirements of all 45 states that collect sales taxes, the staffer explained, while traditional stores with no more than a few locations only need to worry about one. That wouldn't be a problem for a shoe store like Zappos, but it could be a paperwork headache for every small business that has an online presence. The National Retail Federation, a trade group, is backing brick-and-mortar shops that want to see Internet sales taxes everywhere since their walk-in customers have to pay the taxes on everything they buy. 'The bill may change or even be folded into another piece of ""must-pass"" legislation. NRF communications director Stephen Schatz tweeted Monday. 'The fight is far from over.' 'We have about three weeks in the lame duck. Anything can happen. Retailers are all in to get this done this year.' The Obama administration backed the proposal when the Senate bill made national news. 'We believe that the Marketplace Fairness Act will level the playing field for local small business retailers who are undercut every day by out-of state online companies,' the White House's then-press secretary Jay Carney told reporters in April 2013. 'Today, while local small business retailers follow the law and collect sales taxes from customers who make purchases in their stores, many big business online and catalogue retailers do not collect the same taxes. This puts local neighborhood-based small businesses at a disadvantage to big, out-of-state, online companies.' Big money: State legislators hope new laws will help recapture tax revenue lost when consumers makes billions in purchases each year from sites like Amazon . But Grover Norquist, the famously anti-tax president of Americans for Tax Reform, lashed out at the idea. 'Too many politicians in state capitols and Washington have looked at the internet only as a way to raise taxes,' he told MailOnline on Tuesday. 'They want to tax Internet access, they want to raise Internet sales.' 'Boehner has drawn a line in the sand saying the American people come first and politicians need to keep their hands off the Internet. ... Obama says yes to taxing the Internet, Reid says yes to taxing the Internet. Speaker Boehner just said ""hell no"" to taxing the Internet. Boehner wins.' One odd development will strike the states of Virginia and Maryland if the Marketplace Fairness Act doesn't become law, according to Roll Call. Transportation funding calculations in both of those states will change unless they can start collecting sales tax from their residents who buy things across state lines. The net results will be higher gas taxes beginning in January, meaning that the Old Dominion and the 'Free State' – Maryland – will get their money either way. Amazon already collects sales tax from residents of 23 states and wants the bill passed so it can establish its own 'level playing field' with other online giants like eBay and Overstock. Both of those companies oppose the legislation.","House speaker isn't going to bring up a Senate-passed 'fairness' bill during the lame-duck congressional session .
Legislation would allow states to collect sales taxes from their residents' online purchases, no matter where the e-tailer is located .
Brick-and-mortar stores and their trade groups want a mandate because they all have to collect sales taxes from walk-in customers .
Republicans worry that all online stores, including small businesses, will find themselves having to deal with paperwork for nearly every US state ."
"A teenage girl has been held on murder charges after the body of a newborn baby was found half-buried in the dirt behind an apartment block. The child had been lying outside, face down, for up to a month in Muskegon, Michigan, authorities said on Tuesday. The baby's body was found on Monday afternoon by a janitor at the apartment block, who at first thought the child was a doll. Jessica Brewster, 17, who attends Muskegon High School was arrested on Monday night and 'admitted' her connection to the child's death. It is believed she acted alone, according to police, and that she is the mother of the baby. Scroll down for video .

The area at Trinity Manor in Muskegon, Michigan on Tuesday where the body of a newborn infant was found on Monday afternoon. A 17-year-old Muskegon High School student was arrested over the death . The high school senior has been arrested and was being held at the Muskegon County Jail. Detectives told WZZM that the baby was likely born in October and soon afterwards left behind the senior living complex where Brewster's grandmother has a home. The child's cause of death has not been revealed. After the baby's body was discovered, detectives canvassed the neighborhood to ask if any pregnant relatives had visited recently. One resident, reportedly Brewster's grandmother, sent police to talk to the teenager. Muskegon Public Safety Director Jeffrey Lewis told WZZM: 'It was a 17-year-old female who admitted she was in fact pregnant and had the baby sometime in mid-October.' Calls to Muskegon Public Safety Director Jeffrey Lewis by MailOnline went unanswered on Tuesday. Arleen Clements, the janitor who found the baby's body, told MLive that she was in a state of shock over the death. Arleen Clements talks about finding an infant buried in the dirt at Trinity Manor where she works as a janitor . She said: 'I just opened the door and looked down and saw it. My mind told me it wasn't a baby. I looked down closer to it. 'I saw a little leg and little toes. I stood there thinking, ''Am I seeing what I'm seeing? Could it be a doll baby?'"" But she said it was the little toes on the exposed legs of the baby that filled her with dread. 'A doll doesn't have little wrinkles on its toe like that. I just knew it was a baby then,' she said. The case is being reviewed by the county prosecutor and a decision on whether Brewster will be charged is expected to be made on Wednesday.

"Size 10 model Myla Dalbesio has hit back at criticism over her newly released Calvin Klein underwear campaign after Twitter users complained that she is not 'plus size'. Talking to Today, the 27-year-old said it was 'unfortunate' that Calvin Klein  received flak for its 'groundbreaking' Perfectly Fit ad campaign, which didn't actually point out her size at all. 'They released this campaign with me right alongside all of the other girls of varying shapes and sizes, and didn't make a fuss about it,' she explained. 'I think it's really unfortunate, because Calvin Klein has done something that's really groundbreaking... they released this campaign with what some would say is a normal-sized model, a size 10. And size 10 girls, there's not a lot of spots for us to fit in in the fashion industry.' Scroll down for video . Breaking boundaries: Model Myla Dalbesio, 27, who wears a U.S. size ten, has made history as one of the curviest woman ever to star in a Calvin Klein campaign . At a U.S. size 10 (UK size 14), the 27-year-old from Wisconsin is too curvy for a standard sample size zero or two, but plus-size is traditionally classified as size 12 and up, putting her right in the middle. After the campaign was released yesterday, Twitter users criticized Calvin Klein on the basis of an Elle magazine article in which Myla was referred to as 'what the fashion industry would -- still, surprisingly -- call ""plus size""'. 'It's kind of confusing because I'm a bigger girl,' Myla, who stands at 5ft 11in, told Elle. 'I'm not the biggest girl on the market but I'm definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with, so that is really intimidating.' Myla, who describes her body type as 'in the middle,' looks stunning in the Perfectly Fit campaign, flaunting her curves in a black bra, her brunette hair slicked back. She says the ad, which also features the more 'straight-sized' Jourdan Dunn, Ji Hye Park, Amanda Wellsh and Lara Stone, is revolutionary in that it doesn't address that fact that she is the lone 'plus-size' model in the group. 'I'm not skinny enough to be with the skinny girls and I'm not large enough to be with the large girls , and I haven't been able to find my place,' she explained. As such, 'this [campaign] was such a great feeling.' Watch more of Myla's interview at The What's Underneath Project . Standing pretty: Myla shows off her curves in a photo from her agency Jag Models . And yet some people took to Twitter in outrage that she could even be considered a 'bigger' girl. 'Genuine WTF moment,' one critic wrote in a tweet directed at Elle. 'This woman is described as ""plus-size"" and ""a bigger girl"". Aaaraagahagaagahahagahahag'. Another person said: 'I wouldn't consider her a plus size model. Her height and her muscular tone should not categorize as a ""big girl.""' And a third commented angrily: 'How is that plus size??' Despite the outcry, which seemed to be directed at Elle rather than Calvin Klein, Myla says landing the campaign has made her hopeful that size is becoming less of an issue in the fashion industry. Up close: 'It's kind of confusing because I'm a bigger girl,' says Myla, who stands at 5ft 11in. 'I'm not the biggest girl on the market but I'm definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with' Outcry: Some critics have taken to Twitter in outrage that she could even be considered a 'bigger' girl . In comparison: Also featured in the campaign are Amanda Wellsh (left) and Jourdan Dunn (right), who both fit the standard sample size . 'It's not like [Calvin Klein] released this campaign and were like, 'Whoa, look, there's this plus-size girl in our campaign,'' she explained. 'They released me in this campaign with everyone else; there's no distinction. It's not a separate section for plus-size girls.' A statement released by the fashion house expresses the same sentiment. 'The Perfectly Fit line was created to celebrate and cater to the needs of different women,' a spokesperson told MailOnline. 'And these images are intended to communicate that our new line is more inclusive and available in several silhouettes in an extensive range of sizes.' Myla, who is currently signed by Jag Models after being scouted at 16 when she was crowned Miss Teen Wisconsin, has opened up in the past about being encouraged to lose weight in order to fit into the 'standard' modeling size. The model, who also works as a performance artist, has spoken in the past about her darkest days when she found herself heading down a path of drugs and eating disorders. Fitting in: Despite the controversy, Myla says landing the Calvin Klein campaign has made her hopeful that size is becoming less of an issue in the fashion industry . She told Fashionista in 2012: 'I tried for a long time to make myself [lose weight]. I tried throwing up after I ate and that's awful. That is painful - I would never wish for anyone to do that ever.' The model revealed that she would spend weeks eating nothing but calorie-free black olives and pickles  and spending hours in the gym to try to slim down to a more typical model weight. She then gave up modelling for two years to concentrate on her studies but it was Crystal Renn who paved the way for her return as a plus-size girl. Myla said: 'They told me about plus modeling which was something I'd never heard of before. In the middle: 'I'm not skinny enough to be with the skinny girls and I'm not large enough to be with the large girls... 'This [campaign] was such a great feeling', explained Myla (with model Danielle Redman) 'But then they [scouts Jeff and Mary Clark] showed me, and this is when Crystal was really starting to pick up speed, so I walked into Ford and the first thing Gary [Dakin] said to me was, ""You're the next Crystal Renn,"" and then they signed me.' But Myla has also noted that she is encouraged to have landed the Calvin Klein campaign, despite not fitting into the super-skinny mold. 'Look at the history of the brand, they launched Kate Moss, and this is the woman who started this whole trend of waif,' she told Entertainment Tonight earlier this year. 'To see a brand like that embracing a greater range of sizes… it's really special.' Flashback: Calvin Klein has previously attracted ire for championing the 'heroin chic' waifish look as exemplified by Kate Moss in a 1992 ad (pictured)","Myla Dalbesio is 5ft 11in and a US size 10, which is a UK size 14 .

"The alleged ringleader of a plot to execute a random person on Australian soil was once a drug-abusing strip club worker in Sydney's notorious Kings Cross who loved gambling, women and cocaine. Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who is now Australia's most senior Islamic State leader, worked as a spruiker outside a strip club owned by Kings Cross identity John Ibrahim before he turned to radical Islam. Before he allegedly started recruiting Australians to fight in Syria and Iraq, the 33-year-old from Sydney was once a womaniser who mixed with gangsters and suspected drug dealers, according to the ABC's 7.30 program. Scroll down for video . Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who is now Australia's most senior Islamic State leader, worked as a spruiker outside a Kings Cross strip club before he turned to radical Islam . 'He was a big party animal,' a former friend told the program. 'He drank a lot, was a big smoker, he liked drugs, loved women and could be violent. 'He gambled a lot ... He once won $8,000 or $9,000 on the pokies, then played it back down... and he loved cocaine.' Through lawyers on Tuesday, John Ibrahim denied owning the strip club Baryalei worked at. Mr Ibrahim also denied knowing or having any involvement with Baryalei. Baryalei's former friend said he became increasingly troubled as time went on and he developed a 'moral dilemma', which prompted his obsession for Islam. Police allege Baryalei was the catalyst behind last Thursday's counter-terrorism raids that saw more than 800 police raid multiple homes in Sydney and Brisbane. Police allege Baryalei was the catalyst behind last Thursday's counter-terrorism raids that saw more than 800 police raid multiple homes in Sydney and Brisbane . The raids were sparked when police allegedly intercepted a phone call from Baryalei to Sydney 22-year-old Omarjan Azari, which detailed the plot to execute a random Australian on camera. Baryalei, who went from being an Afghan refugee to senior Islamic State militant, had a deeply troubled upbringing with years of physical abuse and mental illness. His family fled Afghanistan in 1981 when he was just 40 days old and they arrived at Sydney's Villawood Detention Centre when he was seven. He was raised in Sydney's northwest and attended Terra Sancta Catholic High School, but his father became violent and abusive towards him. Before he started recruiting Australians to fight in Syria and Iraq, the 33-year-old from Sydney was once a womaniser who mixed with gangsters and suspected drug dealers . Baryalei suffered bouts of depression as a teenager and even spoke of suicide when he was unemployed in 2009. After an apparent religious epiphany, Baryalei started attending his local mosque, grew his beard and began following Muslim preachers on YouTube. Baryalei was shown in a number of YouTube videos himself traipsing around the streets of south-western Sydney with a microphone and purportedly attempting to convert random people to Islam. As his passion for Islam developed, Baryalei gained a following of young men and police later found out he was secretly recruiting followers to fight in Syria. In April last year Baryalei left Australia for the Middle East to initially join Al Qaeda group Jabhat Al Nusra. Baryalei, pictured with US-Australian citizen Tyler Casey (back) who was killed in Syria in January, is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians believed to be fighting for the Islamic State in the Middle East . But within two months he switched to rival militant group, the Islamic State, where he gained a trusted position and quickly became the key intermediary for scores of Australians taking up arms. Neighbours of Baryalei's mum told The Australian she had no idea her son was involved with militant groups until police raided their family home at Quakers Hill last December. 'She thought her son was over there studying,' the neighbour said. 'After her house was raided, she said they must be mistaken, her son would never do anything wrong.' Baryalei is believed to be currently in the Syrian city of Raqqa in a protected location, according to the newspaper. The Australian Federal Police have an arrest warrant out for Baryalei. Mohammad Ali Baryalei was featured in a number of YouTube videos attempting to convert random Australians to Islam.

"It is a record Shadow the lurcher could do without. After more than 260 days, he is the longest-staying resident at Battersea Cats and  Dogs Home. The sweet and loving four-year-old lurcher is a firm favourite with staff at the charity. But while they are glad of his company, they are at a loss to explain why he has not yet found a home. Plea: After 260 days at Battersea, Shadow was desperate to find a new home . Innocent: What you will be getting should you decide to take in Shadow . The average dog stays for 35 days – Shadow has been there more than seven times longer. Like 46 per cent of Battersea dogs, Shadow was brought in by his owners last July as they could no longer care for him. Rob Young, head of rehoming, said: ‘Poor Shadow must feel really unloved as he’s been here for so long and is desperate for a family to call his own. He’s such a gorgeous boy and will make a fantastic companion – we just can’t understand why he’s been with us for this length of time. ‘Hopefully Shadow’s luck will change soon and someone will fall for his charm.’ Friendly dog: Staff at the charity cannot understand why it took so long for the loving lurcher to find a home . Record stay: Shadow spent seven times longer at the Battersea kennels than the average dog . To break up his time in kennels, Shadow was placed in a foster home for two months. Mr Young added: ‘Shadow did fantastically well in his foster home – he’s housetrained, travels well in the car, is very obedient and above all gave his foster parents lots of love and laughter.’ Director of communications at the home Dee McIntosh added: 'Battersea puts no time limit on rehoming a dog or cat and we’ll care for them for as long as it takes to find them what they long for the most – a loving new home. 'Sadly, if some dogs spend too long in kennels, they could start to show signs of severe stress and do downhill rapidly. But we will only put a dog to sleep if it has extreme behavioural problems and it is clear it is too dangerous to rehome into a family environment. 'Fortunately Shadow is not in that situation at all and simply longs for a second chance in life.' So it seems while Shadow may get to continue his life for now, it is hoped that can be in a loving family rather than the home sooner rather than later. New family: Although staff, like welfare assistant Suzanne Coogan (pictured) loved Shadow, they are thrilled he has found a home .","The lurcher has been at the home for 260 days - seven times longer than the average stay .

The Commonwealth-backed Commission of National Inquiry was appointed to look into the circumstances that led to the crisis in the tropical resort group of islands on February 7 when Nasheed said he was asked to resign at gunpoint. Nasheed's supporters said the report would be biased against them. Speaking to thousands of supporters late on Wednesday in the capital Male, where members of his former ruling Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) had gathered, Nasheed called on the public, the army and police to take to the streets. 'If the Commission report declares it was not a coup, then it is legitimate for the people to topple the government from the street,' Nasheed said. The government has tightened security in Male, fearing unrest. Police have said they would not allow any disturbance and asked people to stay away from planned protests. Nasheed's MDP nominee on the commission resigned from the panel on Wednesday after saying some evidence likely to support Nasheed's allegations of a coup was missing from the report. The Maldives, for almost nine centuries a sultanate before it became a British protectorate, held its first fully democratic elections in 2008. Nasheed defeated Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who at 30 years in power was then Asia's longest-serving leader and accused of running the country as a dictator. Anger: A supporter of Nasheed is arrested during protests after the former leader was summoned to the police headquarters for questioning earlier this month . The Maldives hit the headlines in February when its Nasheed was ousted by his deputy, Mohammed Waheed Hassan. Nasheed had spent six years as a political prisoner before his election in 2008 and his first act as president was to demolish the country’s torture centre. He was a guest at the 2009 Conservative Party conference in Manchester where he addressed delegates. Hassan insists that Nasheed ‘resigned’ – but the manner of his removal was widely condemned, with many observers branding it a coup. Earlier this month, former British Labour Party Cabinet Minister was criticised after agreeing a deal to be paid £7,500 a day to advise the leader of the alleged coup in the Maldives. Violence: A Maldives soldier fires a rubber bullet towards police during clashes in February when the president was ousted in a 'coup' According to leaked document, ex-Attorney-General Baroness Scotland was paid £75,000 for two weeks’ work advising the regime on avoiding further action by the Commonwealth, which has raised serious concerns about a string of human rights abuses. Tory MP John Glen said it was ‘outrageous’ that a former British attorney-general was advising a regime responsible for ousting a democratically-elected president. He said: ‘What happened in the Maldives was a military coup. She should hang her head in shame.’ Conservative MP Karen Lumley, who worked in the Maldives before being elected to Parliament, said: ‘President Nasheed was overthrown in a coup and the Maldives is now very unstable. 'Many of my friends there have been arrested by the new regime. It is disgusting that a former British attorney-general should take a well-paid job advising the new regime, which has no democratic mandate.’",Mohamed Nasheed ousted after 'coup' in February .
"Liverpool University is investigating an 'unacceptable' script for the medical students' society annual play where a character is drugged and raped in a parody of James Bond movie. The script, which mocks the anti-rape slogan 'no means no' and has characters including Mrs SluttyPenny, James Bondage and head of MI6 Mmmmm, has caused outrage. Critics said today the 'misogynistic' pantomine is 'deeply offensive' and an 'embarrassment' because of it makes jokes about sex crimes. Shame: Liverpool University is investigating its medical students, based here in the city, after some produced a pantomime script poking fun at rape . It was one of three options written by fourth-year medical students for the annual concert, known as Smoker. The event runs every year and involves each year group performing a play based on an existing story, with sexual elements added. The script, seen by MailOnline, has five scenes all based around sex and innuendo and is written like a pantomime. In the first scene the writers describe how when the 'lights go on all the girls do a gloriously slutty dance in retro slutty clothes' for the audience. In the final act Pussy Galore ties up Dr No Means No after giving him a Viagra overdose, ripping off his trousers and raping him as James Bondage watches. Afterwards all three burst into an explicit version of the classic Bond theme Live and Let Die. Anger: Students and other critics have called the script 'embarrassing' and 'offensive' Disgusted Harriet Hey wrote on Twitter: 'What have I just read? Gross below the line comments, rape jokes and general idiocy.' A second year psychology student told the University paper The Tab: 'Not only is it completely humiliating for the Medicine school, it just goes to show the true extent of the normalisation of rape culture in Universities today. It needs to stop.' Another Twitter user, Del, called the show 'deeply misogynistic'. A social media user, Qwerty, posted: 'Regardless of the LMSS's achievements, this script should not have been written in the first place. 'It's absolutely disgusting and so embarrassing on the university's behalf.' Students were sent the scripts last month and were asked to vote for their favourite. The winning script was a parody of Mulan, which includes a castration scene and a 'sexy geisha' dance. The medical school is also known for a chant, known as Jack Leggate's Song, which includes the line 'We like those girls who say they won't but look as though they might.' The university, the medical students' society, and the Guild, Liverpool University's students' union, released a joint statement condemning the script. They said: 'We expect our students to comply with the University's policy on student conduct and discipline and adhere to appropriate standards of behaviour. 'The University, the Guild of Students and the Liverpool Medical Students' Society are shocked at the content of this material which is clearly unacceptable. The University is investigating. 'The University and the Guild will continue to work together in combating sexism and sexual harassment.' The Guild also said: 'We believe the material in this document is completely unacceptable and will be working with the University and the society to investigate and ensure that the content for this performance is suitable. 'Our talk from the founder of the everyday sexism project and the launch of our Call It Out campaign reinforces our stance on this type of behaviour and our efforts to ensure the University campus is safe and welcoming for all students.'","Explicit script is parody of James Bond and written by fourth year medics .

"The push to reintroduce a royalist title is set to see the ousting top barristers from their roles in Sydney's strongest legal councils. A vote for the Queen's Counsel title was won at a recent election although the reinstatement had been resisted and criticised by leaders of the NSW Bar Council for some time, The Australian reports. Those opposing to the reform are now at risk of losing their positions and may be replaced by pro-QC legal practitioners such as NSW deputy senior Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen SC, who is the subject of an Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry.

Pro-QC supporters, including Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen SC (left), may replace incumbents against the move like Bar Association president Jane Needham SC (right) The return of Queen's Counsel title in NSW had previously been rejected back in April as a bipartisan committee found the move was not in the public interest, according to The Australian. But last Thursday, pro-QC supporters won 12 of the available 21 positions to govern next year's council. An election for the Bar Council executive roles will be held on Thursday. But it is believed the incumbents against the monarchists are under review among them being the Bar Association chief executive Philip Selth and president Jane Needham SC - who had been elected into her role in May. Other states in Australia - Queensland and Victoria - have already reestablished the royalist title. A Supreme Court judge denied Ms Cunneen's bid to halt the ICAC inquiry which also involve her son Stephen Wyllie (left) and his girlfriend Sophia Tilley (right) The election last Thursday saw Ms Cunneen gain one of the highest votes despite ICAC announcing last month of its investigation into the Crown prosecutor over a corruption allegation. Just yesterday, a Supreme Court judge denied Ms Cunneen's bid to halt the ICAC inquiry which also involve her son Stephen Wyllie and his girlfriend Sophia Tilley. Justice Clifton Hoeben handed down his decision on Monday afternoon, ruling against Ms Cunneen's contention that the ICAC had no right to investigate a 'malicious' complaint which related to her private life. The ICAC has alleged Ms Cunneen and her son counselled Ms Tilley to fake chest pains to avoid a breath test after a car crash in May.","A vote for the Queen's Counsel title was won at an election last Thursday .

"The food fraud scandal escalated last night when Tesco admitted the ‘minced beef’ in its frozen bolognese is up to 100 per cent horsemeat. The value range ready-meal was made by Comigel, a French firm also linked to contaminated products at Findus and Aldi. Horses slaughtered in Romania are thought to have been used by Comigel to make meals distributed across Britain and Europe, raising fears the problems are more widespread than first thought. Scroll down for video . Contaminated: The Everyday Value spaghetti bolognese was found last week to contain up to 100% horse . The Tesco revelation came as: . Tim Smith, Tesco’s technical director, yesterday apologised to customers over the latest development. He said: ‘A week ago Tesco withdrew a frozen Everyday Value spaghetti bolognese product from sale. ‘We did this as a precaution because Findus products from the same factory were reportedly at risk of containing horsemeat. ‘Since then, we have carried out a number of tests on the product and those tests identified the presence of horse DNA. Owen Paterson, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, updated ministers about the investigation into horsemeat contamination . Of the positive results, most are at a trace level of less than 1 per cent but three showed significant levels of horse DNA, exceeding 60 per cent.’ Asked what the true level was, the company said the horse meat ranged between 60 and 100 per cent. There have been concerns that the horse meat used in burgers, lasagne and bolognese sold in the UK is contaminated with veterinary drugs, such as bute. Bute is banned from the human food chain because it can cause aplastic anaemia, which is a type of leukaemia. Mr Smith said Tesco’s test for bute was clear, adding that the company would not take food from Comigel’s facility again. The revelations show Tesco has been stocking products containing horse meat from two different European sources. The scandal emerged four weeks ago following the revelation of contamination of burgers made by manufacturers in Ireland. The French authorities say the horse meat itself came from two Romanian abattoirs and arrived at the French company via brokers in Cyprus and Holland. This explanation has been disputed by the Romanian prime minister, Victor Ponta, who angrily denied any suggestion that the food would have been sold as anything other than horse meat. Domino effect: Six supermarket chains in France withdrew ready-meals from Findus and Comigel following Findus's decision to take its frozen beef lasagne, made by Comigel, off the British shelves .

"Milton Keynes Dons' talented midfielder Dele Alli has been rewarded for his impressive start to the season by being handed the Football League Young Player of the Month award for August. The 19-year-old, who has been linked with moves to Liverpool and Bayern Munich, scored twice during the month, against Peterborough and Crawley, and has since continued his form with another goal at the start of September. Speaking to The Football League, Alli said of the award: 'I'm delighted, it's a good achievement but I couldn't do it without the team. It's a credit to be able to win this award in such a young team.' 'Without the manager giving me the opportunity and supporting me - I can't say thank you enough to him or the players.' Dele Alli (right) pictured with his manager Karl Robinson (left) accepting the award from the Football League . Alli (left) is also a regular for England U19s, pictured against Germany U19s on September 8 . Alli's development at MK Dons was rewarded on Thursday, when he was given a contract extension until 2017. With plenty of admirers further up the league, it seems unlikely that Stadium MK will be his home for the duration, though. Brendan Rodgers is one manager keen on aquiring Alli's services, and the player is well aware of the interest. 'Before games, the gaffer will sit me down, tell me I'm being watched, and make sure I'm not getting carried away,' Alli told The Telegraph. 'I've heard he (Brendan Rodgers) has (been watching). It's not something I really worry about.' Alli's talent was shown to the wider world last month, when his performance against Manchester United in the Capital One Cup turned heads. Alli was part of the MK Dons team that defeated Manchester United 4-0 in the Capital One Cup . Alli scored two goals in the month of August, against Peterborough United and Crawley Town . MK Dons ran out comfortable 4-0 winners, and Alli admits that he enjoyed testing himself against top level oppostion. 'That game against United gave me great inspiration because that's where I want to be playing - in the top leagues against the top teams. 'It showed I am capable of doing that eventually.' For now though, Alli feels at home in Milton Keynes - the city in which he was born and raised - and will continue to impress until the big clubs come knocking.

"This is the moment when a hot air balloon narrowly missed crashing into a windmill that has stood for 350 years. The hapless pilot was forced to take evasive action after being suddenly blown off course and sent on a collision path with the historic landmark. The multi-coloured inflatable aircraft missed the Grade One Listed Chesterton Windmill in Warwickshire by a matter of feet. After the close call with the monument - which has stood since 1632 - the aviator was heard to have said 'that was a little close.' Near Miss: A hot air balloon narrowly missed hitting Chesterton Windmill in Warwickshire . The near miss was captured by photographer Chris Day, 48, as he was taking shots of the landmark at sunset on Sunday evening. 'I could see the balloon in the distance and was waiting for it to fly over the windmill when it suddenly lost altitude and plummeted to the ground,' said the photographer from Warwick. 'It seemed to almost bounce along the ground and came within a few feet of hitting the windmill. The pilot of the multi-coloured aircraft was forced to take evasive action after being blown off course . Photographer Chris Day said the balloon missed the windmill by a matter of feet . 'The speed it was going would have certainly damaged the windmill but the pilot managed to put a burst of flame into the balloon at the last minute and narrowly miss it. 'He didn't seem too bothered as he passed overhead he even doffed his cap and said 'that was a little close, good evening' before disappearing into the distance.' The 71ft (22m) high windmill was built from limestone and sandstone between 1623 and 1633 by mathematician and astrologer Sir Edward Peyto and is one of the most famous landmarks in Warwickshire. It is a favourite location for photographers, including EastEnders actor Adam Woodyatt who lives in nearby Southam and takes landscape pictures in his spare time. In 2006 one of the sails fell off the windmill during an open day, injuring one visitor. Initially, following the incident, the area was roped off to prevent visitors approaching the windmill. The sails themselves were then removed for strengthening. They were finally replaced in late 2007.","Balloon missed Grade One Listed Chesterton Windmill by just feet .

"With just minutes to go before the eleventh hour of the eleventh day, the most celebrated public artwork of modern times was finally completed yesterday – by a 13-year-old Berkshire cadet. The Tower of London poppies have been a triumph of unusual teamwork. And the consortium of free-thinking creatives and old soldiers who have made it happen were all standing proudly in their blood-red moat to see it finished. The very first of these ceramic poppies – one for every British and colonial serviceman killed in the Great War – had been planted in July by the Tower’s longest-serving Yeoman Warder. Yesterday morning, the honour of adding the last went to the younger generation. Honour: Cadet Harry Hayes, 13, gives a fine salute after adding the very last ceramic poppy to the Tower of London moat yesterday in front of a line-up of Forces VIPs . The young cadet wore his full military attire including a poppy-embellished beret while undertaking the honour of planting the poppy . The military cadet (centre) walked with Mr Cummins to the spot where the final poppy - the 888,246th - would be planted in the ground . 13-year-old cadet Harry Hayes planted the final ceramic poppy at the Tower of London this morning to mark Armistice Day . Harry, a new recruit to the Combined Cadet Force at Reading’s Blue Coat School, stepped smartly forward and pressed poppy number 888,246 into the damp soil . Harry Hayes, a new recruit to the Combined Cadet Force at Reading’s Blue Coat School, stepped smartly forward and pressed poppy number 888,246 into the damp soil. His own great, great, great uncle, Private Patrick Kelly of the Irish Guards, was killed in 1918. After a salute worthy of a Sandhurst drill sergeant (‘I have been practising,’ he admitted), Harry rejoined the line-up of VIPs for the two-minute silence. It was observed by millions all over Britain, including the Queen and the Prime Minister. Even in this 16-acre panorama of sacrifice, we could still put a name to this final poppy. Harry Hayes (right) walks to the service with his father Des (left), who served in the British Army for 11 years and now works as the Operations and Safety Manager at the Tower of London . Harry Hayes's great-great-great uncle Private Patrick Kelly (pictured left and right with two friends, Jim Foy and unknown) was killed in action on September 27 1918, weeks before the war ended . For, we know that shortly before the 11am Armistice in 1918, Private George Ellison, from Leeds, was the last British soldier to be killed in the Great War. A 40-year-old father of two, he had fought through the entire conflict with the 5th Royal Irish Lancers, only to be shot on the last morning near Mons, the scene of his first battle in 1914. George Ellison’s poppy, like everyone else’s, will be uprooted today and sent to those who bought them before they sold out weeks ago. Once all outstanding bills are paid, £10million will be shared between six Forces charities. Some of the beneficiaries were at the Tower yesterday. Capt Tony Harris, 33, late of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, lost a leg in Afghanistan, won a gold medal at the Invictus Games and is now an ambassador for Help for Heroes. ‘Our regimental headquarters are at the Tower, my children were baptised here and I feel a bond with every one of those men represented here,’ he said. Bryn Parry, ex-soldier and co-founder of Help for Heroes, had brought along the cigarette case which great uncle George had been carrying when he was shot in Flanders. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg shares a moment with the young cadet before he plants the final poppy in the memorial . Harry  (fifth from right) lined up with other dignitaries at the art installation at the Tower of London for the commemoration . Servicemen walk through each of the 888,245 blooms, which represents a British or Colonial military death during the First World War . ‘This has been a beautiful, tranquil reminder of the horrific, bloody chaos of war,’ said Mr Parry. Yesterday’s proceedings began with a Roll Call by the Constable of the Tower, General Lord Dannatt. In full, plumed ceremonial rig, he recited 200 names, ten at a time in between each round of a 21-gun salute. Last on the list was Lt Maurice Dease, the first VC of the First World War. Looking on was a distinguished veteran of the Second, his scarlet Chelsea Pensioner’s uniform offering perfect camouflage in the moat. Lieutenant-Colonel John Humphreys was captured in North Africa, escaped in Italy, rejoined his unit, was captured again in 1944 as he fought on the bridge at Arnhem and escaped once more. ‘Every one of those poppies is a mother’s son,’ he said softly. A huge crowd gathered to watch as the final poppy was planted in the moat at the Tower of London during this morning's ceremony . The General led the ceremony, pictured, in which the last poppy was placed in the moat at the Tower and the Last Post was played . The General led the ceremony, pictured, in which the last poppy was placed in the moat at the Tower and the Last Post was played . Smoke from a gun salute was seen behind crowds at the service this morning at the completed Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red . Four Beefeaters led out the small VIP party representing every strand of this installation, officially known as Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red. They included the two visionaries behind it. There was Paul Cummins, the ceramic artist who came up with the idea of the poppies, borrowed £1million to get them started and lost a finger producing them. He was accompanied by Tom Piper, the theatre designer who brought them to life and devised dramatic flourishes such as ‘The Wave’, a surge of poppies over the drawbridge, and ‘The Weeping Window’, the torrent of red gushing from the ramparts. A yeoman warder looked across the poppies before the ceremony took place, attended by tens of thousands from around the world . All 888,246 poppies have now been planted in the dry 16-acre moat, heralding the completion of the poignant memorial . Both are thrilled that these separate structures have now been bought by the Government and will tour the country before enjoying a permanent home at the Imperial War Museums. ‘The best thing has been all the camaraderie,’ said Mr Cummins. For Mr Piper, the most moving moment was being asked to read the names at a twilight Roll Call and learning of a great uncle killed in 1918. He has already moved on to new projects, but he will never forget what he admits is ‘probably the triumph of my life’ at the Tower. On the walkways overlooking the ‘Seas of Red’, there was still no end to the sea of humanity wanting a look last night, by which the official number of spectators had exceeded five million. Wherever these poppies end up, every single one will not only be a reminder of a life lost – but also of the stunning way in which, a century later, they were all commemorated.","The final poppy - the 888,246th - was planted at the Tower of London by cadet Harry Hayes, 13, yesterday .

"In years to come Per Mertesacker will tell his grandchildren about the three minutes he played for Germany in the World Cup final against Lionel Messi’s Argentina, not the 120 minutes he played for Arsenal in the FA Cup final against George Boyd’s Hull. And so it is time for Arsene Wenger to seriously deliver at the Emirates. Alexis Sanchez – all of sudden he’s gone from being the one who doesn’t quite fit in at Barcelona to the man who will make Arsenal world beaters. VIDEO Scroll down to see the first shots of Alexis Sanchez in an Arsenal kit . World Cup Gunners: Arsenal stars Per Mertesacker, Lukas Podolski, and Mesut Ozil celebrate Germany's win . Never going to let you go: Podolski celebrates with the World Cup after Germany beat Argentina . It’s an amazing transformation. It happened last summer, too. Mesut Ozil went from being the lazy one at Real Madrid to the ‘new Bergkamp’ at Arsenal. The FA Cup gave the fans a great day out, but seeing Arsenal players win the World Cup is a reality check for Gooners who are letting Wenger get away with it. After waiting all this time they should demand more. And in fairness to Gooners they do want more. In fact they are so desperate for more, they have hijacked Germany’s World Cup success as some sort of trophy for Arsenal. Ozil had a decent game in the final but in the words of German legend Paul Breitner was ‘walking’ through the World Cup before that. Mertesacker came on for the last few minutes of the final but Germany only started to look like serious contenders after he was dropped before the quarter final against France. And Lukas Podolski is Arsenal’s version of John Terry. He put the kit on for the celebrations and wouldn’t let go of the World Cup. Landing the big one: Ozil celebrates with the World Cup trophy . Blue is not the colour: Andre Schurrle celebrates with Mats Hummels - but no Chelsea fans are claiming credit for the win . The reality is that a Chelsea player, Andre Schurrle, was more influential for Germany than the three Gooners combined. Yet I don’t hear Chelsea fans trying to claim they won the World Cup. Probably because they aren’t so desperate to claim any kind of football success as Arsenal supporters are. So with Ozil a year into his Arsenal career, Aaron Ramsey fully fit and firing, Sanchez having arrived, as well as Mathieu Debuchy. World class or misfit? Arsenal signed former Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez . Set to join: Sami Khedira could be on his way to Arsenal, as could Newcastle defender Mathieu Debuchy . And talk of Sami Khedira (absolutely nothing stopping Wenger signing the Real Madrid man) on his way, what should Arsenal be aiming for? Wenger has had 18 years at the club and his job is under no threat whatsoever. That kind of stability should give the Gunners an advantage. He is now being allowed to spend serious money. So do Arsenal fans have the balls to set Wenger a target and judge him by it? Would you be happy with the FA Cup and fourth place next year? I hope not. Time to do more: Arsenal must win more than the FA Cup to be considered a sucess . VIDEO One trophy not enough - Arteta . Step up: Arsene Wenger celebrates winning the FA Cup but he must target the Premier League . Arsenal are bigger than that, and they now have players who are too big for that. A real target, something to make the manager earn his money (it seems all he has to do is sign a player and Arsenal fans forgive him the barren years these days), is to win either the Premier League title, or the Champions League. Gooners should settle for no less with the prices they pay, and the patience they’ve shown. Having World Cup winners in the dressing room will lend true perspective on Wenger’s last 10 seasons without a title, and his whole career without any European success. With his years of experience, no pressure of the sack, and money to spend, now is the time for Wenger to show us he has still got it.","Arsenal wrong to claim World Cup victory as theirs just because Per Mertesacker, Lukas Podolski, and Mesut Ozil were in Germany squad .

"Man with a plan: Iain Duncan Smith arrives at Number 10 for a Cabinet meeting. A think tank said today his benefit reforms will work . Iain Duncan Smith’s plan to  persuade millions of people that working is more lucrative than living on benefits could succeed, Britain’s leading economic think tank said today. Reforms will widen the gap between wages and the income of people living on handouts, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. It added in its report that tax increases, benefit cuts and Mr Duncan Smith’s Universal Credit system ‘will strengthen people’s incentives to work’. A week ago the National Audit Office condemned Universal Credit as ‘badly managed and over ambitious’. But yesterday’s report vindicated the reforms. The report said the complex changes will give the workless reason to seek a job and encourage those in jobs to work harder for promotions and pay rises. Economists Stuart Adam and James Browne said tax increases and benefit cuts will swallow more than £33million a year from incomes by 2015, hitting those on benefits harder than workers. Mr Adam said: ‘The Government’s welfare reforms strengthen financial incentives to be in work, on average, more than offsetting the weakening caused by falling real wages.’ However, he cautioned that ‘there is a huge amount of variation in these effects, with large numbers of people seeing big rises or big falls in effective tax rates. ‘Changes in non-financial work incentives and in the perception of how the tax and benefit system works are also likely to be important, and are much harder to quantify. The overall effects of these changes on behaviour remains to be seen.’ The report said that Chancellor George Osborne’s changes to personal taxation will mean that taxpayers will have to hand over an extra £11 billion a year to the Treasury. Cuts in benefits - including tax credit restrictions, cuts in Child Benefit, and the ‘bedroom tax’ reduction in Housing Benefit for those in bigger homes - will amount to £22 billion, it found. The third major influence will be Universal Credit, already in operation in test areas, which will cost the Treasury roughly the same as the present cost of the six different benefits it is to replace. The overall effect, the IFS said, will be to reduce the average replacement rate, the difference between someone’s income on benefits and their income in work, by 3.4 per cent. Without the reform the figure would have gone up by 1.7 points, stripping income from people who work while making it more worthwhile to live on benefits. Making work pay: The report said the complex changes will give the workless reason to seek a job and encourage those in jobs to work harder for promotions and pay rises . Mr Duncan Smith’s Universal Credit will give incentives to workless couples to get one person into a job, will help one-earner families more than two earner-families, and will give 1.5 million people who currently have little incentive to work income gains if they get jobs. The report said: ‘Benefit changes other than Universal Credit are responsible for the bulk of the strengthening of incentives to be in work. ‘But the effect is less dramatic than might be expected given the scale of the cuts. Incentives are strengthened much less for those with children than those without children.’ A spokesman for Mr Duncan Smith’s Department for Work and Pensions said: ‘We are pleased that the IFS find that our welfare reforms will support people into work. ‘Universal Credit will further increase work incentives, especially for those held back the most by the current system, and this will benefit families and the economy.’ David Cameron last night suggested the full roll-out of Universal Credit could be delayed from its 2017 deadline after the criticisms it received from the National Audit Office last week.","Institute for Fiscal Studies backs the complicated benefits reforms .

"Andy Peppers (a pseudonym) decided to squeeze a spot on his back that had been there for 20 years, after it became red, sore and covered in whiteheads . This is the revolting moment a man squeezes a spot on the back of his neck for the first time in 20 years. Not for the squeamish, the video shows a torrent of white pus that had been blocked under the skin for two decades before being released. However the Canadian man it belongs claims the process was not painful - and actually relieved the pressure in the spot. Going under the pseudonym of Andy Peppers, he told MailOnline the spot finally became problematic while he and his wife were travelling through Laos, in south-east Asia. He said: 'The lump started to grow and it got to the point that it hurt for me just to tilt my head back because of all the pressure. 'But we were in Laos, so we were quite apprehensive about going to any medical clinic - especially since we likely wouldn't be able to communicate with anyone. 'Then the lump started to form white-heads. Many, many white-heads. 'Our frantic online research had us more or less convinced that this was basically a gigantic zit. 'We realised we needed to get this thing to ""release"".' Desperate to get rid of the pain, he asked wife to direct his hands where to squeeze, and she decided filmed the event so he could see it. Mr Peppers explained: 'We got some gauze and alcohol and band-aids - a random assortment of normal first-aid stuff. The video, which Mr Peppers uploaded to Youtube, shows a painful looking open wound at the centre of a big lump, with red and inflamed skin surrounding it. As his wife has just unblocked the pore with a pin, at first only clear liquid and blood is seen dripping out. 'At first, my wife used a pin to start a hole,' he explained. 'Initially just a narrow stream of ""stuff"" came out, but the lump didn't really get any smaller. 'Then, some of the multiple white-heads started to release.' Mr Peppers squeezes with his fingers and a small amount of white pus becomes visible, coming through from two whiteheads. As he applies more pressure, reams of white pus come shooting out suddenly, mixed with blood and oil. After a long chain of pus is released, it seemed there was no more. Click below for video  - WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Appearing on the Oprah Winfrey show recently, Dr Mehmet Oz said the technique many of us adopt - pressing the healthy skin around the spot - actually damages it. 'The best way to pop a spot is to rip upwards' Instead, he advises using a needle cleaned with alcohol. This should be placed  parallel to the skin - rather like you would skewer something - and pierce the skin from one side to another. 'Then, rip UP,' Dr Oz advises. 'You only want to hit the white part of the pimple - because that bit is already dead,' he said. Here, there is no sensation, but if you jab the needle in front ways, you will soon hit a part of the spot that isn't dead - and that will hurt. The parallel technique also won't cause any damage to the surrounding, healthy skin, he said. But an extra squeeze pushed out another snake-like amount of the white stuff, which curls into a sticky ball. Mr Peppers, from Toronto, Canada, was left with a pea-sized amount of white pus, attached to his spot. Pus in a white head is  formed of oil, dead cells, and bacteria. Whiteheads form when the pores of the skin become clogged with oil and dead skin cells, forming a 'lid'. The pore's oil secretions build up behind the blockage. Bacteria that live in the pore feed of the secretions and grow, stimulating the body to send immune cells. This is why the area around the spot is red and inflamed, as the immune system tries to kill the bacteria and heal the tissue. Mr Peppers said the act of squeezing released pressure which made the lump less painful. ‘I definitely felt the pressure go way down, and it felt way better,’ he said. ‘And it didn't hurt while I was popping it - it just felt like pressure releasing. ‘Once a significant amount of stuff had come out, it felt way better, and soon stopped hurting altogether.’ He added that he and his wife carried out these spot-squeezing sessions two or three times a day for nearly a week – draining more pus each time. ‘Each time stuff would come out. Sometimes a lot - like A LOT,’ he said. Although he still has the lump, it is barely noticeable now, he added. Mr Peppers asked his wife to unblock the pore with a pin, and as he squeezed white pus slowly came out . More and more white pus was ejected as he applied pressure, and eventually a long chain of the substance was ejected, which curled into a ball . Mr Peppers was left with a pea-sized amount of pus on his face. He said he and his wife squeezed the spot two or three times a day for a nearly a week - draining more pus each time .","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Former New York governor Eliot Spitzer  given an estimated $50million from his father's estate - plus $6million his brother and sister missed out on . Former New York governor Eliot Spitzer is in line for $6million more than either of his siblings after the details of his father's will were revealed. Real estate tycoon Bernard Spitzer, who owned a string of luxury apartments around Central Park, died at the age of 90 earlier this month after a long battle with Parkinsons. He left 10 per cent of his $500million fortune to each of his three children including son Daniel, 57, a neurosurgeon, and daughter Emily, 60, a lawyer. Eliot, 55, was also handed 10 per cent of the fortune, but was left an additional $6million to be paid after his mother Anne passes away. The remaining $250million was donated to the Bernard and A​​nne Spitzer Charitable trust, the New York Daily News reports. Eliot and Anne have also been handed control of the family business, Spitzer Enterprises, which Eliot had been running on behalf of his father. In his will, Bernard Spitzer wrote: 'I am mindful and take pride in the accomplishments of my children and the fact that they are established in life, in largest measure through their own talents and efforts, but as well, if in smaller measure, through the contributions of their mother and mine during our lifetime. 'It is for these reasons, and not through any lack of love for them, that I have left a substantial portion of my estate to the Bernard and A​​nne Spitzer Charitable trust.' But despite Mr Spitzer's assertions, this is not the first time that Eliot has benefited from his father's business empire. Spitzer senior lent his son $4.3million in 1994 in his failed bid to become Attorney General of New York, a post he later won in 1998. Eliot also stayed rent-free in one of his father's apartments, and earned hundreds of thousands of dollars a year managing his father's investments, according to Bloomberg. According to Mr Spitzer's will, all debts owed to him by his children have been written off. While the reasons for Bernard Spitzer's decision were not made clear, the money will come in useful for Eliot as he is facing a $7.6million divorce settlement after splitting from wife Silda (left) in April . Eliot, whose own wealth is estimated to be around $46million, made a brief foray into the world of politics, becoming Democratic governor of New York late in 2006. However he was forced to quit in disgrace just 14 months later after he was revealed to be infamous Client No.9 of the Emperors Club VIP call-girl ring. While his wife, Silda, stood by him through that scandal, their 26-year marriage was ended after he was snapped going into the apartment of his publicist and girlfriend Lis Smith. Silda and Eliot announced their split on Christmas eve 2013 after pictures of him sneaking around were printed in local papers, and  terms  in April - leaving Eliot with a $7.6million bill. As part of the 'post-nuptial' Silda will receive a new car 'no more than every five years', a housekeeper and accountant, unspecified 'entertainment and activities expenses', a $100,000-per-year charity donation and a part-time assistant. Eliot (pictured with Bernard in 2009) has benefited from his father's estate before. In 1994, Eliot was loaned $4.3million to help finance a failed bid to become New York Attorney General . Bernard Spitzer was the son of Austrian Jewish immigrants and grew up in Manhattan before building a property empire including luxury apartments around Central Park (pictured, the Spitzer home on 5th Avenue) Spitzer senior was born in 1924 in New York as the son of Austrian Jewish immigrants and grew up on Manhattan’s impoverished Lower East Side. He earned a degree in engineering, which he later admitted he found 'deadly dull', before serving as a Navy intelligence officer during the Second World War. After the war finished he went into real estate,  helping create buildings such as The Crown at 730 Fifth Avenue and The Corinthian at 330 E. 38th Street. Through his charitable trust he helped to found the Museum of Jewish Heritage, and gave $15 million to New York’s American Museum of Natural History for the Hall of Human Origins.","Bernard Spitzer, 90, died earlier this month after battle with Parkinson's .

"Simon Burgess of Bristol University said White British students may benefit from larger numbers of students from ethnic minorities . Cities with large numbers of immigrant children produce better GCSE results than the rest of the country because pupils work harder, a study found today. White British pupils make slower progress than pupils from ethnic minorities who tend to be more ambitious and committed to education, according to researchers. Cities such as London and Birmingham boast strong academic records because they have high concentrations of ethnic minority pupils. Bristol University researchers said the children of immigrants tended to ‘have greater hopes and expectations of education’ and were ‘more likely to be engaged with their school work’. The findings follow claims that British firms are forced to hire foreign staff because workers here are too lazy. A Hungarian company suggested that British workers were not prepared to stand in a factory for eight to 12 hours and find it easier to live on benefits. The firm is recruiting staff from Eastern Europe to work for sandwich maker Greencore Group - which supplies Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Asda - because it cannot find locals willing to do the work. The new study aimed to investigate the reasons for rapidly improving GCSE grades at London schools – known as the ‘London effect’. Politicians of all stripes have leapt on the trend as evidence for the success of a range of education policies. But the research found that the success of London’s schools can be explained by its diverse ethnic population. White British pupils – who make slower progress than ethnic minority peers – make up just 36 per cent of 15-year-olds in London compared to 84 per cent in the rest of England. Prof Burgess said that students from ethnic minorities score higher than white British pupils, file picture . Professor Simon Burgess, who carried out the research, said: ‘We know that ethnic minority pupils score more highly in GCSEs relative to their prior attainment than white British pupils. ‘London simply has a lot more of these high-achieving pupils and so has a higher average GCSE score than the rest of the country.’ The research shows that pupils in London schools score about eight GCSE points more than those in the rest of England after taking into account their attainment at age 11. This means achieving eight Cs rather than eight Ds or eight As rather than eight Bs. Although less widely heralded, schools in Birmingham also perform particularly well, the research found. Professor Burgess added: ‘My interpretation of these results leads to a focus on pupil aspiration, ambition and engagement. ‘There is nothing inherently different in the ability of pupils from different ethnic backgrounds, but the children of relatively recent immigrants typically have greater hopes and expectations of education, and are, on average, more likely to be engaged with their school work.’ His report said: ‘The main point to take is that… being a recent immigrant or being of non-white British ethnicity has a very substantial positive effect on progress through school.’ It added said than many pupils from immigrant families ‘typically live in more disadvantaged neighbourhoods’. ‘Their advantages must be less material than books, educational visits and computers,’ the paper said. ‘It is argued that ethnic minority pupils have greater ambition, aspiration and work harder in school.’ Professor Burgess also speculated that the success of high-achieving ethnic minority pupils may rub off on white British pupils in areas such as London. Schools in London and Birmingham were found to be less segregated along race lines than some other cities such as Manchester. ‘London has a right to be pleased with itself in terms of the excellent GCSE performance of its pupils. These results help to explain the London Effect but they do not explain it away,’ said Professor Burgess. ‘The London Effect is a very positive thing, and much of the praise for this should be given to the pupils and parents of London for creating a successful multi-ethnic school system.’ He added: ‘Multi-ethnic school systems can be very productive, allowing the ethnic minority pupils to achieve the grades they seek, and (potentially) raising the scores of white British pupils as well. ‘In parts of England where there simply isn’t a large community of recent immigrants, a focus on how to encourage pupils’ engagement with school, hard work and aspiration may pay strong dividends.’","Schools in London and Birmingham have good results due to minority pupils .

The Hindenburg Line (Siegfriedstellung) was a German defensive position built during the winter of 1916-1917 from Arras to Laffaux.  The last and the strongest of the German Army's defence lines, it consisted of three well-defended trench systems. May 1917 saw the second Battle of Bullecourt, a continuation of the British spring offensive north and south of Arras that aimed to support a major French attack further south. The French attacked on 15 April 1917 but when the attack failed, the British and French leaders agreed to continue the operation, which was a joint British and Australian attack on the Hindenburg Line around Bullecourt. The attack began in the early hours of 3 May 1917, and the Australians in particular suffered heavy casualties as a result of machine gun fire over the next few days. On 6 May, the Germans launched their sixth counter-attack, but an astonishing display of bravery in which Corporal George Julian Howell ran along the top of the trenches bombarding the enemy with hand grenades pushed the Germans back.  (Cpl Howell later received the Victoria Cross in person from King George V for his bravery). The following day, the British seized part of Bullecourt, and on 15 May the Germans launched a final counter-attack, in which the British soldiers buried yesterday are believed to have died. The Australians fought the counter-attack off, and by 17 May, all the ruins of Bullecourt were in Allied hands . But the victory came at great cost, particularly to the Australians who were said to have lost more than 7,000 men for a 'small, tactically useless, village'.","Remains of Lt John Harold Pritchard and Pte Christopher Douglas Elphick interred in north France .

Pironkova, who is much better known for her grass-court exploits, broke the Sharapova serve in the opening game and held onto her lead until 4-2. But Sharapova began to exert more and more pressure and forced a first set point in the 10th game only to net a backhand. Colour clash: Sharapova reveals some orange shorts underneath her pink dress . Two more quickly arrived, though, and, after missing a backhand on the first, she profited from a large slice of luck when another backhand hit the top of the net and dropped over . The second set was much more comfortable for Sharapova, who won the final four games, shrugging off a time violation in the penultimate one. Stosur is playing with stitches in her leg after an accident in the gym but has breezed through both her matches so far. She and Sharapova have met 15 times before, with the Russian winning 13, including on clay in Madrid three weeks ago.

"A litter of newborn African Wild Dogs whose mother was deemed unfit to care for them has gotten some help from a very unlikely source. Lilly, a golden retriever, is now a surrogate mother to  the pups, who were born at the Oklahoma City Zoo. Lilly, who gave birth to her own puppy recently, is not only helping by feeding the pups, but also teaching them social skills. Scroll down for video . Meet your new mom: Lilly, a golden retriever, is the new surrogate for a litter of African Wild Dogs at the Oklahoma City Zoo . Getting cozy: Lilly had just had a puppy of her own, so is able to feed and help socialize the newborns . Lucky guys: The newborn pups, two female and one male, were in trouble when their mother proved to have no maternal instincts . 'Even though Lilly’s not an African wild dog, she’s still much better suited to surrogate for our pups than humans would be,' zoo veterinarian Jennifer D’Agostino told News on 6. 'This is a positive for both Lilly’s offspring and the African wild dogs, as they will benefit from initial socialization with a canine species.' Lilly is a retired search and rescue dog that the zoo found after an exhaustive search. who lives in Wichita, Kansas. The puppies, two female and one male, were born on Friday, but their mother, Xena, showed a lack of maternal care. Bath time: Lilly cleans the pups as she enters a cage at the zoo . Feeding time: Lilly cares for her own puppy while caring for the African Wild Dogs, even nursing them together . 'In preparation for this birth, we have been monitoring Xena 24/7 by video. We know that she is an unproven mother and wanted to be ready to intervene if necessary,' said Laura Bottaro, animal curator. 'We are hopeful that these dogs will thrive in Lilly's care and when they reach an appropriate age for socialization we will be able to successfully reintroduce them to their pack.' Important birth: The African Wild Dogs are incredibly valued by the zoo as their population has decreased drastically over the past few years, with less than 7,000 adults . The staff at the zoo is very excited for the new pups as the number African Wild Dogs in the world have been decreasing drastically over the years, and the zoo has not had any newborns since 1997. Currently, there are less than 7,000 adult dogs, with their population declining as a result of disease and loss of habitat.","A litter of African Wild Dogs born at the Oklahoma City Zoo were in need of a surrogate mother when their own mother showed no maternal instincts .

"England centre Kyle Eastmond has been cleared to play in Saturday's QBE International against South Africa at Twickenham after recovering from illness. Eastmond had been troubled by diarrhoea since the 24-21 defeat by New Zealand but took a full part in Tuesday morning's training session, as did wing Semesa Rokoduguni who has recovered from a hip problem. 'Kyle was a bit ill but he's fully fit now. Rokoduguni trained as well and seems to be all right,' attacking skills coach Mike Catt said.

Head coach Stuart Lancaster was ready to move Owen Farrell to inside centre and select George Ford at fly-half if Eastmond failed to recover in time for the second of England's four autumn internationals. Catt believes Farrell and Ford would work well in tandem, but insists Eastmond performed well against New Zealand and will be given another chance on Saturday. 'At the moment Kyle is doing all right alongside Owen,' Catt said. 'Kyle got some good hits in against New Zealand. He looked confident and we expect a big performance this weekend too. 'Picking Owen and George would mean two ball-playing fly-halves in the team. 'From my experiences of playing with Jonny Wilkinson, it works if you want to play a particular game. 'They are both still very young and the beauty about those two is that it's all about the team. It is not about them as individuals. 'They have one hell of a relationship, but we will obviously address it when it needs to be addressed. 'If picking them is what's best for the team, then I am sure Stuart will do it.'

The tourists lost 29-15 to Ireland in Dublin on Saturday and Catt said: 'They are playing a lot more expansively. Their centres are very physical as usual, but they also come from depth. 'Pollard has come through from the under-20s and has been exceptional. He has burst on to the international scene and has a very good kicking game. 'Ireland seemed to close them down a little bit on certain occasions on Saturday, but you have got to stop the big green machine rolling.

"Establishing a nation can be thirsty work, so no one would begrudge America's Founding Fathers raising a glass or two once the job was done. But at a time when the tavern was as important a part of daily life as church, quite how many glasses they would have considered an appropriate celebration has until now remained unclear. New research has revealed that America's early colonialists drank an average of six gallons of pure alcohol every year - almost three times more than their modern American ancestors. Indeed, the Founding Fathers were such heavy drinkers that, in the 18th century, there were more taverns per capita than any other business in the country. High times: John Greenwood's Sea Captains Carousing in Surinam of circa 1758 depicts a drunken scene featuring various prominent Rhode Island merchants, including Declaration of Independence signatory Stephen Hopkins, Governor Joseph Wanton, Admiral Esek Hopkins, and Governor Nicholas Cooke . And, in news that may come as little surprise to many, drinking as a social pastime was inspired by none other than the British. The revelation is a far cry from modern American drinking culture, which is today one of the most restrained in the developed world. According to Kristen D. Burton, of the University of Texas at Arlington, English settlers who had crossed the Atlantic laden with hopes, dreams and barrel-loads of booze inspired Americans to imbibe more beer and spirits with a habit for starting each new round with a hearty toast. ""The Drunkard's Progress (anonymous, 1846): By the early nineteenth century, the culture of heavy drinking in North America had given rise to a home-grown temperance movement . Phd student Ms Burton says that . 'drinking healths' was a uniquely English custom and 'a way for English . drinkers to combine a display of respect with the consumption of . alcohol'. The U.S. has one of the lowest rates of drinking in the developed world. Research shows that average Americans drink just 9.4 litres of alcohol a year - the same as 470 pints of mild beer or 31 glasses of wine. The figure is much lower than Europe where the average British drinker sinks 1100 pints of beer each year and Russians have 1350 pints of beer and 90 bottles of vodka. But . the region also has one of the highest rates of alcohol related deaths . coming second only behind Europe. In America 31 per cent of all deaths . of 15 to 29-year-olds were alcohol related. '[It was] certainly a win-win situation for those who favored the practice', she adds. However, as the custom quickly spread through the taverns of North America, it was not met with universal approval. Burton . tells the story of Boston judge Samuel Sewall who 'encountered . frustrating resistance' when he tried to turn out a rambunctious crowd . of drinkers from a pub in 1714. 'They refused to go away,' he later wrote. '[They] said [they] were there to drink the Queen’s health, and they had many other healths to drink.' Far from heeding his protestations, the crowd soon began to make fun of Sewall, repeatedly drinking to his health in mocking jest. '[They] call’d for more drink; drank to me; I took notice of the . affront… I threatened to send some of them to prison; that did not move . them,' he added with frustration. Both his feelings and sensibilities hurt, the crestfallen judge soon soon realised his protest was useless, admitted defeat and left the pub. Burton adds: 'Not always understood, and at times criticized, ""drinking healths"" continued to remain a favorite way of passing the time in the American colonies. 'With such an appetite for intoxicating liquors, the colonists lacked no excuse for imbibing their favorite beverages, but this old English custom certainly made the act more entertaining for assembled groups like the one described by Sewall.' America the sober: The revelation is a far cry from modern American drinking culture, which is today one of the most sober in the developed world .","Research is part of a Phd thesis by Kristen D.

She told of her desire for a real Christmas tree, although her husband, Michael Pattemore, was not a fan. She added: 'He's spent years trying to put me off a real tree and we're very lucky as we live in a converted psychiatric hospital which has got a really tall ceiling. All I've ever wanted is a real tree. 'No don't make me sweep up the pine needles, oh my goodness',' she joked, mimicking Pattemore. 'Hey I'm getting one, I'm getting a real tree.

"A leading Australian barrister whose wife was found buried upside down in a park grave was sensationally acquitted of her murder today. Lloyd Rayney, 50, was found not guilty of killing his estranged wife, Corryn, 44, after she returned to their home in Perth from her weekly dance class in 2007. During the three and a half month trial which has gripped the country, the Western Australian Supreme Court heard that Mrs Rayney, a former court registrar, had made threats to destroy her husband’s career and ‘take him to the cleaners’. Scroll down for video. Freed: Speaking outside court Mr Rayney said it was 'a terrible tragedy' and  'We still don't know what happened to Corryn' The defence did not dispute that the couple’s marriage was at a crisis point, but Mr Rayney denied any knowledge of what happened to his wife the night she disappeared. He had reported her missing after he said she had failed to return from her regular American-style bootscooting class. A week later her silver saloon car was found abandoned in a Perth beachside suburb. Detectives followed a transmission fluid leak from the car to Kings Park, in the centre of Perth, where they followed a sandy track through thick scrub. Pictured together: Corryn Rayney, right, had been at her weekly American-style bootscooting class on the night she died .

It was there that they discovered a . grave with Mrs Rayney’s body buried in a diagonal position with the head . in the lowest point. Forensic experts said this positioning . would have accelerated decomposition around the head and neck which, . according to the prosecution, deliberately masked the cause of death. A . name tag from a board game called Celebrity Heads was found some 200 . yards from the grave. On one side it read ‘The Queen’, on the other . ‘Lloyd Rayney’. Detectives carried out search warrants of the couple’s home and Lloyd Rayney’s phones were tapped. Police hunt: Mrs Rayney's body was found in scrub in King's Park, central Perth . Grim find: Police discovered a grave with Mrs Rayney's body buried in a diagonal position with the head in the lowest point . Detective . Senior Sergeant Jack Lee later named Mr Rayney as the ‘primary’ and . ‘only’ suspect but the defence team said the police had handled the . investigation in a single-minded and biased way. The defence lawyers even suggested that some evidence had been planted. Mr . Justice Brian Martin, QC - the judge who heard the sensational Peter . Falconio case in the Northern Territory and sentenced Bradley Murdoch to . 28 years jail for the Briton’s murder - said at the end of the Rayney . trial today that ‘I am not satisfied the accused killed the deceased.’ Sunshine city: The family lived in Perth, Western Australia . When Mr Rayney left the court there were chaotic scenes as he and his daughter were mobbed by the media. He said in a brief statement that it was concerning that the death of his wife remained unsolved. Referring to his daughters, he said: ‘It’s been five years since Sarah and Caitlyn have been without their mum. They haven’t been treated well by many people, but apart from that they still don’t know and we still don’t know, what happened to Corryn. ‘That is a terrible tragedy.’ Judge Martin said the police evidence had failed to prove the allegations beyond reasonable doubt. He said he was satisfied Mrs Rayney had died in Kings Park and there was evidence suggesting the possibility of a sexually motivated attack.","Mr Lloyd Rayney, 50, found not guilty of killing his estranged wife, Corryn .

"It promised to be a clash of the titans, the bare-chested black belt from Russia versus Australia's boxer-in-chief who is as likely to be seen surfing as in Canberra. But when Vladimir Putin and Tony Abbott nearly met on the first day of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in Beijing there was a disappointing lack of aggravation - and certainly no shirtfronting. The nearest thing to any perceived slight was Mr Abbott's rather awkward stance as he twisted away from the Moscow hardman at an official photocall. And there was no doubt that the most controversial element of the traditional 'family photo' was the outfits. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Russian President Vladimir Putin posed for an official photo with other leaders at the APEC summit on Monday . No shirt-fronting yet!: Despite standing just behind the Russian leader, Abbott avoided confrontation with Mr Putin . The two men looked calm and relaxed as they greeted and posed with 19 other world leaders during an official photo-call while dressed in traditional Chinese tunics in Beijing . Many were quick to point out that the 21 delegates, clad in Chinese tunics, bore an uncanny resemblance to the cast of Star Trek rather than a group of world leaders about to embark on a gruelling round of diplomacy. 'Obama wearing Star Trek jacket in China? Someone please beam him up,' wrote Steve Miller on Twitter. Jami_USA added: 'Is this a new Star Trek Episode?' However, AFP journalist Katy Lee pointed out that the APEC has a 'rich tradition' in dressing its members traditional clothing of the country holding the summit. 'Important to remember Obama's suit is part of rich tradition of flamboyant APEC fashion. See Kerry, 2013,' she wrote, referring to the Balinese 'endek' woven shirt worn by Secretary of State John Kerry and leaders attending the summit in Indonesia last year. Mr Abbott was welcomed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan after arriving for the summit at the Beijing National Aquatics Center in the Chinese capital on November 10 . Vladimir Putin meets with Chinese president Xi Jinping . Which one do you use? The world leaders compare smartphones . Earlier the same day, Mr Putin didn't look too nervous about a confrontation with the Australian PM when he was spotted shaking hands, smiling for photos and even comparing phones with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,  China's president Xi Jinping and  Chilean President Veronica Michelle Bachelet Jeria. Mr Abbott last night touched down in China's capital after promising 'very robust' talks with Mr Putin. 'The conversation will be, as I have said, about our absolute expectation that Russia will be as good as its word, that it will fully cooperate with the investigations that are under way and that it will do what it can to ensure that justice is done,' Mr Abbott said on Saturday. Cool as a cucumber: Putin rubs shoulders with Chile president Veronica Michelle Bachelet Jeria (left) and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe (right) Prime Minister Tony Abbott  is escorted by Australian Ambassador to China Frances Adamson upon his arrival at Beijing's airport on Sunday night . 'This is not an issue which Russia now expects to be forgotten, that this is not an atrocity which Russia thinks can be swept under the carpet'. 'Australians turned (to us) with an official request for a meeting during an APEC summit and we are agreeing to such a meeting in China,' Putin's top foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov said. 'It will be short,' he added. Abbott is in China to attend the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 2014 Summit being held in Beijing from 5 to 11 November .

The Prime Minister grabbed global headlines after threatening to 'shirtfront' the Russian president but has since toned down his language.

Mr Abbott waves as he boards the plane to Beijing to attend APEC from Canberra on Sunday . Arriving in Beijing on Friday, Mr Abbot is expected to discuss and sign a free-trade agreement with other APEC leaders during the summit . After consulting with other G20 members, Mr Abbott confirmed Mr Putin would not be banned from the economic leaders' summit next week. Mr Abbott said as the G20 is an international organisation which works on consensus, Australia does not have the right to bar any member from attending. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the shirtfront comment went too far. Tough questions need to be asked during Tony Abbott's showdown with Russian President Vladimir Putin . Mr Abbott grabbed global headlines after pledging to 'shirtfront' Mr Putin during the G20 leader meeting . Mr Abbott has flagged a 'robust conversation' and wants Mr Putin to guarantee he's doing everything possible to help investigations . 'In some ways that weakened our legitimate outrage,' he told ABC TV on Sunday. He hopes Mr Abbott uses the meeting as an opportunity to get to the bottom of what happened. 'Putin's not going to tell us the truth,' he said. 'But Tony Abbott has to at least ask.' Fireworks explode in the sky over the Olympic Park in Beijing as the APEC Leaders' conference gets under way . Leaders were treated to an elaborate display on Monday night ahead of another day of talks on Tuesday . The APEC summit marks the beginning of a whirlwind week of diplomacy for Mr Abbott . Australia should be lobbying for peace in Ukraine, as a silver lining to the 'senseless barbarity', Mr Shorten said. Recovery and investigative work at the crash site has been halted because of fighting between the government and pro-Russian separatists, despite a September ceasefire. The APEC summit, which begins on Monday and will focus on economic cooperation, marks the beginning of a whirlwind week of diplomacy for Mr Abbott, who will also visit Myanmar for Asian security talks before returning to Australia to host the G20 in Brisbane.","Vladimir Putin and Tony Abbott posed for official photos with world leaders in Beijing for APEC Summit .

"Police are chasing leads in the murder of a five-year-old girl who was shot dead while sitting on her grandfather's lap. The family of Laylah Peterson told ABC they hoped that the progress would lead to the capture of the shooter who opened fire on the family's home last Thursday. Laylah was shot dead while sitting on her grandfather's lap after a dozen bullets were fired into the Milwaukee home. One entered through the wall and struck her in the head while she sat on the couch watching TV. Laylah Peterson's family announced that her heart was  donated for transplant to save the life of another child after she was shot and killed at her Milwaukee home last week . Neighbors and strangers created a makeshift memorial for the family on the porch of their home this week in honor of the little girl . The little girl's aunt Tracy Martinez told ABC that the family was  struggling to cope with the little girl's shocking death. She said: 'It's a lot to process. Wednesday is the funeral. No one should have to bury a granddaughter or daughter at 5 years old.' The family donated Laylah's heart for transplant to save the life of another child. Neighbors and strangers have created a makeshift memorial for the family on the porch of their home in honor of the little girl. Investigators said there was no clear motive for the shooting and they needed the public's help to find those responsible. During an emotional press conference, Police Chief Edward Flynn said he would keep a photo of Laylah in his chest pocket, next to the photos of his own grandchildren, until the suspects are arrested. 'She is going to be in our hearts, like her little baby heart is going to be in somebody else's,' Chief Flynn said. 'We know that as awful as this event has been, she is going to live on and save a life.' Laylah Peterson, five, was shot and killed last Thursday when  gunmen opened fire on her Milwaukee home as she sat on her grandfather's lap . No arrests have been made in the shooting. Investigators said they don't believe anyone in the home, where Laylah was being raised by her grandparents, was being targeted. Flynn said officers were getting good tips and canvassing the neighborhood for witnesses. He urged anyone with possible information to come forward, saying 'at this point, rumors are as helpful as facts'. He said the house may have been mistakenly targeted, but that several theories were being explored. Without elaborating, he said investigators were having some success with physical evidence and were 'in a different place today than we were yesterday'. Police have said officers found a dozen casings at the scene, and were looking into whether more than one handgun was used. Emotional: Laylah's aunt Amanda Legler, Ashley Fogl and her grandmother Judy Hazard hug officers who were first to arrive at the scene of the deadly attack . United: (from left to right) Robert Peterson, father of Laylah,  aunt Tracy Martinez, grandmother Judy Hazard, and aunt Amanda Legler listen to officers speak . The chief said his officers 'are not going to rest until we find the perpetrators of this vicious crime to justice'. Laylah's relatives tearfully hugged officers during Saturday's news conference, and her aunt, Tracy Martinez, said family was especially grateful to the first officers on the scene. Family spokesman Richard Schwoegler III said Laylah's heart had been donated. He also urged faith-based organizations to take to the streets in an effort build relationships with troubled people. Flynn said so far 11 children under the age of 13 have been shot this year in Milwaukee, compared to two last year. A funeral is planned for Wednesday. A reward of up to $5,000 is being offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case. Father: Laylah's father, Robert Peterson, said he was trying to better himself so he could give his children, who were being raised by their grandparents at the time, the life they deserved . Amanda Legler, Laylah's aunt, spoke through tears in front of the Milwaukee home and demanded justice for her slain niece . Police said officers had no previous calls to the home and they don't believe anyone living there was targeted. 'We believe that this bullet read, 'To whom it may concern.' And that concerns all of us, and that should concern everybody in our community,' Capt. Aaron Raap said during a news conference on Friday. 'If you saw something, say something. If you hear something, say something.' Raap said initial descriptions of the shootings as being 'targeted' referred to the fact that all 12 bullets fired hit the house. Officers found a dozen casings at the scene, and were looking into whether more than one handgun was used. They also were interviewing witnesses and seeking any possible surveillance video. Rapp said in a conference on Friday that investigators are 'vigorously following up on leads' but officials are 'befuddled' as to the motive behind the crime, according to Fox6Now. Police Chief Edward Flynn said two young children were being raised by their grandparents in the house. 'This is a stable, loving, working family in a stable working-class neighborhood where everybody is trying to do the right thing,' Flynn said. The little girl's aunt said that Laylah was a 'wild child,' 'full of life, and the 'happiest child you'll ever meet' A funeral for five-year-old Laylah (pictured right) will be held on Wednesday, according to family members . In an interview with Fox, Laylah's father, Robert Peterson, said his daughter was his 'whole life' and described her as 'the sweetest little girl, so smart and so beautiful'. 'I've never felt this pain in my life,' Mr Peterson said. 'All I've been trying to do is better myself so one day I can take [my children] and give them the life that they deserve.' The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has offered a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case. 'There is no reason conceivable that I can think of that would explain this wanton, violent act,' Flynn told reporters Thursday night. 'We are going to find (the shooters). We are going to arrest them. And they are going to jail.' Shots: Twelve shots burst through the home Thursday at 6pm and one of the bullets pierced a wall then struck the five-year-old in the head . Reward: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has offered a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case of the shooting that took place in the child's Milwaukee home (above) Laylah's aunt Amanda Legler, spoke in front of the home saying that Laylah was a 'wild child' and 'full of life.' 'Just last week we went trick-or-treating and she told me Ti-Ti Manna, I love you more than science,' Lelger told the Journal Sentinel. 'That was just Laylah, she was so bizarre and so cute. She was just the happiest child you'll ever meet.' Laylah is the third child under age 13 whose death was considered a homicide this year in Milwaukee, Lt. Mark Stanmeyer said. But the city has seen fewer homicides this year than last, 76 compared to 93 at the same time in 2013. At this point last year, four children under 13 had been killed. Two young children were being raised by their grandparents in the house, where people left flowers, toys and other items in a makeshift memorial for the little girl .","The family of Laylah Peterson said today that police had leads in the case .

"A four-year-old boy is taking the world of golf by storm with his instinctual ability to drive, chip and putt at a level far exceeding his age. James Grimes, from Louisiana, was playing with plastic clubs before he could even walk. Now he is fast establishing himself as a golfing prodigy. After first taking on lessons at the age of two, he now practices up to six times a week and plays in competitions against eight and nine-year-old children. Scroll down for video . James Grimes takes a shot on the rough. The 4-year-old has been playing golf since he was two . James was born with a love of golf and is able to drive the ball more than 70 yards . He now plays nine hole rounds of golf twice a week and practices up to six times a week . James pictured left with a trophy he won at a junior golfing competition last month, and right, on the fairway . His mother Nicole Grimes said: 'He started with plastic clubs when he was about 15 months old. He was crawling around the house hitting the balls – even before he was walking.' Mrs Grimes and her husband James  Grimes Sr didn't think the early fascination with golf would turn into anything special, even though their son - who was still in diapers - would putt across the house losing dozens of golf balls under sofas, chairs, and TV stands. 'Right when we got him real clubs, he started teeing off balls from the tee – immediately,' Mrs Grimes said. 'He was making contact with every ball, I mean it was amazing.' When James was just two, the Grimes decided to book him for golf lessons. Mrs Grimes said: 'I contacted golf pro, Michael Watts, at Addis Springs Golf Course – where he plays. He took him out for the first time and couldn't believe how he was immediately making contact.' His instructor put a blanket out in front of him and was astounded that Baby James was able to hit every ball off the tee and make it onto the blanket – which was 50 yards away. 'He didn't know what to expect when I called him and said: ""Can you take someone this young?"" 'The first time on the course he was chipping in the air – and putting was natural for him. Michael told me that day – you really need to keep him in this!' James has had his real golf clubs for more than a year now. Poise: James Grimes, 4, teeing off during a tournament in Florida last month . James (pictured) loved playing with plastic golf clubs as a baby and would hit balls before he could even walk . James, pictured during a tournament last month (left) and at home as a toddler (right). He was born with a natural ability to hit the ball . His mother Nicole Grimes, pictured, said she will continue to take him to golf as long as he continues enjoying it . James, pictured left and right, even practices his chipping in the backyard and in his playhouse . He plays a nine hole round once or twice a week, and practices at the course 4 days a week. Mrs Grimes said: 'Honestly, James will practice 6 days a week. It's rare he will take a day off. I have to tell him, 'We're taking this day off.' James' inspiration came from professional golfers Phil Mickelson and Rory McIlroy, and said his favourite part of the game was 'chipping and putting'. Mrs Grimes added: 'His putting is what amazes everyone. He is so accurate with his aim – it is unreal. He'll chip balls in his bedroom; he just loves it.' Last month he competed in the Premier Junior Tour in Florida - although it is hard for the Grimes family to find tournaments where he can actually play against kids his own age. Karen Hannaford, co-owner of the Premier Junior Tour, said she was amazed how he struck the ball with 'no thought'. She added: 'Some kids seemed to be over-coached, where he seems to be hand-eye coordinated and just goes up and hits the ball. 'His swing seems to be more instinctive – rather than taught. Also noticeable is how well he keeps his focus given a nine hole round of golf. 'I did enjoy how relaxed his family is. They were not pressuring him. He seemed to be thoroughly enjoying himself.' Mrs Grimes said as long as James continued to have fun, she would keep bringing him to play golf, but won't pressure him.","James Grimes, 4, has been having golf lessons since he was two years' old .

"A dog needed life-saving treatment after she chewed the cap off a bottle of Baileys and drank the lot. Six-year-old German Shepherd cross Molly was found crumpled in a heap by her owners at their home in Folkestone, Kent, after she guzzled a litre of the creamy liqueur. The owners, who asked not to be named, said they had taken Molly on her morning walk before leaving her in the house for 'a short period of time'. Feeling ruff: Molly with vet nurse Andi Mills (in green) and vet Stephanie Hughes (blue) after she recovered from alcohol poisoning caused by downing an entire bottle of Baileys liqueur while her owners were out . When they returned they found Molly barely conscious and suffering fits as she struggled to breathe. At the time, Molly's owners had no idea what was wrong and rushed her to the vet, where she was put under general anaesthetic to stop any further seizures. It was only when Molly's owners returned home they found a entire one-litre bottle of Baileys - which has an ABV of 17 per cent - empty in the living room. Molly had chewed the cap of the bottle, which was full and had not previously been opened, and proceeded to glug every last drop. Vet Jane Lewis, who helped save Molly's life at Manor Vets in Folkestone, said the dog was lucky to be alive after being treated for alcohol poisoning. She said Molly was taken to a specialist unit for overnight care last Monday, the day she was admitted, and started to make a full recovery by the end of last week. Irish cream: Molly had chewed the cap of the bottle, which was full, and guzzled every last drop . She said: 'She is very lucky to have made a full recovery from her ordeal. 'Alcohol is not just toxic to humans but pets as well and sweet tasting drinks such as Baileys can be impossible to resist. 'As the festive season approaches we hope this will act as a warning to all pet owners to ensure your Christmas spirits are kept out of reach for children and animals alike. 'The next time we see alcohol toxicity we may not see such a happy ending.'","German Shepherd cross Molly, six, chewed the lid off and guzzled the lot .

"With love letters strewn across the floor, a gown hung in the bedroom, and black-and-white photos under a film of cobwebs, it looks like a scene from a fairytale. But this derelict dairy farm standing in the depths of the Welsh countryside is a real-life mystery. Dubbed the 'Red Dress Manor', it is filled to the brim with personal belongings - including a floor-length red satin dress and love letters. But there has been no sign of life within these walls for 40 years. Scroll down for video . Listed: According to documents found by photographer Dan Circa, the house in Llanymynech, near Shrewsbury, is called Calcott Hall and was Grade II* listed in 1953 . Crumpled and beautiful: The red dress pictured in a photo on the wall was found hanging in an empty wardrobe, while other clothes clutter the floor . Namesake: The woman in the red dress that has given this manor its nickname. The picture shows Ellen Jones, who appears in other images around the house . Dust: The years of dereliction are betrayed by the living room which has a thick layer of dust on the floor. Nobody knows why newspapers and notes are left scattered . The four-bedroom house, officially called Calcott Hall, in Llanymynech, Powys, Mid Wales, was grade II* listed in 1953 - more than two centuries after it was first built as a dairy farm. But according to census records, the owner, Ellen Jones, died in the early 1970s and her home became a forgotten relic within its leafy surroundings. However, her belongings have stayed exactly as she left them. Now, a series of haunting images by photographer Dan Circa has unveiled the mysterious manor, showing how generations made it their home over centuries. Magical: The eerie dairy farm, dubbed 'Red Dress Manor', has been left to crumble away for decades. It is filled with letters and pictures that seem to be unspoiled . Vintage: A rusted 1970s Morris stands in the garage by the main house. It is the kind of car that would fetch thousands at an auction today . Personal: Letters and photographs left behind in the manor show a woman named Ellen Jones lived there. Dust has gathered but the shots are clear and mystical . Ancient: The building maintains its original architecture from 1725 with heavy wood doors, stone floors, and high ceilings. Few people have visited the site since the 70s . Crumbling: Plants tumbling through ceilings, torn curtains and crumbling walls only serve to enhance the building's ethereal and timeless beauty . Life: Handbags, ribbons and clothing strewn about the house give little glimpses into the mysterious world of women that lived here years ago . Dust-covered glass bottles of 19th . century cleaning products such as turpentine and black lacquer look like . works of art in the sunshine gleaming through the cracked windows. Floral 1950s wallpaper tumbling down the walls reveal the heavy stone that was used to build the house in 1725. Now, after years of neglect, nature has moved in. Branches and leaves hang through the ceilings and soil is spilling out of the fire place on to a 1960s television. Mr Circa, 28, from Manchester said: 'I heard stories of the manor and so wanted to investigate for myself. 'The . picture of a lady in a red dress and the actual red dress still being . there was particularly intriguing. I wanted to see what else was inside. 'I felt like I was in someone’s home uninvited, I expected the owner to walk round every corner I saw. Bygone era: Delicate bottles of turpentine, black lacquer, and healing oil were the cleaning products of yesteryear. They are a far cry from today's plastic . Decades: A box of Daz alongside older cleaning products, 1950s curtains, and an 18th century wooden window frame shows how this manor was home to generations . Decorative and mysterious: Floral curtains and mis-matched floral wallpaper frame the leafy Welsh countryside through broken glass, as a lone shoe sits on the sill . 'When . I climbed the stairs to enter the main bedroom, I opened the door and . to the right there was a photo of the lady in the garment on her . dressing table with all her makeup and other personal items on it. 'I . then turned to the left and saw an open wardrobe with that red dress . hung up, it was a very eerie feeling as if someone was there. 'I . thought it was her at first glance.' Battered: The window panes are broken, the curtain is pulled across the room, and there are clothes scattered. But no sign of why or where the inhabitants went . Details: The beautiful and dolled-up Ellen Jones also passed her county examinations at the Shropshire Congretional Union, according to framed certificates . Clutter: Frames pictures lean against a typically 60s television before two small chairs with bags and pillows across the floor, and soil spilling out of the fireplace . Beautiful: It is a moment in time frozen and unspoiled. The mustard walls and art deco ornaments suggest a long history of family in the abandoned manor . Mr Circa explained his project as an exploration of 'beauty in decay': 'The lady in the red dress has been identified by census records and personal letters as Ellen Jones. 'I am documenting things that someone once cared about. 'People are amazed to see the pictures, especially when they see it's a place with personal belongings in.'

"Chelsea Clinton lives a charmed life, but don't be fooled: secretly, she's not attached to the oodles of money she and her hedge fund manager husband make each year, the former first daughter said in an interview published over the weekend. Philanthropy is her true passion, Clinton said, and that's why she permanently left Wall Street to join the Clinton Foundation, which . she runs with her parents, former first couple Bill and Hillary . Clinton. 'I was curious if I could care about [money] on . some fundamental level, and I couldn’t,' Clinton told The Telegraph. 'That wasn’t the metric of success I . wanted in my life.' Scroll down for video . Chelsea Clinton, seen here on Monday, says money isn't the 'metric of success' she wants for her life . Chelsea says she has finally found her passion in philanthropy and really doesn't care about making money . Chelsea, philanthropist, puts a Kits for Kids together with an Air Force cadet at Project C.U.R.E. in Centennial, Colo., on Sunday. The kits are basic supplies to provide parents in developing nations with the supplies  they need for their kids at home . Despite Chelsea's self-proclaimed disinterest in money-making, a report last week surfaced that she was paid $600,000 by NBC last year to do a smattering of reporting . It is not uncommon for well-known anchors to earn multiple millions per . year, but Clinton's reported annual salary is high for the frequency of . her segments. By comparison, her salary is higher than both of the last two editors of the New York Times. The . paycheck from her NBC contract has helped Chelsea and her husband Marc Mezvinsky . buy a $10.5 million apartment next to New York's Madison . Square Park . last spring. All grown up: Chelsea's wealth has allowed her to regularly dye her hair blonde and blow out her naturally frizzy hair . Politico said at the time of its report that the 34-year-old, . who is expecting her first child later this year, is now on a . month-to-month contract that would ease her departure should her mother . decide to run for president in 2016. It . later came to light that Clinton was still being paid $50,000 a month . by NBC despite the fact that she hasn't been featured since . January. NBC News has aired two stories by Chelsea . Clinton so far in 2014, both on education programs targeting the . underprivileged that were shown on Nightly News in January. The news network told the Associated Press that it does expect two completed stories to . air soon, however, and two others are in the works. NBC reportedly wanted to . avoid the appearance of a conflict by having her on the air around the . time Hillary Clinton was doing a round of media interviews about her new . book Hard Choices. In any case, Hillary has been hitting the airwaves more than her daughter. The former secretary of state has participated in TV interviews across every major network in the last three weeks, making eyebrow raising statements of her about the Clinton family's financial outlook. 'We . came out of the White House not only dead broke but in debt. We had no . money when we got there, and we struggled to piece together the . resources for mortgages for houses, for Chelsea’s education. You know, . it was not easy,' Hillary said. On Monday Chelsea sported a big chain necklace, a stack of rings on her neatly manicured hand and a  maternity pantsuit . Earning her keep: Chelsea switched from an annual to a month-to-month contract earlier this year (pictured with her mother watching over her at a function n New York City on Thursday) Thanks to eight years in the White House and lucrative speaking gigs and book deals afterward, Bill and Hillary were able to pay for Chelsea to attend Sidwell Friends private school as a teenager and Stanford and Oxford universities. After college, Chelsea experimented in management-consulting and . dabbled in her now-husband's career field of hedge fund management. She . left Wall Street in 2008 to help out with her mom's presidential . campaign, returning briefly after Hillary lost the Democratic Primary, . before determining that she would attend Columbia to get her Masters in . public health. She graduated from Columbia in the spring of 2010 and married Mezvinsky that summer. The high-profile wedding was held at the former home of millionaire businessman John Jacob Astor IV on 50 acres of land overlooking the Hudson River in Rhinebeck, New York. The wedding boasted 500 guests and was said to cost more than $3 million. Her custom-made Vera Wang dress cost approximately $25,000 alone. Clinton also began working at New York University as the Assistant Vice-Provost for the Global Network that year. She left NYU in 2011 and took a contract with NBC and a position at the Clinton Foundation, instead. In her interview with the Telegraph, . Clinton also addressed the perception that she's the beneficiary of . presidential privilege, and it is her pedigree, not her talent employers . seek. 'I will just . always work harder [than anybody else] and hopefully perform better. And . hopefully, over time, I pre-empt and erase whatever expectations people . have of me not having a good work ethic, or not being smart, or not . being motivated.' Chelsea and Marc Mezvinsky's 2010 wedding reportedly, which was held at the former home of millionaire businessman John Jacob Astor IV in Rhinebeck, New York, cost more than $3 million. Her custom-made Vera Wang wedding dress cost approximately $25,000 alone . Luxury look: Chelsea wore leather pants, a Chanel necklace and Christian Louboutin heels to an event two Thursdays ago . Clinton is the second presidential . daughter to get work at NBC; Jenna Bush Hager, daughter of George W. Bush, is a Today show correspondent. Besides . Nightly News, Clinton was hired to do stories for Brian Williams' Rock . Center newsmagazine, which has since been canceled. Much of her work . falls under the umbrella of NBC's Making a Difference stories, about . various efforts to make communities better. Bush's . daughter seems genuinely interested in being a television journalist, . while that doesn't appear to be the case with Clinton. Clinton herself told the Telegraph that she felt called to the same field as her parents despite trying 'really hard to care about things that were very . different' from them. Chelsea may even have a political career of her own ahead of her. 'I . live in a city and a state and a country where I support my elected . representatives. If at some point that weren’t the case, maybe then I’d . have to ask and answer the question for myself, and come to a different . answer,' she said. Clinton has not indicated whether she intends to keep her contact with NBC News after her baby is born.

"Authorities are investigating claims that an aspiring meteorologist shot himself dead in front of friends. Timothy Englehardt, 22, an honor student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, was killed by a gunshot wound to the head as he hung out with friends in Holly Hill, Florida on September 13. In a frantic 911 call, a female caller claims: 'My friend shot himself.' But police have said they have uncovered inconsistencies that makes them question that claim and have deemed the death suspicious, ABC News reported. Scroll down for video . Big dreams: Tim Englehardt, 22, was close to getting his dream job as a meteorologist when he suffered a single gunshot wound to the head on September 13. Police are investigating his death as suspicious . Englehardt's father William told the Eagle Tribune that at least two couples were in the home at the time of the shooting. At 6.14pm, his son texted a friend telling him to put away chicken that had been left out for a cookout - and just a minute later, at 6.15pm, police received a 911 call about a shooting. On the call, in the background, someone can be heard apparently saying: 'I did it.' The caller then tells that person: 'No, you didn't. Relax. You didn't kill him.' When police arrived on the scene, they found the gun inside the house, rather than out on the porch where he had reportedly shot himself, Holly Hill Police Chief Steven Aldrich said. Loss: He was an honor student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida . On the rise: Englehardt, pictured right, had completed an internship with WCVB in Boston over the summer . Loved: Englehardt, pictured with a friend, was also the president of his fraternity, Sigma Chi . Police have not named any suspects in the case. The 911 caller told ABC News that she is devastated but cannot comment until the investigation is over. The questions come as Englehardt's parents, Bill and Therese, say they doubt their son would ever take his life - because he had so much to live for. The top student had enjoyed a summer internship with WCVB in Boston, where he had presented the forecast, and was close to reaching his dream job back home near Boston next year, they said. He had been accepted into Sigma Chi in his freshman year and was named later president of the fraternity. His parents added that he had been himself in the days leading up to the shooting and had called his grandmother to buy him a plane ticket home for Thanksgiving. Scene: He was on the porch of this home in September when he was shot. The 911 caller told dispatchers that he had shot himself dead - but could also be heard talking to someone else who said: 'I did it' Doubts: His parents, William and Therese, say he had everything to live for and wouldn't have taken his life . He did not own a gun, his father said. 'I don't know why people thought it was a suicide,' his father told CBS Boston. 'Tim had everything in the world going for him. He never ever would have committed suicide, it wasn't in his nature.' He told the Eagle Tribune that a police officer had visited their Haverhill, Masachusetts home to break the news to them. 'The detective I spoke to told me there was something about the way Tim died that did not sit well with him,' he said. 'I told him I would wait for the investigation to be completed and he told me he will get to the bottom of this.'","Timothy Englehardt died from a gunshot wound as he hung out with friends in Florida on September 13 .

"Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has described Louis van Gaal as a high-maintenance coach with a 'huge ego'. Rummenigge hired the current Manchester United manager in 2009, and Van Gaal subsequently led Bayern to a league and cup double in his first year in charge, missing out on a treble by losing the Champions League final to Inter Milan. He was dismissed towards the end of his second season in charge with Bayern sitting fourth in the Bundesliga and already out of the DFB-Pokal, bringing to an end a relationship which had not always been easy according to the Bayern chairman. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pep enjoying life as Bayern Munich manager . Louis van Gaal issues instructions from the touchline against Crystal Palace on Saturday . Van Gaal spent just under two years at Bayern Munich, winning the Bundesliga in his debut season . Rummenigge (centre) meets the Pope earlier this month as Bayern played Roma in the Italian capital . 'As soon as he presented his autobiography in a snobby restaurant, I knew hard times were ahead,' Rummenigge told Germany's Spiegel magazine. 'Louis van Gaal was not always easy-care. He wanted to 'Vangaalise' our club. He has a huge ego.' Rummenigge did pay tribute to a 'good and successful coach', but claimed that current coach Pep Guardiola is a much better fit for the club. 'Pep's a genius,' Rummenigge said. 'He's made Bayern a bit more professional. 'He's got high expectations, but he also respects the culture of this club. He has many ideas, sometimes unusual ones, but never crazy.' Pep Guardiola is pictured on Sunday casting his vote in the non-binding vote on Catalan independence . Guardiola won the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and FIFA Club World Cup in his first season in charge, and then strengthened the squad with the signings of Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski from league rivals Borussia Dortmund. Although both transfers were controversial - the first for its timing on the eve of Dortmund's Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid and the second being one of the game's worst-kept secrets with Bayern agreeing terms with the Polish striker even before they were permitted to speak to him - Rummenigge says they did German football a favour. 'If we hadn't signed them, they would now be playing abroad somewhere,' he said. 'Both make the league attractive. 'Gotze had an incredible offer from Manchester City while Real Madrid desperately wanted Lewandowski, and would that have been better for the Bundesliga?'

"A dangerous combination of alcohol and gravity played a cruel joke on a Maine artist who fell out of a second-floor window after accidentally breaking into a flower shop while trying to prank a friend. Ronald Podlaski, 29, who goes by the moniker RookSye in Portland's art circles, said he was trying to surprise a friend Saturday by sneaking into her apartment via the fire escape. But unfortunately for Podlaski, who admittedly came up with the stunt after downing a few too many beers, he got the wrong building. Harebrained prank: Ronald Podlaski, 29, who goes by the moniker RookSye, was arrested Saturday after he accidentally broke into a Portland, Maine, flower shop thinking it was his friend's home . Instead of climbing into the apartment of Cara Taggersell, which she shares with her fiance, Podlaski found himself in the middle of Harmon's & Barton's flower shop on Congress Street Saturday night. After realizing his mistake, and getting tangled in some plants, the hapless 29-year-old tripped the alarm and fell from a second-floor window,Portland Press-Herald reported. When Podlaski came to, he found himself lying on the pavement with a pair of Portland police officers staring down at him. The artist suffered a broken wrist and was hauled off to jail, but prosecutors have decided to let him off the hook after concluding that he has learned his lesson. Podlaski has acknowledged that the nighttime escapade was a 'foolish' idea, and he now plans to apologize to the owner of the flower shop for the unwelcome visit. In an ironic twist, even if Podlaski got the right building that night, his grand gesture would have been in vain because his friend, a fencing referee, was away that week working at an international competition in El Salvador. Ironic: Podlaski was hoping to surprise his friend and former roommate, Cara Taggersell (left and right), but unbeknownst to him she was in El Salvador at the time . Portland police were dispatched to the flower shop at 584 Congress Street at around 10pm Saturday after receiving an alert indicating a possible break-in. Ron Podlaski/RookSye was picked up, literally, and jailed on charges of burglary, criminal mischief and theft. The theft count was tacked on after police spotted a candelabra hanging from the fire escape. They said the 29-year-old plummeted two stories while trying to use the fire escape as a getaway route. The 29-year-old aspiring tattoo artist said that the ill-conceived stunt was exacerbated by an unfortunate miscalculation on his part, which brought him two buildings down from where his friend Cara lives. After climbing two flights of fire-escape stairs to the third floor of 584 Congress Street, he snuck into the attic and then descended down to the second floor, where his error became immediately apparent. Instead of encountering the familiar interior of his friend's apartment, he saw mannequins used by the florist in window displays. Podlaski tried to beat a hasty retreat, but on his way downstairs he tripped the burglar alarm. Series of unfortunate events: Podlaski climbed the fire escape to the attic at 584 Congress Street in Portland, descended to the second floor and only then he realized that he broke into Harmon's and Barton's flower shop . Two peas in a pod: Podlaski and Taggersell had been roommates at one time, and according to the woman, it is not uncommon for him to hurl pebbles at the windows to draw her attention . Desperate to escape, Podlaski tried to climb out the window but stumbled and fell, landing on the sidewalk below where he was collared by police. Mr Podlaski was released from Cumberland County Jail Monday after spending the weekend cooling his heels in a cell. When Cara Taggersell heard of her friend's misadventure, she was not surprised. ‘He’s always up for a good time. Sometimes he might lack common sense about some things,’ she told the paper. The fencing referee said it was not uncommon for Podlaski, her former roommate, to hurl stones at their windows to draw her and her fiance's attention. Podlaski insisted that he was not a bad person, but rather a 'foolish young man who ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time.'","Ronald Podlaski, 29, who goes by RookSye, spent the weekend in Portland, Maine, jail after the stunt .
