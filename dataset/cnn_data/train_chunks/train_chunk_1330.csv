Citing the incident report, the newspaper reported that  Deputy John Beard fired a stun gun three times while Healey resisted arrest. Beard and another deputy, Eric Anderson, later got Healey onto the ground, used the stun gun another two times and put his legs in shackles. Healey was taken to a hospital and was put on life support after he had trouble breathing, the incident report stated. The Escambia County Sheriff's Office told The Pensacola News Journal that Healey's family took him off of life support on Monday.

"Janet Pearson, 57, is accused of planting the wire which tripped up her neighbour Kari Anderson causing her to fall down two flights of stairs . A feud between two women at an exclusive flats complex ended up in court after one of them allegedly laid a tripwire outside her neighbour’s door. Kari Anderson was sent hurtling down two flights of stairs after tripping over as she walked out of her apartment, a court heard yesterday. The 53-year-old – who suffered injuries to her face, wrist, neck and back – was left lying in a heap and weeping with pain at the bottom of the stairs. A court heard the tripwire had been purposefully placed outside her flat door by Janet Pearson, 57. When Miss Anderson came out in the dark, she failed to spot it. She said: ‘I was carrying a bin bag in one hand and an overnight bag in the other. I felt something sharp on my shin and that was the last thing I remember.’ She said she ended up ‘lying at the bottom [of the stairs], crying’ after her wrist was bent backwards in the fall. ‘I still remember the pain. I could taste blood. It was on my face and in my hair. As I walked back up the stairs, I used my phone to see what had caused me to fall. ‘I shined the light at the top of the stairs and then I saw the wire. Her door was closed on the wire to keep it in place.’ Yesterday Pearson denied assault and causing actual bodily harm when she appeared at Preston Crown Court. The jury heard the pair had been neighbours for many years in the exclusive seafront apartments of the genteel Lancashire town of Lytham. Homes on their street regularly sell for as much as £1.5million. Pearson is accused of setting up the tripwire in the block of flats in Lytham, Lancashire, where she lives . There had been minor disagreements between the pair over the years but trouble flared when Pearson moved a homeless man in with her. Miss Anderson claims he would drink heavily and stand in the hallway outside her flat smoking cigarettes, which he then stubbed out in her plant pots. Injured: Neighbour Kari Anderson, 53 . The mother of one, who has lived in the £400,000 penthouse suite with her son for 15 years, said: ‘I came home in the middle of the night and he was standing there in her dressing gown smoking a cigarette. ‘He thought it was funny to throw his cigarette butts into my flower pots so I asked him to stop. He shouted abuse at me and was very offensive so, when I told my son, he went round and told him not to do it again.’ The pair also fell out over a storage cupboard in the hall between the two flats which, Miss Anderson claimed, her neighbour was using. She said: ‘I asked her if she could take her things out of my cupboard in the hallway and she didn’t. It’s my store cupboard and I paid a lot of money to have it installed.’ The court heard the ‘tripwire’ incident happened on January 21 when Miss Anderson stepped out of her apartment. But Pearson claimed she actually stumbled over a set of Christmas fairy lights. Robert Brown, a retired judge who lives in the block, said he was aware of a lighting problem in the common hallway. He added: ‘Miss Pearson had rigged up a little lighting system of her own. It consisted of fairylights in a cluster, which she had hung on the wall just outside her door, that was fed by a plug which she had put in to her own socket just inside the door to her apartment.’ The trial continues.

"Online searches for trips to Cuba are up a staggering 95 per cent following US President Barack Obama's plans to re-develop relations between the two countries. Tourists are being warned that if they want to see 'the real Cuba' they should book their trips now, before the Caribbean country becomes 'Americanised.' President Obama announced a 'new chapter' in US relations with Cuba, with plans announced by the White House include easing access for US citizens, lessening financial restrictions, and lifting the 54-year-old trade embargo. Scroll down for video . As America have eased sanctions with Cuba, could tourism between the two countries be looked at next? Tourists are being urged to visit Cuba sooner rather than later if they want to see unadulterated local culture . And while the landmark thaw is relations signals a positive future for Cuba, travellers looking to explore the 'timewarp' nation are being urged to go now, before it changes forever. As part of resuming diplomatic relations with Cuba, the US will soon reopen an embassy in the capital of Havana and carry out high-level exchanges and visits between the governments. The US is also easing travel bans to Cuba, including for family visits, official US government business and educational activities. Tourist travel remains banned for Americans, although the relaxing of regulations have led many to believe that this could well be the next issue to be reviewed. TravelSupermarket travel expert Bob Atkinson is urging anyone who is thinking of visiting Cuba to book sooner rather than later. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Mr Atkinson said: 'It really is a unique place to visit, and once it becomes fully open to the Americans, they will without doubt pile in. 'Havana was seen as a party destination for Americans years ago, such was its close proximity to Florida. 'However you look at it, opening up to the Americans will change the way it feels and I think this will be to the detriment to the culture and heritage of the place. It is likely that with economic sanctions lifted, Cuba will change forever, in many cases for the better but there are fears it will lose some of its unique identity . Havana is famed for its colourful colonial architecture and crumbling buildings . 'I would urge anyone who is thinking of visiting Cuba to book now; there is something about Cuba that you just can't put your finger on. 'I would say go now, as you cannot be sure the culture and heritage of Cuba will remain as it is now. 'Looking at searches on December 10/11 against December 17/18, following Obama’s announcement of a new approach, searches to the destination were up 95 per cent week on week.' As one of the popular Caribbean destinations for travellers around the world, Cuba also remains one of the most affordable, and there is a good choice of flights available from the UK. Natasha Lee, head of product at letsgo2.com, added: 'Cuba is set to change now that relations with the USA are warming up. While Cubans will doubtless fiercely protect their national identity, customs and traditions - the authentic aspects of Cuba so loved by holidaymakers - change will come. 'First time visitors and those already familiar with Cuba and her charms may be best to visit now and experience the island before the pace of change speeds up.' The town of Trinidad in Cuba is one of UNESCOs World Heritage sites and offers untapped beauty . Explore, the adventure travel specialist, is encouraging customers to travel to Cuba sooner rather than later to experience the country's unique character and charm before it changes forever. Ashley Toft, managing director of Explore has travelled to Cuba on a number of occasions and has mixed emotions about the news. The Che Guevara memorial is in Santa Clara . 'On the one hand it is very evident that change will come at some stage, and that the younger generation of Cubans are waiting for that to happen. While they have excellent education and healthcare, there is still real poverty, and they lack things that we all take for granted such as a choice of goods to buy (food is mostly from ration shops) and access to the internet and to world news.' He goes on to add: 'On the other hand, part of the charm and intrigue of Cuba as a travel destination is that it is 'stuck in time', with few shops, no global brands and of course a huge number of old gas guzzling 50's American cars on the roads. 'I have no doubt that change will happen quickly once diplomatic relations start to build, and especially if congress agree to start lifting sanctions, which looks likely to happen now,' he added . 'All these things will take some time, but if you want to see Castro's Cuba before change starts to happen and I would really recommend travelling soon.' Gordon Steer, UK manager for World Expeditions, said: 'We are thrilled that this historic announcement coincides with the re-introduction of Cuba in our programme. 'Although the development does not signify any changes in the immediate future for travellers, it does open the door to major developments in the country's tourism industry and infrastructure to accommodate the increased interest and accessibility. 'Travelling to Cuba today often feels like stepping back in time – internet access is limited and slow, there are no shopping centres and department stores, all cars go back to the 1940s and 1950s, you will not find any international fast food or coffee chains and all hotels are, either fully or partly, owned or run by the Cuban state. 'But as the relations between the two countries improve, change will come. At World Expeditions, we hope that Cuba will move away from being a largely all-inclusive destination to offering more opportunities to independent and adventure travellers so they can visit more pockets of this beautiful country and enjoy more authentic experiences.' US President Barack Obama announced a shift in policy toward Cuba in an address to the nation . Licensed American travelers to Cuba will now be able to return to the US with $400 in Cuban goods, including tobacco and alcohol products worth less than $100 combined. This means the long-standing ban on importing Cuban cigars is over, although there are still limits. The US is also increasing the amount of money Americans can send to Cubans from $500 to $2,000 per quarter, or every three months. Early in his presidency, Obama allowed unlimited family visits by Cuban-Americans and removed a $1,200 annual cap on remittances. Secretary of State John Kerry is also launching a review of Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terror. Obama does not have the authority to fully lift the long-standing US economic embargo on Cuba, given that Congress enacted that policy. However, officials said he would welcome lawmakers taking that step.","Tourism travel for Americans to Cuba is still banned, but that could change .

"Accused: Christopher Sena, 47, allegedly sexually abused children for more than a decade . A father who is accused of sexually abusing children for more than a decade told victims he would kill them or break their legs if they told anyone about the assaults, it has emerged. Christopher Sena, 47, his wife, Deborah Sena, 50, and ex-wife, Terrie Sena, 43, who all lived together in a trailer in Las Vegas, are accused of abusing at least eight children over 13 years. Some victims were relatives, while Christopher Sena also encouraged his children to bring their friends over to the house so that he could abuse them, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported. He allegedly told one girl and one male victim to 'bring female friends over' and to make sure they wore bathing suits, according to the police report. Another female victim, who is now an adult, said she saw Christopher Sena take 'a number of her friends' into his office, police said. One woman who says she was sexually abused told investigators that she believes her high school friends were assaulted by Sena. Neighbors told the Review-Journal that he would seem 'excited' when his sons brought girlfriends over to the house. Others described the Sena property as the place many neighborhood kids would hang out. Christopher Sena would erect a projector screen in the yard and hold movie nights, they said. To stop his victims from speaking out about the abuse, he told at least two of them that he would kill them or break their legs if they spoke out, they told police. Arrests: He lived in a trailer with his wife Deborah Sena, 50, (left) and ex-wife, Terrie Sena, 43, (right). The women are also accused of engaging in sexual activity with children . Christopher Sena was arrested in September when Deborah, who recently split from him, another woman and a child told a family attorney about the alleged abuse. The attorney went to police, as is required by law, and a SWAT team stormed the house on September 18 to arrest Sena and seize his recording equipment. Authorities allegedly found videos showing all three adults engaging in sex acts with children, which led to the arrests of Deborah Sena and Terrie Sena last week. At least eight minors were involved and some encounters were filmed as part of a child porn operation, police said. One alleged victim told authorities that when Sena started abusing her as a child, the two women were not aware of it, but when she was 17, she was forced to engage in sexual activity with them. That victim started to strike her stomach with a piece of wood, fearful that he would fall pregnant with Sena's child, police said. Scene: After his wife told a lawyer about the abuse, Christopher Sena was arrested at their home (pictured) in September. Officers seized electronic equipment and allegedly found videos of the abuse . Some of the victims say they were abused for years; one boy said the abuse started when he was three and continued until he was a teen, while another woman said she was abused two or three times a week by Sena for more than a decade. But according to police, who called it 'one of the most horrific sex rings in memory', he was not the only one carrying out the abuse. His ex, Terrie Sena, told police she was attracted to young male and female teens, and said it was 'really enjoyable' when one of the boys started to look like Christopher Sena. But she told authorities that she later felt 'ashamed' and 'dirty'. Terrie and Christopher Sena had three sons and a daughter together before splitting in 1997. But after they split, Terrie continued to live with her ex and their children, even when he took a new wife. Authorities also allegedly found footage of Deborah Sena, who left her husband in August, involved in sexual acts with the family dog. Deborah Sena told police that there was 'fear and intimidation' involved when it came to dealing with her husband Christopher (pictured together in an old photo), whom she split from in August . Deborah says her husband said that, if she loved him, she would do what he wanted her to do . She claims her husband told her she would do what he wanted if she loved him. One of the seized recordings also allegedly shows two Sena children having sex with the family dog, The Daily Beast reported. Christopher Sena is facing 23 charges, including incest, bestiality and felony child abuse. Many of the charges carry a sentence up to life in prison. The women, who were arrested on December 11, together face 27 charges, including child abuse and neglect, sexual assault of a minor and incest. Police said they expect more charges to be brought against the trio. All three have been held without bail.","Christopher Sena, 47, his wife, Deborah Sena, 50, and his ex-wife Terrie Sena, 43, have all been accused of sexually abusing children .

"A keen gardener who poisoned her estranged sister's prized vegetables  in a  four-year  feud over the family will has been ordered to pay her £5. Gillian Leeden poured weed killer over older sister Lyndsey Glassett's Jerusalem artichokes as part of a bitter row over their late mother's estate. The 62-year-old claimed she mistook the plants for weeds when she killed them whilst her 67-year-old sister was away for the weekend on May 23. Leeden (right) claimed she had mistook her sister Lyndsey Glassett's (pictured left leaving court) plants for weeds . Leedon had previously received a police caution after setting up a website to publish 'very unpleasant comments' about her sister and her sister's family. The sisters have not been on speaking terms since 2010. The plants had been growing at the sister's home in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, where both live in a semi-detached property split into two separate maisonettes. Prosecution barrister Harry Snook told Stevenage Magistrates' Court: 'It was Lyndsey Glassett who had bought the artichokes, who planted them and who for several years had grown them in that exact spot for the pleasure she took in gardening. 'The relationship (between the sisters) was very poor. They had not spoken for a number of years and there was a good deal of ill feeling between them related to the care provided to their late mother and disputes about their mother's estate. 'That, the prosecution say, explains what we say is a quite deliberate and spiteful act to the plants she would have known we the property of her sister. 'She doesn't dispute she poured the poison on the plants. She said she believed them to be weeds rather than a desirable plant.' Leedon told the court the garden had been 'a mess' and she was simply attempting to tidy up and remove some weeds when she poisoned her sister's prize artichokes (stock picture of artichoke) 'It is difficult to imagine that anyone would think they (the plants) weren't being cultivated. Even to a layman I would suggest it was not a weed, but to someone with gardening experience, even more so. 'We know there was motive for her to act intentionally. This is someone who let a personal grudge get the better of them.' Ms Glassett told the court she had purchased the Jerusalem artichoke tubers (shrubs) for £10.95 from a garden centre approximately 18 months earlier. She said: 'They can grow up to about ten to 12 feet. I had used them in stews, soups and as vegetables, as well as giving some to friends.' But when she returned from her weekend away, she found the plants had been tampered with. She told the court: 'When I came home they were obviously dead because all of the leaves were discoloured and they weren't alive. 'I was more annoyed than anything because I was going to leave the house within weeks. If she'd waited I would have dug them up and taken them with me or she could have killed them when I'd gone.' But magistrates ruled that Leeden's actions amounted to criminal damage and she was handed a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £5 compensation to her sibling, £310 in costs and a £15 victim surcharge . Asked about her relationship with her sister, she said: 'It was non-existent. We hadn't been on speaking terms since 2010.' Ms Glassett also described her sister as 'an excellent gardener' who 'grows vegetables I haven't even heard of.' Ms Leedon, taking the stand, told the court she was attempting to tidy up the weeds from the entrance to the property, where she runs her own hair laser removal business. She said: 'The place was a mess, I wanted it tidy. I had clients there and I didn't think it looked good with them coming up to all this mess. 'There were some (weeds) covering the garden and some grasses that were six or seven inches tall. There were six or seven types of plant there and it just looked a mess.' Asked what she believed they were, she said: 'Weeds.' But magistrates ruled her actions amounted to criminal damage after hearing no evidence that the estate's executors had given permission for the weeds to be removed. Chairman of the bench Peter Sweetman said: 'We have heard from your evidence that you did damage the plants and intended to do so. 'We have been told you believed you would have got the consent of the executors to clear the plants but we have heard no evidence to support that and therefore we find your guilty of criminal damage.' Prosecutor Mr Snook asked magistrates to take into account the previous police caution when considering their sentence. He said: 'She received a police caution in 2013 for malicious communications. She had set up a website and made numerous and very unpleasant comments about her sister and her sister's family.' Leedon was handed a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £5 compensation to her sibling, £310 in costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

"Thousands of bears are being detained in minute cages for the entirety of their lives and forced to endure regular painful procedures so that their bile can be regularly harvested. At least 20,000 of the once majestic mammals are estimated to be trapped in bear bile facilities across Vietnam, Korea, China, Laos and Myanmar, according to Luke Nicholson, a regional project manager for World Animal Protection. 'They sit in metal cages that are elevated off the ground and they are denied basic animal welfare conditions,' Mr Nicholson, who has travelled to Vietnam at least five times in the last year to visit these facilities and negotiate with governments, told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . At least 20,000 bears like this one, are estimated to be trapped in bear bile facilities across Vietnam, Korea, China, Laos and Myanmar . The are mostly kept in cages no larger than a telephone booth for the entirety of their lives, fed unnatural diets and put through torturous procedures so that their bile can be regularly harvested . 'It's very hard to go back and see the same bear in that same cage and see that he's getting older and yet he's done nothing over the last few years except sit in that cage,' Luke Nicholson, a regional project manager for World Animal Protection, said . 'I've been doing this for a number of years now and it's very hard to go back and see the same bear in that same cage and see that he's getting older and yet he's done nothing over the last few years except sit in that cage. 'It's distressing. It upsets me greatly. Bile facilities are horrible places.' The bile 'farm' business revolves around the demand for bear bile, which is extracted from the animal's liver before being turned into powders, ointments and capsules. 'Bile, or Ursodeoxycholic acid, is an organic product that actually does have some pharmaceutical and therapeutic value - but nothing outside what you can achieve from a paracetamol,' Mr Nicholson said. The bile facilities, such as the one pictured, are located throughout Asia and are regulated by different laws, depending on the country . Methods of bile extraction also vary from country to country: This bear, in Vietnam, is knocked out with a strong tranquilliser each month before a large syringe or catheter is inserted deep into his gall bladder . In South Korea, where it is legal to breed bears and slaughter them at 10 years of age for the sole purpose of extracting bile, the mammals are bred and caged for their entire lives before being killed. The bile (pictured in the clear bottle) is then extracted or the gall bladder harvested . 'There's no excuse or reason why these animals should be suffering for what can be replaced by herbal and synthetic alternatives. 'The myths and traditional Asian medicinal belief is that it can be used to cure a number of ailments; hangovers are a common one in Vietnam and it has also been suggested that it can ease suffering from liver disease and damage. It's often added to things like haemorrhoid creams and it has even been called a cure all – some people believe it can cure cancer.' Aside from 'medicinal purposes', the fluid is also used for entertainment purposes, according to World Animal Protection, and is drunk to demonstrate affluence. In recent years it has also been added to various lifestyle and beauty products such as energy drinks, toothpaste and shampoo. To extract the bile, the bears are mostly subject to torturous procedures, which vary from country to country due to the different laws that are in place. The bile is used in a wide range of products. Pictured: Liquid bear bile and bile flakes that have been dried . A haemorrhoid cream that contains bear bile powder, created by drying the bile and grounding it into a powder (left) and a pharmaceutical capsule for liver function with 2.5 per cent bile (right) 'Bile, or Ursodeoxycholic acid, is an organic product that actually does have some pharmaceutical and therapeutic value - but nothing outside what you can achieve from a paracetamol,' Mr Nicholson said . In Vietnam, Mr Nicholson said it is 'legal to keep bears, but illegal to exploit them for commercial purposes' and therefore illegal to extract bile from a live bear and sell the products. However there is a lack of compliance with these laws in the country, and the most common technique of bile extraction involves knocking the bear out with a powerful tranquillizer each month before inserting a large syringe or catheter deep into the bear's gall bladder to extract the bile. In South Korea, where it is legal to breed bears and slaughter them at 10 years of age for the sole purpose of extracting bile, the mammals are bred and caged for their entire lives before being killed. The bile is then extracted or the gall bladder harvested. In China, where it is also legal to own a captive bear and extract its bile, the most common technique involves 'farmers' luring the animals into minute cages where they can barely move before piercing through the bear's abdominal wall into the gall bladder to create a permanent hole. Mr Nicholson is part of a team currently negotiating with the governments in South Korea and Vietnam to help bring an end to the industry . 'In South Korea we are actually progressing quite well. We are currently looking at property rights issues concerning those bears and compensating farmers to exit the industry - and that's looking promising,' he said . He added: 'In Vietnam we are working to progress towards improved legislation and policy so no new bears are able to enter the industry' Typical Chinese methods of bile extraction involve creating a permanent hole in the bear's abdominal wall and gall bladder which is regularly prevented from healing, causing extreme pain and medical problems . 'A steel needle is then inserted into the hole and the bile is drained at regular intervals. Alternatively a ""free dripping fistula technique"" is used whereby a tube is then passed into the gall bladder, typically twice daily, to extract the bile,' World Animal Protection explains. 'Either way the wound is painful and bile can seep back into the abdomen, causing severe infection. The hole in their abdominal wall is regularly prevented from healing - this not only causes extreme pain but can lead to inflammation, abscesses, gall bladder stones and infections.' In most of the countries, the animals spend their entire lives in cages no larger than a telephone booth and often scar themselves from repeatedly hitting themselves against the bars in frustration. Unnatural diets, including rice or vegetable gruel, as well as their constant cramped conditions, lead to agonising health problems. The organisation is working alongside the government in each of these countries to improve legislative outcome for bears.

Mr Nicholson is part of a team currently negotiating with the government in South Korea to ban the breeding of bears which he said would 'signal an end to the industry'.

We are currently looking at property rights issues concerning those bears and compensating farmers to exit the industry - and that's looking promising,' he said. 'In Vietnam we are working to progress towards improved legislation and policy so no new bears are able to enter the industry, but until we can have a quantified number of captive numbers, which we hope for by 2015, it's hard to say or indicate the end date for the industry.'

"A few days ago, the first reviews began to trickle in for the comedy The Interview, which depicts a shambolic attempt to assassinate the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Unfortunately, they were less than enthusiastic. One critic called it a ‘non-stop sledgehammer … bereft of satiric zing’, while the Hollywood industry paper Variety called it an ‘alleged satire that’s about as funny as a communist food shortage’. Even the film’s makers probably imagined that having earned back its budget from its target audience of American teenagers, their picture would soon disappear into well-deserved obscurity. Climb-down: Randall Park as North Korean tyrant Kim Jong-un in The Interview, which has been pulled from release after Sony Pictures was hacked and confidential material leaked across the Internet . Terrorists:Kim Jong-un and his wife Ri Sol-ju remembered the three year anniversary of the death of  Kim Jong-il. If North Korea was to launch a cyber attack it could bring the West to its knees in 15 minutes . How wrong they were. For it now seems certain that The Interview will go down in history not as an indictment of Hollywood’s obsession with the lowest common denominator, but as a chilling symbol of the future of international conflict. When, two days ago, the film’s parent company Sony announced it was cancelling its Christmas Day release, the decision was widely seen as an abject surrender to foreign pressure. All week, North Korean hackers have been leaking secrets found in Sony’s emails, from insider gossip about the star Angelina Jolie to the script of the next James Bond film. In an attempt to shore up wavering cinema chains who were uncertain as to whether to screen the film, Barack Obama recommended that ‘people go to the movies’. But as pressure mounted, it became clear Sony’s American bosses lacked the courage to stand up to Kim Jong-un’s cyber bullies. And when the hackers issued a terrifying warning to American audiences, telling them to ‘remember September 11, 2001’, Sony simply lost its nerve. Thus, The Interview has vanished from the schedules, and it seems unlikely it will ever return. In the meantime, Hollywood figures have been queuing up to denounce Sony’s decision as an awful setback for free speech. ‘Today, the U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished bedrock principle,’ said the director Judd Apatow. The actor Rob Lowe went further: If Sony had been in charge of the Allied war effort in World War II, he said, then the Nazis would have won. In many ways the story could hardly be a better metaphor for American foreign policy in the past few years. After almost a decade of reckless, ham-fisted over-stretch under George W. Bush — typified by this month’s appalling revelations about the CIA’s torture programme — the U.S. has turned inwards. Obama’s policy in Syria and Ukraine has been a shambles, his attitude to Russia is dithering and pusillanimous, and he seems entirely bereft of ideas about how to fight back against the jihadists of Islamic State. Lending support: Rob Lowe  said that if Sony had been in charge of the Allied war effort in the Second World War then the Nazis would have won . In this context, therefore, Sony’s surrender to the North Koreans merely looks like more of the same. But I think there is another dimension to this story — one that should frighten every man, woman and child in the Western world. For years, military experts have been warning that our expectations of warfare are dangerously outmoded. We still think of war as something that happens on a foreign battlefield, fought out between professional armies with tanks and guns. But for more than a century, the front line has been moving closer and closer to the ordinary British household. From the horrors of the Blitz to the pub bombings of the IRA, our illusions of living in an island fortress have been brutally dispelled. Cyber warfare is merely the latest frightening development in the history of human conflict — a threat to British society that could have potentially devastating consequences for millions of families. We cannot say, though, that we were not warned. As long ago as the spring of 2010, the former White House counter-terrorism chief Richard Clarke, who worked for the Reagan, Clinton and Bush administrations, published a book warning that the West might have lost the new cyber war before it had even officially started. As Mr Clarke pointed out, the Russians, the Chinese and the North Koreans had already recruited legions of hackers, while Iran even boasts of having the world’s largest cyber army. In his book Cyber War, he paints a petrifying scenario. If the Russians or North Koreans launch an all-out cyber attack, he suggests, then they could effectively bring Western society to its knees within just 15 minutes because we are so utterly dependent on electronics, which run everything from nuclear power stations to our bedside alarm clocks. With bugs and viruses racing through computer systems, the military and the police might be paralysed. Trains could crash, pipelines explode, the financial markets risk going into meltdown, the National Grid might crash, hospitals could fall dark, cash dispensers might go dead and ordinary life might come grinding to a halt. Last year, the People’s Liberation Army’s Shanghai-based cyber unit was caught hacking into major American corporations such as the nuclear power company Westinghouse Electric and the United States Steel Corporation. Workers remove a poster-banner for The Interview from a billboard in Hollywood, California, on Thursday after Sony announced it was cancelling the movie's Christmas release due to a terrorist threat . In Britain, the head of MI5 and the director-general of GCHQ sent a letter to the bosses of all the FTSE 350 companies stating that cyber attacks against UK companies are causing significant damage to their reputations and revenues. ‘It scares me to death,’ one military insider told the Economist. ‘The destructive potential is so great.’ It sounds like the stuff of science fiction. But all military technology sounded futuristic once, from tanks and atom bombs to drones and satellites. And some countries are already all too aware of the costs of losing a cyber war. In the spring of 2007, Russian hackers paralysed government computers in the little republic of Estonia, a member of Nato and the European Union. It was a classic example of imperialist bullying, carried out not with tanks and gunboats, but with computer worms and viruses. Seven years on, British and American military planners are still studying the Estonian attacks for clues to the future of cyber warfare. Even if you rarely use a computer, the dangers of a Russian or North Korean cyber attack can hardly be exaggerated. A future in which hospitals risk being paralysed, the railways grinding to a halt, supermarkets running out of food and police computer systems collapsing is not one to be taken lightly. Of course, the leaking of Hollywood secrets and James Bond scripts is not in the same league. But if the North Koreans can beat a giant corporation such as Sony, then who is to say they cannot take down Britain’s public services, too? As the furore over The Interview has shown, the West is clearly on the back foot. The former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, remarked this week: ‘No one should kid themselves. With the Sony collapse, America has lost its first cyber war. This is a very, very dangerous precedent.’ I think he is right. I believe the struggle over The Interview is just the start. And I suspect the shock troops in any future world war will not be blood-streaked men in battle fatigues, but pale-faced computer geeks, hunched intently over their keyboards. In the years after the fall of the Soviet Union, we in the West were too busy congratulating ourselves on our victory to grasp that a new and potentially even deadlier challenge lay ahead. Too complacent, too confident in our mastery of the old technology, we failed to realise that war itself was changing. From Moscow to Pyongyang, the West faces implacable adversaries, equipped with the new digital weapons of the 21st century. If you want to see the battlefield of the future, just look around your living room.",If the Russians or North Koreans launch an all-out cyber attack they could effectively bring Western society to its knees within just 15 minutes .
"Rev Margaret McPhee (pictured) claimed that Santa was 'make believe and not real' to a group of children at a carol concert in Stalham, Norfolk . When a curate asked primary school children at an end-of-term service what Christmas was about, she should have guessed what was coming. But after several excitedly called out ‘Father Christmas’, Rev Margaret McPhee stunned them by claiming the jolly chap in the red suit didn’t exist. She apologised for the comment immediately after the service but outraged parents are now threatening to boycott her village church, St Mary’s in Stalham, Norfolk, for ruining the magic of the season. Some have even tried to undo the damage by telling their children the married assistant priest is a ‘liar’. Furious messages posted on the internet include one from Colin and Clare Jefkins, who said: ‘Sorry my child will not attend any more church services again. ‘She would not like it if we said there was no “God”.’ Michelle Ryan added: ‘Rev McPhee has put me off taking my children to church just in case something else gets said.’ Tara Fiske wrote that both her children believe, saying: ‘They grow up far too quickly already, people shouldn’t try to make them grow up faster!!!! I had to tell my children that the vicar was a liar basically, so I could keep my children believing.’ Peppa Cuthbert complained future Christmas services had been ‘tainted’ by the outburst. ‘I think a lot of people probably felt like walking out but out of respect for the children sat in shock at what was said,’ she said. And Samantha Tisshaw described how her confused seven-year-old son asked her: ‘Mum, why did Reverend Margaret lie to us?’ The Church of England service was held on Monday for the pupils of Stalham Academy Primary School, which has 340 children aged seven to 11. The choir had just finished singing when Mrs McPhee, 49, asked the fateful question about the meaning of Christmas. When some children mentioned Santa Claus, she claimed he was ‘make-believe and not real’. The comments prompted an urgent damage limitation exercise from the wife of Stalham rector Simon Lawrence, who offered an ‘unreserved’ apology. Parents had to comfort their children, some who were as young as seven, after Rev Margaret McPhee claimed that Santa was 'make believe and not real' at a service at St Mary's Church in Stalham, Norfolk (pictured) Valerie Moore (right), chief executive at the Right for Success Trust, which runs the 341-pupil Stalham Junior School, said: 'The children were astonished, which is very sad' before adding: 'I don't like to apportion blame' Emma Lawrence said: ‘As Simon has said to those parents who have phoned or emailed us, it was a stupid, unplanned, off-the-cuff remark which Margaret is very sorry for.’ Mrs McPhee, who was previously a business lecturer at the University of East Anglia, confessed to making a ‘huge mistake’. ‘I really regret it and the upset it has caused to those who were there and whoever has since heard about it,’ she said. Norwich Diocese described Mrs McPhee as a ‘sensitive and sensible priest’. Spokesman Jan McFarlane said: ‘She knew she should not have said what she said as soon as she said it and she is trying to do everything possible to put it right.’ Valerie Moore, chief executive at the Right for Success Trust, which runs the 341-pupil school, said that she had no control over what the vicar was going to say. Miss Moore said: 'The children were astonished, which is very sad. However, the vicar made a heartfelt apology to us all. 'I don't like to apportion blame. 'I love the fact the curate took the time to understand what had happened, understand she had upset people and put it right. 'The school has a fantastic relationship with the church and we would like that to continue.' Civil servants are being urged not to use the phrase ‘Merry Christmas’ in festive messages. An email to Government staff suggested ‘Season’s Greetings’ was a more acceptable term. Officials at the Department of Energy and Climate Change were also advised not to use ‘images of skin’. The message was sent to some members of staff who wanted to know how best to compose messages in the run-up to Christmas. It stated: ‘When picking, think Season’s Greetings rather than Merry Christmas.’ The email went on: ‘As an organisation of multiple faiths and agnostics serving the same and in the interest of inclusion, I’d avoid images of skin.’ A DECC spokesman insisted the email was only sent to a small number of staff. He said: ‘There is no formal guidance about Christmas cards,’ adding that Energy Secretary Ed Davey’s email to staff featured repeated use of the word Christmas. Tory MP Ian Liddel-Grainger called the advice ‘pathetic’. He said: ‘We should be able to celebrate Christmas and recognise people have different faiths without offending anyone.’ Controversy: Father Dennis Higgins (pictured) angered parents by telling children at a mass in Derbyshire that Father Christmas did not exist . It is not the first time a vicar has been criticised for claiming that Santa is not real. Earlier this month, Father Dennis Higgins was labelled ‘plain mean’ after telling a group of schoolchildren that Father Christmas did not exist. The clergyman, who is in his 80s, was attempting to teach pupils the true meaning of Christmas while delivering mass at a school in Buxton, Derbyshire. His comments angered parents, who accused him of ruining the 'magic of Christmas'. One parent, who did not wish to be identified, said: 'How dare he say such things to such young children? 'To try and take away the magic of Christmas is just plain mean. 'It really saddens me that someone who people should respect and look up to can do something so mean.' However, members of the priest’s congregation quickly leapt to his defence, setting up a Facebook page called Support Father Higgins and posting a series of kind messages calling him an 'honest' and 'courageous' man. His support page reads: 'This page is being set up on behalf of Father Dennis Higgins who has dedicated his life to God and the Church. He has been a pillar of Buxton's community.' Father Andrew Cole, spokesman for the Catholic Diocese of Nottingham, which includes Buxton and the surrounding area, later apologised for Father Higgins' 'intemperate language'.","Children as young as seven hear shock claim during Christmas concert .

"European judges dealt a hammer blow yesterday to David Cameron’s attempts to crack down on the abuse of Britain’s visa system. Strict rules forcing foreign family members of European Union residents to get a permit before visiting the UK were scrapped by the European Court of Justice. This leaves Britain facing a fresh surge of non-EU migrants if they are related to someone living in the EU, and encourages people who want to exploit Britain’s way of life entering the country. Scroll down for video . Test case: Sean McCarthy, a dual British and Irish national who lives and works in Spain, challenged the law because his Colombian wife needs a permit to visit Britain despite  their children being British (all pictured) The ruling by the court, which interprets EU law, also makes it less likely the Prime Minister will be able to renegotiate rules on freedom of movement. Mr Cameron has pledged to end abuse by so-called ‘third country nationals’ – those from outside the EU who gain rights to live in the UK by marrying non-British EU citizens. Ministers are concerned that sham marriages to EU citizens accompanied by easy-to-obtain residence papers in some EU countries would become another back door into Britain. The ruling came in a case brought by Sean McCarthy, a dual British and Irish national who lives and works in Spain, and his wife, a Colombian. They claimed her rights to freedom of movement were being infringed because she has to obtain a ‘family permit’ visa every time she wants to travel to the UK even though she holds an EU Residence Card issued in Spain and both their children are British. Freedom of movement: The ruling is a blow to politicians' promises for tighter migration controls . Thousands of jobs will be advertised in the UK only after ministers agreed a new deal with Brussels. Under current rules, any jobs posted on the Government-run website Universal Jobmatch must also be placed on a European website, which helps would-be migrants search for work. EU countries have now agreed to allow firms to advertise domestic vacancies only in their own country. The deal could encourage more companies to recruit locally because they would have to specifically opt-in if they wanted to advertise outside the UK. Employment Minister Esther McVey said: ‘The new rules will significantly reduce the number of jobs advertised in Europe and put British residents first. We will continue to work to ensure the system remains fair to jobseekers and to businesses.’ The proposal still needs to be passed by the European Commission. Ruling in the McCarthys’ favour, the European Court said Britain was ‘not permitted’ to bar the spouse and children of an EU citizen from entering the UK without a visa. The Government had introduced the rules because it was concerned that residence permits handed out by other EU nations did not meet international security standards. The judges said Britain was able to assess documents at the border. The ruling only applies to the families of EU residents who are living in the EU outside their home nation. If, for instance, Mrs McCarthy was married to a Spanish man living in Spain, she would still need to apply for a visa. Tory MEP Timothy Kirkhope, the party’s spokesman in Brussels on justice and home affairs, criticised the judgment. ‘Britain will always be best placed to deal with its own immigration needs not a judge in Luxembourg,’ he said. Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: ‘This is yet another ECJ judgment which weakens our ability to control entry to the UK. This ruling trumps a UK immigration control designed to prevent abuse.’ A Government spokesman said: ‘The UK is disappointed. It is right to tackle the abuse of free movement rights.’","Test case was brought by Briton Sean McCarthy, who lives in Spain .

"Tragic: Bounkham (left) and Alecia Phonesavanh's (right) toddler son Bounkham Jr (center), called Bou Bou, was injured in a botched SWAT raid on a relatives home earlier this year . The parents of a toddler who was left disfigured after being hit with a stun-gun grenade in a botched drug raid while he slept in his crib are speaking out after a grand jury decided not to bring up charges in the heartbreaking case. Alecia and Bounkham Phonesavanh's youngest son Bounkham Jr, called 'Bou Bou', was just 18-months-old when a SWAT team burst through his bedroom and threw a flash-bang device at his sleeper crib, in the hunt to find a drug-dealing cousin who didn't even live there. Now, after several surgeries to address the boy's serious injuries, the family is left with over $1million in medical bills that the county has refused to pay. 'Before this we didn’t owe anybody anything,' Mrs Phonesavanh recently told ABC News. 'And now after all this, they have completely financially crippled us.' And that wasn't the only tragedy the family experienced last year. The Phonesavanhs and their four children were only in Georgia because their house in Janesville, Wisconsin burned down that spring, leaving them homeless. They moved in with Bounkham's sister in Cornelia, Georgia while looking for a new home back in Wisconsin, all crammed into the garage, converted into a bedroom. They had just found a new home and were planning to move back to Wisconsin when the SWAT raid happened in the early hours of May 28. The SWAT team was looking for Mr Phonesavanh's 30-year-old nephew Wanis Thonetheva, who an informant said was selling methamphetamine from his mother's house where the family was staying. Drug agent Nikki Autry secured the 'no-knock' warrant, which allowed her team to search the house without notifying the owners. Heartbreaking: In October, a grand jury decided not to bring up criminal charges related to the raid, which left Bou Bou with burns to his face and chest and a collapsed lung (pictured before the raid on the left, and after on the right) Scarred: Bou Bou spend five weeks in a medically-induced coma and continues to recover from his injuries. His parents say they now owe more than $1million in medical bills, which the county has refused to pay . Damage: A SWAT team was carrying out a 'no-knock' warrant to arrest Bou Bou's drug-dealer cousin the night of the accident . Wrong house: But his parents say they didn't see 30-year-old Wanis Thonetheva at the house the entire time they were staying there . Police reports show that it was Habersham Deputy Charles Long who threw the 'flash-bang' grenade that landed in Bou Bou's pack-and-play. Innocent: Little Bou Bou pictured in happier and healthier times . Mrs Phonesavanh says she immediately heard her baby start screaming, and she went to grab him but was stopped by police, with Deputy Jason Stribling stepping in to pick up the child. 'I kept telling him, ""Just give me my son. He's scared. He needs me."" The officer wouldn't. And then he walked out of the room with [Bou Bou] and I didn't see him again.' She says they wouldn't even let her see her child before taking him away in an ambulance, and only said at the time that he was fine and just lost a tooth. But Mr Phonesavanh got a clue about the real extent of his son's injuries when he  noticed a pool of blood by the baby's crib. The couple were held by police for two hours, and when they showed up at the hospital, they found Bou Bou in a serious condition with burns on his face and torso and a collapsed lung. Bou Bou was in such poor condition that doctors at Atlanta's Grady Memorial Hospital put him into a medically-induced coma for five weeks. Meanwhile, police arrested Thonetheva a few hours later without incident. He pleaded guilty to selling meth and is currently serving a 10-year sentence in Georgia prison. Mrs Phonesavanh still doesn't know why drug agents thought Thonetheva was at the home. She says while her sister-in-law feared her son had stolen things from the house, they never saw him the entire time they were living there. 'They messed up,' Mrs Phonesavanh said. 'They had a faulty search warrant. They raided the wrong house.' While her son was still healing in the hospital, both Agent Autry and the judge who signed the warrant resigned from their positions, and later the task force that organized the raid was disbanded. However, the family is now left reeling by the fact that a grand jury investigating the raid decided not to bring up criminal charges in the case, though they admitted the work was 'sloppy'. And the family hasn't received any compensation from the county since a Georgia state 'gratuity' law protects local governments from having to pay. The family still has the option to file a civil suit however,  and there is also an ongoing federal investigation. The Phonsevanh's have three other children including 7-year-old Emma, 5-year-old Mali and 3-year-old Charlie. They have set up a webpage to bring justice for their baby, which can be reached below. All together: The couple have three other children together including 7-year-old daughter Emma, 5-year-old daughter Mali and 3-year-old daughter Charlie .","SWAT team conducted raid on Cornelia, Georgia home where the Phonesavanh family were staying with relatives in May .

"Most women who socialise in pubs or clubs will have experienced some kind of unwanted attention on a night out whether it's heavy breathing down their neck at the bar, a grope on the dance floor,  crass comments, bum pinching or aggressive 'banter'. Sadly, being hassled on a night out is now seen as the norm and as such often goes unchallenged and unreported. But one London council is taking a stand against harassment by working with local pubs, clubs, bars and restaurants to introduce a Women's Safety Charter. Southwark council have introduced a Women's Safety Charter in a bid to help women feel secure on a night out and  stamp out harassment in the area . Southwark council is asking local businesses to sign up to a set of commitments designed to give women the confidence to report incidents to venue managers. The borough in south east London is home to almost 500 licensed venues and wants to send a clear message to customers that any level of harassment will not be tolerated. Thirty venues, including the famous Ministry of Sound nightclub and Elephant and Castle’s The Coronet, had already signed up when the charter was launched on Tuesday. They say: 'Southwark Council takes this type of harassment seriously and believes it is an issue that reduces women’s quality of life. 'So, we carried out a large scale consultation with the public, council and partner officers, elected members and licensees to hear about their experiences and understand what can be done keep women safe from harassment on a night out. 'We are proud to be launching the Women's Safety Charter, developed with venues in the borough. 'The charter is based on a number of key principles which ensure that all staff working at licensed premises act in a responsible and supportive manner, taking all reports seriously. The intention is that the WSC will send out a clear message that female harassment in these premises will not be tolerated.' Councillor Radha Burgess, the country's first deputy cabinet member for women's safety said: 'Typically, harassment is seen as ""normal"" and goes without being reported or even spoken about.' Championing the campaign is Councillor Radha Burgess, the country's first deputy cabinet member for women's safety. She said: 'Typically, harassment is seen as ""normal"" and goes without being reported or even spoken about. As a council we believe it is time this trend was reversed and that women are made to feel confident enough to speak out against incidents that make them feel uncomfortable, intimidated or threatened. 'Everyone deserves to enjoy a night out without the fear of harassment or intimidation. We want to show harassment to women and girls isn’t acceptable.' The charter was created after speaking to female Southwark residents, and Radha told The Telegraph: 'There’s a kind of ubiquity of harassment and groping that happens in clubs. We need to help women get home safely. Women in nightclubs still feel men are quite predatory. 'I think harassment of women is all about the idea that women are occupying men’s spaces. They’re either not welcome or need to be controlled in some way. That kind of feeling underpins how women feel in public spaces and nightclubs.' The five point charter aims to encourage women to speak out about incidents that make them feel uncomfortable, intimidated or threatened . Venues who have signed up to the scheme promise to... 1. Prominently display high visibility posters in the venue which discourage harassment and encourage reporting . 2. Take every report of harassment and sexual intimidation seriously and take appropriate action . 3. Take active steps to support persons who report harassment or sexual intimidation which might take place in their premises . 4. Train all front of house staff to address women’s safety and harassment . 5. Take active steps to ensure women leave the venue safely .","Southwark Council has introduced a Women's Safety Charter .

"Police were called to a parish council meeting after a row over sheep grazing turned into a physical fight. Lancashire police have called in video footage of the incident on Monday, at a meeting of the allotments committee of Briercliffe Parish Council. The meeting had to be abandoned after discussions about sheep grazing rights became heated and 'swear words were exchanged' before the row spilled outside. Police were called to a parish council meeting in Lancashire - to break up a row over sheep grazing . Lancashire Constabulary said it is now investigating possible public order offences. Councillor Margaret Lishman, who chaired the meeting, said: 'The meeting had to be adjourned because a fight broke out between some members of the public. 'The matter is with the police at the present time so it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.' A police spokeswoman said the matter was under investigation and officers were reviewing video footage of the incident. She said no arrests had been made, but police were looking into possible public order offences. Former parish councillor Sarah Seed has been involved in protracted negotiations over grazing land for her sheep Millie, along with fellow councillor Colin Meeks. Lancashire police have called in video footage of an incident on Monday night, at a meeting of the allotments committee of Briercliffe Parish Council . The scuffle is said to have broken out at the meeting between council lengthsman Michael Greenwood, and Mrs Seed's husband, Jimmy . The meeting was stopped, the police were called and the argument spilled outside on to the street . She resigned earlier this month along with Coun Meeks, and lodged a standards complaint with Burnley Council. The scuffle broke out at the meeting between council lengthsman Michael Greenwood, and Mrs Seed's husband, Jimmy. Mr Greenwood works as a contractor for the Parish Council, as council lengthsman. Lengthsmen are employed by parish councils to tend to parts of the village such as commons and village greens, and maintain drainage into fields and public areas. Mrs Seed said: 'It started in the community centre. But onlookers have played down the 'fight' and said it was more of a 'scuffle' Councillor Margaret Lishman, who chaired the meeting, said: 'The meeting had to be adjourned because a fight broke out between some members of the public' It is believed the argument centred on the rights of former parish councillor to graze her sheep on land belonging to the parish council . 'There was just a scuffle, nobody really punched anyone else, it was six of one and half a dozen of the other. 'I'm not surprised that a fight broke out.' 'It's the way they're treating people in the parish that we disagree with.' MailOnline has contacted Mr Greenwood for comment. Another member of the public who was at the meeting, Paul Stowell said: 'It was fight between a member of the public and the parish council lengthsman. 'The meeting all stopped when it spilled outside and police were called.'","Meeting at Briercliffe Parish Council had to be abandoned after fight .

"Free agent footballer Ray Rice chose a Christmas fundraiser collecting toys for needy children for his first public appearance since a video of him knocking out his wife in an elevator saw him dropped by the Baltimore Ravens. The 27-year-old running back stepped out on Wednesday for the Toys for Tots fundraiser, held at the Jimmy's Famous Seafood restaurant in Dundalk. Giving an interview at the event, Rice said it 'feels good to be out and amongst the Baltimore community and just to give back', and addressed the aggravated assault charges laid against him after punching then-fiancee Janay Palmer, whom he has since married. 'I made a horrible mistake in my life, but, you know, if you truly believe in second chances, you know, they will forgive me,' Rice told CBS Baltimore. 'I think all of the fans here, all the people here, really look deep into who I am.' Rice's wife, however, did accompany him. 'Feels good to be out': Ray Rice (center) made his first public appearance since his domestic assault charges in September, stepping out for the Toys for Tots Christmas fundraiser in Baltimore on Wednesday night . 'I made a mistake': Rice told local media he believes his fans will forgive him for punching his wife out cold . Christmas spirit: The 27-year-old running back was surrounded by children all night . Getting down: Rice was also captured dancing with a little girl during the Christmas-themed event . Last month, an arbitrator lifter the indefinite suspension from the NFL against Rice. National Football League Players Association spokesman, George Atallah, said at the time: 'I can only confirm the suspension has been vacated, effective immediately.' Under the vacation, approved by former U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones, Rice is now eligible to sign with any NFL team - and can do so as soon as he receives an offer. It came two months after the footballer was suspended from the league indefinitely after he was filmed punching Palmer with his left fist in an elevator at an Atlantic City casino. United front: Former Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice (pictured arriving at court with his wife, Janay Palmer, on November 5) has won his appeal of his indefinite suspension and can return to the field immediately . Shocking footage: It comes two months after the footballer was suspended from the National Football League indefinitely after he was filmed punching Palmer  with his left fist in an elevator at an Atlantic City casino . Knocked out: After this elevator security video of the altercation surfaced in September, the Baltimore Ravens released the three-time Pro Bowler, and his $35 million contract, before the NFL suspended him indefinitely . 'It is unbelievable': Within minutes of Judge Jones's decision in the appeal being publicly released, people across America, Britain and elsewhere had taken to social media to express their disgust at the verdict . Within minutes of Judge Jones's decision being publicly released, people across America, Britain and elsewhere had taken to social media to express their disgust at the verdict. Hillary Nadler wrote: 'It is unbelievable that Ray Rice is able to play again. I hope no one signs him,' while Marty Coultas said: 'Who's gonna sign Ray Rice? No one. Not happening.' Detroit-based journalist Ron Fournier tweeted: 'Any poor excuse of a man who hits a woman is kicked out of any self-respecting club. The NFL is a millionaires'/billionaires' club of enablers.' And Andrew Sheehy, from Scarborough in England, added: 'If Ray Rice plays another down in the NFL again, linebackers will line up left, right and center to hit him as hard as they can.' Outrage: Detroit-based journalist Ron Fournier (pictured) tweeted: 'Any poor excuse of a man who hits a woman is kicked out of any self-respecting club.

Right, Rice smiles on the sideline during the second half of a game against the San Francisco  49ers . However, not everyone was opposed to Rice rejoining the game, with Twitter user AJ Gould saying: 'Glad Ray Rice got reinstated... Hope Roger Goodell gets fired!' Initially, Rice was suspended by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for only two games following the one-punch knockout of his then-fiancée in an elevator at the New Jersey-based casino in February. However, after security video of the altercation surfaced on TMZ in September, the Ravens released the three-time Pro Bowler, and his $35 million contract, and the NFL suspended him indefinitely. Criticism over the two-day action led the NFL to toughen its penalties on domestic violence, with Mr Goodell admitting in a letter to team owners that he 'didn't get it right'. During the appeal, Rice's lawyers and the union argued the league had overstepped its authority in modifying former running back's two-game suspension, saying he was being 'sentenced' twice. In addition to testimonies from both Rice and Palmer - who supported her husband - Judge Jones heard from  NFL security chief Jeffrey Miller and Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome. In her decision Judge Jones wrote: 'Because Rice did not mislead the commissioner and because there were no new facts on which the commissioner could base his increased suspension, I find that the imposition of the indefinite suspension was arbitrary. On the field: During the appeal, Rice's lawyers and the union argued the league had overstepped its authority in modifying the player's (pictured) two-game suspension, saying he was being 'sentenced' twice . Couple: In addition to testimonies from both Rice and Palmer (pictured together)- who supported her husband - Judge Jones heard from NFL security chief Jeffrey Miller and Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome . 'I therefore vacate the second penalty imposed on Rice. The provisions of the first discipline - those regarding making continued use of counseling and other professional services, having no further involvement with law enforcement, and not committing any additional violations of league policies - still stand.' Also last month, Palmer - now Janay Rice - spoke toESPN about the Atlantic City incident, saying it stemmed from an 'insignificant' argument between her and her husband. She told the broadcaster: 'As we were arguing, he was on his phone and not looking at me. I went to reach for his phone, and when he grabbed it back, he spit at me and I slapped him. 'We got into the elevator and what happened inside is still foggy to me. The only thing I know - and I can't even say I ""remember"" because I only know from what Ray has told me - is that I slapped him again and then he hit me. I remember nothing else from inside the elevator.' After coming round in the casino lobby, surrounded by police, Palmer was taken to the police station with her husband, who kept telling her 'It's going to be okay. We'll be okay'. Explaining her decision for standing by Rice, she said although she was 'angry', she 'knew it wasn't him' and he had never acted like that before. 'No matter how long we have known each other and no matter what the circumstance is, Ray understands that violent behavior like this, even one time, is never acceptable,' she said.","Ex-NFL star filmed punching his wife Janay Palmer with left fist in elevator .

"The number of prisoners being put to death in the States  has fallen to a 20-year low as concerns grow in the wake of a series of botched executions. There were just 35 executions carried out in 2014, compared to 39 the year before, according to a Death Penalty Information Center report issued on Thursday. The Washington-based non-profit organisation also noted the number of people being given a death sentence was also down to its lowest in 40 years, reaching 72 by mid-December. Scroll down for video . The number of executions carried out in the United States fell to its lowest since 1994 . It also points out high profile botched executions in Ohio, Arizona and Oklahoma - states all using a new drug combination - have led to what the center described as 'outcry and delays' indicating increasing concerns among the public about how the death penalty is imposed. The new drugs took longer to kill the inmate, with witnesses in some cases saying the prisoners appeared to be in pain before they died. In particular, the death of Clayton Lockett - convicted of killing 19-year-old Stephanie Neiman in 1999 and burying her alive - has horrified the public. Shocking court documents revealed a doctor burst Clayton Lockett's artery during his execution at Oklahoma state prison - an execution which used a combination of experimental drugs (pictured) According to a report into his death on April 29, a doctor tried to insert an intravenous line into his groin in a frantic attempt to save him, but hit and burst an artery instead. It caused blood to splatter over the doctor's jacket before the execution was officially stopped. Lockett's heart stopped beating moments later. The report quotes Oklahoma state prison warden Anita Trammell  as saying that the procedure was a 'bloody mess'. Oklahoma's 21 death row inmates are fighting the state through the court - arguing Clayton Hackett's bungled execution is evidence they likely will experience pain and suffering from the state's lethal injection protocol. Lawyers are due in federal court in Oklahoma City on Thursday, where the inmates are challenging the state's method of execution. The court will hear testimony about the process - which left Lockett 'writhing' on the gurney, before he mumbled and lifted 13 minutes after he had been given the lethal cocktail. Much of the case centers on the use of the sedative midazolam as the first in a three-drug combination, used for the first time during Lockett's execution. Attorneys for the state say new execution protocols and staff training will prevent similar problems from happening again. Oklahoma's next execution is set for January 15 next year. Oklahoma carried out no more executions in 2014 after Lockett's death, while only seven of 32 states that have the death penalty on the books executed inmates during the last 12 months. The bulk came from just three states: Texas, Missouri and Florida, the Death Penalty Information Center report said. Richard Dieter, the center's executive director, said evidence in recent years suggests 'the death penalty is becoming irrelevant as a criminal justice tool'. Bit Michael Rushford, president of the pro-death penalty Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, said there is little evidence that juries are less likely to impose death sentences or that the public at large is opposed to the death penalty. The lower number of executions is, in part, a result of fewer death penalty-eligible crimes being committed in recent years, he said. However, even a reduced number is likely to place the United States in the top 10 countries for executions: 2013 saw the US execute fifth most people in the world, behind China, Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, according to a report released in May by the human rights organization Amnesty International.","Just 35 prisoners were executed in the States during 2014 .

"Sixteen bottles of the world's oldest rum have sold for a record-breaking £135,000 after they were found in the cellars of a stately home. The rum was made in Barbados 234 years ago and then brought back to Britain by aristocrat Henry Lascelles. The Earl of Harewood had put 226 bottles of light and dark rum in the wine vaults of his family home - Harewood House in Leeds. But despite the popularity of the spirit in Georgian times, the bottles were consumed surprisingly sparingly. Sixteen bottles of the world's oldest rum have sold for a record-breaking £135,000 after they were discovered in the cellar of a stately home . The rum had been made in Barbados in 1780 and then transported to Britain where the Earl of Harewood put 226 bottles in the wine vaults of Harewood House in Leeds, pictured . Despite the lavish parties hosted at Harewood House, just a few bottles were drunk a year. And by the 20th century, rum became an unfashionable drink and the huge stocks of it in the cellar were forgotten. The dust-covered bottles were only discovered in 2011, when Mark Lascelles, brother of the eighth Earl of Harewood, performed a stock check at the Grade II-listed property. The cobwebs and mould were painstakingly cleaned from the hand-blown bottles and it was revealed they matched an entry in the cellar book from 1969, which stated there were 28 bottles of dark rum and 31 bottles of light rum left. Twelve bottles of the rum were sold in February this year for £80,000, setting a new world record for the spirit, but now sale of 16 bottles - half of each type - surpassed it with a final total of £135,713. This means each bottle of rum is worth £8,482, making it not only the oldest but also the most expensive rum in the world. It is thought the rum comes from Barbados because the Lascelles family owned a lot of estates on the Caribbean island in the 18th century, including one that is now run by Mount Gay Rum. The dust-covered bottles, right, were found after a stock check in 2011, and sold by Christie's auction house, left, for more than £8,000 a bottle . The sale means each bottle of rum is worth £8,482, making it not only the oldest but also the most expensive rum in the world . It would have been distilled in Barbados then shipped in barrels back to Britain and bottled at Harewood House. The light rum is almost 70 per cent proof while the dark rum is nearly 60 per cent. David Elswood, international director of wine at Christie's auction house in London, said: 'The story behind this rum is fantastic. 'It was made at the Lascelles estate in Barbados in 1780 then shipped back to Britain in casks and bottled at Harewood House. 'But over the years it has been drunk very sparingly. The family only had a few bottles each year and the store just got forgotten about. 'Fast forward more than two centuries and members of the Lascelles family were making an inventory of what they had in the cellars when they found on the top shelf these mouldy bottles. 'They checked the cellar books and found to their amazement they were bottles of rum dating back more than 200 years. 'The rum is cask-strength and remarkably it tastes very good. Often spirits don't age well but this rum tastes fantastic. 'This is the most expensive rum in the world, and as far as we're aware it is the oldest too.' The proceeds of the sale will be donated to the Geraldine Connor Foundation, which helps young people in performing arts and has strong links with Harewood House.

"European judges dealt a fresh blow to the Government today after ruling  foreign families of EU citizens cannot be stopped from moving to the UK. Until now, ministers had required European nationals’ overseas family members to get a travel permit before travelling to Britain. But the European Court of Justice found a British citizen living and working in Spain did not have to get a travel permit for his Colombian wife to visit the UK. Ukip claimed the ruling extended the right to free movement to 'millions of people from anywhere in the world'. Sean McCarthy is now free to bring his Colombian wife Patricia McCarthy Rodriguez and daughters Natasha and Chloe to the UK after European Union judges ruled in their favour against the British government . The controversial ruling means overseas citizens from outside the European Union who marry someone from the EU could get the right to move to Britain. A government source said the ruling only applied to overseas family members of EU nationals who are living outside of the country he or she is from. In practice this would mean that an Algerian partner of a French national living in France would still need a family permit to visit Britain. However if the Algerian and French couple were living in Spain, or any EU country outside of France, the new ruling would allow them to come on a residents permit. The case revolved around Sean McCarthy, a dual British and Irish national living and working in Spain, and his wife, Patricia McCarthy Rodriguez. They have two young children who are both British citizens. Mrs McCarthy claimed she should be allowed to travel to the UK with her British family without having to obtain a British visa as she holds an EU Residence Card issued by the Spanish government. However, the British Government has until now required Mrs McCarthy to obtain a ‘family permit’ visa every six months if she wants to travel to the UK. The McCarthys took action against the UK Government under the European Union’s freedom of movement rules, arguing that Mrs McCarthy should not have to apply for a visa every time she wants to travel. The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, which interprets EU law, ruled in the McCarthys’ favour today, stating that freedom of movement rules do not allow measures which - in pursuit of an objective of general prevention of abuse - preclude family members from entering a member state without a visa. David Cameron promised tough new restrictions to stem the flow of EU citizens to Britain . Free movement rules have been at the heart of the debate over immigration in Britain and whether the country should remain a member of the EU . The win could potentially open Britain’s borders to large numbers of non-EU nationals who live with EU citizens across the continent. Mrs McCarthy has to go from Marbella to the British Embassy in Madrid to be fingerprinted and complete detailed application forms every time she wants to travel to the UK. The process takes several weeks, even months, her lawyers said. The UK invoked the visa regime because it had concerns about other EU member states’ residence cards, as some allegedly do not meet international security standards, and therefore could be used to abuse EU freedom of movement rules. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker wants to encourage the free movement of workers throughout the EU . But the legislation requires an entry permit to be obtained before entry into the UK even where the authorities do not consider that the family member of an EU citizen may be involved in an abuse of rights or fraud. Court of Justice judges said the fact that a member state is faced with a high number of cases of abuse of rights or fraud committed by non-EU nationals - as the UK claims - cannot justify a sweeping measure to exclude family members of EU citizens. The judges said the UK is able to assess documentation for signs of fraud or abuse at the border and if fraud is proven they can exclude an individual. But they added that the UK is ‘not permitted to determine the conditions for entry of persons who have a right of entry under EU law or to impose upon them extra conditions for entry or conditions other than those provided for by EU law’. A Government spokesman said: ‘The UK is disappointed with the judgment in this case. It is right to tackle fraud and the abuse of free movement rights. ‘As the case is still to return to the UK’s High Court for a final judgment, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.’ Britain is bound by the Court of Justice’s ruling. Free movement rules have been at the heart of the debate over immigration in Britain and whether the country should remain a member of the EU. Last month, David Cameron promised tough new restrictions to stem the flow of EU citizens to Britain, including a block on EU migrants claiming welfare for the first four years after they arrive in the country. However, the Prime Minister insisted he rules ‘nothing out’ if British demands for change fall on deaf ears, and warned that welfare reforms will be an ‘absolute requirement’ in the renegotiation that would be held ahead of his planned referendum on EU membership. Ukip MEP and spokesman on immigration Steven Woolfe said the Court of Justice ruling strikes another blow against the UK’s power to control its borders. Mr Woolfe said: ‘Britain will be forced to recognise residence permits issued by any EU member state, even though the system of permits is wide open to abuse and fraud. ‘This ruling extends the so-called ‘right to free movement’ to millions of people from anywhere in the world who don’t have citizenship of any country of the EU. ‘This is yet more proof that Britain can never take back control of its borders as long as it remains in the European Union.’","Until now, non-European family members had to get a travel permit .

"Mistletoe... it is hard to quantify how much joy and misery one sprig of a plant could bring every year. It is the stuff of horrors - a drunken colleague lurching towards you at the  office Christmas party with the plant held above their head. Or, the cause of happiness, when a person finally gets to plant a smacker on the lips of a man or woman that they have been admiring from afar. So spare a thought for Emma, 22, and Tom, 26, who bravely took to the streets of London earlier this week in a competition to see who could get the most smooches from members of the public. Scroll down for video . Emma, 22, and Tom, 26, competed to win most kisses from strangers. The Londoners filmed the reactions of the people they approached. Emma won the competition with double Tom's kiss count. The pair gamely took on the challenge from the social network Twoo.com, who handed them Go Pro cameras attached to a mistletoe-covered helmet each. The social experiment took place in Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square on a grey Monday afternoon, but they still managed to attract several kisses each. Unsurprisingly, Emma came out as the clear winner at the end of the competition, with 18 men happy to provide her with a peck on the cheek or lips. Tom struggled considerably at the beginning of the experiment, with most women turning him down without a second glance, but he was saved by a group of female tourists who each gave a kiss after dancing around him in a circle and ended with a respectable nine smooches. Sarah Zelbst, Marketing & Community Coordinator from Twoo said: 'Interestingly, the experiment found that Londoners are more adventurous when in groups, which applies to both sexes. 'The guys were more up for a kiss when their friends were there and encouraging them to plant a kiss on Emma's cheek. 'Girls were also more up for a quick smooch under the mistletoe when they were with their friends. 'In fact, Tom's score shot up after a group of girls encircled him and then went for a kiss.'

"The estranged wife in Britain's biggest ever divorce case has said she will not appeal after being awarded £200 million less than she wanted. Sir Chris Hohn, son of a Jamaican motor mechanic, was ordered by a High Court Judge to hand over about a third of a £1 billion fortune to Jamie Cooper-Hohn, earlier this month. The 49-year-old had wanted half of the money, but Judge Mrs Justice Roberts awarded her 36 per cent - £337 million - following a trial in the Family Division of the High Court in London. Today Mrs Cooper-Hohn said she had considered appealing the ruling but decided against it. Jamie Cooper-Hohn, 49, (pictured left) has said she does not plan to appeal the High Court decision to award her £200m less than she wanted in her divorce from Sir Chris Hohn, 48, (pictured right). 'I have chosen not to appeal this judgment, and instead focus on my passions: transforming children's lives in the developing world and raising my own children. 'I firmly believe, however, that the so-called 'special contribution' doctrine used in this case is outdated and unjust in disproportionately valuing the generation of wealth. 'It dismisses the important contributions that those who take on the responsibility to raise children and work in less lucrative sectors make to our society. The award is thought to be the biggest of its kind made by a judge in England. Legal experts say it is 'certainly' one of the biggest payouts to be pocketed by an estranged wife. She and Sir Chris married in 1995, had four children and had been married for more than 15 years, Mrs Justice Roberts was told. Mrs Cooper-Hohn had said the wealth had been created as a result of their 'partnership'. But the judge concluded that Sir Chris - who was educated at a state school and studied business and accounting at Southampton University - was a 'financial genius' who had made a 'special contribution' to the creation of the couple's fortune. Sir Chris Hohn, son of a Jamaican motor mechanic, will take more than half a billion pounds in the divorce . Mrs Cooper-Hohn said instead of appealing the judgement she is going to return her focus to 'helping children in need across the world and raising my three daughters and son' Mrs Cooper-Hohn had told the judge that she worked long hours on behalf of their charitable foundation - and travelled. She said they had met when studying in the United States, at Harvard near Boston. She said both had wanted to 'make the world a better place'. And she added today: 'Our family had three pillars at its core: work, philanthropy, and the care and nurturing of our children. 'I was primarily responsible for two of those—raising four children and, as CEO and Founder, creating one of the world's largest and most impactful foundations. 'I saw our marriage as an equal partnership with mutual interests. That our legal system failed to acknowledge our marriage in that light and saw the woman's role as less 'special' than the husband's contribution sends the wrong message to those who choose a life of service. 'I truly hope our legal system will evolve to have more respect for a modern definition of marital partnership.' Sir Chris had told the judge: 'Over the long term I am an unbelievable money-maker.' He said he was a billionaire and in the 'top 10' career investors. But he had also told the judge that he did not 'really care about money' and said money did not bring happiness. Sir Chris had said he had visited the Philippines aged 20, seen poor children and vowed that if he ever had enough money to help poor children he would. He said by his mid-30s he had been in a position where he could retire and raise money for charity.","Jamie Cooper-Hohn says she will not appeal the £337m awarded in divorce .

'In northeast Victoria, it's in the high 20s, low 30s. It's temperature, but the most critical thing this afternoon is wind speed, which will move the fires around and potentially push them into areas which will be difficult to extinguish,' he said. Highest-risk communities were doorknocked on Wednesday and made aware of the danger, he said. There are still 160 properties without power but they are listed to have power back before dark, he added.

"Military Cross winner Brian Wood said British troops had been dragged through 'five years of hell' by the Al-Sweady inquiry . Soldiers and their families yesterday said they had been left ‘disturbed’ and ‘angry’ after enduring a five-year inquiry into false claims that British troops murdered, tortured and mutilated Iraqis. Former troops said their reputations had been tarnished and their relatives had suffered years of anguish due to the allegations, which the £31million investigation eventually exposed as ‘calculated lies’. Last night the mother of one of the soldiers who gave evidence to the taxpayer-funded inquiry said the way her son had been accused of wrongdoing was ‘disgraceful’. She said Scott Hoolin, now 31, heroically fought off the enemy – only to have his name dragged through the mud. Ann Hoolin, 50, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, told the Daily Mail: ‘I think the inquiry disturbed him and this coming back again now has just upset and disturbed him again. ‘To be accused of wrongdoing in the aftermath of what happened is disgraceful.’ She said her son was just 21 when he engaged in a ferocious firefight named The Battle of Danny Boy in 2004. The convoy he was travelling with came under fire from militants armed with grenades and AK-47s. ‘It was a worrying time for the family as he was so young and fighting over there,’ she said. ‘Now this has opened it all up again for both Scott and the family. ‘As a family we are angry about that and we are angry because when he went to give evidence to the inquiry he told us when he returned home that the whole thing was a waste of time.’ Soldiers were accused of war crimes on the gravest scale by insurgents who told ‘deliberate and calculated lies’ in order to damage the reputation of the Armed Forces. The lawyers representing nine Iraqi claimants were branded ‘shameful’ after their case was comprehensively rejected by a war crimes inquiry on Wednesday. Former corporal Brian Wood won a Military Cross for his bravery during the bloody firefight. Echoing comments made by Mrs Hoolin, he said: ‘We have been dragged through five years of hell. That in my view is a betrayal of our service. We did what we had to do as soldiers and we did the right thing.’ The 34-year-old, of the 1st Battalion the Princess of Wales’ Royal Regiment, was conducting a vehicle checkpoint in 2004 when he heard a soldier had been hit by a grenade and another shot in the arm and rushed to their aid. Detained Iraqis being guarded by a British soldier that was shown at the the Al-Sweady Inquiry. The long-running inquiry found that British troops mistreated nine Iraqi detainees following a fierce battle a decade ago, but false allegations of murder and torture were the product of 'deliberate lies' The Al-Sweady public Inquiry released shocking images which formed part of its investigation into the ferocious firefight, dubbed the Battle of Danny Boy, at a checkpoint near Basra in 2004 when a number of insurgents were killed . But on the way there in armoured Warrior vehicles, his unit was ambushed by insurgents from three positions. The troops had to charge across open ground and they fought for five hours in one of the most intense battles since the Falklands. In the firefight, 28 insurgents were killed and nine militants were taken to the Camp Abu Naji military base where they were questioned. But their heroic efforts were tarnished when the detainees claimed they were subjected to torture and witnessed executions and mutilation. The Al-Sweady probe into the shocking allegations found they were ‘wholly and entirely without merit’. It exonerated British troops, saying the Iraqi men they were accused of torturing were not innocent farmers but insurgents killed or captured in the firefight. British troops had responded to the ‘deadly ambush with exemplary courage, resolution and professionalism’, according to Sir Thayne Forbes, who was conducting the inquiry. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon demanded Leigh Day and legal aid-funded Public Interest Lawyers, the two law firms that represented the discredited Iraqis, make an ‘unequivocal apology’. But Phil Shiner’s PIL has refused to admit any wrongdoing. As it stands, PIL will receive around £3million for its work on the inquiry. Both firms are being investigated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority for alleged misconduct. Do you know the soldiers or their families forced to live under a cloud of suspicion and allegations for more than a decade? Please contact 0203 6151091 . Lawyer Phil Shiner has repeatedly been condemned for taking on legal aid clients to sue British institutions despite having flimsy cases. His firm, Public Interest Lawyers, has received around £3million in public money for the Al-Sweady Inquiry alone and has been involved in dozens of other such claims. It is still representing another 1,500 Iraqis who say they are the victims of British abuse. Birmingham-based Mr Shiner has also persuaded prosecutors at the International Criminal Court to probe Britain over claims of war crimes by troops. The 57-year-old set up PIL in 1999, shortly before the Human Rights Act came in. In 2004 Mr Shiner – who has links with the barristers' chambers of Tony Blair's wife Cherie Booth QC – was named 'Human Rights Lawyer of the Year'. But as recently as May, two High Court judges attacked his controversial firm for using thousands of pounds of taxpayer-funded legal aid to bring another worthless case to court. Lord Justice Moses and Mr Justice Collins called for powers to strip the practice of the legal aid fees it will be paid for trying to win compensation for a murderer complaining about not being allowed to vote while in jail. They said the claim made on behalf of Somali-born Dutch inmate Samson Teshome was 'absurd'. PIL had argued that as an EU citizen, convicted killer Teshome – who served 14 years for the murder of a fellow asylum seeker – should have been allowed to vote in local and EU parliamentary elections in 2012. Mr Shiner drew criticisim for persisting with the legal fight even after a Supreme Court judgment had removed any possibility of success. However, prosecutors in the Hague have launched a 'preliminary examination' into claims UK forces tortured and mistreated Iraqi prisoners between 2003 and 2008. It is the first time the ICC, which usually prosecutes blood-soaked dictators, has investigated Britain. Mr Shiner made more than 400 allegations of beating, sexual assault, mock executions and electric shocks of Iraqi captives. He has been criticised for sending representatives to Iraq to talk to people who claim to have been abused by British troops.","Soldiers and families left 'disturbed and 'angry' after Al-Sweady inquiry .

"A daredevil conservationist and his team have taken Britain's most stomach-churning seflie - from the top of a 404ft medieval spire. Gary Price, 46, clerk of works at Salisbury Cathedral in Wiltshire, and a team of helpers took a number of pictures from the capstone at the very top of the spire while carrying out repairs. Kitted out in ropes, a harness and a hard hat Mr Price, who is in charge of the cathedral's conservation, made the hair-raising climb to replace a faulty wind meter accompanied by rope access specialists. Scroll down for video . Gary Price took the ultimate selfie 404ft above the ground from the  top of the spire at Salisbury Cathedral . Mr Price, using ropes and a harness is near the top of the spire in this picture taken from ground level . He climbed the 332 steps inside the cathedral to the base of the tower before scaling ten narrow ladders inside the spire to a small weather door. He then climbed through the door and pulled himself up the last 30 feet to the capstone using rungs set into the outside of the spire's masonry. It is only the fourth time Mr Price, from Salisbury, has made the climb and something that will not be repeated for another three or four years. He replaced the anemometer, a device for measuring wind speed, which had stopped working properly in wind and rain. Mr Price scaled ten narrow ladders inside the spire to a small weather door before he climbed out and pulled himself up the last 30 feet to the capstone using rungs set into the outside of the spire's masonry (pictured) The stomach churning view photographed by Mr Price and his team as they scaled the medieval cathedral . Mr Price and his team also abseiled down the east side to check out and plug a leak that was discovered as a result of the September storms. While most cathedrals in medieval times took centuries to build, Salisbury's was erected in just 38 years by 300 men from 1220 to 1258. The spire was added later between 1300 and 1330 and the cathedral is the tallest medieval structure in the world. Salisbury Cathedral also has Britain's largest cloister and largest cathedral close, the world's oldest working clock and the best surviving of the four original copies of the Magna Carta. Mr Price pictured replacing the anemometer, a device for measuring wind speed, which had stopped working . One of the terrifying birds-eye views of the cathedral taken by Mr Price from the top of the spire . Mr Price said: 'It's a very exciting day for me because I don't get to go up the spire very often at all and it's probably going to be the last time for another three or four years. 'The cathedral is the tallest medieval structure in the world, 404ft to get to the capstone. 'When you climb out the weather door the spire is quite wide, but the higher you go the more narrow it gets and you do feel a bit like ""is this going to take my weight?"" but it will, it's been there for 800 years. 'It is quite exposed and you can see all the way around you. 'When you get up there your heart is definitely in your mouth and all of your senses are heightened. 'You're super safe but it's certainly an adrenaline rush. 'The hardest bit is making yourself climb out of the door when you're perfectly safe inside and when you abseil back down to go in the door, with the harness and all the equipment you need and it's a narrow door it can be quite tight to get back in. 'If there's two or three of you up there and one of you moves you can feel the spire slightly swaying.' Mr Price said if there is more than one person up the spire and someone moves you can feel the spire sway .","Gary Price, 46, heads up conservation on medieval Salisbury Cathedral .

"A rare Victorian public toilet has been given Grade II listed status because it has been deemed a structure of 'special historical interest'. The toilet, which is still in use today in Clifton, Bristol, is made from metal and was built by Walter MacFarlane in the 1880s. The rectangular building is constructed from cast iron with a Moorish-style theme and glass roof, and each porcelain urinal unit has a curved metal modesty screen at chest level. Scroll down for video . The toilet, which is still in use today in Clifton, Bristol, is made from cast iron metal and was built in the 1880s . The Victorian public urinal was given grade II listed building status because of its 'special historical interest' English Heritage said it had listed the building because these 'often humble structures' were 'important to the streetscene of our cities'. A spokesman said: 'Historic elements of the public realm, including street furniture and public facilities, are particularly vulnerable to damage, alteration and removal and where they survive well, they will in some cases be given serious consideration for designation. 'In times of austerity, facilities and structures such as this set of urinals are under increasing threat, and where there are found to be deserving of protection English Heritage will recommend to the Secretary of State that they be added to the National Heritage List for England.' He said the urinal was a 'relatively rare surviving example of a once common type of building' and represented the 'civic aspirations of the authorities in the Bristol suburbs in the late Victorian period'. Bristol City Council, which owns the structure, said it 'remained very well used and appreciated'. English Heritage said it had listed the building because these 'often humble structures' were 'important to the streetscene of our cities'. The public toilet building was officially granted the listed status on December 11 . English Heritage said the urinal was a 'relatively rare surviving example of a once common type of building' Two other similar structures were listed in Bristol in 1977 on Horfield Common and Mina Road Park. Maggie Shapland, from the Clifton and Hotwells Improvement Society, said: 'We are really glad it makes it harder to destroy our heritage by raising awareness and we are highly delighted to keep part of our historic streetscape.' All buildings built before 1700 - which survive in anything like their original condition - are listed, as are most of those built between 1700 and 1840. Particularly careful selection is required for buildings from the period after 1945. A building normally has to be over 30 years old to be eligible for listing. Grade II buildings are deemed to be nationally important and of special interest. 92 per cent of all listed buildings are in this class and it is the most likely grade of listing for a homeowner. They are usually listed on the basis of external inspection and include diverse structures such as canal locks and bridges, mill workers' cottages, manor houses, churches, barns and war memorials'. All listed buildings are covered by the same degree of statutory protection, regardless of grade. - English Heritage . The toilet is not the first to be given listed building status. A lavatory at the Museum of Steam Power and Land Drainage in Westonzoyland, Somerset, was given the honour and now attracts queues of visitors desperate to get their photograph taken with it. The toilet, which was built in the 1940s, is dubbed the 'Leaning Tower Of Pee-sa', because the small redbrick building it is housed in leans at an angle just like its Italian counterpart. Other more notable buildings to be given grade II listed status include Alexandra Palace in Haringey, north London. The iconic entertainment venue, which was originally opened in 1873 but rebuilt in 1875 following a fire, became a listed building in 1996, at the instigation of the Hornsey Historical Society. The building and its grounds is also included in the English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest. The BT Tower in Fitzrovia, central London, which was built between 1961 and 1965, also has grade II listed status. The 581 foot high structure - 627 foot including additional aerial rigging – was given listed building status in 2003. As well as buildings and towers, English Heritage can also give listed building status to statues and structures. The William Shakespeare statue and fountain in Leicester Square, central London, has grade II listed status, having been given it in February 1958.

Ms Williamson was charged with supplying the Class B drug, which she pleaded guilty to. She evaded a conviction after the district judge accounted for the bullying she suffered at the workplace. Ms Ward, who resigned amid the ordeal, did not face criminal conviction. She admitted her wrongdoings to the tribunal, saying: 'I made a very bad snap decision'. The childcare teacher said her mistake should not imply that she is unable to teach, as she has been doing so for nine years.

"A former mayor and her daughter who kept dozens of animals in their home which was knee-deep in faeces have been found guilty of animal welfare offences. Pamela Ann Crisp-Beard, 63, and her daughter Maria, 24, kept a menagerie at their cramped terraced home which was so squalid that even the cutlery was plastered with animal excrement. Rabbits at the home in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, were so desperate to escape their hutches that they had 'created a network of tunnels' through knee-deep compacted faeces which the pair had failed to clean up. The mother, who used to be mayor of the market town, and her daughter were found guilty of six animal welfare charges at Skegness Magistrates' Court today. Former mayor Pamela Ann Crisp-Beard and her daughter Maria were found guilty of animal welfare offences . RSPCA inspectors found rabbits were so desperate to escape their hutches that they had 'created a network of tunnels' through knee deep compacted faeces . The family's pets included 15 rabbits, a golden pheasant, two guinea pigs, five mice, two rats, a cat, two dogs, four domestic ducks, a goose and 22 chickens, a parrot and two ferrets. Some of the animals were kept inside their home, including in a bedroom, while others were left in the back garden. Neighbours contacted the RSCPA, with animal welfare officers finding their feet squelched on carpets in the Crisp-Beard's hallway because they were sodden with urine.

'Some of the animals were kept in cages stacked from floor to ceiling in the front room and there was a gaping hole in the ceiling. 'Some of the dirty straw inside the cages was inches thick with excrement. 'I struggled to identify the golden pheasant, kept in the back garden of the property, because it was so badly caked in mud and faeces. 'On my first visit I found some of the animals were kept in cages with filthy, sodden straw.

"This is the moment two heartless thieves stole £700 of Christmas money from an elderly couple after pretending to ask for directions. Moments earlier the ‘despicable’ con artists had followed the couple – both aged in their 80s – around a bank and watched them withdraw their savings. CCTV cameras capture the moment one of the men distracts the grandparents by pretending to be lost, while his partner swoops. Criminals: Police are hunting for two thieves who stole a vulnerable couple's £700 Christmas savings by distracting them claiming they were lost . Sickening: One man asked the pensioners for directions while the other rifled through a bag and stole a wallet . As the pensioners load their shopping into the boot of their car, one man keeps them engaged in conversation, encouraging them to turn their backs to the vehicle. Meanwhile, his accomplice can be seen lurking in the background before he sneaks up behind them. He then reaches into the woman’s handbag, snatches her purse and walks off. The first thief then quickly concludes his conversation, appearing to thank the pensioners for their directions, before following his accomplice. Yesterday, West Midlands Police released the 45-second CCTV footage in a bid to catch the men. Hundreds posted links to the footage on Facebook and Twitter in a bid to find the ‘vile’ thieves. Do you know these men? Detectives believe these are the men responsible for the wallet snatch . Detective Sergeant Dave Faries said the men struck at 10.30am on November 25, on Thamley Road in Coventry. He added: ‘This was a well-planned theft in which the suspects coldly and deliberately targeted the elderly couple. ‘Not only did they follow them in the bank, but they also shadowed them as they carried out their shopping, waiting for the right time to pounce.’ He said the couple had withdrawn the money for Christmas presents for their family and thankfully, ‘in the spirit of the festive season’, Coventry Building Society refunded the cash. ‘However, I will not rest until these despicable thieves are identified and brought to justice,’ Mr Faries added. ‘We have carried out numerous inquiries in the area and checked police systems to try and identify the suspects, but now we need the public’s help to trace them. ‘I’d also like to urge people to be on their guard against such tactics and if a stranger approaches you in the street, make sure you keep an eye on your belongings and report any suspicious activity to police.’ Cynical: The gang had been following the couple since they withdrew the money from a cashpoint . Distraction: The ringleader then spoke to the pensioners claiming they had lost their way while the accomplice lurked behind . Kind: The couple politely turn round to face the man but doing so allow the other thief to sneak in and steal . Exit: As soon as the wallet was stolen the thieves fled and police are desperate to track them down . Distraction theft is not uncommon and it is believed these men may be travelling from town to town to evade police. In September, three thieves were captured on CCTV using a similar technique – distracting a frail elderly man as he took money out of a cashpoint, and taking his bank cards and cash. Yesterday, one woman, who didn’t give her name, wrote on MailOnline that her 84-year-old mother also experienced almost identical tactics. She said thieves ‘followed her into the Halifax, watched her withdraw £800 and then distracted her while another member went down her shopping trolley and stole it’. She added: ‘The whole sorry incident was caught on CCTV but all the police said was they were aware of the gang operating in our part of Suffolk and she has heard nothing from them since.’ On Twitter, users described the thieves as ‘disgusting’ and ‘vile scumbags’. In the footage, one of the men is wearing a black leather jacket with a white patterned jumper while his bald accomplice has a moustache and is wearing a black puffa jacket with a white hood. Anyone who knows the identity of the men is urged to call police on 101, or the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.","Thieves had followed couple them claimed they were lost in Coventry .

"Government staff sending festive emails have been urged to not to say Merry Christmas. The extraordinary advice was sent this week to avoid offending people of other faiths and agnostics. Officials at the Department for Energy and Climate Change were also told not to use ‘images of skin’ to prevent accusations of racism. The email was sent to staff this week who wanted advice on what to send in festive e-cards . The ministry, led by Lib Dem Ed Davey, sends e-cards instead of traditional paper greetings to save money and paper. An email sent to some officials this week gave advice on what the messages should and should not say, to avoid offending people who do not celebrate Christmas. The message was sent on Monday to staff who wanted to know how to style festive greetings sent from the department, The Sun reported. It stated: ‘When picking, think Season’s Greetings rather than Merry Christmas.’ The email added: ‘As an organisation of multiple faiths and agnostics serving a community of the same and in the interest of inclusion, I’d avoid images with skin.’ Tory MP Ian Liddell-Grainger said the advice was ‘just pathetic’. ‘They should grow up and get a grip. We live in 21st century Britain and we should be able to get on and celebrate Christmas and recognise people have different faiths without offending anyone.’ Energy Secretary Ed Davey insisted he mentioned Christmas several times in his seasonal message to staff . DECC employs 1,600 staff in London and Aberdeen. A spokesman insisted the email was only sent to a small group of people in the department. ‘There is no formal guidance to staff about Christmas cards,’ he said. Mr Davey’s seasonal message to staff included several references to Christmas, the spokesman added. Writing to all staff, Mr Davey said: ‘Having just spent the last week in Lima at the Climate Change talks, I, for one, am definitely looking forward to a few days at home with the family at Christmas. I’m sure you are too! ‘I hope that everyone finds time over Christmas to reflect, relax and recharge the batteries. You deserve it. Merry Christmas – and a Happy New Year.’","Message sent to officials at Department for Energy and Climate Change .

"A depressed student fed-up with his non-existent sex life tried to kill himself by jumping from a building – but ended up landing in a tree and being left dangling by his foot. Ilya Gocharov, 25, from the city of Chelyabinsk in southern Russia, had decided to take his own life after failing to have sex for over a year since his long-term girlfriend dumped him for someone else. But after jumping out of a fifth floor balcony he landed in a tree and got tangled upside down in the branches, before passers-by heard his cries for help and called the police. A police officer gapes at Ilya Gocharov as the depressed student hangs from a tree branch . In trying to kill himself he plunged five floors from the balcony of an apartment block . An officer had to jump onto the roof of a police van to help the 25-year-old get down safely . He was filmed dangling from the tree branch around 10ft above the snow-covered ground, before a police van pulled up and an officer clambered onto the roof to help him down. He was then shoved into the vehicle to warm up, but wasn't at all grateful for being rescued, according to the the officers. A police spokesman said: 'When officers arrived they found him hanging from his foot in the tree. He was unable to get free on his own. 'They asked him if he was OK and then managed to get him down. 'He had minor bruises and abrasions but apart from that seemed OK, apart from being a bit angry. 'He said he had a pain in the heel of his foot and when the officers suggested he go to hospital he refused and walked off without even saying thank you.' Pal Igor Woronoff, 25, said: 'He was very upset about the break-up with his girlfriend and I don't think he really got over it. 'He has now agreed to go to counselling organised by the college who insisted he get treatment after being notified about the incident by police. 'I'm just glad that tree was in the way when he jumped off the balcony.' To speak to a skilled, trained counsellor, call the Samaritans on 0845 790 9090. Gocharov was not at all grateful for being rescued, according to the officers who came to his aid . Police were left baffled by the student's actions as he sought to end his life over his lack of sex . It's not what the van is usually used for but on this occasion it was just right for the job . Gocharov was bundled into the van afterwards to kelp him keep warm in the freezing Russian cold . But he didn't stay long, reportedly walking off without saying thank you to his rescuers .","Ilya Gocharov, 25, made the attempt after failing to have sex for over a year .

"Shocking new figures reveal Florida to be the child abuse capital of America - as 117 children were killed while being monitored by welfare officers in the state in just five years. And a sickening map of abuse shows how at least 786 children, most under the age of four, died from violence or neglect from 2008 to 2013 in plain view of child protection authorities. Many of them were beaten, starved or left alone to drown while agencies had good reason to know they were in danger. Shocking: A map of the USA shows the number of children killed while being monitored by child welfare caseworkers since 2008. Asterisks indicate that the state is unable to determine between deaths that took place while children were being monitored and those that occurred where abuse had not yet come to the attention of authorities. Montana did not provide any data. The previously unknown figures were obtained in an investigation by The Associated Press - who canvassed the 50 states, the District of Columbia and branches of the military - circumventing a system that does a terrible job of accounting for child deaths. Many states struggled to provide numbers. Secrecy often prevailed. Most of the 786 children whose cases were compiled by the AP were under the age of 4. They lost their lives even as authorities were investigating their families or providing some form of protective services because of previous instances of neglect or violence or other troubles in the home. Take Mattisyn Blaz, a 2-month-old Montana girl who died when her father spiked her 'like a football,' in the words of a prosecutor. Matthew Blaz was well-known to child services personnel and police. Just two weeks after Mattisyn was born on June 25, 2013, he came home drunk, grabbed his wife by her hair and threw her to the kitchen floor while she clung to the newborn. Tragic: Mattisyn Blaz, of Montana, was just two months old when her father spiked her 'like a football,' in the words of a prosecutor. Pictured left, an urn conataining her ashes and right, her mother Jennifer holds up her photo . Monster: Mattisyn Blaz's father Matthew Blaz, 33, right, was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the death of his infant daughter . Jennifer Blaz said a child protective services worker visited the day after her husband's attack, spoke with her briefly and left. Her husband pleaded guilty to assault and was ordered by a judge to take anger management classes and stay away from his wife. Convinced he had changed, his wife allowed him to return to the home. She said the next official contact between the family and Montana child services came more than six weeks later - the day of Mattisyn's funeral. The system also failed Ethan Henderson, who was only 10 weeks old but already had been treated for a broken arm when his father hurled him into a recliner so hard that it caused a fatal brain injury. Maine hotline workers had received at least 13 calls warning that Ethan or his siblings were suffering abuse. The caseworker who inspected the family's cramped trailer six days before Ethan died on May 8, 2012, wrote that the baby appeared 'well cared for and safe in the care of his parents.' Many factors can contribute to the abuse dilemma nationwide: The child protective services system is plagued with worker shortages and a serious overload of cases. Budgets are tight, and nearly 40 percent of the 3 million child abuse and neglect complaints made annually to child protective services hotlines are 'screened out' and never investigated. All that's left: Jennifer Blaz holds the small hand print, hair clipping and footprint given to her by the hospital after her daughter Mattisyn Blaz's death . Also, insufficient training for those who answer child abuse hotlines leads to reports being misclassified, sometimes with deadly consequences; a lack of a comprehensive national child welfare database allows some abusers to avoid detection by moving to different states; and a policy that promotes keeping families intact can play a major role in the number of deaths. Florida: 117 . New York: 78 . Texas: 76 . Ohio: 37 . Washington: 36 . Illinois: 33 . Louisiana: 30 . Pennsylvania: 26 . Maryland: 26 . Missouri: 25 . Because no single, complete set of data exists for the deaths of children who already were being overseen by child welfare caseworkers, the information compiled over the course of AP's eight-month investigation represents the most comprehensive statistics publicly available. But the number of abuse and neglect fatalities where a prior open case existed at the time of death is undoubtedly much higher than the tally of 760. Seven states reported a total of 230 open-case child deaths over the six-year period, but those were not included in the AP count because the states could not make a distinction between investigations started due to the incident that ultimately led to a child's death and cases that already were open when the child received the fatal injury. The data collection system on child deaths is so flawed that no one can even say with accuracy how many children overall die from abuse or neglect every year. The federal government estimates an average of about 1,650 deaths annually in recent years; many believe the actual number is twice as high. Even more lacking is comprehensive, publicly available data about the number of children dying while the subject of an open case or receiving assistance from the agencies that exist to keep them safe - the focus of AP's reporting. 'We all agree that we cannot solve a problem this complex until we agree it exists,' said David Sanders, chairman of the federal Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities, whose members are traveling the country studying child deaths under a congressional mandate. States submit information on child abuse deaths to the federal government on a voluntary basis - some of it comprehensive, some of it inaccurate. In some cases, states withhold information about child deaths in violation of the terms of federal grants they receive. Failed by system: Ethan Henderson, pictured with grandmother Jan Collins, was only ten weeks old but had already been treated for a broken arm when his father hurled him into a recliner so hard that it caused a fatal brain injury . The U.S Department of Health and Human Services says all states receiving grants under a prevention and treatment program must 'allow the public to access information when child abuse or neglect results in a child fatality,' unless those details would put children, their families or those who report abuse at risk, or jeopardize an investigation. Still, no state has ever been found in violation of disclosure requirements and federal grants have never been withheld, according to Catherine Nolan, who directs the Office on Child Abuse and Neglect, a sub-agency of HHS. The information that states send the federal government through the voluntary system also is severely lacking. A 2013 report showed that 17 states did not provide the federal government with a key measure of performance: how many children had died of child abuse after being removed from their homes and then reunited with their families within a five-year period. When President Richard Nixon signed the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act into law in 1974, it was seen as a sign of federal commitment to preventing child abuse through state-level monitoring. But in 1995, a board reviewing the subsequent progress issued a scathing report calling or better information and transparency and flagging 'serious gaps in data collection.' Nearly 20 years later - 40 years after Nixon signed the act - the AP found that many such problems persist.","Investigation by Associated Press discovers huge number of kids failed by child welfare caseworkers across U.S.

"One of Chancellor George Osborne’s key advisers has been handed a 19 per cent pay rise, it was revealed last night. Rupert Harrison - who has been described as the 'real Chancellor' and the 'most important person in Government who you've never heard of' - enjoyed an increase last year from £80,000 to £95,000. The former Eton head boy has been a long-term aide to Mr Osborne, and his salary rise is said to have been prompted by his appointment to the Treasury Council of Economic Advisers. Pay rise: Rupert Harrison has been described as the 'real Chancellor' and the 'most important person in Government who you've never heard of'. He is pictured (right) with Chancellor George Osborne . Dr Harrison, who is the son of a bank manager and a French teacher, is said by government insiders to be talented at coming up with appealing policies to equal electoral objectives. The 36-year-old father lives in a basement flat in Notting Hill with his lawyer wife Joanna, 37. The revelation of his pay comes as it emerged that the salary bill for ministers’ special advisers has soared by £1.2million in just one year - despite David Cameron’s pledge to cut the cost of politics. Figures published yesterday show that there are now 103 so-called ‘spads’ working in Whitehall, at an annual cost to the taxpayer of £8.4million. This is 17 per cent up on the £7.2million cost the year before, and much higher than the £5.9million bill in Gordon Brown’s last year of power. The number of special advisers is up on the 98 that were in place a year ago and 71 just after the Coalition took office. Working together: Former Eton head boy Dr Harrison (left) has been a long-term aide to Mr Osborne . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s director of communications, Steve Lotinga, was paid £105,000. Mr Clegg alone has 20 spads – which Labour points out is larger than the number of female MPs he has in his party. The Prime Minister has 26 spads. The surge comes despite the fact that the Tories promised at the last election to cap the number of spads, and the Liberal Democrats pledged that they should be paid out of political funds not taxpayer coffers. Mr Cameron said in 2009: ‘If we’re going to take our country through these difficult times, those who lead must lead by powerful example. That means getting our own house in order and cutting the cost of politics.’ But the latest figures, released by the Cabinet Office, show that six advisers are being paid £100,000 or more, with the list topped by Mr Cameron’s chief of staff Ed Llewellyn and his director of communications Craig Oliver, who each received £140,000. William Hague, Leader of the House, still employs Arminka Helic on a salary of £70,000 – even though she has now been elevated to the Lords. Angela Eagle, the Shadow Leader of the House of Commons, said: ‘Another day, another broken promise from David Cameron and Nick Clegg. Salaries: The pay bill for ministers' special advisers has soared by £1.2million in just one year - despite a pledge by Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured yesterday in Brussels) to cut the cost of politics . ‘David Cameron promised to get the cost of politics down but under him the number of Special Advisers spirals ever upwards – the public are now picking up bill of over £8million to pay for his appointees. ‘This also shows how you can’t trust a word Nick Clegg says. The Lib Dems used to say that Special Advisers shouldn’t be paid for by the public but as soon as he got his feet under the Cabinet table he broke his word. ‘The cost to the public of Lib Dem Special Advisers is over £1.7million – Nick Clegg alone has more advisers working for him than he has female MPs. ‘This is a Government which breaks its promises and leaves hardworking people to pick up the bill.’ John O’Connell, director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘There’s nothing wrong in principle with ministerial staff but their salaries have got to be kept under the same tight control as everybody else’s in the public sector. Deputy PM: Nick Clegg (pictured on Wednesday) is said by Labour to have more advisers working for him than he has female MPs . ‘David Cameron promised before he was elected that the cost of politics would go down under his watch, and politicians should keep their promises.’ Answering business questions in the Commons, Mr Hague said the rising numbers reflected the ‘nature of coalition’ and that their average pay was actually lower than it had been under the previous Labour government. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said that special advisers’ pay was now on average £5,000 a year less than it had been under the last government. A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said the increase in the number of spads reflects coalition working and the 24/7 demands placed on ministers. ‘As part of this Government’s long-term economic plan, we are making efficiencies from the Civil Service, which is now 21 per cent smaller than it was at the time of the 2010 general election,’ he said. ‘Workforce reductions and pension reforms saved £4.7billion last year, compared to a 2009/10 baseline. Special advisers perform an important function and their average salary cost is 8 per cent lower now than under the previous government.’","'Real Chancellor' Rupert Harrison   enjoyed increase last year from £80,000 .

"New security footage has been released which allegedly shows Sydney siege gunman Man Monis walking slowly around Martin Place an hour before he took 18 people hostage. Taken at 8.30am on the Monday morning, the footage shows a man believed to be Monis in the hour before he initiated the bloody ordeal which claimed the lives of three people, including his own. Detectives examined the footage on Wednesday, as new information emerged  that the self-styled sheikh had been in the Lindt Cafe for up to an hour before he produced a sawn-off shotgun from his bag. Scroll down for video . Barristers Guy Renolds SC and David Hume represented Man Haron Monis (pictured) in court on Friday . The footage, released by Channel Seven security, was shot from the network's Martin Place studio, which overlooks the square outside the Lindt Cafe where the crisis occurred, reported news.com.au. After allegedly walking around Martin Place in the early hours of Monday morning, it is believed that Man Monis entered the Lindt Cafe, where he sat for up to an hour before the hostage crisis began. One of Monis' lawyers described his chance encounter with the gunman in the cafe on Monday morning, labelling his behaviour as distinctively calm. 'He was cool as a cucumber, not agitated, not scoping the place out, not looking over his shoulder,' said the lawyer. The lawyer asked not to be identified, as one of Monis' former lawyers has received death threats, but revealed that Monis invited him to sit down for a coffee, and enquired about the progress of legal matters the two were involved with. 'He called my name out and said, 'How are you going?,' the lawyer said. 'I didn't recognise him at first so I walked over to him,' he told The Australian. Speculation has abounded as to the mental state of Monis during the siege, with Seven Network journalist Chris Reason describing Monis as becoming 'increasingly agitated' throughout the evening. However, Monis' lawyer said that his demeanor was unruffled, and the most peculiar element of the conversation was the gunman enquiring why he was in the cafe. Mr Hume and Mr Renolds SC work in the same building (pictured) as Monis's victim Katrina Dawson . Three days before he stormed a Sydney cafe with a shotgun Man Haron Monis had an appeal against conviction rejected in the High Court . 'He kept asking, ""Why are you here?"". I think he was genuinely surprised to see me there,' the lawyer said. Describing Monis as intelligent, the lawyer said that Monis never appeared to be violent, though he held extreme views and often ignored legal advice. Monis was in constant communication with his lawyers, faced with a plethora of legal charges for sexual abuse and sending malicious letters to the families of dead soldiers. The new revelations follow information that the barristers who represented Man Haron Monis in court just three days before he staged a bloody 17-hour siege work in the same building as victim Katrina Dawson. The gunman's lawyers Guy Renolds SC and David Hume work at Sixth Floor Selborne Wentworth Chambers, two floors below Eight Selborne Chambers office where Ms Dawson and colleague Julie Taylor work, the Daily Telegraph reported. Separated from two adult daughters back in Iran, Monis had also been denied contact with his two sons - now aged 10 and four years old - in a long running custody battle with his ex-wife's family . The building is around the corner from the Lindt cafe in Sydney's Martin Place, where Ms Dawson and cafe manager Tori Johnson were fatally shot and 16 other hostages escaped after a terrifying ordeal at the hands Monis. Last Friday morning, after reluctantly pleading guilty to twelve charges of sending malicious notes disguised as 'sympathy letters' and making phone calls to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, 50-year-old Monis had taken his case to the High Court. But Monis was rebuffed. He had already been rejected by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal (NSWCCA). He had already taken his case - that charges of using a postal service or similar to menace, harass or cause offence were unconstitutional - once to the High Court. In February last year, six members of the High Court returned their judgement. It was a split decision, divided evenly between three male judges who agreed with Monis that the charges were unconstitutional. Three female judges ruled that the appeal court decision that the charges against him were constitutional should hold. On Tuesday morning many innocent people were injured and two were tragically killed in the deadly siege . Last Friday Monis went to the High Court again. Represented by Sydney barrister Guy Reynolds SC, he made an application to remove the Appeal court decision to the High Court. By 10am, the court's Chief Justice Robert French and Justice Stephen Gageler swiftly dismissed his application. Monis, who was not present in the court, was telephoned and told his bid had failed. Separated from two adult daughters back in Iran, Monis had also been denied contact with his two sons - now aged 10 and four years old - in a long running custody battle with his ex-wife's family. Following a bitter and vengeful relationship with the children's mother Noleen Hayson Pal after she ended it in 2011, Monis had been charged with intimidating her but was lucky enough to have the charge and an Apprehended Violence Order against him dismissed in May 2012. In April the mother of Monis' children Noleen Hayson Pal was stabbed 18 times and set alight in the stairwell of his western Sydney flat in Werrington . But in April 2013, Ms Pal was stabbed 18 times and set alight in the stairwell of his western Sydney flat in Werrington and seven months later, in October last year, police charged Monis with accessory to murder. His girlfriend, Amirah Droudis, a Greek Australian Muslim convert was charged with Ms Pal's murder. Ms Droudis was also charged over the hate letters, for aiding and abetting Monis. In September last year, Monis told police he had known Droudis for six years but that their relationship had not begun until May 2013 - the month following Ms Pal's murder. Seven months later, in October last year, police charged Monis with accessory to murder while his girlfriend Amirah Droudis was charged with Ms Pal's murder . Ms Droudis was due to appeal her charges in court next February, the same months Monis would face a trial on the multiple sex charges, including two of inciting a teenage girl to commit an indecent act. No date had been set for the murder trial. But it was the mark against his name over the poison pen letters which had dominated Monis's thoughts since 2009, as he went from the District Court to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to the High Court and back to the High Court again, only to be rebuffed. Seventy-two hours later, Monis took a shotgun into Martin Place.","Security footage shot from Channel Seven's studio reveals a man believed to be Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis calmly walking the square .

"These are the first images of a polar bear looking after her new born cub at a zoo in Germany. The tiny animal, which is just weeks old, can be seen clambering over its mother Vilma in their birthing cave at Rostock Zoo in the north of the country. Staff say the cub, which has yet to be named, was born on Vilma's 12th birthday and is so young it has yet to fully open its eyes. The first images have been released of a polar bear cub born just two weeks ago at Rostock Zoo in Germany . In one picture, Vilma can be seen lying on her back and gently resting one of her huge paws over the cub. According to German website Rostock Heute, the father is a male called Lars - the same bear that fathered Knut, a cub born in captivity in Berlin eight years ago. The mother and her newborn are currently alone in the cave and are only visible through images beamed from a video camera. Zoo bosses said the birth took place on December 3 and comes amid plans to build a new £7.85million facility for polar bears and penguins in 2016. The cub, which has yet to be named, was born on its mother's 12th birthday and is so young it has yet to fully open its eyes . The last polar bear births at the zoo were ten years ago in 2004 when twins Venus and Valeska were born. Staff say Vilma, who has become a mother for the second time, is looking after her cub 'intensely' and that the young animal is already putting on weight. Two years ago she had a daughter named Anori after giving birth at a zoo in Wuppertal near Dusseldorf. Polar bear cubs generally weigh about 450-850 grams at birth and only open their eyes between 21 and 34 days later.","First images emerge of cub born in captivity in a zoo in Rostock, Germany .

"Lesbian women earn more than straight employees - but gay men are paid less, a study has found. On average around the world, homosexual women are paid 12 per cent more than heterosexual counterparts - yet gay men get 9 per cent less than straight males. Britain’s pay gap for lesbian women against others is 8 per cent, while gay men get 5 per cent less. Scroll down for video . Split: On average globally, homosexual women are paid 12 per cent more than heterosexual counterparts - although they receive less in Greece and Australia . In the US, gay men earn 16 per cent less than heterosexuals - while lesbians get 20 per cent more than straight women. Between the two lies Germany, where gay men earn 9 per cent less than straight men and gay women earn 11 per cent more. The figures come in a report released yesterday into inequalities in the labour market which looked at gay and lesbian employees worldwide. It was carried out by Dr Nick Drydakis, an economist at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, who said: ‘A puzzling issue is the earnings premiums found for lesbian employees in some countries. By country: In the US, gay men earn 16 per cent less than straight men, while the figure is 5 per cent in Britain . ‘Gay men often avoid certain male-dominated occupations in favour of female-dominated occupations - less masculine jobs - for which salaries may be lower. ‘The higher salaries among lesbians in some countries may reflect discrimination in favour of masculine traits rather than against them. ‘In addition, lesbians tend to self-select into male-dominated occupations that may offer higher salaries.’ He added: ‘There are no quantitative studies of the relationships among gender identity, personality characteristics and labour market prospects for lesbians. ‘So whether lesbian employees possess characteristics that enhance their attributes for job advancement and earnings is still unknown.’ Australia, Canada, the US and the EU are said to have the strongest protection of sexual-orientation rights, including workplace anti-discrimination laws. Differences: The report found gay and lesbian employees have lower job satisfaction than their heterosexual counterparts and are more likely to be harassed and bullied by colleagues (picture posed by models) But the report claimed that despite this, all gay people are discriminated against in favour of heterosexual applicants with comparable skills and experience during the hiring process. That was observed in studies carried out in Austria, Cyprus, Greece, Sweden, the US and Canada. The report also found that gay and lesbian employees have lower job satisfaction than their heterosexual counterparts and are more likely to be harassed and bullied by colleagues. But gay and lesbian people who are open about their sexual orientation within the workplace are more likely to report higher job satisfaction than those who are not. The report highlights that not even 20 per cent of countries have adopted sexual orientation anti-discrimination laws in employment. At the same time 2.7billion people live in countries where being gay or lesbian is a crime. The study was based on 10 surveys and commissioned by the World Bank/IZA World of Labor project.","On average globally, lesbians are paid 12% more than straight workers .

"From wide-mouthed frogs and a hungry gecko to majestic elephants and grizzly bears, these are just some of the stunning photographs which have topped an international wildlife competition. The amazing images, taken by both professional and amateur photographers, were the winners and runners-up of a competition by The Society of International Nature and Wildlife Photographers. Taken from all around the world, from Sussex to South Africa, the photographs capture the stunning forms of wildlife, with close-up shots giving an incredible insight into their life. The winning image, of two frogs sheltering under a leaf, was actually taken in Bognor Regis, despite its tropical appearance. Photographer Kutub Uddin, 28, who usually captures humans on camera, said he couldn’t resist taking a snap of his two pet frogs when they grabbed a leaf and used it as a shelter. Other spectacular photographs submitted to the competition include two young bears keeping watch in Finland, a fox with a lop-sided ear in west London and a wasp spider taking hold of its damselfly prey. The winning photograph, of two pet red-eyed tree frogs sheltering under a leaf, was taken by 28-year-old photographer Kutub Uddin from Bognor Regis, West Sussex. He said: 'I was cleaning out their tank  and watched as they climbed up a plant. I just couldn’t resist getting my camera and taking a few quick snaps of them. It was really funny to see them with the leaf, it looked as if they were using it as an umbrella' Wildlife photographer Ian Cook, bagged three highly commended images in the international competition. The 57-year-old, from Northumberland, said all of the images were taken at a 1:1 Macro Masterclass at Southpark Farm, Knowsley Safari Park in Merseyside earlier this year. He said: 'The exact names of the creatures are a Painted Hopper, a New Caledonian Crested Gecko (above) and a Dead Leaf Mantis' Mr Cook's photograph of a Painted Hopper (above) was highly commended in the competition, which was run by The Society of International Nature and Wildlife Photographers. He had three images commended, out of hundreds by both professional and amateur photographers . The photo of a fox with a lop-sided ear was taken by Vladimir Spirov in Brompton Cemetery, west London. The wedding photographer, 56, spent five months getting to know the fox before he could get close enough for the shot. He said: 'After a while the fox started to recognise my ""special"" whistle and my voice. Finally, it started to take food from my hands, so I was able to shoot it up close. This is one of those photos' Italian photographer Luigi Calabrese, 41, saw his photograph of two young bears, which was taken near a lake in Finland, highly commended . Carys Jones, 50, from Surrey, had her photograph of a rare Chalkhill Blue butterfly (left) commended. She said: 'The image is of the relatively unusual Chalkhill Blue butterfly, taken on my first ever visit to Ranmore Common, near Dorking in Surrey this summer. It was a slightly windy day which made it trickier to grab sharp shots. Luckily this little butterfly helped me out by staying on this particular flower for some time'.

"A young married couple who plotted to abuse children as part of a paedophile love triangle are facing jail after police uncovered 'horrific' texts and indecent images of children and animals. Kevin Barnett, 28, suggested drugging youngsters so he could enact his sick desires and his wife Susan, 28, said she would be willing to comfort a child as it was raped, a court heard. The pair were found guilty of arranging the commission of a child sexual offence and a second woman, Nikita Moore, 22, was convicted of conspiracy to commit child sexual offences with Barnett. Moore had even discussed having a baby with Barnett, from Barrow, Cumbria, for them to abuse together - although prosecutors  conceded this particular 'horrific' exchange was just fantasy. Kevin Barnett, 28, (right) suggested drugging children so he could enact his sick desires and his wife Susan, 28, (left) said she would be willing to comfort a child as it was raped, a court heard . The 22-year-old was sending messages to Barnett saying she thought about sexually abusing children 'all the time' when sick exchanges between the married couple were still continuing. Although both women were eager to please Barnett as he made increasingly disturbing suggestions, the Preston Crown Court heard he was the driving force behind the criminal activity. Mr Brown told the court how Barnett took advantage of the women's feelings and exploited their desperation for his own sexual gratification - at one stage having a threesome with both women. Detectives were able to stop the would-be child abusers after officers were called to a domestic disturbance between, Barnett and a woman unrelated to the case. Officers examined his phone after a tip off and the three defendants were arrested after detectives trawled through the sick messages. Nikita Moore, 22, discussed having a baby with Barnett for them to abuse together and they have been convicted of conspiracy to commit child sexual offences . All three denied the charges and argued the texts had been a 'fantasy' with no real intent to act on them. The jury had to decide whether or not the messages represented a genuine plan to sexually abuse children. Moore began an affair with  Barnett shortly after the death of her long term partner Jason Baines, who killed himself in October 2013. The 22-year-old, originally from Birmingham, said the two had indulged in 'unconventional' sexual practices. Their relationship ended in early 2014 when Moore discovered Barnett was also having an affair with another woman. After admitting the affair to Mrs Barnett, Moore said the two women had become 'really close' and began living together in Barrow. But Moore continued to secretly exchange messages with Kevin Barnett discussing underage sex and sharing indecent images of children. Summing up the case, Judge Christopher Cornwell told the jury: 'You have heard the text exchange which at times no doubt disgusted you. We could go on and on with the disgust but the central question never goes away. Was there a conclusive agreement and was there an agreement that it should be put into action?' Moore and Kevin Barnett had previously pleaded guilty to offences relating to indecent images of children. Mrs Barnett had also pleaded guilty to possessing extreme pornography depicting sex with animals. The defendants will next appear at Preston Crown Court for sentencing for all the offences on February 5 next year. Judge Cornwall said: 'I don't see any alternative to immediate imprisonment.' Acting Detective Inspector Brian Murray, of the South Cumbria Public Protection Unit, said: 'I am pleased that justice has been served today and these three individuals will be facing prison for their crimes. 'Thankfully cases like this are extremely rare in Cumbria and the quick arrests of these three people once information came to light show that we are committed to protecting children in Cumbria.'

"A mother has rounded on Nick Clegg over ‘mouldy’ sandwiches delivered to pupils under his free school meals scheme. The Deputy Prime Minister was challenged during his radio phone-in by a caller who complained that sandwiches sent to her daughter’s school had ‘turned up frozen’ or with ‘mouldy bread’. She said the sandwiches were part of ‘very unhealthy’ lunches which contained items such as doughnuts. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg vowed to investigate claims a school in Somerset was providing 'unhealthy' meals . Parents were being forced to send pupils to the school – St Joseph’s Catholic Primary in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset – with extra food to supplement their inadequate free meals, claimed the caller, named Nicola. The revelations are embarrassing for Mr Clegg who has insisted his £1billion free meals scheme – which entitles all four to seven-year-olds to a free school lunch – will make pupils healthier and give them more energy to learn. But critics have argued that many schools are not equipped to implement the policy and that its benefits have been over-stated. Mr Clegg admitted it was ‘totally unacceptable’ that pupils were being served poor quality food. Nicola told him during the show on LBC Radio that a whole term into the free meals initiative, her daughter’s school still lacked the kitchen facilities to prepare hot food for pupils. Children were instead being offered cold packed lunches provided by a contractor. Mr Clegg, pictured leaving the LBC studios, has faced criticism of the policy to introduce free school meals for all under-7s . She said: ‘The sandwiches are either cheese, ham, or tuna. There is no capacity for requests such as no butter, or whatever, if they don’t particularly like it.’ On one occasion ‘the sandwiches turned up frozen’ and on another ‘they turned up in mouldy bread’, Nicola said, adding: ‘Most parents I know are now sending in their children with additional food because they’re coming home hungry.’ The Liberal Democrat leader told her: ‘It sounds totally unacceptable and you are quite right as a mum to be immensely annoyed.’ He added: ‘If what you said is absolutely right, it hasn’t changed at all since the beginning of term, and that they are providing such poor value and poor quality cold meals, that’s completely wrong. The Deputy Prime Minister has championed the policy of free lunches for under-7s . Mr Clegg yesterday made mince pies with year 5 pupils from Hallfield Primary School in West London during a visit to announce take up figures for free school meals . ‘It’s not what is happening across the vast majority of the rest of the school system.’ He promised to look into the case and ‘make sure something is done’. A spokesman for St Joseph’s Catholic Primary said: ‘We have received no complaints about mouldy food. ‘On one occasion frozen sandwiches were delivered in error, but these were returned to the contractor and replaced with freshly made ones.’ They said the school is having a kitchen installed to provide hot meals, but that the current packed lunches ‘meet national guidelines’. Mr Clegg’s on-air exchange with Nicola on Thursday came as he released figures showing that take-up of free meals is running at 85 per cent across the country. But in the South East it dips to 81.5 per cent, with more children preferring to bring their own food. Take-up was expected to be 87 per cent, but only three English regions reached this level – the North East, the North West and inner London.","All under-7s now offered free school lunch in schools in England .

"The banker flew to a luxury resort island in Indonesia thinking he was about to be interviewed for a lucrative job connected with multimillionaire mining magnate and political leader Clive Palmer. Instead, the alleged perpetrators of an elaborate plot used the bogus interview to try to get the National Australia Bank executive to say he lied during a court case in which one of the suspects was suing the bank. When that failed, they sent two Indonesians dressed as security officers to take the banker captive - seizing his passport, mobile phone and wallet - until he made a videotaped confession regardin gthe case, police allege. Andrew Crook (pictured) arrested in Brisbane on Friday over the alleged kidnapping of NAB executive . Palmer United Party  leader Clive Palmer (right) with media adviser Andrew Crook (left) aboard his $70 million dollar Global Express aircraft in August 2013 . Palmer United Party media adviser Andrew Crook, 48, of New Farm in Brisbane, appeared before the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday charged with retaliation of a witness, attempting to pervert the course of justice, and attempted fraud. Former police detective Mick Featherstone, 51, of the Gold Coast, also appeared on identical charges. Police said an arrest warrant had been issued for a third man wanted in the, former Australian Rules Footballer and property developer Tony Smith, who lives overseas. The court was told there were allegedly emails between Crook, Featherstone and Smith, involved in luring the NAB employee to an Indonesian Island with a fake job opportunity. Barefooted and wearing a shirt and shorts, Crook sat in the dock with his arms folded across his chest. He kept his gaze focused on the magistrate, avoiding any glances in a public gallery full of journalists. His lawyer argued that Crook had no prior convictions and was not a flight risk having owned a business for the past 20 years in Brisbane. Crook was granted bail with conditions, including that he does not contact any of the co-accused, the witnesses, NAB employee and that he surrender his passport. Featherstone was also granted bail under similar conditions. Both men are not to approach within 100 metres of two Southport NAB branches, despite Featherstone's lawyer saying his client banks with NAB. Mr Smith, 48, is currently in Indonesia. Police will allege the three men lured a NAB executive to Batam Island in Indonesia under the false assumption that he was to be interviewed for a high paying job as a global finance manager with a company owned by Mr Palmer. Detective Superintendent Mick Niland said police will allege Featherstone used a false identity and Crook used his media company links 'to make the job offer appear as the real deal'. 'We will allege to real reason was to extract a confession from the bank employee and make him retract and change his evidence, which he gave during a civil trial in 2012 in the Supreme Court in Queensland,' Mr Niland said. Since 2009 Mr Smith has been involved in civil legal action against  NAB, claiming he lost $70 million after an agreement with the bank and broken contracts caused a finance company he owned to collapse. Detective Inspector Phillip Stevens said police will allege the three me 'schemed' to elicit a confession from the NAB employee, who was a key witness in the civil matter. Clive Palmer's (left) media adviser Andrew Crook (right) has been arrested in Brisbane . ‘It will be alleged that part of that planning occurred in Queensland, the execution of key parts of that plan were done in Singapore and Indonesia, and then the offences were committed back in Queensland,’ Mr Stevens said. Mr Stevens said: ‘It reads like a Hollywood script.’ Mr Niland described the alleged plan as 'bizarre'. He added that Mr Palmer was not involved in the investigation. ‘He is a victim of the circumstances, where his name has been used by the three offenders in an effort to lure the NAB executive to the island in Indonesia,’ he said. Queensland police said in a statement that the attempt to get the banker to admit that he had lied during the court case failed. Events then took an even more bizarre turn. Police allege two Indonesians dressed in security uniforms entered the room where the interview took place an detained the banker, seizing his mobile phone, wallet and passport. The man was then threatened 'which ultimately led to him being coerced into make a confessional video before they would allow him to leave the island,' the police statement said. Earlier on Friday Mr Crook was arrested after police raided his New Farm home in inner Brisbane , before going to his offices in the CBD for further raids, the ABC reported. Police also arrested former police detective Mick Featherstone on the Gold Coast. Police Taskforce Maxima also issued an arrest warrant for former Sydney Swans player and property developer Tony Smith, who is believed to be overseas. Mr Crook's company Crook Media handles all public relations for Clive Palmer and his Palmer Uniter Party . Police said Taskforce Maxima's Criminal Economy Team - set up to eliminate bikie gangs -uncovered evidence  while it was investigating another matter. The ABC's 7.30 Report conducted an investigation in Mr Featherstone, which aired in September, and it encouraged the alleged victim to come forward to police with his story. Mr Crook's company Crook Media handles all public relations for Clive Palmer and his Palmer Uniter Party. On Friday, Mr Palmer suggested the arrests were an attempt to undermine him in the lead-up to the Queensland election. 'It's a significant thing to me that it's state police up  there [raiding Mr Crook's office] and [Premier] Campbell Newman is going to call the election probably in February or March,' he told the ABC. 'A lot of these things are being orchestrated to happen at this time. 'I think it's an effort to undermine our political support in Queensland and try to get Campbell Newman re-elected as Premier.' Mr Palmer said he was concerned that his election campaign materials were seized during the raids conducted on Mr Crook's office. Mr Palmer suggested the arrests were an attempt to undermine him in the lead-up to the Queensland election . 'From my point of view I'd be concerned - police issued a search warrant where they can get access and take away all of his computers and that would contain all of our election plans for the coming state election,' he told 2GB. Mr Niland rejected this idea. ‘It’s utter nonsense to say it’s political or somehow politics is involved,’ he said. He added that Mr Palmer’s campaign materials were ‘extremely safe’ in police custody and will be returned to him as soon as possible. National Australia Bank today confirmed it provided Queensland Police with details of allegedly 'unsolicited approaches' made to an employee in regards to evidence they gave in a civil court trial involving a former customer. 'This has been a difficult time for our employee,' a spokesman said in a statement. 'These are serious matters that should now be investigated and dealt with by Queensland Police and any other relevant authority.'

"The Ohio-based companies that provide the U.S. Army with Abrams tanks, once again proved to be one of the big winners when congress passed a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill this week. The new defense spending bill will include $120 million for the 70-ton tanks – even though the army has repeatedly said it doesn't need them. It is the third year in a row that congress has disregarded the army's expressed wish to suspend tank building and upgrades. For the third year in a row, congress has disregarded the army's stated desire to suspend tank building and upgrades and has passed a defense spending bill that includes $120 million on Abrams tanks . In a statement, Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, said that congress 'recognizes the necessity of the Abrams tank to our national security and authorizes an additional $120 million for Abrams tank upgrades. 'This provision keeps the production lines open in Lima, Ohio, and ensures that our skilled, technical workers are protected.' Turner chairs the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee and will retain that position in the next Congress, reports Fox News. His district includes the General Dynamics Land Systems plant in Lima, Ohio, the only U.S. manufacturer of tanks. The tank debate between the army and congress goes back to 2012 when General Ray Odierno, the army chief of staff testified that 'we don't need the tanks. 'Our tank fleet is two and a half years old on average now. We're in good shape and these are additional tanks that we don't need.' Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, left, said congress recognizes the necessity of the Abrams tank to our national security, while Gen. Ray Odierno, right, the army chief of staff testified in 2012 that 'we don't need the tanks' Built to dominate the enemy in combat, the hulking Abrams tank weigh 70-ton and the army had suggested that production lines could be kept open through foreign sales . Then congress voted for another $183 million for tanks despite Odierno's argument that the army was seeking to become a lighter force. 'If we had our choice, we would use that money in a different way,' he said at the time. The current Abrams upgrade program approved by congress calls for improving gas mileage by decreasing idle times and also  improvements to the tank's sights and sensors. Built to dominate the enemy in combat, the hulking Abrams tank weigh 70-ton and the army had suggested that production lines could be kept open through foreign sales. But politics is keeping the Abrams production line rolling as the deal protects businesses and good paying jobs in congressional districts where the tank's many suppliers are located. Congressional backers of the Abrams upgrades view the vast network of companies, many of them small businesses, that manufacture the tanks' materials and parts as a critical asset that has to be preserved. Congressional backers of the Abrams upgrades view the vast network of companies, many of them small businesses, that manufacture the tanks' materials and parts as a critical asset that has to be preserved . The money, they say, is a modest investment that will keep important tooling and manufacturing skills from being lost if the Abrams line were to be shut down. The Lima plant is a study in how federal dollars affect local communities, which in turn hold tight to the federal dollars. The facility is owned by the federal government but operated by the land systems division of General Dynamics, a major defense contractor that spent close to $11million last year on lobbying, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. The plant is Lima's fifth-largest employer with close to 700 employees, down from about 1,100 just a few years ago, according to Mayor David Berger. But the facility is still crucial to the local economy. 'All of those jobs and their spending activity in the community and the company's spending probably have about a $100million impact annually,' Berger said.","For the third year in a row, congress has disregarded the army's stated desire to suspend tank building and upgrades .

"NASCAR's 'bad boy' Kurt Busch says he was naked and sobbing on the floor of his motorhome after having a spiritual experience watching Brad Pitt in 'Seven Years in Tibet' when his ex-girlfriend burst in with her young son. Busch took the stand in his own defense on Wednesday at a hearing for a protective order that Patricia Driscoll filed against him. He admitted to grabbing her face and telling her to leave him alone, but says her claims that he smashed her head into the wall three times and strangled her in September is a 'fabrication.' He said he was stark naked when Discroll barged into his motorhome in Dover, Delaware, with her young son and demanded that he tell the boy to his face that his relationship with Driscoll was over. Scroll down for video . NASCAR champion Kurt Busch described being naked on the floor and sobbing after watching Brad Pitt in 'Seven Years in Tibet' following his loss in a race in Dover, Delaware . Patricia Driscoll says she fears for her safety and alleges that Busch choked her and smashed her head against the wall of his trailer . Busche denies that he smashed Driscoll's head and says she is seeking revenge after he broke up with her . The hearing in a Dover, Delaware, court took a turn for the bizarre on Wednesday - and it wasn't just Busch's testimony. Driscoll's attorney later called Busch's personal assistant to the stand who testified that the racer's 37-year-old ex has been prone to telling 'far-fetched stories.' Michael Doncheff says Driscoll claimed she a 'trained assassin' and once ranted: 'NASCAR is nothing. I take down foreign governments. I own Washington.' Mr Doncheff also recalled how the weekend before the confrontation in Delaware, he noticed that Driscoll was moving gingerly and appeared stiff. When he asked her what was wrong, she told him that she had been picked up by a big man and slammed to the ground while helping 'round up' illegal immigrants at the Mexican border. Driscoll works as a narcotics and homeland security consultant and lobbyist at a small Washington defense contractor called Frontline Defense Systems. She is also the head of a small charity that helps wounded veterans. Busch said he wasn't depressed after a race loss - he was just having a spiritual experience watching 'Seven Years in Tibet' Busch says Driscoll dragged her young son along to his trailer and told the NASCAR racer to tell the boy to his face that he had broken up with her . Dover police say they are still investigating the September 26 incident, but have made no arrests. Driscoll waited six weeks to report the assault. Driscoll says she fears for her safety and testified on Tuesday: 'I don't know what he's capable of doing.' Busch has hired a team of attorneys, who have denied the accusation and portrayed Driscoll as a scorned lover seeking to ruin Busch's career. Busch testified that he was naked the entire time that Driscoll and her son were in the motorhome. The man known in NASCAR circles for a bad-boy image that has earned him the nickname 'The Outlaw' also testified that he had been crying earlier that night while watching 'Seven Years in Tibet,' a 1997 movie starring Brad Pitt. 'It was a moving experience... It was a spiritual movie,' Busch explained, adding that the movie led him to reflect on his own life. 'There were some tearjerker moments.' The elegant blonde sobbed in court as she described the alleged attack and also asked that Busch undergo psychological evaluation . Busch's legal team says the racer will be cleared of all wrongdoing after a thorough investigation of the facts behind the case . In a text to Driscoll that night, Busch told her that he was crying, lying on the floor and didn't know 'which way was up.' In another text that night, Busch told Driscoll 'I don't love anything right now.' Driscoll testified that she became concerned about Busch after seeing the texts and went to check on him, thinking she and her son could comfort him. Driscoll and Busch both testified about an angry exchange following a race in New Hampshire, one week before Dover. It resulted in him damaging a rental car and her driving off, leaving him stranded at a Boston airport. She also said she tried to reach out to Busch's mother after the New Hampshire race, saying Busch was drinking and struggling with depression. Busch testified that he told Driscoll 'bye forever' after New Hampshire but acknowledged sending a text nearly a month later hoping to talk to her. Busch, 36, said that while the two were in his bedroom, he again asked her to leave, for what he said was the fifth time. 'I took my hands and cupped her cheeks and I looked at her eye to eye and I said 'you need to leave.' I was defusing the situation,' he said. Busch was called to the stand by Driscoll's attorney, Carolyn McNeice. She did not ask him whether he smashed Driscoll's head against the wall. 'She just did not want to hear that denial,' Busch attorney Rusty Hardin said after the hearing. Hardin will cross-examine Busch when the hearing resumes January 12. 'He will explain in detail his side of it,' Hardin said. Mr Doncheff, whom Busch hired to drive his motorhome and be his personal assistant, said Busch treated him well but had a temper at times. Busch often deferred decisions to Driscoll, who Mr Doncheff said could be 'high maintenance.' Mr Doncheff said on the night of the motorhome encounter, Driscoll sent him a screenshot from her earlier text conversation with Busch. He said he thought it might be a good idea for Driscoll to drive to Dover. Doncheff also said he believed Driscoll when she later told him Busch had assaulted her, even though she previously had made what he considered unbelievable statements.

"Barack Obama's move to open relations with Cuba brought an official weather forecast from Havana's state news agency that it would rain flower petals, but Cuban-Americans serving in the U.S. Senate unleashed a stormy tempest on the White House Wednesday. The president made his shocking and historic announcement armed with a new budget that seems to cement the State Department's ability to fund an embassy and pay salaries in Havana. But while two Republicans threatened action when the new GOP-led Congress convenes, they were led by a Democrat who has backed the White House on nearly everything for the last six years. Complicating the saga, Hillary Clinton reportedly engineered the Cuba thaw when she was Obama's secretary of state, and she will likely be saddled with it in the 2016 White House race if the effort fails to move the island nation toward Democratic reforms. New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez lashed out immediately, saying Obama'd decision to free three Cuban spies in exchange for U.S. aid worker Alan Gross had 'vindicated the brutal behavior of the Cuban government.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . DEVASTATED: Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (left) appeared Thursday with Florida GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (center) and Mirta Costa, the mother of Carlos Costa, a pilot from a group called 'Brothers to the Rescue' who was shot down and killed by Cuban fighter jets in 1996 . SPRUNG: Cuban spies Ramon Labanino (left), Geraldo Hernandez (center. left side), Antonio Guerrero (near right) jumped for joy after their release from US custody as a condition of Cuba returning US aid worker Alan Gross to the United States. Fernando Gonzalez (far right) was convicted along with them but released earlier . New Jersey Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, a Cuban-American, disagrees with the president's position on Cuba and gave the White House an earful about appeasing dictators on Wednesday . BOWED, NOT BROKEN: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican son of Cuban emigres, said he would do everything in his power to block the president's new openness with the Castro regime . 'Trading Mr. Gross for three convicted criminals sets an extremely dangerous precedent. It invites dictatorial and rogue regimes to use Americans serving overseas as bargaining chips' and will 'invite further belligerence toward Cuba’s opposition movement and the hardening of the government’s dictatorial hold on its people,' Menendez said. Speaking of Obama's move to normalize diplomatic and trade relations with the communist dictatorship, he claimed 'the United States has just thrown the Cuban regime an economic lifeline.' Menendez is the outgoing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His GOP colleagues, Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, are also Cuban-Americans – and they threatened to stop the White House before its plan to open an embassy in Havana can gain traction. Appearing on CNN, Rubio pledged to block the confirmation of any White House nominees to a new post of Ambassador to Cuba. 'I reserve the right to do everything within the rules of the Senate to prevent that sort of individual from ever even coming up for a vote,' said Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants. On the Fox News Channel, he said Wednesday was 'a terrible day for democracy. It's a sad day for those that want freedom and liberty for the Cuban people.' VIVA MADAME ARCHITECT! Hillary Clinton reportedly engineered Obama's Cuba thaw while she was secretary of state, which could open her up to criticism in a presidential race if the plan flops . Alex Conant, Rubio's chief spokesman, told MailOnline that the senator is still exploring practical avenues to block the president, through both the confirmation process and Congress' power of the purse. 'We're looking into those questions ourselves,' he replied to questions about what Republicans might practically do. 'But I don’t see how a nominee to be ambassador to Cuba gets confirmed in the Senate next year.' In the past, any single U.S. senator could block a floor vote on a presidential nomination and force the nominee's advocates to come up with 60 votes to override his or her action. But through outgoing Senate Majority Leader Harry's Reid's use of what Washington wags called the 'nuclear option,' a simple majority is now all that's needed to approve a presidential appointee. Even so, with Republicans holding 54 seats in the Senate that will open for business in January – and some Democrats angry about Obama's new Cuba policy – actually confirming a nominee could be impossible. Cruz speculated on CNN about Senate action that could block the resumption of diplomatic and trade relations with Havana. 'It's not clear at this point where the votes will be, but I expect in the Senate to see a far more vigorous voice defending our national security interests,' he said. 'And I am hopeful that we will prevent a bad deal and a bad decision. The point I was making on this, there’s a reason why I expect to see bi-partisan cooperation to rein this in. In 2009, the appeasement of Putin didn't work and Putin invaded Ukraine a sovereign nation.' It's unclear what else Congress could do, but some political operatives are buzzing about the power of the purse. Lawmakers approve the money spent by federal agencies, including the State Department. DEFIANT: Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz said he expects 'bi-partisan cooperation to rein this in' among senators in January . But Obama announced his Havana shift while his signature on a new federal budget was just days old. That document may stymie Senate dissenters who just last week would have forbidden Secretary of State John Kerry from spending money on a new Havana embassy and on salaries to staff it. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest thumbed his nose at them during a press briefing on Wednesday, suggesting that the administration already has the funds it needs to follow through on the president's televised announcement since U.S. personnel have been on the ground there for some time. 'As a point of fact, it’s not clear to me that additional appropriations will be necessary to establish an embassy in Cuba,' Earnest said, 'principally because there is already a significant diplomatic presence in Cuba.' 'There is an Interests Section there that represents the interests of the United States. So I don’t know of any specific appropriations request that has been made. There may be one in the future. We'll see.' Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, the Judiciary Committee's outgoing chairman and one of the lawmakers who accompanied Gross back to the U.S. on Wednesday, said it would be 'really, really foolish' to normalize relations with Cuba while no ambassador is in place. And Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who has tried unsuccessfully for 12 years to rally support behind legislation to change U.S.-Cuba policy,said 'it would be really counterproductive to block funding for an embassy.' 'We're going to have a lot more Americans traveling to Cuba. … To tell those Americans who travel there, you're out of luck if you have a problem, I just don't think that's right. BOLD: Obama surprised Washington and the world by announcing that he would scrap the 53-year-old policy of detachment from the communist country of Cuba . However U.S-Cuba relations sort out, Hillary Clinton will get much of the credit or blame. From 2009 until her departure early last year, then-Secretary of State Clinton took the lead when the Obama administration interfaced with Cuban officials, according to Bloomberg News. White House and State Department officials and others told Bloomberg that Clinton pushed hard for the administration to end the half-century-old bans on tourism and trade with the island communist state. While some in the White House resisted her pressure, her brainchild ultimately came to fruition this week. 'Hillary Clinton played a very large role,' New America Foundation senior fellow Steve Clemons told the news outlet. 'Cuba was on her mind,' he said, referring to her final year in office. 'I know that she raised it a number of times. The White House wasn’t ready to move but she kept that in play.' And Arturo Valenzuela, then assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs and Clinton's top Cuba-policy aide, said 'there was strong support in the State Department for liberalizing some of the restrictions and Secretary Clinton was quite clear about that.' Trade relations with the island dictatorship just 90 miles from Florida are governed by the  1996 Helms-Burton Act, which strengthening the trade embargo first put in place by President John F. Kennedy. Only Congress can overturn that law – a near-impossibility with strong GOP majorities in both houses when the 114th Congress convenes just weeks from now. But GOP leaders seem to concede that nothing Obama promised on Wednesday goes beyond what Helms-Burton permits. 'It's not like he's thrown the door open to Cuban cigars coming into Florida and Chevrolets going to Havana,' an aide to a senior House Republican told DailyMail.com. 'But the danger, now that Obama has moved the goalposts, is what the next Democratic administration and the next Democratic Congress could do. And the next. And the next.'","Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Robert Menendez bashed the White House's thaw with the Castro regime .

"Forget beard baubles, one man has turned his lengthy facial hair into a Christmas tree, an octopus, a snowman and even a bowl for eating noodle soup. Isaiah Webb, 30, from San Francisco, has found fame on the internet as Incredibeard, a hirsute and highly creative beard sculptor who says he's 'a simple man on an extraordinary mission'. He hasn't shaved for 16 years and relies on strong styling paste and his wife's imagination to turn his beard - which extends far below his chest - into bizarre works of art. Scroll down for video . Festive fuzz: Isaiah Webb aka Incredibeard posted this design on Instagram, aptly named Douglas Fir-Face . Let it snow: On the first day of #Decembeard, Webb created jaunty Fudgy the BeardMan out of his facial hair . Webb, the man behind the Incredibeard persona, posts pictures of his sculpted facial hair on Tumblr and Instagram every Monday under the hashtag #Monbeardday. Recent beard sculptures include a natty outsize bow tie, an upside-down octopus clutching at his face and for Thanksgiving last month, a cornucopia filled with harvested vegetables. Each week fans write to Webb suggesting ever more outlandish and voluminous sculptures he could create with his beard. This has resulted in some mindboggling creations including a ramen noodle bowl, called the Big Bowl O'Beard Ramen - which he says is one of his favourites - and holders for five beer cups beneath his chin. Webb said he hasn't been clean-shaven in about 16 years and his beard has been left to grow for the past two years. Earlier this year he told Mashable that the decorative displays are a team effort. He designs the creations and wife Aphan styles them. Horn of plenty: For Thanksgiving  Webb fashioned his beard into  Bearducopia and filled it with goodies . Webb's locks are transformed into an octopus attacking him with carefully curled and crafted tentacles . In fact, it was his wife who urged him to grow his beard and pursue this unusual undertaking. '[My wife] was really the one that kept pushing me to grow a beard, then to grow it out long. She is at the heart of Incredibeard,' he said. 'I may come up with the different beard design ideas, but she is the one that styles everything. She brings the beard art to life. Incredibeard would be nothing without her.' The Woodsman moustache wax and beard oil from Texas-based grooming company The Bearded Bastard are all he needs to help shape his facial hair. Kate, 11, a subscriber of News-O-Matic's online children's magazine, asked him to mould this bearded bow tie . 'Like a moth drawn to the flame, this beard can't stay away from my face,' says Isaiah of this geometric style . He received many requests for this uncannilly accurate Batman design, called The Bane of My Beardxistence . He said: 'The greatest and most profound thing a man can do is grow a beard. 'A real beard (one not grown from hormonal imbalance or steroids) is as unique to men as childbearing is to women. 'To truly understand this, you must grow your beard out for at least six months. After six months, the beard will feel just like a child. 'You'll even start having nightmares of shaving it off by accident. After six months, you'll never want to be alone - I mean clean-shaven - again.' Webb manages to eat noodles out of his Big Bowl O'Beard Ramen sculpture - one of his personal favourites . Ingenious: Webb's beard can be divided and turned into holders for five beer cups just beneath his chin .

"New double yellow lines painted on the ground in Cambridge are the shortest in Britain at just 11 inches long. The road markings on Hamilton Road in Chesterton are designed to separate a residents' parking zone with a pay and display area and motorists who park on the lines will face a £50 or £70 fine. It has taken over the accolade of Britain's shortest double yellow lines from a set also in Cambridge - on Humberside Road - which measure just 13 inches. The road markings are designed to separate a residents' parking zone (left) with a pay and display area (right) The lines have taken over the title as Britain's shortest double yellows from another set in Cambridge . But residents and motorists say the markings, which are about the same length as two iPhone 6's, are a 'ridiculous' waste of time and money and branded them 'pathetic'. Jennie Youce, of Burwell, parked up next to the line and said: 'It is absolutely ridiculous. What a complete waste of time and money. I can't understand why they even bothered with it. It is pathetic. 'And the question is, are they the exact distance between the residents' parking bays and the pay and display signs? Because they look a lot wider than that. 'I just can't believe they have spent money on this and wasted time. They must have better things to do.' But Cambridgeshire County Council chiefs have defended painting the lines. A spokesman said: 'Although we have seen people try and squeeze cars into unusual places such as pedestrians crossings, we don't expect anyone to try and park on these lines. Motorists have branded the lines, which are almost a foot-long, as 'pathetic' and a 'waste of time and money' 'This is a genuine attempt to be helpful to motorists by signalling with other signs the divide between pay and display parking and residents' parking on this street. 'The lines mark the border between the two types of parking and aim to help drivers park in the right bays and avoid a fine for parking in the wrong one.'

"Police in North Carolina say they will not bring any charges against a 14-year-old boy who shot an intruder three times, killing him, believing the teen was protecting his home and his sick grandmother inside. The boy, whose father was murdered during a robbery at his auto shop six years ago, was looking after his his grandmother in Mint Hill, near Charlotte, on Tuesday after she recently underwent a hip replacement. The teen, who was sick with bronchitis, was fixing something for his grandmother in the kitchen about 5pm when he heard a window break at the back of the home. Two men - later identified as brothers Isai Delcid, 18, and Carlos Delcid, 22 - were trying to get into the house, police said. Scene: The attempted break-in occurred at this home in Mint Hill, just outside of Charlotte, on Tuesday night . Smashed: This is the window of the house the burglars broke and tried to climb through . Evidence: Police marked a piece a wood on the balcony where a bullet was lodged in the shooting . Proud: George Wyant, the 14-year-old's grandfather, said he is grateful his wife not alone in the house . The boy then ran and grabbed a loaded Glock pistol he knew his grandfather kept for protection. He fired three times at the window, killing Isai Delcid. Shot dead: Isai Delcid, 18, was killed by the teen as he attempted to break into the house . The man is believed to have been outside the home when he was shot. His brother then fled the scene. Moments later the grandmother, Anna Marie Wyant, 73, called 911. 'The man was breaking into the window,' she told the operator, according to The Charlotte Observer. 'He was halfway in the window. 'My grandson told him to stop and get out of here and he didn't so my grandson shot him. 'Somebody just broke in the house and we shot him.' Police who arrived at the scene found the body of Isai Delcid at the back of the house. Carlos Delcid was arrested nearby and has been charged first-degree burglary. The boy's grandfather, George Wyant, said while the situation was unfortunate, he is glad his grandson was home at the time of the attempted break-in and that his wife was not alone. 'Who knows what could have happened,' he told The Observer. Wyant said the boy was familiar with guns. 'I took him to a shooting range,' he said. Investigation: A huge police presence can be seen at the home on Rolling Fields Road on Tuesday . Police: Investigators check out the scene as they prepare to remove the body from the back of the home . 'All the boys, I wanted them to learn gun safety. 'That's what all of us should have for protection. 'These are different ages, and you have to protect yourself.' Sadly the family are no strangers to tragedy. In April, 2008, the Wyants' son-in-law and the 14-year-old's father, Gregorio 'Greg' Hernandez, was shot to death at his automotive shop. 'He was a mechanic,' George Wyant said. 'It was his garage. Someone came in and shot him to death.' Two years later, a jury found Victor Vasquez guilty of first-degree murder for the killing. Vasquez was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

"Arthur Sinodinos, who has been the subject of investigations by corruption watchdog ICAC, resigned as Assistant Treasurer on Friday, fuelling rumours the Prime Minister is about to reshuffle his Cabinet. Mr Abbott has publicly stated that changes were on the cards and there are reports that the front-bench overhaul could take place as early as this weekend. The PM's recent concession that 'there are one or two barnacles still on the ship but by Christmas they will have been dealt with' does not bode well for under fire Defence Minister David Johnston. Last month he gained notoriety for his statement about Australian Submarine Corporation in parliament of 'you wonder why I wouldn't trust them to build a canoe?'. The ICAC findings on Senator Arthur Sinodinos, due early next year, was seen as pivotal to the major reshuffle of the Federal Cabinet, however, the Senate officially resigned as Assistant Treasurer on Friday . Tony Abbott's flagging popularity, which sees him trailing Opposition Leader Bill Shorten by eight points as preferred PM and the Coalition's dip in voter support has a major Cabinet reshuffle on the cards . There are suggestions Tony Abbott could dump David Johnston from the defence portfolio as early as this weekend but any moves against the embattled Defence Minister could ignite tensions with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, a known supporter of the Senator . Pivotal to the shake-up by Tony Abbott will be two roles; the troubled portfolio of defence under the watch of Senator Johnston and the Assistant Treasurer position now relinquished by Senator Sinodinos. A minor reshuffle of the ranks could be put in place before the new working week while a major overhaul of the senior ministry is more likely by the end of January. Asked recently whether it was time to reshape the Coalition front-bench, Mr Abbott said 'at some stage between now and the next election, quite probably, but this is a good front-bench'. Three weeks ago he conceded it had been a tough year at the top and famously stated 'there are one or two barnacles still on the ship but by Christmas they will have been dealt with'. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that a source believes 'the threshold question is Arthur (Sinodinos). The PM doesn't want Arthur to be in the mix but he is'. Mr Abbott was waiting on the outcome of the ICAC inquiry into Senator Sinodinos, which was due in January but could now be delayed. It's believed he will escape any official sanctions over the inquiry into his involvement with Australian Water Holdings. The need, in the eyes of some senior MPs, to get Senator Sinodinos back in the fold as soon as possible was given more currency due to the pressure which has steadily built on Treasurer Joe Hockey over his stalled Budget measures. Senator David Johnston (seated) has been under intense pressure since claiming parliament that he would trust the ASC to 'build canoes' and revelations of lavish wining and dining . But Senator Sinodinos will not return to that prominent position, after announcing his resignation effective Friday. The newspaper also claims that Mr Abbott favours a tweak of the front-bench ahead of bigger changes nearing the end of next year, leading into the 2016 poll. Still, any moves against the Defence Minister could ignite tensions between the PM and the Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, a known supporter of Senator Johnston. The success of Ms Bishop, however, has led to internal calls for more women to ascend to the Coalition front-bench with Higgins MP, Kelly O'Dwyer, seen as a likely candidate for promotion. With the opinion polls showing the Prime Minister and Coalition losing popularity fast, a reshuffle is seen as pivotal by senior Coalition members. Mr Abbott now trails Opposition Leader Bill Shorten by 8 points as preferred prime minister, 47 to 39 and Labor holds a four point lead on two-party preferred basis, 52 per cent to 48.","Assistant Treasurer Arthur Sinodinos resigns on Friday fuelling rumours of a weekend Cabinet reshuffle by the PM .

"Amy Pitcher, 27, claims she was refused entry to Cameo, in Ashford, Kent, because she was too fat .

Amy Pitcher, 27, carefully selected her outfit for the VIP reopening of the newly-refurbished club Cameo, in Ashford, Kent. Miss Pitcher, who is a size 18, was wearing an orange dress, a smart black jacket, and sparkly high heeled shoes. But when they arrived at the club she says they were told all the tickets had gone. Then she claims a doorman told her and her friend, who is a size 20, that they did not have the 'right style' and turned them all away. She said: 'I couldn't believe it. 'He said he didn't want to hurt our feelings, but our size and style didn't go with the image they want to promote. 'I was completely shocked, just stared at him and said ""oh"". 'I am a size 18 and my friend is a 20. I was dressed appropriately and so were my friends. 'I was wearing an orange dress with a black jacket and sparkly heels. 'We didn't cause any trouble, none of us got angry and we just walked away shocked and quite embarrassed.' NHS worker Miss Pitcher, who has been a member of Slimming World for two years, sent an email complaint to manager of the club and got no reply. But the club has since been in touch offering a complimentary night out for her and her friends. Miss Pitcher, of Ashford, added: 'We had a good rant about them when we left and just tried to enjoy the rest of the night as best we could but it completely ruined our evening.

"Invest in a meat probe, ice your cake a week before Christmas and serve a good Rioja with the turkey dinner. These are the top Christmas tips from food experts including chef Marco Pierre White and French patissier Eric Lanlard. The duo, together with Mail On Sunday's wine columnist Olly Smith and cheese expert Charlie Turnbull, share their secrets for perfect Christmas banquet in P&O Cruises’ Christmas campaign. Celebrity-worth dinner: Marco Pierre White advises to use a meat probe for the perfect turkey . The secret of cooking the perfect turkey? According to Pierre White you can’t do it without a meat probe. He says: 'No bird in this world has its presence on the table like a turkey, it’s majestic. But the secret of cooking a perfect turkey ... is a meat probe.' He adds: 'Christmas lunch without question is the most important lunch of the year, but lots of people panic, why because they don’t apply a strategy in what they’re doing.' And Lanlard advises home bakers not to to ice and decorate Christmas cakes too much in advance. Patissier Eric Lanlard advice is to ice your cake a week before Christmas Day . Cheese expert and judge Charlie Turnbull’s (right) last-minute tip for top-notch Christmas canapes is to pop a spoonful of mincemeat into a canape case with a bit of grape and Stilton on top (left) bake it in the oven . In the one-and-a-half-minute video, he says: 'When it comes to ice and decorate your Christmas cake, don’t do it too much in advance, just do it one week before Christmas. So the icing don’t change colour and so the icing don’t dry out.' Cheese expert and judge Charlie Turnbull’s last-minute tip for top-notch Christmas canapes is to take a pop a spoonful of mincemeat into a canape case with a bit of grape and Stilton on top. 'Bang it in the oven for a quick blast of heat and in five minutes, you’ll have a perfect canape for unexpected guests,' he suggests. Wine expert Olly Smith (left) suggests making Santa a G&T (right) instead of leaving a glass of wine or port . Or for the more adventurous, he advises: 'You probably haven’t tried this so just trust me, it’s really good. 'Get a little bit of goat’s cheese have a little bit of honey on it, I know it sounds a bit odd but it really lifts it and it’s really light and pleasant once you’ve had all that heavy turkey and stuf... lovely way to finish a meal.' Stuck for ideas for which wine to serve with Christmas dinner? You can't go wrong with a Rioja, according to expert, Olly Smith. And he adds, when it comes to leaving a tipple out for Santa, ditch the traditional sherry and go for something more modern. Olly says in the footage: 'Father Christmas he’s such a great guy, but do you know what I think he must get a little bored of all the and sherry and the port that’s left out for him. 'I think we should leave him the world’s best gin and tonic and my tip for doing that is to freeze the tonic water in an ice cube tray and then add it to the drink, as they dissolve they reinforce the flavour and Santa’s going to be delighted.'","Food experts share their cooking tips in Christmas campaign video .

"Most people hoping to celebrate with glass or two of champagne this festive season will probably try to avoid agitating their bottle of bubbly before serving. Shaking bottles of champagne has become widely associated with flying corks and the kind of messy spraying of liquid normally restricted to the winners podium in Formula One. But new research now suggests that actually giving your bottle of champagne a good shake before serving may help to reduce the risk of unwanted explosions upon opening. Scroll down for video . Cheers! French researchers have shown that shaking a bottle of champagne actually decreases the pressure inside and in turn reduces the risk of unwanted explosions when opening a bottle of bubbly . French scientists have found that vigorously shaking a bottle of champagne can actually decrease the pressure that builds up inside the bottle. The key, it seems, is waiting for the right amount of time before opening the bottle. Researchers have found that applying a magnetic field to an antifoaming agent, they can reduce the foaming effect to a huge degree - and it could bring the cost of beer down in future. Zahra Shokribousjein, from the Centre for Food and Microbial Biology in Belgium, studied the effect of a bottle of beer overfoaming. Known as gushing, it occurs when fungi infect the beer’s malt base, latching on with surface proteins called hydrophobins. When the beer is being brewed, these hydrophobins attract carbon dioxide molecules, which make the beer bubbly. To counteract the effects, brewers use hops extract, which is an antifoaming agent that binds to the proteins and prevents them attracting CO2, but it is not wholly effective. The latest study though found that when a magnetic field was applied to malt, the hops extract was broken into smaller particles. They found that this increased the effectiveness of the antifoaming agent, preventing CO2 from binding with the hydrophobins. In fact, the method was so effective that much lower amounts of hops extract were needed, reducing the cost of brewing the beer in the first place. And the process, which takes only a minute, also made the beer taste less bitter. They found that although the pressure initially drops when champagne is shaken, huge numbers of 'super critical' bubbles form in the neck of the bottle. This is what leads to the characteristic effervescence that occurs when a bottle is opened. However, after around 40 seconds the number of bubbles in this state begins to decrease until they have completely disappeared 220 seconds - just over three and half minutes - after shaking. At the same time, the pressure inside the bottle starts to increase again but plateaus around 0.1 bar less than the original value. Professor Gérard Liger-Belair, who led the research at the University of Reims in Champagne-Ardenne, said: 'A popular belief is that the pressure increases when a bottle is shaken and that is the reason for gushing of the liquid when the bottle is opened. 'We show that shaking in fact produces a small but opposite effect, in the form of a transient pressure decrease.' However, their research also cautions against shaking bottles of fizzy drink that have been resealed after opening as this can result in an increase in pressure. The explanation for this counter-intuitive behaviour of champagne has to do with the dynamics of the bubbles inside the liquid. While sealed, the carbon dioxide and alcoholic liquid form an equilibrium where the gas is continiously dissolving and effervescing at the same rate. Shaking however instantaneously creates lots of large bubbles as the free gas and liquid mix. However, as these bubbles start to collapse, some of the gas they contain in is temporarily dissolved in the liquid, reducing the amount of free gas in the bottle. As gas requires more space than liquid, this reduces the pressure on the cork. The findings build on previous work by Professor Liger-Belair that showed cooling bottles of champagne can reduce the speed of the cork as it leaves the bottle. The scientists tested champagne and sparkling wine in adapted bottles (illustrated, right) and water in an aluminum container (illustrated, left) which were shaken for 20 seconds, allowing pressure to be measured . He recommended cooling the bottle to 39 degrees F (4C), which causes the cork to travel at three quarters of the speed when it has been left at room temperature. Their latest study now suggests that also giving the bottle a shake a minute or two before serving can also help to keep prevent any mess accidents. It is thought that as many as 900,000 people injure themselves or cause damage with flying champagne corks or by spilling the liquid each year. Around eight per cent of these are due to a cork hitting someone in the face, according to a survey by Morrisons in 2011. Damage to lights, ornaments, furniture, fittings and clothing account for around 15 per cent of the champagne related incidents. Shaking causes a pressure to drop inside the champagne bottle and then to slowly rise before plateauing at a level less than it was originally . Doctors have also warned that flying corks can cause serious eye injuries and even blindness in the most extreme cases. Professor Liger-Belair has also found that the average glass of champagne produces around one million bubbles - provided it is not drunk. In the latest study, which he conducted along with with scientists at the Centre de Recherche Paul Pascal in Pessac, France, the researchers tested the effect of shaking champagne, the sparkling white wine Blanc Foussy and carbonated water after shaking them for 20 seconds. They found that the pressure in each of these liquids dropped after shaking before slowing increasing again over time. In the carbonated water there appeared to be an overall decrease in pressure after shaking of around 0.1 bar. Tests in the alcoholic wines, which have different viscocities to water, only showed slight differences compared to the water, according to the study, which is published online in the Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. They also filmed the formation of bubbles inside bottles of champagne after they had been shaken and found that huge numbers of bubbles initially form when shaken but after 220 seconds they have completely disappeared. Professor Liger-Belair said: 'If opening occurs just after shaking, the immense majority of bubbles are super-critical, and then effervescence starts fiercely. 'There is no pressure increase prior to opening, and the pressure in the bottle neck keeps close to zero once the bottle is opened. 'Gushing only lasts for a few seconds, but can be prolonged by continuous shaking of the bottle. Gushing lasts as long as the generated bubbles are larger than the critical size.' Scientists say that before shaking the carbon dioxide gas and champagne liquid is in equillibirium (left) but shaking causes bubbles to form as the two mix toghether (b) and then as the bubbles collapse some of the CO2 in the bubbles dissolves in the liquid, meaning there is less free gas in the bottle to create pressure (c)","Researchers from the University of Reims in  France found pressure inside bottles of champagne drop by 0.1 bar after 20 seconds of shaking .
Pressure drop is due to collapse of bubbles that form during the shaking .
This causes some of the gas in the bubbles to be dissolved in the liquid .
All the bubbles formed by shaking disappear after around 220 seconds ."

"New Zealand police have apologised after assuming that a driver stopped on a rural Coromandel highway for driving with a kayak strapped sideways on its roof was an Irish tourist. District Road Policing Manager, Inspector Freda Grace, said that when the officer stopped the man on SH25 to speak to him about the danger his kayak was posing to other road users, the man's accent made her assume he was Irish, and so was not aware of the road laws in the country. The 'Irish' driver was stopped by Waikato Police for driving with his kayak lying sideways across his car's roof . 'Unfortunately we did not check his identity documents and as a result the driver was issued a warning, ordered to remove the kayak and told to head back into town to get suitable transport arranged for the kayak before continuing his journey,' Inspector Grace said in a statement. 'In this case the officer believed obtaining compliance from the motorist and preventing a crash was a more effective outcome than issuing the driver a fine and she believed she was enhancing foreign relations.' 'Waikato Police wish to offer an unreserved apology to any persons of Irish descent we may have offended,' said Inspector Grace. New Zealand is renowned for its beauty, not for spotting Irish accents . Mrs Grace said that regardless of the driver's nationality, the main focus of the incident remained road safety and the risks posed by the driver to other road users should not be forgotten. 'After all, over the next couple of weeks the population of the Coromandel is expected to rise from 15,000 to over 130,000. At any one time around 80 per cent of motorists on the region's roads will be visitors of one sought or another and we will all need to drive safe to reach the beach this summer,' she said.","A driver was stopped by Waikato Police on a rural Coromandel highway for driving with his kayak strapped sideways across his car's roof .

"Christmas trees have become easier to decorate because they have fewer branches at the top - after two consecutive mild winters, growers claimed yesterday. Many of the popular Nordmann Fir trees grown in England have big gaps between their top branches because they have grown upwards too quickly in the unseasonal weather. Experts say the perfect Christmas tree should have around 9in to 15in gaps between its branches but two good growing seasons means the branches at the top of this year's trees are very sparse. Easier to decorate: Grower Vincent Thurkettle, 58, harvests his  Nordmann trees in Great Hockham, Norfolk . Two mild winters: Mr Thurkettle said growers 'need colder winters to create the perfect Christmas tree' This year's mild weather means the bottoms of the trees are also much more bushy than normal. Vincent Thurkettle, 58, who grows Norway Spruce, Blue Spruce and Nordmann Firs at Manor Farm in Great Hockham, Norfolk, said growers ‘need colder winters to create the perfect Christmas tree’. He added: ‘We have had two long mild summers and a mild last winter, which means the trees have grown too fast and the distance between the rings of branches is bigger than usual. ‘Luckily most of our customers are seeing this as a positive because it makes it easier to dress the tree with tinsel and large baubles which hang well in the gaps.’ Different shape: This year's mild weather means the bottoms of the trees are much more bushy than normal . Choices: Many Christmas tree customers are said to be selecting trees with bigger gaps between branches . Improvements: The milder weather also means the needles on the Christmas tree are better than usual . Colin Palmer, who runs Coddington Christmas Tree Farm near Ledbury in Herefordshire, said it was the taller Nordmann Firs over 6ft which had mainly been effected. But he added that many of his customers were actually selecting the trees which had bigger gaps between their branches. Mr Palmer said: ‘My clients have welcomed it as it makes it easier for them to decorate the tree and we've found people have actually been selecting these trees. ‘This year was the best growing season for over a decade so there has been robust growth and it means the top shoots up quickly and the lower part of the tree is even more bushy than usual.’ The milder weather also means the needles on the Christmas tree are better than usual. Mr Thurkettle added: ‘The foliage is the best I have ever seen. It is beautiful, green and lush and really silky and soft. The needles are as good as they can ever be.’","Nordmann Fir trees in England have big gaps between top branches .

"The US Army is set to launch the first of two blimps designed to help the military detect and destroy cruise missiles or rogue aircraft incursions targeting America's East Coast cities. The first radar-toting vehicle will be set airborne next week as part of a three-year test of the latest defense system at an Army facility near Baltimore, Maryland. When fully deployed next February, the $2.8billion system will feature two, unmanned, helium-filled aerostats - able to scan the oceans and coastline in a 340-mile radius. Defense project: The US Army is set to launch the first of two blimps designed to help the military detect and destroy cruise missiles targeting the nation's capital or other major East Coast cities . One balloon will continuously scan in a circle from upstate New York to North Carolina's Outer Banks, and as far west as central Ohio. The other will carry precision radar to help the military on the ground to pinpoint targets. The system is called JLENS - short for Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System. The project, built by Raytheon Co. of Waltham, Massachusetts, and TCOM L.P. of Columbia, Maryland, has cost the government about $2.8 billion so far. And last week Congress approved another $43.3 million for the first year of the test. Reducing costs: Despite the project setting the US government back by £2.8billion, experts say the airships will save money in the long run by reducing the need for surveillance by conventional aircraft . Despite the staggering cost, supporters of the project say JLENS will save money in the long run by reducing the need for surveillance by conventional aircraft. 'The analysis we've done says it's about five to seven times less than operating a fleet of aircraft to cover the same area over the same time period,' said Douglas Burgess, Raytheon's JLENS program director. The white balloons, each 80 yards long, are part of a new wave of lighter-than-air surveillance equipment. Testing: A giant radar dome is seen on the bottom of the unmanned aerostat, which will be launched next week . They will not carry weapons as enemy missiles would be destroyed by air, ground or ship-based weapons. Major General Glen Bramhall, commander of the 263rd Army Air and Missile Defense, said: 'We can defeat cruise missiles but we have limited capability to detect. 'And so, with an elevated sensor, such as JLENS, and the ability to look out over the horizon, now we have the ability to detect and to enable our systems to defeat cruise missiles.' The government has also deployed tethered airships near the Mexican border, in Iraq and Afghanistan and in the Caribbean Ocean to combat drug smuggling. The airships at Aberdeen, Maryland, will be the first of their type near a major East Coast city, visible from Interstate 95. Plan: When fully deployed next spring, the system will feature two, unmanned, helium-filled aerostats, tethered to concrete pads 4 miles apart . The military has insisted that the balloons will not carry cameras in response to privacy campaigners' concerns about snooping. But David Rocah, of the American Civil Liberties Union in Maryland, said the group was leery of the airships' ability to constantly monitor moving objects, including cars on the ground. Mr Bramhall says the radar is unable to identify individuals or record cellphone conversations. 'The mission is not to spy on U.S. citizens. It is not designed for that,' he said.","First of two airships will be launched next week at Army facility in Maryland .

'Whatever the Thai government decides in this case, we . believe these two young people did not commit this crime,' said . Htoo Chit, the Myanmar committee's spokesman. The murders of the two tourists dealt a blow to Thailand's vital tourism industry, which generates almost 10 per cent of the  gross domestic product. The country was already struggling to recover from months of political upheaval that culminated in a May 22 coup, with the unrest keeping some visitors away, and the government called on police to solve the case quickly. But human rights groups have accused Thai authorities of using the men as scapegoats. Win Zaw Htun (left) and Zaw Lin (right )took part in a reconstruction on Koh Tao, Thailand, after Thai police said DNA from the men matched samples found on victims . The two suspects were paraded in front of cameras after apparently making murder confessions, but it was reported that a Burmese embassy official later formally retracted their confessions amid allegations the pair were tortured. In November British detectives traveled to Thailand to review the police investigation into the murders after widespread criticism of blunders including allowing reporters to trample over the crime scene. But last month, the victims' families said they had seen strong evidence against the suspects and expressed confidence in the case. 'There is a great deal of detail and vast areas of investigative work which has been shared with us,' Ms Witheridge's family said in a statement released through Britain's Foreign Office.

Mr Miller's family has urged restraint from rights groups and the media while the court case unfolds. 'The support for the Myanmar suspects has been strong and vocal, but please do not jump to conclusions until you have considered the evidence from both sides in full,' Miller's family said in its statement. They added: 'They must respond to these charges, and their arguments must be considered with the same scrutiny as those of the prosecution.

"A health and safety expert was too ill too drive when he blacked out at the wheel and smashed into a bright A-Level student's car, a High Court judge has ruled. Peter Haynes will have to pay substantial damages to 19-year-old Simon Green, who was left with a permanent brain injury after the horror crash on the A11 in Norfolk. Mr Haynes, 56, told London's High Court he was not to blame because he was in a state of 'automatism', similar to sleepwalking, after abdominal pain caused him to pass out. Horror crash: Health and safety consultant Peter Haynes (left) will have to pay substantial damages to  Simon Green (right), who was left with life-changing brain damage after Mr Haynes passed out at the wheel on the A11 . But today Mr Justice Supperstone ruled Mr Haynes was liable for the crash, because he should not have driven once he realised he was ill. The businessman, of Metfield, Suffolk, was on his way home from a conference in Norwich in March 2012 when he passed out  on a slip road to the dual carriageway near the village of Cringleford. The self-employed health and safety consultant's Toyota Land Cruiser hit the rear of student Mr Green's Volkswagen Polo, shunting it under the Land Rover in front. Mr Green, a high-achieving A-level student, suffered life-changing brain damage in the crash and it was 'remarkable' that he survived at all, the case heard. He launched a civil case to reclaim damages from the health and safety expert, insisting he was responsible for causing the pile-up. Mr Green sued Mr Haynes at the High Court (pictured), where he relied on the rare defence of automatism . People claiming 'automatism' - where they had no control over their actions through no fault of their own - has made headlines after defendants accused of sex offences claimed they acted in their sleep. It has its origins in 19th Century definitions of 'insanity' but now stands as a separate defence for people with no mental health issues. The defence is wide-ranging and open-ended - it can include sleep disorders or medical conditions such as an epileptic fit or a hypoglycaemic attack. In one criminal case in August, a driver was acquitted after a jury heard he caused a crash which killed a married couple because he was choking on a sweet. Other examples could include a swarm of bees flying into a car. The defence is almost completely unheard of in civil cases, however. One person involved in Mr Haynes' case said it the first example he had seen in more than 20 years. There are no statistics on how often the defence is pleaded or succeeds, and last year Parliament's Law Commission said it should be scrapped in criminal cases altogether. The five-strong panel led by Lord Justice Lloyd Jones said the wording should be changed to 'not criminally responsible by reason of recognised medical condition', making the law less open to interpretation. In his defence, Mr Haynes said the crash occurred after he had a blackout triggered by abdominal pain and he was in a state of 'automatism', meaning he was carrying out actions over which he had no control. Lawyers for Mr Green accepted that Mr Haynes passed out seconds before the collision - but said he was negligent in choosing to drive when he did, and and in the manner of his driving. The judge said Mr Haynes had felt very unwell with an upset stomach when he was still at the conference and rang his wife, asking her to make him a doctor's appointment. But he still decided to drive home, and 'in all likelihood' drove close to 70mph in the outside lane which would have made it more difficult to pull over. Had he been driving slowly and in the inside lane, ready to pull over, the accident would have been avoided. The judge said: 'In my judgment, having regard to the true state of the defendant's health when he left the conference centre, he should have appreciated the risk of his condition getting worse and that, if it did, his judgment and ability to drive was likely to be impaired. 'On a balance of probabilities, I find that the defendant should not have driven on leaving the conference centre after he felt so unwell, and that he was in breach of his duty to other road users in so doing.' The amount of damages to be awarded to Mr Green, now 22, of Swaffham, Norfolk, will be assessed at a later date. There was no mention in court of whether Mr Haynes ever faced a criminal investigation.","Peter Haynes blacked out in his Toyota Land Cruiser on A11 in Norfolk .

"A fiance hanged himself just months before he was due to get married after suffering a 'bad trip' triggered by recreational use of cocaine, an inquest heard today. Window fitter David Curson, 23, described as 'happy-go-lucky' by family and colleagues, had been excitedly preparing for his wedding to fiancee Anne-Marie Johnson, an inquest in Bolton was told. The couple had been planning to buy a house together and the night before he died Mr Curson had been looking at mortgage options. Window fitter David Curson, 23, (pictured) was an occasional user of cocaine before agreeing to give it up at the request of his fiancee Anne-Marie Johnson (left), an inquest in Bolton was told . But the inquest was told that the occasional cocaine user - who had agreed to give it up at the request of his fiancee - had taken the drug again while house-sitting for his mother. As the effects wore off he was plunged into a lethally depressive 'comedown', the coroner heard. He was found dead by his father John the following day after a work colleague was unable to raise him, with a note by his side. Coroner Jennifer Leeming ruled Mr Curson may not have intended to take his own life, and recorded a narrative verdict. The hearing was told that 'happy-go-lucky' Mr Curson, from Golborne, near Wigan, enjoyed his job and was a good worker, . In a statement his fiancee Miss Johnson said the couple were planning to buy a house together and added: 'His death has come as such a shock. I do not understand why he would take his own life. I loved him very much. He was a lovely man.' She said Mr Curson had told her he occasionally took cocaine but she had asked him to stop. The hearing was told that 'happy-go-lucky' Mr Curson, from Golborne, near Wigan, enjoyed his job and was engaged. The couple were said to have been 'very happy and were planning to their future together' She added: 'David was certainly not a regular user and because you were very much against it he said he would not use it again. You tell me that there was not a reason that you were aware of that he would take his own life.' She said she last saw her fiancée the day before he died on October 28 said said 'everything was absolutely fine' and that they had even spoken about applying for a mortgage. Mr Curson's work colleague Brian Collard said the pair had had a couple of beers together the night before Mr Curson died and that he had wanted some financial advice about his credit rating. He said: 'I got on very well with David. He was a very good worker. He liked to have laugh and a joke. I would describe him as a happy-go-lucky person. I did not think he had a care in the world and I did not think he was likely to be easily depressed. 'He wanted some financial advice. He had seen a house he liked and he was considering a mortgage for the house he wanted for himself and his fiancée. 'He wanted to know how to access his credit rating before he made an appointment with the bank. He seemed normal not anxious or stressed. Because we had a close friendship I feel if he had felt worried, he probably would have said something to me.' The inquest was told he started taking the drug again while house-sitting for his mother and as the effects wore off he was plunged into a lethally depressive 'comedown'. A coroner recorded a narrative verdict . Dr Naveen Sharma, a consultant histopathologist, said tests showed alcohol and cocaine in Mr Curson's system and said: 'It was clearly recent - in the house leading up to his death. It is difficult to say if it had any effect on the state of his mind. It is dependent on the tolerance of the individual. Cocaine has an accelerant affect and a comedown affect. It depends on tolerance. 'Sometimes people comedown quite sharply in relation to the com down effect of cocaine. If everybody agrees that is a conclusion in the absence of any other explanation. ' In a statement Mr Curson's father John said: 'David's death is inexplicable and came as a terrible shock to all his friends and family. The loss of David is so hard to bear. We are all devastated by his death. 'This has affected not only his family but all those close friends who lived him very much. I could not have asked for a better son. He had everything going for him. He was a happy-go-lucky man and had such a bright future ahead of him.' Recording a narrative verdict, Miss Leeming said: 'I do not think he was taking cocaine regularly and that is part of the issue. I do not think people understand that if you have a 'bad trip' as it was called in the 60s they do not understand how dangerous it can be in terms of your mental state. 'What happened here seems to be completely inexplicable and I just wonder whether his mind was affect by the depressive effect of the cocaine bearing in mind there is no other possible explanation for why this has happened. 'The problem is when people take cocaine they think are fine. They think this is fine, this is okay. If you say to people who take it recreationally ""you are putting yourself at risk"" they say ""no I am fine. I just take it every Friday."" 'People do not understand the risk of the depressive affect from one particular batch. In the same way they do not understand the risk of overdose because of having a particularly pure batch. I do wonder if it had some effect on his mind. This is a gentleman who had no reason to end his life.' She added: 'There is really no other way to put other than to say he hanged himself because that is what happened but the state of his mind when he did it is unclear. 'To record that someone took their own life I have to be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that they understood what they were doing and intended the act. I cannot be satisfied by that here beyond all reasonable doubt.' According the national drug education service FRANK, users of cocaine experience a long 'comedown' as the effects of the drug wear off and they feel depressed and run down.

"An Oklahoma City councillor donated a kidney to someone he barely knew on Monday and credited his strong faith for inspiring him. Owasso City Councillor Chris Kelley, 34, and Paul Kropp, 46, had met only a couple of times before but the pair just got a whole lot closer after Kelley gave Kropp his kidney in a life-saving rare organ donation surgery. 'Words can’t describe what he’s done for me,' said Kropp, to Tulsa World. Blessed: Paul Kropp, 46, was given a life-saving kidney donation from Owasso City Councillor Chris Kelley, 34, whom he'd only met a few times before . Blood brothers: 'He’s given me life,' said Kropp of Kelley as he held back tears from his hospital bed . 'He’s given me life,' said Kropp as he held back tears. Kropp told Tulsa World that he was never the type to get a check-up and remained in relatively good health for most of his life. All of that changed in February of this year when a friend of Kropp died at age 50 without warning and Kropp decided it would be a good idea to see a doctor to evaluate his own well-being a few months later. Following the check-up, the doctor gave Kropp some unfortunate news. Kropp was in renal failure and was told to report home and go to Hillcrest Medical Center where he was fitted for a catheter for dialysis. Kropp lost 18 pounds in just one week and the function level of his kidneys dropped from eight per cent to four per cent. Kropp needed a new functioning kidney and the gift Kelley gave him on Monday is nothing short of a miracle. Doctors told Kropp to survive that he would need to get a new kidney from a living donor. Most kidney donations come from cadavers but the average wait for receiving one can take up to four years. Kropp’s wife Missy offered her kidney but she was turned down because she has diabetes. Miracle: Had Kropp not had undergone a routine check-up he may not even know that his kidney was failing . Out of desperation, Missy took to social media to talk about her husband’s need for a living donor. Kelley saw the post and felt an explainable urge to help a man he’d met only a handful of times before. ‘I’m a spiritual guy,’ Kelley said in an interview last week. ‘I’ve gone to church all my life. But I can’t say I’ve ever had something happen to me where I just felt that I was not making the decision. I read this, and I just felt moved to do something.’ Kelley was tested by the hospital and the kidney was a fit and so he made the decision that would save Kropp’s life. Kelley’s wife Kathy also urged him to give Kropp the gift he would keep with him for the rest of his life. ‘It’s a sacrifice,’ said Kelley. ‘After feeling what I have felt the last couple of days, I think I agree with that a little more. But really it’s such a privilege because you’re in a position where I’m going to be up and around in two weeks and my life’s going to be back to normal. New beginnings: Kelley may have lost his liver by giving it to Kropp but what he gained was a lifetime friendship . ‘You see what it means to these guys here, and it means the world to me. … It feels great.’ The City Council held a meeting on Tuesday and the members were blown away by Kelley’s great deed. ‘I’m absolutely blown away by what Councillor Kelley has done,’ said Mayor Jeri Moberly . ‘I feel honored to know someone who would give this gift that is beyond measure. … Chris’ gift is a shining example of selflessness,’ she added. ‘When you hear about something like this, you tend to ask yourself, “Would I do that?” said Warren Lehr, Owasso’s city manager/ . ‘For family, for a close friend? Maybe. But for a friend of a friend? I don’t know of many people who would do that.’ Kropp feels blessed for people like Kelley and if he has one word of advice for anyone reading it’s they go to the doctor and get a check-up that just might save their life.","Owasso City Councillor Chris Kelley, 34, and Paul Kropp, 46, only met a couple of times but Kelley gave Kropp his kidney and saved his life .

"Official report: Lord Myners' review has flattened claims that taxpayers may have lost £1billion as the Government privatisation undervalued Royal Mail . Taxpayers were short-changed by £180million after the sale of Royal Mail - but not the £1billion predicted at the time, an official report said today. There was fury during the sale last October when shares were sold for 330p, raising almost £2billion, but within a week they were worth 550p. Opponents said the Government had mishandled the deal and could have received millions more for the public purse when the privatisation went ahead. Former city minister Lord Myners said today the sell-off was executed with 'considerable professionalism' and the Government and taxpayer achieved 'significant value'. He said that raising the share price sale level by more than 30p to 350p could have put the whole deal at risk. This would have raised the extra £180million. The Government sold 60 per cent of Royal Mail. Lord Myners said: 'This is a seminal piece of work which has the potential to fundamentally alter the way companies are floated on the UK stock market and I look forward to seeing how this develops. 'I regard the Royal Mail privatisation to have been a complex exercise executed with considerable professionalism. Many previous governments attempted to sell but failed. The sale was done against a backdrop of global economic uncertainty and a threat of industrial action, which go a long way towards explaining the cautious approach taken throughout the process. 'There were also some inherent complexities built into the transaction, such as a generous retail offer, which added to this caution. The Government adopted conventional standard market practices built up over time. 'We found no evidence to challenge the general assertion that an IPO price greater than 350-360p could have been achieved and we accept that a decision to revise the range would have come with added uncertainty and risk. The right decisions were made. 'We do not believe that a price anywhere near the levels seen in the aftermarket could have been achieved at listing. The aftermarket conditions were extraordinary, unpredictable and did not reflect significant value 'left on the table' as some concluded at the time. The Government and taxpayer achieved significant value.' Shares shortfall: There was fury when the sale went through because shares went for 330p - only to reach 550p within a week . The National Audit Office criticised the flotation earlier this year and an influential committee of MPs made the claim in July that taxpayers may have lost £1billion as the Government privatisation undervalued Royal Mail. The Business Select Committee said taxpayers missed out on ‘significant value’ when the Government pushed through flotation of part of its stake in the mail delivery firm but did not focus on getting the best price for taxpayers. The MPs claimed the Government feared ‘failing’ over the controversial sell-off and received poor advice. The Business Select Committee recommended changes for future sell-offs suggesting that companies that advise the Government on share issues should be excluded from becoming a preferred investor. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'I am very grateful to Lord Myners and his expert panel for this important and insightful report. It contains a number of significant proposals which could make the general process of future sales more transparent. 'I would encourage financial regulators and those bringing companies to market to engage in this debate. In particular they should explore how digital auctions could, in certain circumstances, make the sale process much more flexible. 'I also welcome his comment that the sale was executed with considerable professionalism and that any decision to try to have priced the shares higher would have been risky. We were right not to take that risk.'","Deal was done last October for 330p a share - but  reached 550p days later .

"Russia's richest men have watched helplessly over the past 48 hours as vast sums of their wealth have evaporated thanks to their crumbling economy. Alisher Usmanov, a steel magnate who owns a third of Arsenal football club, and Roman Abramovich, an oil tycoon who owns rival Chelsea, have lost more than £800million between them. Sergey Galitsky, who owns Russia's largest supermarket chain, was the biggest loser, seeing £900million disappear in two days as the value of the Russian rouble tumbled. Alisher Usmanov (left) has lost an estimated £500million after the rouble went into meltdown two days ago, while fellow steel magnate Roman Abromovich has lost £288million . The collapse of Russia's currency, which began two days ago after an interest rate hike lead to panic among investors, also threatens Russia's stranglehold on the top of the Rich List. Mr Usmanov, who once topped the Sunday Times list, could drop from second to ninth in the table, leaving not a single Russian in the top five, compared with 2013 when there were two. Mr Abramovich, meanwhile, could drop from number nine to number 11, behind the Duke of Westminster, unless the rouble recovers in the coming days. On Tuesday the currency lost 20 per cent of its value in just a few hours, dropping to an all-time low of almost 80 roubles per dollar. Yesterday the value rose and fell sharply, causing Apple to suspend online sales and forcing shops to announce sharp price rises, leading to panic buying. Today the rouble is trading at 61 to the dollar, according to Xe.com, meaning it has gained back a lot of ground but is still below the historic low of 60 which caused the initial panic. Despite the huge drops in wealth most Russian billionaires have seen in the last few days, two men have managed to buck the trend, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires index. Vladmir Potanin, who made his fortune selling shares in public assets after the fall of the Soviet Union, managed to make £117million, leaving him with an estimated fortune of £7.6billion. Meanwhile financial manager Andrey Melnichenko raked in £32million while most of his fellow countrymen lost out. In total the 15 richest Russians, who control £98.6billion between them, lost £5.5billion in just 48 hours as Russia's economy tumbled causing the largest crisis of Vladimir Putin's leadership. President Putin is due to give his annual end-of-year address later today, which last year lasted for four hours. However the timing could hardly be worse this year and is likely to be completely overshadowed by Russia's economic woes. The country's finances have been left in a poor state largely due to a fall in the price of crude oil as Saudi Arabia has flooded the marketplace with reserves, driving value down. Economic sanctions from Europe and the U.S. over the situation in Ukraine have not helped, with Obama due to sign legislation passing new measures in the coming days. Vladimir Putin is facing the largest crisis of his leadership after the currency collapsed, with his end-of-year speech today (pictured) being overshadowed by the crisis .","Sergey Galitsky, who owns Russia's largest supermarket, lost £900million .

"Horror: Intelligence chiefs are investigating the links between Dr Mirza Tariq Ali and the Taliban death squad that murdered 132 children . Links between a fugitive NHS surgeon and commanders of the Taliban suicide cell who massacred 132 school children are being investigated by Pakistani intelligence officers. Mirza Tariq Ali, who fled the UK last year to join jihadi forces, is said to be a senior Taliban commander hiding in the tribal areas of Pakistan with those who controlled the six gunmen responsible for Pakistan’s worst terrorist atrocity. An associate in the UK of controversial hate preacher Anjem Choudary, the 39 year-old recently appeared in a chilling Taliban recruitment video threatening the Pakistan Army. Significantly, the Taliban has admitted responsibility for the school atrocity and said it was to avenge the deaths of their women and children in a six-month long army offensive. Ali, from East London, practised for nine years in London and Cambridge, and slipped out of the UK last year in a bid to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State while awaiting trial at the Old Bailey. However, he was detained by the Croatian authorities, before being deported to Pakistan, his country of origin, where he joined-up with the Taliban. Investigators in Peshawar said yesterday that they believed several factions of the Pakistan Taliban – co-ordinated from neighbouring Afghanistan – were behind the attack on the Army Public School in the frontier city that killed 150. Scroll down for video . In one chilling intercepted telephone call between the death squad and their commanders at the height of the slaughter, a gunman is said to ask : ‘We have killed all the children, now what do we do?’ He is told to wait for the arrival of the commandos trying to rescue the surviving children and detonate their suicide vests killing as many soldiers as possible. Police and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) are said to have dozens of intercepted calls recorded before and during last Tuesday’s attack linked to Taliban commanders and co-ordinators on both sides of the Afghan border. Jihadi: Dr Mirza Tariq Ali has now emerged as a senior Pakistan Taliban commander and recently appeared in a chilling recruitment video (pictured) in which he made threats against the Pakistan army . Hunted: The order for the school raid was given by the overall leader of the Pakistani Taliban Maulana Fazlullah (pictured) whose previous crimes include ordering the failed murder of teenage campaigner Malala .

Taliban militant Hafiz Saeed Khan is understood to have been one of the Peshawar massacre masterminds . Hafiz Saeed Khan (centre) is understood to be one of six commanders giving instructions to the killers . Officials confirmed they are looking for links with Ali, whose rise to prominence since arrival with the Taliban is said to have been rapid and now uses the name Dr Abu Obaidah Al-Islamabadi. He was described as ‘someone of interest’ to the mass murder inquiry and wider war against the Taliban. Ali was arrested and charged with violent disorder last year following a demonstration in Central London calling for jihad in Syria organised by the East London-based Chodary. But before the start of his trial in May this year he skipped bail and left the UK. He was subsequently convicted in his absence at the Old Bailey and sentenced to 15 months in jail in the first-ever successful prosecution for Islamic sectarian violence in Britain after he was seen hitting a bystander over the head with a pole. Ali was also struck off by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) after a hearing in Manchester. Speaking last month on a Taliban video in both Urdu and English, Ali said he did surgical training in London and ‘at the same time I called the non-Muslims to Islam’. He urged those fighting for the army in Pakistan to stop being ‘an ally of Kuffar (non-believers) and resisting against the implementation of Shariah.’ Up to 20 commanders believed to be linked to the Peshawar murders operating with different wings of the Taliban are said to have been involved in helping to orchestrate the outrage masterminded by Maulana Fazlullah, the group’s Pakistani commander. Known as ‘Radio Mullah’ because of his previous propaganda broadcasts, Fazlullah is believed to be operating in the eastern Afghan provinces of Kunar and Nuristan, where Afghanistan’s military have little influence.

One of the targets of his hitmen was teenage education campaigner Malala Yousafzai, this year’s winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, who survived being shot in the head and now lives in England. With unprecedented anger at the Taliban’s latest attack spreading across the country, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has promised that terrorism will be defeated. ‘We have resolved to continue the war against terrorism till the last terrorist is eliminated,’ he said. Mr Sharif has ordered the military to step-up attacks on the group despite the Taliban blaming operations in the tribal areas that have killed women and children as the reasons for the Peshawar ‘revenge’ attack. The Pakistani Air Force carried out 20 airstrikes in a small Taliban stronghold in the north west of the country yesterday, killing at least 57 militants. Depraved: The Taliban gunmen who slaughtered 148 innocent people, including 132 children, are pictured just hours before the massacre. The white banner they pose in front of is the flag of the Pakistani Taliban and reads: 'There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is Allah's Messenger' Killers: Photographs of the six men responsible for murdering 132 children were released by the Taliban this morning, along with an emailed statement revealing the terrorists plan more attacks at schools in Pakistan . Militants: All six  gunmen were shot dead by Pakistan security officials - but not until they'd killed 132 children . Warped: These two-cold blooded killers stare menacingly  into the camera before carrying out the massacre . Armed: Released by the terror group's spokesman Mohammad Khurasani a third group shot shows the same men wearing full military fatigues - an outfit that would outed them as Taliban to security guards . The remote handling of suicide attackers from the safety of neighbouring countries is not unusual in the region. The 2008 attack on the Indian city of Mumbai is said to have been commanded from the Pakistani port city of Karachi. Afghan officials say that a number of major bombings on the capital Kabul were co-ordinated by handlers in Pakistan. ‘The belongings we got from suicide bombers involved in the Peshawar School attack provided us with clues, and our intelligence agencies shared some other very valuable information related to the planning and execution of this terrorist attack,’ a security officer said, referring to a meeting on Wednesday between Pakistani and Afghan intelligence agents. In an act of defiance yesterday, several pupils who had been inside the school at the time of the shootings turned up at the gates to show their contempt for the Taliban gunmen, promising they would not be intimidated. The Taliban has threatened more strikes on schools linked to the military but dressed in his green blazer yesterday Student Aakif Azeem, 18, insisted: ‘We want our revenge.

Recalling the moment the Taliban struck, he told the BBC said: ‘I was in the dining room when the gunmen started firing and one took a shot at me with a pistol, but the bullet ricocheted. There were children screaming and crying and there were bodies everywhere.’ ‘The corridors were dripping with blood. Even the teachers were terrified... All I could think about was where my little brother was. Later I found out that out of a class of 25 who died, he was the only one who escaped unharmed,’ It was confirmed last night that a five-year-old girl named Khola Altaf was the youngest victim of the massacre - despite alleged instructions from Taliban commanders not to kill ‘small children’. Khola is understood to have been on her first day the school’s kindergarten when gunmen burst into the room and reportedly shot her at point blank range. Following the horrific terror attack on a school in Peshawar, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ordered the lifting of the moratorium on the death penalty for terror related cases in Pakistan. The death penalty had been unofficially suspended since 2008, under the orders of President Asif Ali Zardari. Following Zardari’s decision to retire in September 2013, renewed calls emerged for the death penalty to be re-stated for terror related crimes. Nawaz Sharif was re-elected for a third term as Prime Minister in June 2013, promising to bring back the death penalty. However, international pressure from human rights groups and threats of further violence from the Pakistani Taliban, forced Sharif to shelve his plans to re-instate the death penalty in late 2013. Despite the ban, judges in Pakistan are still allowed to sentence convicted criminals to death row. Last year, 226 people were sentenced to death by Pakistani courts. Activists claim that Pakistan’s overcrowded jails contain the largest number of death row prisoners in the world. Over 8,000 criminals are currently being held on death row. 800 of the prisoners have been sentenced for terror related crimes. There has only been one execution in the last five years. Muhammed Hussein, a former soldier in the Pakistani army, was sentenced to death by a military court for murdering his senior officer in 2008.

Johnson’s parents have long insisted that there son was murdered and in July they filed a lawsuit in Lowndes County Superior Court that stated that their son died ‘at the hands of one or more students.’ Two brothers, whose names have been withheld because they were juveniles at the time of incident, received letters from the U.S. Attorney’s Office informing them they were 'target(s) of the grand jury’s investigation.' The boys - described as 'white and affluent' by AJC - had been linked to the case because the youngest sibling had been involved in a 2011 scuffle with Johnson. Lowndes County sheriff’s deputies released a report confirming the alibi of the older of the two brothers earlier this week. The report concludes that the oldest boy had left the school grounds an hour before Johnson was last seen on school surveillance tapes because he was taking part in a wrestling tournament in Macon. Lawyers for Johnson’s parents had last month produced a copy of a bus reservation that listed a 4 p.m. departure time for a wrestling tournament in which the older brother was competing — roughly three hours after Johnson was last seen alive. Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson have long insisted that there son was murdered and in July they filed a lawsuit in Lowndes County Superior Court that stated that their son died 'at the hands of one or more students' But the police report included interviews with the school’s wrestling coach, the bus driver and several teammates who all insisted that they left Valdosta around lunchtime. Wrestling coach Spencer Graybeal told police the form was submitted with an estimated departure time three months before the tournament and that it was later amended on learning that the wrestlers were due in Macon -152 miles away - at 4 p.m. for weigh-ins. The Johnsons are seeking to hold the county school board, school superintendent and the principal of Lowndes High School responsible for their son's death. Their lawsuit mentions that Johnson had been in a fight with another student during a bus trip to a football game a year before his death. It also blames school officials for not interviewing classmates 'who witnessed incidents of harassment and threats' against Johnson. The state medical examiner had ruled Johnson’s death an accident caused by positional asphyxia, supporting local law enforcement’s theory that the teen got trapped while reaching for a pair of sneakers . The lawsuit doesn't specifically allege that the same student who fought with Johnson - the wrestler’s younger brother - had a role in his death. He was in class and accounted for when Johnson was seen entering the gym where his body would later be discovered. Johnson's parents are seeking unspecified monetary damages from the school system. A federal investigation in Johnson’s death remains active. The Lowndes sheriff’s office has confirmed that Assistant U.S. Attorney Deborah Sines recently retrieved the mat where Johnson’s body was found. The state medical examiner had ruled Johnson’s death an accident caused by positional asphyxia, supporting local law enforcement’s theory that the teen got trapped while reaching for a pair of sneakers.

"Paul John Scott, 32, one of Britain's most wanted fugitives has been arrested after trying to sneak back into Britain in a light aircraft . A suspected drug smuggler named as one of Britain's most wanted men has been arrested after trying to sneak back into the UK from Holland in a light aircraft. Paul John Scott, 32, a suspected member of a drug-dealing gang, was stopped by police after he touched down at East Winch Airfield in Norfolk from the Netherlands in a Cessna 170, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. The plane's Dutch pilot, who was also arrested on suspicion of money laundering, has been bailed pending further enquiries. Scott, from Liverpool,  was accused of being in possession of 2,000 euros and a false Belgian identity card. He was charged with conspiracy to import cocaine and appeared at Liverpool Magistrates Court yesterday. He was remanded in custody until his next court appearance at Liverpool Crown Court on January 2. Scott is a suspected member of a Merseyside-based organised crime group that plotted to smuggle up to 40 tonnes of drugs into the UK, the NCA said. The arrest on Tuesday night comes two weeks after the NCA launched a manhunt for Scott and issued an appeal on BBC One's Crimewatch show. Officers from Norfolk Police and Border Force were waiting for the aircraft to touch down as suspicions had been raised ten days earlier when the pilot landed in the same airfield in a different aircraft.

"Steve Ockerby resigned as chair of governors after taking his children on a holiday during term-time . A chair of governors at a primary school has been forced to quit after taking his children out of lessons for a three-day trip to Lapland despite being refused permission. Steve Ockerby resigned from his role at Shibden Head Primary Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire, after furious parents noticed photographs of the trip were posted on Facebook. The family, who have a daughter at the school and a son at nearby Queensbury School, made the decision to take their children on the trip, despite the threat of a £360 fine. Mr Ockerby, who is a firefighter with West Yorkshire Fire & Rescue service, was warned his daughter's absence would be treated as 'unauthorised'. His decision comes as Bradford Council continues its crackdown on school absence during term time. Councillor Ralph Berry, the executive member for children's services at the council, called Mr Ockerby's actions 'breathtaking' and pointed out that school attendance rules applied to all parents. The firefighter has now stepped down from his position as governor but said he remained 'totally committed' to the school. He said: 'My role in the Fire Service dictates I have to work shifts and have an allocated holiday pattern which leaves me with no choice over when I can take holiday. 'We followed the correct procedure, according to the school policy, to request leave of absence during school time, and we received notification back from the school that the trip would be unauthorised. 'This is the first time we've taken our child out of school. My daughter has a 100 per cent attendance record and is achieving well. 'However, this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the whole of my family. 'I understand that people will condemn me for my decision. They are, of course, entitled to their opinion. 'It is unfortunate that my family's enjoyment has caused some parents so much distress. 'I am fully aware that my actions may result in a fine. I will pay whatever sanction is imposed. Mr Ockerby said his job as a firefighter left him with no other choice and he has since stepped down from his position at Shibden Head Primary School (pictured) 'I remain totally committed to supporting the school. However, as people are very quick to condemn my actions and after nearly five years of dedication, commitment and time, I feel it is in my best interest to resign from the governing body as my family will always come first.' Earlier this year, Jenny Winder, 53, head of Elstow Primary School near Bedford, was branded a 'hypocrite' after she booked a holiday to the Caribbean for after the Christmas holidays. Mrs Winder had refused to give an explanation or apologise for trying to take the time off but caved under pressure and cancelled the trip. In June, a head teacher was allowed to take unpaid leave from Stafford Leys Primary School in Leicester due to 'personal reasons'. But his absence caused outrage after parents found out he had travelled to South America for the World Cup in Brazil. Mr McGovern's request for time off was originally rejected by governors following a row when the headteacher of another Leicester school was allowed to take a month off in term time to get married. The decision however was overturned after the head appealed with the help of his union. Vina Pankhania, 30, head teacher at Little Hill primary school, was allowed to take almost a month off work between the beginning of the Easter term and start of the summer holidays this year after governors said she had 'worked extremely hard'. Meanwhile an inquiry has been launched in Bilborough, Nottingham, after Carol Barker, of Woodlands Special School took holiday in term-time. Councillor Berry said: 'For a governor of a primary academy to take his children out of school during term time while we have a major drive on school attendance is somewhat breathtaking. 'He has done the right thing in resigning. School attendance is a major priority in this city. It is part of raising standards of achievement. Every day lost in education is learning lost. 'The rules apply to everybody.' Cllr Michael Walls, a former governor at the school, said: 'It was not a wise thing to do under the circumstances, in view of the problem with children being off and keeping kids off school outside school holiday time. 'Being chairman of governors, really he should be backing up the school and the school's policy.' The school's head teacher, Sarah Thornton, and Helen Rowland, of Focus-Trust, the charitable trust which helps run the school, released a joint statement describing his resignation as a 'huge loss'. It said: 'In this role, Mr Ockerby has given a significant amount of his own personal time and made a substantial contribution to the strong leadership of the academy. 'This will be a huge loss to the governing body and school. 'We are all saddened that this matter has overshadowed what has otherwise been a shining example of governance and role model to other parents.'","Steve Ockerby resigned from role at Shibden Head Primary Academy .

"A man cut off his ex-girlfriend's nose with a steak knife leaving it hanging from her face by a thread after confronting her about a new boyfriend. Dale Hathaway, 27, has been jailed for eight years today after launching a savage attack on Maria Vella, 33, in the lobby of a  Newport hotel as young children and families looked on in horror. She was found lying in a pool of blood screaming with the 'most horrific injuries' police officers had ever seen and needed 200 stitches to re-attach her nose, Cardiff Crown Court heard. The pair had spent the afternoon drinking together at the Newport Hilton hotel in April – but the conversation became heated when Hathaway confronted her about her new boyfriend. Dale Hathaway, 27, (left) has been jailed for eight years after slicing off Maria Vella's nose in the lobby of a Newport hotel . He then grabbed the steak knife and used it to 'effectively sever her nose from her face' after she asked him not to drive because he'd had too much to drink. Prosecutor Robert Buckland QC said: 'Dale Hathaway's ex-girlfriend was seriously injured and has been left with permanent scarring after this horrific steak knife attack. 'This injury had a major and lifelong impact on the victim.' 'Hathaway was drunk and used the steak knife deliberately with the intention of causing serious injury. Ms Vella was found lying in a pool of blood screaming with the 'most horrific injuries' police officers had ever seen . 'This offence was committed in public and in the presence of a young child.' Ms Vella's wounds were so deep that it caused part of her nose to hang forward on to her top lip. She continues to suffer from psychological trauma following the attack in April and says she is reminded of it every time she looks in a mirror. 'I never want to talk about this again,' she said. Hathaway from Cardiff was jailed for six years at the city's crown court in October after he admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent. But his sentence has been increased to eight years by judges sitting at London's Criminal Appeal Court, who said the original term was 'unduly lenient'. He initially told police Ms Vella had fallen and hurt herself and then claimed he had 'thrown' the knife behind him and it had cut her accidentally. But when a surgeon analysed the weapon and said 'significant force' must have been used to inflict the injury with the knife, he admitted the offence. Increasing his sentence to eight years, Lady Justice Macur said the term was too short and did not reflect the 'aggravating factors' in this case. Sitting with Mr Justice Blake and Mr Justice Dove, she added: 'Bearing in mind the use of a weapon, and the manner in which it was used and the description of the injury, we consider that the correct sentence was one of eight years.'

"Illegal immigrant Babar Khan, 24, spent thousands on a sham marriage but was caught out and jailed after staff noticed he couldn't spell the bride's name . An illegal immigrant who spent thousands of pounds on a sham marriage has been jailed after staff spotted he was unable to spell his bride's name. Babar Khan, 24, of no fixed abode, had arranged for his big day to be held at Southampton Register Office, but police dramatically stormed the ceremony as the fake couple prepared to say their vows after officials became suspicious. The Pakistani national paid £4,660 to marry the woman he barely knew in a desperate attempt to remain in Britain at a ceremony in front of just two guests. Southampton Crown Court heard police officers who quizzed the couple found they gave  'wildly conflicting' accounts of how they met. Police then searched Khan's home and discovered 'crib notes' with prepared answers about their 'history' together. Khan was released on bail but in an attempt to evade being deported he fled to London - before the authorities caught him again. Siobhan Linsley, prosecuting, told the court Khan was initially granted entry to Britain in September 2011 to study a three-year accountancy course in the capital. But when he failed to attend classes, immigration officers ordered him to apply for an extension or leave by the following June. Khan instead decided to pay the thousands of pounds for a sham marriage with a Southampton woman. But on the couple's arrival at Southampton Register Office on April 14 this year staff became concerned, the court heard. Miss Linsley said: 'He misspelt her name, they had no interest in seeing the room where it would take place and they were vague about details.' The woman, who has not been named, is believed to have received £250 for her part in the deal. Police who searched her home found no evidence of Khan ever living there. After his arrest Khan was bailed and ran away to London where he was eventually re-arrested in September while working in a factory. The Southampton Register Office where Khan stumped up £4,660 to marry a woman he barely knew . In mitigation barrister Jane Rowley stressed Khan was not the main organiser of the scam. She said: 'He bitterly regrets his misguided action. 'His motivations to come here weren't just greed. He wanted to make a constructive life in Britain.' Recorder Nicolas Gerasimidis said to Khan: 'This was a sham marriage and not genuine. 'You made the decision to stay in this country and went awol. 'You were burying your head in the sand to avoid the consequences of your actions.' Khan, who admitted conspiring to breach immigration law and two counts of breaching marriage laws, was jailed for 20 months. Following the completion of his sentence he will be deported to Pakistan. The woman denies a charge of conspiracy to breach UK immigration law and is due to stand trial next year.","Babar Khan, 24, spent £4,660 on sham marriage to woman he barely knew .

"It's a  feast fit for a king, kicking off with two snifters of Richard Hennessy cognac before following on with prized Ossetra caviar, Kobe steak, white truffle mash and Chateau d'Yquem wine. But at an eye-watering $21,000 (£13,500), it's certainly not a meal everyone will be able to afford. The extravagant dinner features on the New Year's Eve menu at Empire Steak House in New York City, according to JustLuxe. New York City's Empire Steak House is ringing in the New Year with its $21,000 sumptuous spread . The starter, which will be served with a bottle of Dom Perignon Oenotheque, comprises four ounces of Platinum Ossetra Caviar and a seafood platter with lobster, crab, clams, oysters, and tuna tartar. The main event is an eight-ounce Grade A5 Kobe rib eye steak imported from Japan with white truffle mashed potatoes and black truffle creamed spinach, paired with a bottle of Chateau Petrus. The lavish meal ends with a creme brulee infused with Taylor Fladgate’s 1964 Single Harvest Port, and half a bottle of Château d'Yquem. After dinner, diners will be served glasses of Taylor Fladgate’s 1964 Single Harvest Port with various cheeses. Ossetra caviar eggs have a nutty and fruity flavour . There are several types of caviar but true gourmet caviar comes from only from the sturgeon fish  - primarily Beluga, Osetra, and Sevruga sturgeons . Beluga caviar is the most expensive in the world. It has large roe which ranges in colour from black to pale grey with a smooth, buttery flavour. Also spelled Osetra, Oscietra or Asestra, Ossetra caviar's medium-sized eggs have a nutty and slightly fruity flavour. Their colour ranges from golden brown to light grey. Sevruga caviar is more plentiful than Beluga and Ossetra and as such is the least expensive. Its roe is small and ranges in colour from black to very light grey. It has a salty, rich and intense flavour. Fine caviar is rated according to the size and color of its roe, its method of processing, and colour. Very light roe is known as Royal caviar and was once reserved only for royalty. The largest remaining deposit of sturgeon is in the Caspian Sea, shared by Russian and Iranian producers, where 85 per cent of today's wild caviar originates. Not the first time: The restaurant made headlines last year for its $10,000 five-course festive menu . The lucky duo will be given $1,000 (£640) in gift certificates for future dinners when their costly meal ends. The restaurant also has a more affordable New Year's Eve tasting menu at $99 (£63) per person. It made headlines last year for its $10,000 (£6,400) five-course festive menu which offered guests lobster cooked in Champagne and a three-layer chocolate and raspberry tart with gold leaf and Cognac.

"Hundreds of motorists are flocking to a garage selling what could be the cheapest petrol in Britain - at just £1.09 a litre. The pumps at the Harvest petrol station forecourt in Redditch, Worcestershire, ran dry three times in the past two weeks after its manager slashed fuel prices. Drivers have faced 30-minute queues to fill up their tanks after Velautham Sarveswaran, 52, cut the cost of fuel at his petrol station because he was fed up of supermarkets 'cheating' customers with rip-off prices. Scroll down for video . Velautham Sarveswaran has slashed the price of petrol at his garage in Redditch, Worcestershire, to just £1.09 a litre - potentially making the station the cheapest in Britain . The petrol station manager has also cut the price of diesel - down to £1.16 a litre - because he was fed up of supermarkets 'cheating' customers with rip-off prices . Mr Sarveswaran has also seen motorists arrive in their droves at his two other petrol stations in Maypole, Birmingham, and Walsall, where the cost of filling up has also been knocked down. The petrol station boss, who charges £1.16 a litre for diesel, said he decided to act because of high prices at supermarket forecourts. Despite the low costs, the independent garage which sells Harvest Energy fuel still makes a 3.5p profit on every litre it sells. He said: 'It's a great feeling because we are passing on the benefits of the price cuts to the customers. They are praising us and they are happy. 'Normally we have local customers but more people are stopping here after seeing the prices. 'I believe we are the cheapest in the country, people have told me they can't find it cheaper anywhere else. 'Our Walsall branch is busy and in Redditch the forecourt is small and there's been queues of motorists. It ran out of petrol about two or three times over the past two weeks. 'One customer told me he saved nearly £15 filling up his Range Rover - that's a lot of money.' A graph showing the average price of a litre of unleaded petrol since 2010. Prices have been rising but began to fall from the beginning of 2014 . The average price of a litre of diesel has also followed a similar pattern over the past four years, with the cost decreasing in 2014 . The big four supermarkets all announced a 2p fuel cut last week following a huge drop in the price of crude oil. The price of a barrel of crude oil has dropped by 40 per cent in the past six months, with some retailers now passing the saving on to customers. But Mr Sarveswaran said supermarkets should have seen the reduction in costs coming and acted sooner. 'The supermarkets should have done it quicker. They don't put the prices down straight away, they make a fortune,' he said. 'Where I live, Sainsbury's is still 115p. It makes me angry and then suddenly they wake up and cut their prices by 2p. They are cheating people.' Father-of-one Mr Sarveswaran has managed the petrol stations with his wife Ananthi, 50, since 2002. The former civil engineer, who lives in Dorridge, West Midlands, said he plans to slash prices by another 2p next week. He added: 'We need to make a profit and we set a profit margin and what we have been doing over the last year is cut down prices straight away when oil prices drop. 'Our sales have gone up by 25 to 30 per cent since we brought it down to 112p last week. 'I can see us bringing it down and knocking another 2p off next Monday.' The pumps at the Harvest petrol station forecourt have run dry three times in the past two weeks as customers flock to fill up their vehicles . The price of a barrel of crude oil has dropped by 40 per cent in the past six months, with some retailers now passing the saving on to customers . Customer Alan Nicks, 44, drove six miles from his home in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, to fill up his Ford Focus at the petrol station this morning. He said: 'My cousin told me about the price and I didn't believe it when I was first told. I had to come and see it for myself. 'It was worth a bit of drive out and a 30-minute wait queuing. It's an absolute bargain.' Average petrol prices have plunged in the last month from 123.1p a litre in mid-November to 116.8p in mid-December. The price of diesel has also nosedived from 127.5p a litre to 122.5p in the same time. Yesterday experts said the fuel price war could see petrol cost less than £1 a litre in the new year -the lowest level since May 2009. RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: 'What's currently happening at the pumps with falling fuel prices is something many motorists will not remember seeing before. 'The prospect of petrol going below £1 a litre in the new year is incredible, particularly when prices at the beginning of 2014 seemed to be heading ever upwards.'","Garage in Redditch, Worcestershire, is selling petrol for just £1.09 a litre .

"The Dude and Ferris Bueller now have something in common: both are have been declared national treasureS. The Big Lebowski, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Saving Private Ryan are among 25 movies being inducted this year into the National Film Registry for long-term preservation, the Library of Congress announced Wednesday. The library selected films for their cultural, historic or aesthetic qualities. This year's selections span the years 1913 to 2004. Unforgettable: Ferris Bueller's Day Off starring Matthew Broderick is among 25 movies being inducted this year into the National Film Registry . Masterpiece:: The 1986 movie was chosen as the first film on the registry from the late director John Hughes . Gritty epic:Stephen Spielberg's World War II saga Saving Private Ryan from 1998 was chosen in part for its ultra-realism with scenes depicting 'war as hell' The films named to the registry include Hollywood classics, documentaries, silent movies, student films, independent and experimental projects. This year’s selections bring the number of films in the registry to 650, which is a small fraction of the Library’s vast moving-image collection of 1.3 million items. Among the latest batch of inductees are such familiar and popular titles such as the horror classic Rosemary's Baby and the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, as well as lesser known movies that were milestones in film history. Stephen Spielberg's World War II masterpiece Saving Private Ryan from 1998 was chosen in part for its ultra-realism with scenes depicting 'war as hell.' Cult classic: The Coen Brothers' 1998 slacker comedy The Big Lebowski is a tale of kidnapping, mistaken identity and bowling . Horror masterpiece: Roman Polanski's 1968 Rosemary's Baby starred Mia Farrow in her first role as a pregnant woman who believes she has become the target of a sinister plot . On a lighter note, the comedy Ferris Bueller's Day Off from 1986 starring a young Matthew Broderick in the title role was chosen as the first film on the registry from the late director John Hughes. Curators noted Ferris Bueller emerged as one of the great teen heroes of film. The oldest selection dates to 1913 and is believed to be the earliest surviving feature film starring black actors. Vaudevillian Bert Williams gathered with black performers in New York City to make the film Bert Williams Lime Kiln Club Field Day. The film was discovered 100 years later in the film vault at the Museum of Modern Art. Pure imagination: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory starring Gene Wilder was a 1971 musical adaption of Roald Dahl's surreal book . Here are the 25 films selected in 2014 by the Library of Congress to be preserved as part of the National Film Registry: . The Library of Congress runs a major film preservation effort at its audio-visual conservation center built inside a Cold War-era bunker in Culpeper, Virginia. 'By preserving these films, we protect a crucial element of American creativity, culture and history,' Librarian of Congress James Billington said in announcing the new selections. Some of the most endangered films are silent films. A report from the library last year found 70 per cent of the nation's silent feature films have been lost and only 14 per cent still exist in their original 35 mm format. The silent films selected for preservation this year include The Dragon Painter from 1919, starring Hollywood's first Asian star, Sessue Hayakawa, and the 1916 silent film Shoes, which examined poverty and prostitution, curators said. Other films were chosen for their cultural significance. A 1976 independent film entitled Please Don't Bury Me Alive! that was chosen for the registry is considered by historians to be the first Chicano feature film. Set in a San Antonio barrio, filmmaker Efrain Gutierrez explored his story as a young Chicano man, questioning his people's place in society at the end of the Vietnam War as thousands of his Latino brethren returned home in coffins. Others faced segregation, poor schools and a justice system that was filling prisons with Chicanos. The filmmakers were angry with how Hollywood portrayed Mexican Americans. 'We were invisible in our own national culture,' Gutierrez said in a written statement. 'We were being buried alive.' The most recent film on the list in James Benning's 13 Lakes from 2004 - a feature-length film that can be seen as a series of moving landscape paintings reminiscent of Claude Monet. Bert Williams Lime Kiln Club Field Day is the oldest selection from 1913 and is believed to be the earliest surviving feature film starring black actors .","The library selected 25 films spanning the years 1913 to 2004 .

"Chicago Bears star Chris Conte has said that he believes playing in the NFL is worth any risk to his long-term health . Chicago Bears star Chris Conte, who has suffered two concussions this season, has said that he believes playing in the NFL is worth any risk to his long-term health. The 25-year-old defensive back told WBBM that he is happy to accept a shorter life span in return for living out his dream of playing professional football. 'I'd rather have the experience of playing and, who knows, die 10, 15 years earlier than not be able to play in the NFL and live a long life,' said Conte. The player has experienced his fair share of injury issues this season, causing him to miss three games and leaving him unable to continue in seven of the 12 games he's been involved in. 'Ever since I was a little kid, it's what I've wanted to do,' Conte told WBBM. 'In college, I didn't even graduate school because my senior year, I honestly let school be a casualty to that because I knew I had one opportunity to make it to the NFL, and I put everything into that. And I felt school's something I could figure out later. 'As far as after football, who knows. My life will revolve around football to some point, but I'd rather have the experience of playing and, who knows, die 10, 15 years earlier than not be able to play in the NFL and live a long life. 'It's something I've wanted to do with my life and I wanted to accomplish. And I pretty much set my whole life up to accomplish that goal. So I don't really look toward my life after football because I'll figure things out when I get there and see how I am. 'As long as I outlive my parents, then we'll be all right,' Conte said. 'Something I've wanted to do my whole life': Chris Conte is pictured taking on Adrian Peterson . When questioned later about his comments, Conte reiterated that he believed 'doing what I love outweighs risks despite injuries I have amounted this year.' 'My reference wasn't even to concussions, just the associated risk with football and accepting the fact that life expectancy of someone who has played in the NFL is shorter than the average person,' he told ESPN on Wednesday. 'And I'm fine with trading that risk for the opportunity to play football since it's something I have always wanted to do and a dream come true. Former Bears tight end Desmond Clark tweeted soon after that he agreed with Conte. 'So I live to 75 instead of 85 and in return I had the chance to play in the NFL. I'll do it all over again,' Clark tweeted. Former Bears tight end Desmond Clark (above) tweeted soon after that he agreed with Conte . The NFL expects 6,000 of nearly 20,000 retired players — or 28 percent — to suffer from Alzheimer's disease or at least moderate dementia someday. But other former players have sued the league over injuries they say are the result of playing football. The NFL last month urged a judge to approve an estimated $1 billion settlement of concussion lawsuits despite concerns raised by former players or survivors who felt left out. The 65-year fund would resolve thousands of lawsuits that accuse the NFL of long hiding what it knew about concussions and brain injuries to keep players on the field.","Conte, who has suffered two concussions this season, has said he believes playing in the NFL is worth any risk to his long-term health .

"Aleksander Owens-Thurston died after crashing into a snow machine while skiing in the Austrian Alps, an inquest has heard . A university graduate died in the Alps when he crashed into a snow machine while not wearing a skiing helmet, a coroner has heard. Aleksander Owens-Thurston, 23, of Surrey, was killed in February this year, just weeks after Michael Schumacher was placed into a medically-induced coma following a similar accident. A coroner has now called for safety improvements at an Austrian ski resort and urged Britons heading off on skiing holidays this winter to wear helmets. Mr Owens-Thurston lost control on a steep run in St Anton during the first day of a holiday with his parents, younger brother and godfather. The IT worker - who was an experienced skier - fractured his skull when he collided with the 15ft long boom arm of a snow machine while skiing on a black run. His inquest in Taunton heard that the boom arm was left across the ski run and was not padded, although the machine and its pedestal were. Recording a verdict of accidental death today, West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose urged further safety precautions. He said: 'This is a tragic matter. These snow making machines are increasingly used, and I suspect this year more than ever, as resorts try and have a full season and cannot afford to lose customers if there is not adequate amounts of snow. 'One finds snow making machines at many modern resorts across Europe. It seems to me that the marking of this snow making machine was probably inadequate. 'Witnesses referred to other resorts where they have bright, luminous tape and certainly a warning.I also note that the pedestal and the machine itself were padded but not the boom. 'Sadly, I think Aleksander did not appreciate the difficulties he was facing coming down the slope. 'What I think happened is that for some reason he fell or lost control, probably coming down onto the blue run, and as a result he hit the boom with enormous force. Mr Owens-Thurston - an experienced skier - either 'lost control or fell' in the moments before the crash. Pictured on a earlier holiday in the resort . He added: 'His father, who was not present, said he was probably flying through the air. 'Whether padding on the boom would have assisted... it certainly might have helped. Also I do urge everyone these days to wear helmets. 'One reads and hears of many cases where people's lives are saved. Sadly he died very shortly after the incident.' Mr Rose said that he would be writing to the Ski Club of Great Britain highlighting his concerns and depending on its response, he would consider raising the matter directly with the Austrian authorities. 'Certainly there should have been padding on the boom. I am very unhappy about the position of snow making machines and I think that the primary cause of this accident,' the coroner said. The accident happened at the skiing resort of St Anton, Austria, where the 23-year-old was on holiday with his parents, younger brother and godfather in February this year . Mr Rose concluded: 'If the boom had been pointing to the side of the ski slope I doubt I would be sitting here today for this very tragic incident.' Paul Swateridge told the inquest that he saw Mr Owens-Thurston set off in front of him on the slope but did not see the collision. Mr Swateridge, from Taunton, who is Mr Owens-Thurston's godfather, said he did not learn of the tragedy until he returned to his hotel later that day. Mr Owens-Thurston graduated from University of Surrey with an economics degree last year. Pictured with girlfriend Ellis . 'The skiing conditions were perfect, the weather was perfect and there was not a cloud in the sky,' he said. 'Aleksander was not wearing a helmet. It was really, really hot, around zero degrees, which doesn't seem a lot but when you are in Austria it's hot. 'The boom was across the slope, rather than down the slope. It was the way they left it - it presented a 15ft target to hit. 'Going back the following day it looked to me a little bit negligent to leave it in that position - in my mind it was negligent.' Mr Owens-Thurston had recently graduated from the University of Surrey with a degree in economics and had started a job at an IT firm. His family, who have since moved to Zurich, were not present at the hearing. Speaking after his death, his father Phillip said he wanted changes to be made to prevent any similar accidents. 'There's an element of risk [in skiing] but what I have said is that it shouldn't be any more risky than it needs to be,' he told Get Surrey. 'If you stick a 15ft-long steel bar across a slope in a position, if someone comes down at speed and loses control they will be thrown into it at 50mph, that's not helpful. 'It's a tragic accident but what they have to do is think about the placement of the obstacles on the ski slopes, especially on black slopes where if you lose control it's going to be at speed.' In December 2013, just over a month before Mr Owens-Thurston's accident, Michael Schumacher was seriously injured in an accident at Meribel in the French Alps. The racing driver was wearing a helmet, which shattered due to the force of the impact when he fell onto a partially-covered rock. After months in a coma, the seven-time F1 champion  is now said to be paralysed and in a wheelchair, cannot speak and has memory problems. The crash happened weeks after racing driver Michael Schumacher was seriously injured in a skiing accident .","Experienced skier was on holiday in Austrian resort in February last year .

"Health authorities in Ireland were last night seeking legal advice over whether a brain-damaged pregnant woman should be kept on life-support in an attempt to save her unborn child. It is understood the woman who is in her late 20s suffered a brain trauma within the last two weeks and was originally brought to the Beaumont Hospital in Dublin. However well-placed sources say she has now been brought to the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar which has a maternity unit. She is said to be within the first 20 weeks of her pregnancy. First port of call: It is understood the woman who is in her late 20s suffered a brain trauma within the last two weeks and was originally brought to the Beaumont Hospital (pictured) in Dublin . It is understood some members of the woman’s family wish for the machine to be kept on, but other individuals do not believe that action to be appropriate. The health service are seeking legal advice in relation to whether they continue to keep the mother on life-support for the sake of her unborn baby. Health authorities were expected to receive definitive legal advice yesterday in relation to the rights of the mother versus the rights of the unborn child. Sources say the mother – believed to be from Westmeath – suffered from significant ‘brain trauma’. An Irish medical law expert said Dublin High Court most likely would determine whether the woman will be kept alive artificially until the baby can be delivered. The case is scheduled for Tuesday. New location: Well-placed sources say the woman has now been brought to the Midland Regional Hospital (pictured) in Mullingar which has a maternity unit. She is said to be within the first 20 weeks of her pregnancy . Dr Adam McAuley, a Dublin City University law lecturer, said yesterday: ‘The law isn't clear, and when there is conflict, the matter will have to come before the court.’ Such disputes have become increasingly frequent in Ireland, a predominantly Catholic land from which more than 4,000 women travel annually to receive abortions in England. However, that option does not exist for ill women medically unable to leave the island. The news comes after Health Minister Leo Varadkar said on Tuesday that constitutional restrictions on abortion are too ‘restrictive’ and have a ‘chilling effect’ on doctors. He was speaking in the Dáil on a private members’ bill on the Eighth Amendment, which gives equal rights to the mother and the unborn. Huge demonstration: A file photograph from July 2013 shows thousands of anti-abortion protesters filling Dublin's major thoroughfare, as they march against Ireland's abortion bill . Mr Varadkar said: ‘Difficult decisions that should be made by women and their doctors, a couple or the next-of-kin where there is no capacity, and on the basis of best clinical practice, are now made on foot of legal advice. That isn't how it should be.’ Last year after bitter debate, politicians amended Ireland's abortion ban to make terminations legal if doctors deem the woman's life at risk from continued pregnancy. That step had been delayed for two decades. It finally happened after an Indian woman died from blood poisoning linked to her own dying foetus. The Irish hospital had refused her abortion pleas, citing the foetus' heartbeat. There are increasing calls in Ireland for the country to legalise abortions in cases involving rape, fatal foetal abnormalities, or long-term health risks to the woman.","Woman in late 20s has 'suffered brain trauma within last two weeks'

"Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood was last night at the centre of claims that his office relaxed rules to allow Tory special advisers to campaign in the Rochester by-election. A Tory Party source said Sue Gray, the Cabinet Office head of ethics and propriety, had allowed telephone canvassing. But such campaigning would appear to have required bending the rules of the strict code of conduct governing political activity by special advisers. However, the source said: 'This went right to the top and it was clear this was within the rules.' Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood was last night at the centre of claims that his office relaxed rules to allow Tory special advisers to campaign in the Rochester by-election . The row erupted after Theresa May's aides Nick Timothy and Stephen Parkinson were blocked as parliamentary candidates by Tory HQ. It is likely to prompt questions from Opposition MPs about whether other taxpayer-funded officials have broken rules by taking a direct role in a political campaign. Labour's Cabinet Office spokesman Jon Ashworth said: 'There are serious question marks here which Cabinet Secretary Jeremy Heywood needs to clear up. I will be asking him to provide answers about what guidance has been given.' Sir Jeremy is a powerful force at No10. David Cameron once joked: 'Remind me, Jeremy, do you work for me or do I work for you?' Critics claim he was complicit in the culture of 'sofa government' when Tony Blair was PM. He was nicknamed Sir Cover-up after preventing the Iraq War inquiry from seeing letters and records of phone calls between Mr Blair and George W Bush in the run-up to the conflcit. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's director of communications, Steve Lotinga (left), was paid £105,000. William Hague still employs Arminka Helic (right) on a salary of £70,000 – even though she has now been elevated to the Lords. One of George Osborne's advisers, Rupert Harrison (centre), received a 19 per cent raise last year, taking his pay to £95,000 . The news comes as it emerged that the multi-million-pound pay of ministers' special advisers has soared by £1.2million in just one year – despite David Cameron's pledge to cut the cost of politics. There are 103 so-called 'spads' working in Whitehall, at an annual cost to the taxpayer of £8.4million, figures published yesterday show. This is 17 per cent more than the £7.2million last year, and far higher than the £5.9million during Gordon Brown's last 12 months in power. The number of spads is up on the 98 in place a year ago and 71 just after the Coalition took office. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's director of communications, Steve Lotinga, was paid £105,000. Mr Clegg has 20 spads – which Labour points out is more than the number of female Lib Dem MPs. The Prime Minister has 26. William Hague still employs Arminka Helic on a salary of £70,000 – even though she has now been elevated to the Lords. One of George Osborne's advisers, Rupert Harrison, received a 19 per cent raise last year, taking his pay to £95,000. The Tories had promised at the last election to cap the number of spads, and the Liberal Democrats pledged they should be paid out of political funds, not taxpayer coffers. The latest figures, released by the Cabinet Office, show that six advisers are being paid £100,000 or more, with the list topped by Mr Cameron's chief of staff Ed Llewellyn and his director of communications Craig Oliver, who each received £140,000.","Sir Jeremy Heywood at centre of claims his office let advisers campaign .

"The man arrested in pre-dawn raids across Sydney in September has been hit with three new terror-related charges. While the original charge of planning an act of terror against Omarjan Azari, 22, still stands, prosecutors on Friday conceded the alleged act was not a beheading and was not planned for Martin Place, the scene of this week's siege. Azari appeared by video link from Silverwater prison after being transported from the Supermax jail in Goulburn, ahead of a planned bail application. During Friday's hearing he was charged with three fresh counts - two of knowingly making funds available to a terrorist organisation and one of attempting to make funds available to a terrorist organisation. Scroll down for video . Deep inside Supermax: Ormarjan Azari (pictured on his way to prison following his arrest on at his parents' house on September 18) is being held in the High Risk Management Correctional Centre - Australia's most secure jail - under its strictest inmate classification . Azari has been charged along with a 25-year-old man who was arrested in Beecroft in Sydney and taken into custody earlier this week. Azari is charged along with Ali Al-Talebi with transferring money to ISIS via two Western Sydney money transfer businesses. Police allege that on August 6, Azari and other males went to a Travelex store in Parramatta Westfield Shopping Centre and deposited $3000, which was to go via Pakistan to Australian ISIS recruiter Mohammad Ali Baryalei in Syria. Prosecution screw up: Prominent Sydney barrister, Winston Terracini SC, (pictured) told a Sydney court last month that a phone call at the centre of the case against accused terrorist, Omarjan Azari, had a 'glaring error' in its translation from Arabic to English. He also said authorities had conspired to deny Azari any prison visits by his family . Azari allegedly waited outside the Travelex as the other males deposited the money. The following day, August 7, Azari allegedly transferred $3000, in the company of other males, to Syria via Pakistan at the Western Union money transfer shop in Auburn in Western Sydney. The money was going to Baryalei via a man in Peshawar called Zia Abdulhaq, who has since been killed. Then on August 8, Azari and Al-Taledi attempted to transfer $9211 to Syria at the Bisotel Rieh Travel Agency, which is owned by the sister of Australian Syrian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf. The agency, which is operated by Damour Sharrouf and her husband, Ahmed Alwash, has since been shut down by federal agencies. Azari was arrest in a dawn raid during a large counter-terrorism operation (pictured) by hundreds of police across Sydney . Azari's lawyer, Steve Boland, said  widespread media coverage claiming Azari had planned a beheading and chosen Martin Place for the act was nonsense and that it would be almost impossible for Azari to get a fair trial given the 'extraordinary circumstances and the public atmosphere at the moment'. 'It has emerged that the Crown has absolutely no evidence of such a thing,' Mr Boland said about allegations Azar was planning to publicly behead a member of the public in Martin Place, video the killing and then drape the victims body with a ISIS flag. Commonwealth prosecutor Michael Allnutt said that in the charges against Azari, there had never been any mention of an execution in Martin Place. According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call  on September 16 from former Sydney nightclub bouncer, Mohammad Ali Baryalei (pictured) in Syria to a man outside Omarjan Azari's house in Guildford in western Sydney and a plot to behead a person and drape them in the ISIS flag was discussed . Azari's bail application will now go ahead on February 24 on the three new charges of financing terrorist activity in Syria. Last month, lawyers for Azari claimed there was a a 'glaring error' in the federal prosecution case against him, saying the official translation of a phone call at the centre of the police evidence against the 22-year-old apprentice mechanic. Prominent Sydney barrister Winston Terracini SC also said Azari - who is being held in Australia's toughest jail, Supermax in Goulburn - was being kept apart from his family who are not allowed to visit. Leading Sydney silk: Winston Terracini SC (right) and solicitor Ben Archbold (left) are pictured leaving Central Local Court in November following their appearance before Magistrate Greg Grogin on behalf of Omarjan Azari, the 22-year-old apprentice motor mechanic who police allege was planning to behead a member of the public . Azarai, a former soccer fanatic and Parramatta High School student who grew up in Sydney's western suburbs, was arrested on September 18 at his parents' home in Guildford in what was one of dozens of raids in a counter-terrorism operation by hundreds of police on homes in Sydney and Brisbane. According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call three days before the raids between Azari and former Sydney nightclub bouncer, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East. Mr Terracini told Central Local Court magistrate Greg Grogin in November that he had already had an Arabic speaker listen to the phone call in which prosecutors allege Azari made the threat to behead a person in Sydney's Martin Place. Prominent Sydney barrister Winston Terracini also said Azari - who is being held in Australia's toughest jail, Supermax in Goulburn - has been kept apart from his family who are not allowed to visit . 'There is at least one glaring error which goes to the crux of whether this young man is involved in a terrorist act,' Mr Terracini said of the prosecution's translation of the phone call. Mr Terracini said despite the Commonwealth DPP serving many documents in its brief of evidence against Azari, 'only one piece of evidence is relevant'. 'It seems to be the fact there is only one telephone call ... and there are inaccuracies in the translation.' Around 12 homes were searched on September 18 in Sydney’s northwest suburbs by NSW Police and Australian Federal Police (AFP). Police confiscated a sword (above, left) and materials from the cars of suspects (above, right) during the September 18 raids across NSW and Queensland in the nation's biggest counter terrorism offensive . Around 12 homes, including the house (pictured) where Omarjan Azari had been living with his parents, brothers and sister, were searched in Sydney’s northwest suburbs by NSW  and Australian Federal Police . Azari has been in custody in in the Supermax High Risk Management correctional centre for three months since the raids. Mr Terracini said Azari had been prevented from seeing his family by Corrective Services and prosecutors conspiring in a 'secret' agreement to ban 'visitors of any kind ... family, his parents who have no criminal convictions, his sister who has no conviction'. Commonwealth prosecutor Karen Leavy told the court her office had 'no influence' over inmate classification. Mr Terracini said Azari's defence team was not interested in the 180 or more documents gathered by the Commonwealth DPP and that the telephone allegedly used in the call from which the terrorism charge arose did not belong to the accused. 'We are interested in the phone used allegedly by this man which the prosecution knows was not his,' Mr Terracini said. Azari is accused of conspiring with Baryalei 'and others' in planning a terrorist act between 12.01am on March 8 this year and 4.30am on September 18, the time and date of his arrest. Following Omarjan Azari's arrest, heavily armed police (pictured) escorted him from Central Local Court down to the Goulburn Supermax Jail where he has been held under strict conditions . Azari was arrested the day after his parents left Australia to fly to Saudi Arabia for the religious holiday, the Hajj. The account said Baryalei ordered him to carry out an attack, which the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP)said was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community'. CDPP prosecutor Michael Allnutt told Central Local Court during Omarjan Azari's first court appearance on the day he was arrested that he had had made a threat during a phone call a few days prior to the raid which involved a 'random selection of persons to execute'. Azari had displayed 'an unusual level of fanaticism' in the call, which was intercepted by police, Mr Allnutt said. Court documents suggest the plotting for a public beheading between Omarjan Azarai, Baryalei 'and others' began on May 8, and prosecutors say Azari knew he was under police surveillance . Court documents suggest their plotting began on May 8, and the court heard Azari knew he was under police surveillance. Azari is being held in Supermax under NSW prisons highest security classification, which means he would not be allowed to hold telephone conversations in any language but English. Even his visits from his legal team have been in the metal-lined legal boxes inside Supermax.

"A Muslim community leader who had the Sydney cafe gunman at his house for lunch and dinner claims he was not capable of plotting and executing this week's deadly siege or his controversial activities over the past several years without help. Self-styled Sheikh Man Horan Monis held 18 people hostage for more than 16 hours at the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, a siege that ended in a hail of gunfire early Tuesday that left two hostages and the gunman dead. Some commentators this week labelled the crazed gunman a 'lone wolf'. But Jamal Daoud, a Muslim activist who had dealings with Monis over several months in 2010, told Daily Mail Australia that Monis could not have been acting without some form of assistance. 'I don't think that he was acting alone. I don't. I really don't,' Mr Daoud said, adding he believed Monis would not have been capable of conducting the siege plan in complete secrecy without support or training from someone here or overseas. Mr Daoud did not have any direct knowledge of any assistance to Monis. Scroll down for video . This pictures shows Muslim community activist Jamal Daoud with the man who he was shocked would one day become a 'violent terrorist' - self-styled Sheikh Man Horan Monis, the gunman who held eighteen people hostage for more than sixteen hours in Sydney this week until he was gunned down by police. This picture was taken at a large celebration for the birth of Daoud's first son . Fanatic: Man Haron Monis in the second half of 2010. Mr Daoud says he cut all ties with the self-proclaimed sheik . Protest: Man Horan Monis is pictured here attending a rally alongside various members of the Social Justice Network and people of other affiliations . Moment of terror: Hostages are forced to hold the Islamic Shahada flag in the window of the Lindt chocolate cafe . Free at last: Lindt cafe worker and hostage Elly Chen bolts for freedom on Monday afternoon. She was one of five hostages who managed to escape before it came to a bloody end around 2am on Tuesday . Mr Daoud questioned how Monis was capable of executing his abusive letter-writing campaign to the families of deceased Australian Defence Force personnel in 2008 - which he and his wife Amirah Droudis were later convicted for. He also said he believed Monis would not have been able to publish inflammatory videos on his personal website - logistically or technically - several years ago. In the YouTube clips, a woman who appears to be his wife, praised the Bali bombings and September 11 terrorist attacks. 'My understanding and the people who knew him said he is not capable of doing this himself -  because they [would] need a lot of help or support,' Mr Daoud said. There is no connection known between Ms Droudis and the siege. Mr Daoud first met Monis at a rally to protest the visit of Israeli Vice-President Silvan Shalom to Australia on December 3, 2009, where the self-styled Sheikh - an Iranian refugee who arrived in the country in 1996 - introduced himself as a 'peace activist'. Monis handed Mr Daoud his business card and said he hoped they would participate in future protest actions together. They did just that, participating in various demonstrations, including about the detention of asylum seekers at Villawood, in Sydney's west. But their relationship did not last for long, Mr Daoud said: 'Our contact did not last more than a few months.' Their final encounter at a Ramadan dinner hosted at Mr Daoud's home for disadvantaged members of the community. Mr Daoud's organisation, the Social Justice Network, cut ties with Monis around that time following the publication of the videos featuring the woman believed to be Ms Droudis. In one video, the woman said: 'I regret to say I am a terrorist. I admit and formally confess that for many years I have been a terrorist, but I'll try not to be anymore.' 'Amirah': In a series of videos on Man Horan Monis' website, a woman believed to be his partner Amirah Droudis celebrated the Bali bombings, Holocaust and September 11 terrorist attacks . The Social Justice Network cut ties with Monis in late 2010 following his bizarre behaviour and the publication of various videos, including one wear a woman believed to be his wife Amirah (pictured) called herself a terrorist. Many members of the Social Justice Network are who hold terrorism 'strongly in contempt', Mr Daoud said . Mr Daoud said, 'We wanted to tell her, this is not Islam'. He added that there were questions over how Monis met his wife - who used to work as a hairdresser and partied in Kings Cross bars but later converted to Islam and became an apparent follower of Monis. Members of the Mr Daoud's group - which protest over matters such as the treatment asylum seekers and Palestine - also doubted Monis' sanity and refused to be part of his own bizarre protest plans, including a demonstration in which he shackled himself to Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court over charges relating to his letter-writing campaign. Mr Daoud said Monis constantly refused to answer his questions about whether he was receiving any support in his letter-writing or video campaigns. 'We could not keep any clue about what's going on in his mind or his plans,' he said. Mr Daoud was unable to name individuals who could have been acting in concert with Monis this week, or over the past several years. A New South Wales police spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr Daoud's claims, saying their investigation is ongoing. On Tuesday, police executed a search warrant on the home of Amirah Droudis - where Monis spent much time - carting away several bags of material and documents. Wife: Amirah Droudis is pictured here arriving at Campsie Police Station following dramatic raids on her  home in Belmore, in Sydney's outer west, on Tuesday . Raid: Police officers from the Critical Incident Unit seized several documents from Ms Droudis'  home in Belmore on Tuesday . Ominous warning: Man Horan Monis was not on government terror watchlists at the time of the siege . Both the Federal and NSW governments are examining various aspects of Monis' activities in Australia, including how he obtained political asylum in Australia, how he acquired the sawn-off shot gun he used in Monday's siege and his interactions with various government agencies. Mr Daoud told Daily Mail Australia he and his wife were floored to find out Monis was responsible for the siege. He would only hear of him again when investigators examining the alleged murder of Monis' ex-wife, Noleen Hayson Pal, contacted him for information earlier this year. 'We were shocked, me and my wife,' he said. 'We were shocked and we could not believe that he was able to do this. 'This is why we think he was receiving some intensive brainwashing and training, of how to hide things, you know. 'We are thinking he is not acting alone because someone was planning this very secretive mission for the last few years. 'Somebody planned this very carefully you know. Everything was kept very secret. He was able to reach his targets and execute his final mission.' Police said during the siege that the gunman's motives were unclear, and that it appeared that he was acting alone. It later emerged that one of his few demands was to have a flag of the Islamic State militant group brought to him. This two storey brick house in the south-western Sydney suburb of Green Valley was Monis's home on and off for eight years . A two storey brick house in the south-western Sydney suburb of Green Valley was Monis's home on and off for eight years until his former wife Noleen finally forbade him to visit. The house, where Noleen Pal's parents, Ashok and Marian Pal, live, has a granny flat in the backyard where Monis lived full time with Ms Pal. After their relationship foundered he continued to visit. According to court documents, Monis was staying two days a week until Ms Pal told him, on June 18 2011, not to come back. Monis' stayed in an external flat at the back of the house, where his ex-wife's parents, Ashok and Marian Pal, still live . Ms Pal at one point left Sydney and travelled to stay with her godfather, Ayyat Khalik, in San Francisco. Mr Khalik has told San Francisco TV station Eye 5 KPix that Ms Pal sought refuge for about a month before returning to Sydney, after which she was murdered, in April 2013. On Thursday, as Mrs Pal sheltered inside the Green Valley house, police told Daily Mail Australia the family was still 'very frightened' following Monday's siege.","Muslim community leader claims Man Horan Monis could not have been acting alone .

After trying and failing to free it, the 40-year-old decided to call the fire service for help - but even emergency crews struggled to find a solution. Mr Kurman told local media: 'I opened up the hood and realised that there was a cat inside which was interfering with the mechanism. I tried to get it out but failed, and so I called the fire service to see if they could get it free.' He said that he was worried about driving the car with the creature inside in case it caused a crash adding that he did not want to see the cat hurt. Despite trying several tricks - including pouring cold water on the animal - fire crews eventually decided to tow the car to a nearby garage. Mechanics then spent two hours taking the car apart before firemen could put their hands inside and pull the cat free.

"Rescue teams who previously saved lives in the Japanese earthquake and tsunami spent eight hours freeing a dog that had become trapped in a cliff. Otis, a dog which had been rescued from Romania, got stuck after he ran into an old smugglers' tunnel in the cliff in Margate, Kent, and got wedged, 15ft from the entrance. The Sussex and Kent County Technical Rescue Team spent eight hours digging their way into the confined space on their hands and knees to rescue the one-year-old dog. A specialist search and rescue team who saved the lives of people in the Japanese Tsunami spent more than eight hours digging a one-year-old rescue dog out of a cliff in Margate, where the animal had got stuck . The team was involved in the 2011 Japanese rescue effort. They were called after his owner Heather Tait was unable to reach Otis and the fire brigade was also unable to free the animal. Miss Tait, 51,had tied her three dogs up as she briefly visited the nearby yacht club last Wednesday, but when she returned Otis had disappeared. She said: 'Otis had run off into a small hole in the cliff. Jo Murray (left), partner of Heather Tait, poses with Otis once he had been rescued by the team, which included Rose Bell (right), and had previously worked to save lives after the tsunami in Japan . The team worked for eight hours to widen the hole in the cliff so they could free Otis who had been trapped . 'I looked in there and couldn't see him, I thought that was it. 'I could hear him yelping and barking. 'The fire brigade came and did what they could but they just couldn't get him out. But then the search and rescue team came and spent hours trying to dig him out.' The rescue team used shovels to widen the space to pull Otis free.

Heather's partner Jo Murray, 45, said: 'I could hear him crying the whole time, he was really miserable in there. 'But eventually they managed to grab his lead and pulled him to safety.' The Margate couple, who are both artists, are fostering the terrier-type stray,  from charity Angels 4 Dogs. Miss Tait added: 'He's very traumatised but I think he's going to be fine thanks to the amazing work from the rescue teams. I think I will adopt him.'","Otis, a dog from Romania, got trapped in a hole in a cliff in Margate in Kent .

"This Christmas was always going to be difficult for the family for Lily-Mae McKinstry, a 10-year-old from Essex who tragically died of brain cancer last month. But the shadow hanging over the family's festive season has been partially lifted after mystery Christmas presents starting arriving in the post. The schoolgirl's parents have now discovered that their daughter spent her final days buying her relatives gifts online. Lily, from Chelmsford, lost her battle with a rare and terminal brain tumour earlier this winter, leaving her parents Andrew and Vicki heartbroken. But they have been left amazed at their daughter's ingenuity after they started receiving the gifts she bought with her father's credit card in the post. Scroll down for video . The family of Lily-Mae McKinstry (right) were left devastated by her death from a brain tumour last month. They have now discovered the youngster ordered them all presents online in the weeks before she died . Lily was diagnosed with a rare and terminal brain tumour earlier this year and underwent radiotherapy . Mrs McKinstry, 42, a hairdresser, said: 'When Lily passed away last month both me, Andrew and her big brother Ethan, were all left completely devastated. 'Our whole world came crashing down, we were making plans and expected Lily to be around for Christmas. 'After she died we were sorting out her things and were so shocked when we saw Andrew's credit card details in her notebook - but when we chased it up the penny dropped. Our beautiful, special girl had brought us all surprise Christmas presents. 'Now every few days we are receiving packages in the post, it's really emotional when we open them but it's also so comforting. Lily was so thoughtful and organised, I know how happy this would've made her.' Mr McKinstry, 48, a brewery  engineer, said: 'So far we have received bandanas in all of our favourite colours - Ethan loves wearing them, so she knew he'd appreciate the gift. 'She's also sent a chicken costume for Ethan which was a funny surprise and completely shows her sense of humour, and also some books. 'A really special gift was a Build-A-Bear teddy bear which we were going to bury with Lily, but after her big brother saw it he wanted to keep it to remind him of her.' The youngster made a 'bucket list' after being diagnosed with the tumour and the list included a wish meeting famous people. It came true when she met One Direction earlier this year . Mr McKinstry added: 'We could never be mad at Lily for paying for our presents on my credit card, she was so clever and it's amazing seeing what gifts she wanted to get us. 'We even found thank you cards addressed to everyone she cared for. 'We don't know what gifts we'll receive or when, but every single one is a really special present from Lily.' The surprise gifts are helping the family cope during their first Christmas without their daughter. DIPG is a type of brain tumour found in the lower back of the brain, near the top of the spinal cord. The tumours tend to be discovered during childhood, with most of those diagnosed being found in youngsters between the ages of five and seven. The condition makes up around 10 per cent of all brain tumours found in children. Unfortunately, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for DIPG in recent years and only 10% of children found to have the tumours live for more than two years after diagnosis. There is no known cure for the tumours, which are often treated with radiotherapy, chemotherapy or surgery. Mrs McKinstry said: 'It's helping us get through Christmas without her, it makes it feel like she's still with us in some way. 'Lily just loved this time of year - she still believed in Santa Claus, and we couldn't wait to spend this Christmas with her as we though it would be her last one. 'The presents are made even more special because we know how excited Lily would have been to give them to us. 'We get so excited whenever we see the postman, as we just can't wait to see what he'll deliver next.' Lily led an active  life before her diagnosis, but she started suffering from weak muscles in her arms, legs, eyes and face and, in May this year, she was diagnosed with Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) - an extremely rare and terminal brain tumour. Mrs McKinstry said: 'Our lives were turned upside down, Lily was quite the adrenaline junkie and loved indoor skydiving and wake boarding. She was perfectly healthy before her diagnosis and had a real lust for life. 'Her tumour in the brain stem was inoperable, so Lily had to undergo six weeks of radiotherapy at UCL Hospital. 'Lily never moaned, she was so brave and she returned home to us in mid-July. It was great seeing her be able to chew, talk and walk normally again. 'But tragically a week after her eight week check-up scan, she started having the same symptoms again and a CT scan confirmed the tumour was growing.' Lily (pictured with her mother Vicki) is said to have loved Christmas and buying her family presents . She used her father's credit card online to order gifts for her relatives in the weeks before she tragically died . Mrs McKinstry added: 'We were told this time that there was nothing more doctors could do, Lily fought so hard but in the end she couldn't stop it from claiming her life. She achieved so much though in such a short time and we are all so proud of her. 'We found a note in her bedroom after she had passed away which we know she had written after her radiotherapy because of her handwriting. 'The note said that if she was to pass away young she wanted her IPad to go to her dad, her laptop to go to her brother, her favourite mannequin to me, her clothes to go to poor children and any money to go towards her funeral. 'That was just the kind of girl she was, so kind and caring.' Mr and Mrs McKinstry are now in the process of completing a bucket list Lily drew up to honour their late daughter. Mrs McKinstry said: 'It's really important that we carry out Lily's wishes after everything she's been through. 'Some of her wishes were really mature for her age - number one was to have world peace and number two to have better access for disabled people in the underground system. 'She received a letter back from Boris Johnson about it which was amazing and he did a video message to her.' Her parents say the secret scheme by their daughter has made a difficult Christmas easier to get through . Lily was carried by horse-drawn hearse to her funeral as one of her 'bucket list' wishes was to enjoy a horse and carriage ride . She added: 'Lily was a huge fan of the X Factor as well and was supposed to meet Simon Cowell the day she died. 'She met One Direction and had video messages from stars including Pixie Lott, Ollie Murs and Louis Walsh. One of her favourite things was taking a helicopter ride, she loved it. 'Every message made Lily smile and they meant so much, I want to thank everyone who took part in making my girl's last days so special. 'I know we might not be able to complete everything on the bucket list but we are going to try. 'Last week we all stayed in a posh hotel with two bath tubs in the room.' Mr McKinstry said: 'We know some of her things on her bucket list will be hard but we will keep going - we would do anything for her. 'We want to raise as much awareness about DIPG as possible, we need more research so more lives can be saved and finally a cure can be found.' They family are raising money for the Havens Hospices. 1. World Peace. 2. Wheelchair access at every underground station in London  - Boris Johnson her a sent letter and video message. 3. Meet famous people including, Simon Cowell, cast of Modern Family, Dani Harmer from Tracy Beaker, Jamie Oliver, the bands The Vamps and 5 Seconds of Summer and Olly Murs and Dermot O’Lear from the X Factor. As part of her 'bucket list' - which is now being carried on by her family - Lily wanted a helicopter ride . 4. Meet Jacqueline Wilson and have her write a book about Lily - Received personalised letter. 5. Hot air balloon ride - Uncompleted but will hopefully be done in Lily's honour . 6. Her ‘cat’ video to be shown on the Talk Talk sponsor trailer for X Factor - It was made but not aired. 7. A holiday  - The family went to Butlins. 8. Adopt an animal  - The family hope to do as soon as possible. 9. Visit Florida - Unfortunately, Lily was too ill to go on a planned trip. 10. Helicopter ride - Completed. 11. Horse and carriage ride  - Lily’s coffin was carried by horse and carriage. 12. Trip to a chocolate factory  - A family member is going to complete in the New Year. 13.

"Those who ignore the advice dolled out in fortune cookies at the end of a meal take heed: a retired U.S. Postal Service is $200,000 better off after using the numbers in his  to play the lottery. Martin Fuentes, 73, is sitting pretty after putting his faith in the advice dolled out in the sweet end-of-meal treat. The grandfather won $200,000 in the Lucky Day Lotto after buying a ticket at a 7-Eleven store in Des Plaines - nicknamed, appropriately, the 'City of Destiny'. Fortune cookies have proved a good source of winning lottery numbers of the years . Mr Fuentes explained he had taken his mother's advice to 'play the ""lucky numbers""' in his fortune cookie - and was now encouraging others to 'take someone's advice'. But Mr Fuentes isn't the only lucky winner to credit their windfall to the advice of a fortune cookie. New York grandmother Emma Duvoll, then 75, enjoyed a meal at Manhattan Chinese restaurant Sammy's Noodle Shop & Grill earlier this year, ending it by cracking open her sweet treat to reveal five lucky numbers. She used the numbers when purchasing a Powerball ticket in February this year - winning a life changing $2million. Just weeks later, Merces Goncalves, of San Jose, California, scooped $400,000 thanks to a fortune cookie, Liberty Voice reports. Then there was the Powerball draw in 2005, which had a record 110 winners,winning $500,000 and $100,000 each, according to Fox News. At first, organizers appear to have suspected foul play - until it became clear all the winners had used numbers from a fortune cookie. But what is Mr Fuentes going to do with his good fortune? It seems his family is about to have their best Christmas ever. 'I plan to use some of it to make the holidays very special for my children and grandchildren,' he said.","Martin Fuentes followed his mother's advice to play treat's 'lucky numbers'

"This is the heart-stopping moment a downhill skateboarder travelling at high speed nearly smashes head on into an oncoming passenger coach. The unidentified longboarder was speeding down what he thought was a deserted country road in Spain, until a white coach suddenly appeared round a sharp left-hand bend.

Driving under wet conditions, the truck’s dog trailer can be seen losing control as it wobbles from left to right – lifting one side up in the air before it landed back down but ends up flipping over. Scroll down for video . Shocking footage has emerged of a truck's back trailer rolling over on its side on a Sydney motorway . Within seconds, the trailer ends up scrapping on its’ side along the freeway but luckily the surrounding vehicles managed to avoid any collision with the truck. The driver with the dashcam, believed to be Mat Wake, can be heard stepping on his brake, as he slowly drives towards the incident while smoke and dust started appearing from the trailer. When the trailer stopped sliding across the road, other motorists are seen driving around the truck but they continue off in their journey. It is unclear what happened after the incident but one motorist posted a photograph of the accident scene on the video, showing a tow truck, road officials and police officers surrounding the empty trailer. The video was posted onto Dash Cam Owners Australia on Thursday morning. A caption along the video explained: 'A Dog trailer of a truck develops a tank slapper ans [sic] flips on Sydney's M4 motorway. Luckily Police were just down the road and started reversing up as it happened.' Since it was last uploaded, the video has received more than 55,000 views and a significant amount of comments about the incident.

"Soaring numbers of families are taking the hassle out of preparing the traditional Christmas Day dinner at home by eating out this year. One million diners are set to be served by a single leading pub and restaurant group alone on December 25th, the latest research shows. And the study found that the average cost per head of a Christmas Day dinner is highest in London at £56.92 and lowest in Scotland at £47.41. More than 1,000,000 guests are set to dine out on Christmas Day, a 20 per cent rise on last year's figures . Out of 250,000 meals already ordered in one restaurant, half were not the traditional turkey dish . With less than a week to go until the big day, research reveals more than one million guests are set to dine out for Christmas lunch. Pubs and restaurants across the UK have seen a 20 per cent increase as UK consumers plan to dine out on the 25th instead of eating with family and friends at home. And it's not just the usual venue for Christmas dinner that seems to be changing, but also our choice of festive food. With the cost if cooking for a family rising to £178 and the stress of timing numerous dishes, many are now choosing to eat at restaurants . Although turkey remains a favourite, according to the 250,000 meals already on order, sales of Chocolate Brownies are outselling the traditional Christmas Pudding, and in Harvester nearly 50 per cent of the meals set to be served will not be turkey. With a predicted nine hours spent preparing, cooking and clearing away a Christmas Day feast, it's no wonder that Britons across the country have made the decision to ditch the dish cloths this year. As well as the time spent making Christmas dinner, industry research indicates that it costs the average family £178 to cook at home, put together with the pressure of serving multiple courses to the extended family means chefs at home could be cooking up a lot of stress. When compared to the average cost of dining out on Christmas Day (£52.58) and the ease of being served in a restaurant it is not hard to see why people are increasingly stepping away from the stove. Restaurant and pub group Mitchells & Butlers, who conducted the research, has seen increased bookings for Christmas Day, with the top ten booking hotspots from guests in Birmingham, London, Leeds, Bristol, Liverpool, Sheffield, Sutton Coldfield, Glasgow, Nottingham and Coventry. Catriona Kempston, Marketing Director, at Mitchells & Butlers said: 'We are a nation of bakers, but now more than ever time spent with our loved ones is coming first and though the tradition of cooking at home is still prevalent, the hours that can be given back by dining out this Christmas is outweighing it. 'Christmas can be a stressful time, taking the drama out of ""doing the dinner"" could be the best Christmas present you can give someone, and with sales of our gift cards up 34 per cent this year already and £500,000 sales, it seems Seasons Eatings is this year's most popular present to give loved one this year.'","20% rise in the number of people dining out on Christmas Day .

"A controlling husband was facing life imprisonment for strangling his wife in a jealous rage after she started a relationship with a new man, a court heard. Andrew Leigh was convicted of the murder of his estranged wife of eight years, Luna, 42, after learning she had started dating someone new. After she spurned his reconciliation attempts the 'controlling' 42-year-old drugged the pretty brunette with sleeping pills before throttling her in her bed. Her body was discovered 'cold as ice' in the former martial home in Pype Hayes, Birmingham on June 29 this year. Andrew Leigh, 42, (pictured left) was convicted of the murder of his estranged wife Luna, 42, (pictured right) by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court . Leigh, a telecommunications engineer, had denied murder, but a jury disbelieved his version of events and found him guilty after a 10 day trial at Birmingham Crown Court. The court heard Leigh had moved out of the property around a year ago but wanted to rekindle his relationship with Luan but she had 'moved on.' In a jealous revenge attack he then drugged her with sleeping pills before strangling her to death in her own bed. Prosecutor Rachel Brand QC said: 'It was about 6.45am on June 29 when the defendant rang his wife's sister, a woman called Natasha Chamberlain. 'His opening remark was 'I am really sorry, Natasha, but your sister has passed away.' 'Natasha replied: 'What the hell do you mean? What has happened?' 'He told her he found her dead in bed at about 10.30pm the previous evening but did not call an ambulance because he did know what to do at the time. 'He had killed his wife. 'When the ambulance arrived on the Sunday morning, Luan Leigh was as cold as ice.' Jurors were told Leigh had drugged his wife on the Saturday evening with the over-the-counter sleeping pills Nytol, which contain antihistamines. Traces of the main ingredients of Nytol were found in Mrs Leigh's blood during her post-mortem. Ms Brand said: 'We do not how much was given to Luan...but we do she was drugged. The jury heard that Leigh drugged Luna before strangling her in her home in Pype Hayes, Birmingham, West Midlands . 'Police found the empty packet of tablets, along with their receipt and instructions of use in the house. 'He was on CCTV buying Nytol in the Lloyds pharmacy in Walmley on the Saturday morning.' The court heard Leigh had become aware Luan was dating somebody else after going through her iPhone and trying to hack her Facebook account. Ms Brand added: 'Luan told her sister and friends that he once locked her in her garage in a bid to get back together. 'He had also tried to hack into her Facebook account. 'About one week before her death, Luan told Andrew that she did not want him to go on a family holiday and gave him his money back. She wanted to take her mother instead. 'It transpired that the defendant had been snooping around her mobile phone on the evening of Saturday June 25. 'She had just starting seeing someone else and the defendant found out about it. 'He did not move on.' Leigh had moved out of the martial home (pictured above) about a yeat before the murder . During his trial, Leigh claimed he killed his wife by accident. He told the jury he wanted to try and get Luan's iPhone to 'find the truth' about her relationship with the other man and bought some Nytol, and put two tablets into her tea. Leigh said his estranged wife had gone upstairs and when he checked she appeared to be asleep and he found her iPhone under her pillow. However as he was leaning over her, he said, she woke up and lunged at him. He told the jury: 'I grasped her neck and held her momentarily and I then pushed her back down on the bed.' Speaking after the verdict, Detective Inspector Warren Hines, of West Midlands Police, said: 'The couple has been married for around eight years, but had been together for 22 years and were still friends, despite the split.. 'However Luan found Leigh to be controlling and was encouraging him to move on with his life. 'Andrew Leigh was controlling and overbearing and he did not accept that his marriage to Luan was over. 'He has, through his actions, deprived Luan's family of a much loved daughter, sister and friend. 'I very much hope that today's verdict will in some small way allow Luan's family to start rebuilding their lives after the terrible events of June this year.' Leigh was due to be sentenced tomorrow/ on Friday.","Andrew Leigh, 42, was found guilty of the murder of his 42-year-old wife .

"Jonathan Firth, 33, (pictured today) who groomed a 16-year-old pupil by sending her naked pictures on Snapchat before taking her virginity, has been jailed . A secondary school teacher who groomed a 16-year-old pupil by sending her naked pictures on Snapchat before taking her virginity has been jailed. Bradford Crown Court heard that Jonathan Firth, 33, began a 'wholly inappropriate' relationship with the teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons. The teacher, who was already in a relationship, took the girl to cafes, and sent her naked pictures of himself, before her to the house he lived in with his parents, where they eventually had sex. Prosecutor Rebecca Young told the court that at the time of starting the relationship with the pupil, Firth, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, was working at a high school as a cover supervisor, teaching English and Healthcare. 'The situation found him to be very informal and he engaged with pupils in gossip about other teachers,' said Miss Young. 'When she returned to do her A-levels she told her friends that she liked the teacher. They told him she wanted to speak to him and when she spoke to him she told him she liked him. 'He contacted her over Twitter and Snapchat and sent naked photos of himself getting in and out of the shower, but she didn't want to reciprocate. 'In October they started to meet up and met in a café so people didn't see them and then she started to go round to his house.' Miss Young told the court that the girl went round to Firth's home, where he lived with his parents, eight or nine times, and while there they would watch films, kiss and hold hands. However, she said that the end of November, the relationship became sexual, after Firth 'provisionally told her that he would wait for her to give him a sign to say she was ready'. The court heard the relationship came to an end after the teenager - who cannot be named - revealed to her mother how old her 'boyfriend' was, and Firth stopped speaking to her. The girl started a relationship with someone her own age, who told a teacher at the school, who confirmed she already had concerns about Firth's relationship with many of the other pupils. 'She saw him appear to be flirty with a number of 15 and 16 year old girls,' Miss Young said. Firth was suspended from his job at the school, and resigned immediately, the court heard. Bradford Crown Court heard that Jonathan Firth, 33, began a 'wholly inappropriate' relationship with the teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons . In a victim impact statement read out to the court, the girl said what had happened has had 'a huge impact on her day-to-day life and on reflection she feels she was taken advantage of'. She admitted being 'excited' by having to keep it a secret and by the fact she had a crush on him, but has since found it hard to keep up with a work, and found people were talking about her at school and on social media. The court heard that during his relationship with the girl, Firth was also in a four-year ongoing relationship with another teacher. Defending Firth, Dale Brook, said references given to the court by friends and family described him as a 'caring, thoughtful, decent man'. He was jailed for 21 months after admitting three counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of causing a child to engage in sexual activity as a person in a position of trust, between October and November last year . He said Firth regretted his actions: 'It came at a time when he was low and the attention and affection she showed to him was flattering. 'His history of mental illness and his history of being low is no excuse but it's an explanation as to how he ended up doing what he obviously should never have done.' Firth stood in the dock with his head bowed as he was jailed by Judge Jonathan Rose. The judge said: 'It's mysterious why, when you had a relationship, you should seek a sexual relationship with someone I regard as being a child. 'You were a man of education, intelligence and training, and you are certainly aware of how inappropriate a relationship of this type was. 'She was inexperienced in sexual matters and she was a virgin and you took from her the gift of her virginity. She will forever know it was taken in a criminal act.' He was jailed for 21 months after admitting three counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of causing a child to engage in sexual activity as a person in a position of trust, between October and November last year. Firth was also handed a ten-year sexual offences prevention order and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge.","Jonathan Firth took the girl to cafes and sent her naked pictures of himself .

"Lengthy jail terms were handed out to four men on Thursday after they tortured a Perth drug dealer and left him disabled. Cyril Mansour, his brother Serji, Andy Mannah and Niraj Singh, all flew to Perth from Sydney in November 2011, and lured Gary Visanich, 43,to a house in Bentley. They assaulted Mr Visanich for hours and he suffered multiple injuries including burns and severe lacerations that were contaminated with dirt. Cigarette butts were also found deep in his throat. After being tortured Mr Visanich was driven to a nearby park and dumped beside rubbish bins. Police arrest one of of the four men from Sydney involved in torturing Gary Visanich . The Perth trip had been arranged by Cyril Mansour to recover a drug debt of up to $150,000 owed to him by Mr Visanich. ABC reported that District Court Judge Julie Wager said Mr Visanich could no longer live independently and could not look after himself without supervision. Judge Wager described what was done to Mr Visanich as 'degrading', 'disgusting' and 'cruel'. 'It is that chilling that you made the premeditated decision to fly-in and fly-out and behave in this manner,' she said. One of the gang members is taken away by police in Sydney . Judge Wager said Cyril Mansour was the 'principal offender' who had sent threatening text messages to Mr Visanich in the days before he was assaulted. Cyril Mansour was sentenced to 12 years' jail, while his brother Serji and Mannah were each given eight years. Singh was sentenced to nine-and-a-half years. Gary Visanich suffered multiple injuries including burns and severe lacerations . A fifth man who dumped Mr Visanich in the park was sentenced to two years and nine months in jail. The men were arrested in Sydney three weeks after the assault and extradited to Perth.","Cyril Mansour, his brother Serji, Andy Mannah and Niraj Singh lured Gary Visanich to a house in Bentley .

"A collection of bizarre Victorian inventions that never quite made it past the prototype stage have been revealed in a new book. It was the incredible era when Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb, George Stephenson was busy with his first steam engine and engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed the first propeller-driven transatlantic steamship. But the display, which has been held at the National Archives in Kew, Richmond, for 150 years, reveals not every idea in the 'age of invention' would change the world. The inventions found range from the wacky to the baffling, such as a cravat to protect against garrotting and an air-conditioned top hat. There are even a set of saucy corsets with expandable busts. The display, which has been held at the National Archives in Kew, Richmond, for 150 years, includes a parasol with portholes so the user can see through the top . The idea of hiding a coin purse in a glove (pictured) was one of the Victorian-era that failed to change the world . Inventors also proposed artificial leeches to drain blood for medical treatment (pictured) and a flying machine for the Arctic that pre-dates the first airship by more than 40 years . Inventors also proposed artificial leeches to drain blood for medical treatment and a flying machine for the Arctic that pre-dates the first airship by more than 40 years. The idea of hiding a coin purse in gloves never caught on nor did a mechanical 'jack' for automatically pulling off boots. A device to save people from drowning, complete with rowing-style paddles and miniature floating buoys, never made it into production. And a mangle-like hair brushing machine also failed to make the cut. There was even a design for a walking stick cane gun like the one used by actor Robbie Coltrane in the 1999 James Bond film The World Is Not Enough. There was even a design for a walking stick cane gun (pictured) like the one used by actor Robbie Coltrane in the 1999 James Bond film The World Is Not Enough. A design for a corset with an expandable bust, invented by F.Parsons in 1881. It works by inflating the cups with a tube to make the breasts appear larger . The Bonafide Ventilating Hat, invented by John Fuller & Co. in 1849, was designed to stop gentlemen's heads overheating while wearing top hats, a big problem at the time . The discovery of the plans was made by Julie Halls, Records Specialist for Registered Designs at the institution in Kew, south London, gathering dust. She has now turned the designs she found that spanned from 1839 to 1991 into the book 'Inventions That Didn't Change The World'. Julie said of the book in an interview with publisher Thames & Hudson: 'These designs came in a culture where inventors were viewed as national heroes. 'There was very much a culture of 'can do' and teaching yourself and being self-reliant and a fascination with the way things worked. Artificial leeches, thought up by one of the Victorian inventors who thought they were great minds of the time . A design for a gold digger's dwelling was one of the late 1800s wacky inventions which was drawn up put never put into production . Designs reflected things that were possibly needed at the time like this one for an 'Invalid's Exercising Chair', invented by Robert Kerry, in 1852 . 'Today, you would expect new designs that come to the market to have been made by professional engineers or designers. 'But in those days people would just invent things associated with their own profession and try and get them to the market. 'It was amazing to discover them especially when only a few very determined researchers had actually seen them before. 'The book is an opportunity for the public to see them for the very first time.' When Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb in 1879 and George Stephenson was busy with his first steam engine, hundreds of wannabe inventors wanted their shot at glory. A design for an Anti - Garotting Cravat, invented by Walter Thornhill in 1862 - the same year an MP was the victim of a robbery by garrotting . Plans for a universal reservoir inkstand, created in Birmingham, have been gathering dust for 150 years . A design for a 'jack' for putting on and pulling off boots, invented by, Edward Fox, in 1846. It features in the new book complied from the National Archives . The Desideratum Combined Knife and Fork, invented by, Messrs Arnold and Son in 1881 was designed with the intentions that people would be able to eat with one hand . A design for a spring bible and prayer case which was registered for Thomas Brindley of Finsbury . Author Julie, who has worked at the Archives for five years, insists everyone was trying to create the next big thing more than 150 years ago. She says the 1843 Utility Designs Act was the turning point because the Act gave copyright protection to the new elements of 'useful' designs. Before that only 'ornamental' plans like ceramics, wallpapers, and textiles were covered by the Act. Julie said: 'A lot of the designs seem completely bizarre until you know the social history behind them. Though you do have to wonder how many lives would have been saved by the anti-garrotting cravat.' Inventions that Didn't Change the World is available to buy on Amazon. This figure shows the design for a 'breast reliever', which was invented by Alexander Robertson, in 1849. It never made it into production and collected dust elsewhere .

"Rina Khan was cleared of assault today after being accused of hitting a child so hard with a ruler that it snapped . A primary school teacher who hit a six-year-old pupil on the head with a ruler in class has been cleared of assault. Rina Khan, 41, was accused of hitting the child so hard that it broke - as a punishment for getting a question wrong during a Maths lesson. On Tuesday, she went on trial at Birmingham Crown Court charged with common assault and child cruelty. Prosecutors said she 'flipped' and lost her temper before lashing out and also claimed she called the boy a 'muppet'. The court heard a teaching assistant watched in horror as part of the ruler 'flew across the room' after the incident on March 20 which left the Year 2 pupil 'sad and scared'. Ms Khan wept in the dock as she told the court yesterday that she only 'tapped' the boy on the head because he was misbehaving by poking another pupil with a pencil. And after less than an hour of deliberating today, a jury agreed with her version of events and cleared of her of all charges. Recorder John Edwards told Ms Khan: 'You have been found not guilty on both counts. You are discharged and you are free to go.' Outside court, Ms Khan spoke of her relief following her ordeal which saw her suspended from her job and taking anti-depressants. She said: 'I am just very relieved that the word was not guilty. This has been going in since March. 'I was suspended and I have been ill at home since. I have been taking anti-depressants and I had become somewhat of a recluse. 'And all this just for tapping a child on the head with a ruler. 'I do feel like I have been picked on. I'm not sure what I'm going to do next.' The court heard how the teacher had warned the child twice about poking another pupil with a pencil at the school, which cannot be named for legal reasons. She admitted to striking him on the head with the ruler but said she only did so gently and the ruler may have broken because it was weak. Jurors were also told the boy 'barely reacted at all' and was not injured during the incident. Giving evidence, Ms Khan, from Smethwick in the West Midlands, said: 'I have a duty of care to all my pupils. A jury Birmingham Crown Court, pictured, agreed with Ms Khan's version of events and cleared her of common assault and child cruelty charges . 'The pencil was quite sharp. It was going to hurt the girl. She was really trying so hard to work. 'I had a ruler in my hand at that time...and simply tapped him on the head. 'The ruler broke. I was really really shocked by that. I don't think I used any force. It was just a tap. 'I did call him a muppet but I did not use that word on that day. 'I used that word with my children sometimes but as a term of affection, just like The Muppets Show with the furry, little guys.' Tom Walkling, defending, added: 'Do we want to live in a world where teachers are so afraid of being prosecuted in a criminal court that they are wary of any contact with the children in their care? 'Is tapping a naughty boy on the head with a ruler really a criminal assault?'","Rina Khan, 41, was accused of hitting the child so hard the ruler snapped .

"A month of gaffes by Nigel Farage has led to a slump in voter satisfaction with the Ukip leader. Rows over breastfeeding, immigrants causing traffic jams and demanding a wreath at the Cenotaph have combined with allegations of a sex scandal involving the party's general secretary and a candidate. A new poll today showed Mr Farage's net satisfaction rating has dropped sharply to -20, with supporters of other parties finding him a turn-off. Scroll down for video . The latest IpsosMori survey reveals a dramatic fall in net satisfaction with Nigel Farage as Ukip leader . The new IpsosMori survey puts net satisfaction – the percentage of voters satisfied minus the percentage dissatisfied - in Mr Farage's performance as Ukip leader is at its lowest ever level at -20. Only 33 per cent are satisfied and 53 per cent dissatisfied. This is down from a net score of -6 last month, and down sharply on positive ratings of 11 seen in May last year. While Mr Farage remains very popular amongst Ukip supporters with 92 per cent satisfied, his ratings among the other parties' supporters have slipped, IpsosMori said. Half of Tory supporters are unimpressed by Mr Farage, 66 per cent of Labour supporters, and 61 per cent of Lib Dems. Mr Farage remains more popular that the other leaders, with only Ed Miliband seeing a slight rise in support this month . Sex education policy confusion . Dec 3: Nigel Farge: 'I've never advocated that policy. If somebody in Ukip in the past did, well, so be it, but I think that people need to have a rounded education and sex education is part of that.'  The party's website stated:  'Scrap sex and relationship education for children under the age of 11.' Ostentatious breastfeeding . Dec 5: Nigel Farage: 'It isn't too difficult to breastfeed a baby in a way that isn't ostentatious.' Immigrants causing traffic jams . Dec 6: Nigel Farage: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here. It should have taken three-and-half to four. 'That has nothing to do with professionalism. What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the M4 is not as navigable as it used to be.' General secretary sex scandal . Dec 8: Ukip general secretary Roger Bird suspended over allegations of impropriety with candidate Natasha Bolter. He claims they slept together, she denies it. Doubts later emerge about her CV, with Oxford denying she studied there and questions about her teaching qualifications . Rate an immigrant game . Dec 13: A Ukip game asks supporters to rate 'blacks, Muslims and Eastern Europeans' in a game – with prizes of cash and a Ukip golf umbrella. Weeding out the lunatics . Dec 14: Ukip candidates chief David Soutter: 'Half my job is spent not finding good candidates to stand, it is weeding out the lunatics, the people who shouldn't be there.' Candidate quits over 'poofter' comments . Dec 15: Kerry Smith forced to quit as Ukip candidate in South Basildon and East Thurrock after being taped mocking gay party members as 'poofters', joking about shooting people from Chigwell in a 'peasant hunt' and referring to someone as a 'Chinky bird'. Taking money from Brussels . Dec 16: Ukip secures a £1.5 million pot of taxpayers' cash by forming a new European-wide political party. Mr Farage courted controversy last month when he waded into the row over breastfeeding in public, after a mother at the London hotel Claridge's was asked to cover her baby's head with a napkin. He suggested mothers of newborn babies should avoid being 'openly ostentatious' when breastfeeding and might think about sitting in a corner when doing so. The Ukip leader was also branded 'silly and dangerous' after blaming immigrants clogging up the M4 for him missing an event in Port Talbot. The party has also been rocked by allegations that general secretary Roger Bird behaved inappropriately towards candidate Natasha Bolter, including taking her for dinner and buying her a dress. And Kerry Smith was forced to resign as the party's general election candidate in South Basildon and East Thurrock – which Mrs Bolter hoped to be selected for – after making a series of offensive comments. In recordings of phone calls obtained by the Mail on Sunday, the would-be MP was said to have mocked gay party members as 'poofters', joked about shooting people from Chigwell in a 'peasant hunt' and referred to someone as a 'Chinky bird'. Before quitting, Mr Smith had initially apologised and explained that he had been under great stress at the time of the comments and taking strong painkillers. Lib Dem Deputy PM Nick Clegg today dismissed Ukip as 'just a movement of angry blokes' trying to become a political party. On his LBC Radio phone-in show Mr Clegg said: 'Of all the excuses for this kind of bile and racist, homophoboic vitriol - 'I was on a sedative' - most people on a sedative don't become Alf Garnett on stilts, do they? Most people on sedatives go to sleep. 'But apparently if you are in Ukip, if you are on a sedative, you just become even more unpleasant.' He added: 'What we are seeing in Ukip is what I always predicted would happen, which is that the more they try and become like a political party, rather than just a movement of angry blokes - it's almost always angry blokes in suits just saying they are against everything - and the more they are being pressed on what you would do and what you would agree on, the more the problems emerge.' Mr Clegg's personal ratings are still in the doldrums, down to -40 in the latest poll. The Lib Dems are on 9 per cent in the voting intention, behind Ukip on 13 per cent, with the Tories ahead on 32 per cent and Labour on 29 per cent. Gideon Skinner, Head of Political Research at Ipsos MORI, said: 'One of the themes of the year has been the rise of the 'other' parties as a mirror to the weakness of the traditional three. 'Most attention has been paid to UKIP, who still claim third place, although their leader's popularity with voters beyond his own supporters has fallen. 'But it's not just UKIP, as we see this month with a high for the Greens, who are fishing in the same pool of disaffected Liberal Democrat voters who have been boosting Labour.' Labour is under threat from Ukip in four key seats, a poll showed today. Ed Miliband's party is under threat in Great Grimsby, Dudley North, Plymouth Moor View and Rother Valley. Lord Ashcroft's poll found Labour was ahead in the seats, but only just. He said: 'If the Labour Party is worried about them, it has good reason to be.' In three of the seats he found Ukip ahead by up to six points on the standard voting intention question, and they were tied with Labour in Dudley. 'It was only when people were asked how they would vote in their own constituency that Labour's lead reasserted itself: six points in Rother Valley, five points in Plymouth Moor View, three points in Dudley North and one point in Great Grimsby. In the seats as a whole the swing to UKIP was 13.5 per cent, Lord Ashcfroft added.","Ukip leader's net satisfaction falls dramatically to -20%, says IpsosMori .
Marks a sharp decline from -6% last month and up to 11% in May last year .

"Stepping down: Dr Anthony Marsh has said he will no longer head up two ambulance services at once . The controversial boss of two ambulance services has announced he is stepping down from one just 11 months into the job. Dr Anthony Marsh was already chief executive of West Midlands Ambulance Service when he added the East of England region to his workload in January. He has now said he will go as soon as a replacement can be found. The decision came in the week that a harrowing internal report from the East of England ambulance service revealed paramedics were leaving bodies at ambulance stations to avoid finishing their shifts late. It followed a series of outcries, firstly over his taxpayer-funded £232,000-a-year salary while effectively working part-time in both regions. He was then found to be spending a five-figure sum each year on expenses for taxis and hotels. In the meantime, he failed to drag response times in the East of England to expected national standards. Tory MP Henry Bellingham yesterday accused both ambulance services of making a ‘mistake’ in allowing one person to run them. ‘What East of England Ambulance Service needs is a full-time, dedicated chief executive to move the service forward,’ he said. ‘It’s all about delivery and success and I don’t think he’s delivered. They were asking one person to do too much.’ Dr Marsh will no longer receive the £50,000 pay boost he was granted when he took over the dual role. Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter described the remuneration package as ‘obscene’ when he was ‘only doing half a job for each ambulance service’. It then emerged Dr Marsh was spending £350 a week on taxis, despite being handed a 2012 silver Range Rover Sport by the West Midlands service. Officials explained he couldn’t drive himself as he needed to work during the three-hour journey to the East of England headquarters. Job number one: Dr Marsh was already in charge of the West Midlands ambulance service, pictured... Job number two: But he then took on the top job at the East of England ambulance service too (above) Instead, a Mercedes would pick him up at his home in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, and drive him to the site in Melbourn, Cambridgeshire. He was also staying in hotels twice a week on average, costing more than £7,000 a year. There was renewed outrage when the body of James Harrison, 32, who collapsed and died in a Cambridgeshire street, was left beside bins at an ambulance station because paramedics wanted to go home on time rather than take his body to a hospital morgue. Anger: Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter described Dr Marsh's remuneration package as 'obscene' This week’s report revealed it remained there for two hours and spent so long unrefrigerated that police feared it would affect post-mortem examination tests. Investigators also uncovered evidence crews were paying undertakers to do the job for them so that they wouldn’t overrun their shifts. Other failures in the region include a 92-year-old Second World War bomber veteran who died from a bleed on the brain after waiting 90 minutes for an ambulance when he fell and hit his head. The West Midlands service was fined £2.6 million in May for missing targets. Meanwhile East of England – which has been paying 60 per cent of Dr Marsh’s salary - has continued to miss the targets for ambulance response times. In November it managed to reach just 71.1 per cent of the most urgent Category A (Red 1) call-outs within eight minutes against the required 75 per cent. A spokesman for East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust, which Dr Marsh had signed up to for a two-year period, said: ‘Long ambulance delays are significantly reduced, performance is improving, complaints are down and compliments are up, although we recognise there is still much work for us to do.’ The West Midlands service confirmed he would continue as its chief executive.

"A coach driver left his passengers stranded after he quit his job at the wheel after repeatedly getting lost during a journey to an airport. The National Express coach was travelling from Bradford in West Yorkshire to Heathrow on Tuesday night when the frustrated driver told passengers he has 'no idea' where he was going, before ringing up his bosses and quitting. He told customers he was not allowed a satnav as National Express bosses believe they look 'unprofessional.' The National Express coach was travelling from Bradford in West Yorkshire to Heathrow when the frustrated driver told passengers he has 'no idea' where he was going, before ringing his boss and quitting (file picture) At one point during the 'nightmare' seven-hour journey the coach was stuck on an industrial estate in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, for 25 minutes while the driver looked for Luton railway station. The coach journey normally has around 11 scheduled stops, including Luton railway station and Luton airport bus station. Trevor Wright, a passenger on the coach, told The Sun: 'People tried to talk to him but he refused to communicate.

Mr Wright added that the driver eventually used a phone to find Luton railway station but then went 'ballistic' after he accidentally drove the wrong way up a one-way street.

The Sun reported that 20 passengers were then forced to get taxis to Heathrow in a desperate bid to catch their flights, while the driver took the rest to Luton Airport and would not drive any further. Some passengers took to Twitter to vent their anger. Yimika Edun said: 'Shouldn't there be some sort of gps system on board to assist the driver?

"The birth of bilby joeys have topped off an exciting year that saw the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge officially opening the bilby exhibit named in honour of their son, Prince George. Prince George, accompanied by his parents to the ceremony, unveiled a plaque commemorating the dedication of the Prince George Bilby Exhibit at Sydney Taronga Zoo earlier this year. Following the royal visit first time mother Yajala gave birth to two joeys around 10 weeks ago but they have only just begun emerging from their underground nest. Scroll down for video . Taronga Zoo’s national breeding program has led to its first-ever successful births of joeys at the Prince George Bilby Exhibit in Sydney . Despite the threatened marsupial species, the Zoo’s national breeding program has led to its first-ever successful births of joeys after their mother, who arrived from Monarto Zoo in South Australia in 2013, had a successful pairing with Taronga's male bilby, also named George. ‘This breeding success will help us build on the incredible exposure of the visit by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their son Prince George, which brought the message of bilby conservation to the world,’ Taronga Zoo director Cameron Kerr said. The Royal couple visited the Sydney landmark on April 20 and were introduced to some of Australia’s unique and endangered wildlife before the ceremony, which was part of the Australian government’s official gift following his birth in mid-2013. Prince George was accompanied by his parents to unveil a plaque commemorating the dedication of the Prince George Bilby Exhibit . Making its first appearance from their underground nest  after it was born about 10 weeks ago, along with its sibling . Taronga Zoo is celebrating the birth of its first-ever Bilby joeys following the royal visit in April this year . Bilby keeper Paul Davies said: ‘I’d like to think there was a little Royal magic at work in the birth of these joeys. 'You could say the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge brought us good luck, as it’s after their visit that we’ve been able to breed Bilbies for the very first time.’ The gestation period for the joeys is only 14 days – one of the shortest of all mammals before they are carried in their mother’s pouch for about 75 days. The gestation period for the bilby is only 14 days. Joeys are then carried in their mother’s pouch for about 75 days . The births cap off an exciting year that saw The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge officially open the Zoo’s new Bilby exhibit named in honour of their son, Prince George . Yajala's successful pairing with a male bilby is a triumph for the national breeding program for this threatened species . Mr Davies said keepers had yet to determine the sex of the two joeys, who still spend much of their time underground in their home at the Zoo’s Australian Nightlife exhibit. ‘Yajala is still quite secretive with the little ones. The best time to catch a glimpse of them is between 10-11am, but this time will extend each day as the joeys grow in confidence and become more independent from their mother,’ he said. Bilbies once ranged over most of mainland Australia, but have suffered a catastrophic decline over the past 200 years due to predation by feral animals such as foxes and cats, competition with rabbits and habitat loss. Taronga has begun conservation partnerships with the Save the Bilby Fund and Australian Wildlife Conservancy to help protect Bilbies and their remaining habitat in the wild.

"The family of a British student who was travelling to Australia when he died on MH17 has revealed there are still 700 fragments of human remains to be identified in the Netherlands. Ben Pocock, 20, from Keynsham, Bristol, was a second-year international business degree student at Loughborough University. He was en route to Perth to study at the University of Western Australia when Malaysia Airlines flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine in mid-July. Scroll down for video . Ben Pocock was one of 10 Britons who died on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 . The family of a British student who was travelling to Australia when he died on MH17 has revealed there are still 700 fragments of human remains to be identified in the Netherlands . Ben's father, Jeremy Pocock, says his family has been fortunate in a way because they've been able to recover quite a lot of his body. 'But we are one of those families that will almost certainly have to go through the process of dealing with further identifications,' he told BBC TV on Thursday night (Friday morning AEDT). 'Only a few days ago we were informed that there are another 700 fragments of human tissue or bones yet to be identified and that's a process that's going to go until April or May. Mo, Evie and Otis Maslin who were killed on flight MH17 when their plane was shot down over Ukraine after returning from a holiday to Amsterdam . 'So there are a lot of families that are going to be receiving news of yet more identifications over the coming months and we may be one of them.' Authorities announced in early December that some fragments of all 38 Australians who died on MH17 had at last been formally identified. All 298 people on board the flight, from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, died when the jet was shot down over an area of Ukraine controlled by pro-Russia separatists on July 17. the family of Ben Pocock have revealed that 700 pieces of human remains still need to be identified . Mr Pocock said four Dutch families were still waiting for loved ones to be identified and even where identification had been possible in some cases it was 'minimal'. Many believe Russian-backed rebels shot down MH17 on July 17, but the exact cause remains unknown. 'The most important question for me and for my family - and all the other families I should imagine - is what happened and who did it?' Mr Pocock said. Mary and Gerry Menke were aboard the doomed flight when it was shot down over the Ukraine . 'They must be held to account. That's it - that's the bottom line. '(But) we have to be careful that we don't jump the gun and that we've got all the evidence and it's properly gathered.' The first sections of wreckage arrived in the Netherlands last week. Australian woman Emma Bell was a victim of the MH17 crash . Australia's lead envoy in the investigation, Angus Houston, expects the wreckage will indicate what happened. But the criminal investigation into who's responsible will be 'exceedingly difficult', he cautioned last week. Ben, an international business student, was heading to Australia for six months of study and travel. Queensland resident Roger Guard was on the flight when pro-Russian rebels shot down the plane . Mr Pocock said his wife Louise would have liked a final coffee with Ben at Bristol airport but he was so excited he headed straight through to the gates. 'So we said our goodbyes, we had a hug and that was it,' Mr Pocock said. 'We watched him go off into departures and ... we never saw him again.' Ben's younger sister, Emily, said grieving had been very strange because her brother was supposed to be in Australia for six months anyway. Sister Philomene Tiernan, who was well-loved in her by all her pupils, died onboard MH17 . 'He wasn't supposed to be at home,' she told the BBC. 'So we've had a hard time actually accepting what's happened.' Mr Pocock discovered news of the crash after checking Twitter on his phone as he returned home. 'It said a Malaysia Airlines flight had crashed and I just knew, in that second, that it was his,' he said. 'Even though I couldn't quite recall the flight number I just knew immediately that it was his flight.' The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and a team of Malaysian air crash investigators inspect the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 . Mr Pocock said his family were desperate for answers over what had happened and who was responsible. 'The most important question for me, and for my family and for all the other families I should imagine, is what happened and who did it, i n very, very simple terms. 'They should be held to account. That's it, that's the bottom line.' The victims of the crash included 10 Britons, 43 Malaysians and 195 Dutch nationals.","Ben Pocock was killed when MH17 was shot from the sky over the Ukraine .

"Brian Stonehouse joined the Royal Artillery in 1939 but his skills in French and as an illustrator proved invaluable in identifying four fellow spies killed in a concentration camp and led to a career at Vogue . It was supposed to be the perfect disguise - an English spy with a proficient command of French posing as an art student to transmit information from inside Nazi-occupied France. But the sketching skills of Brian Stonehouse later proved invaluable both in his work for the British military in identifying victims of fellow spies who died in concentration camps, and later in forging a successful career in fashion. The soldier turned spy was eventually spotted by Vogue, who employed him as an illustrator and he became among one of the best known in the profession. An exhibition of Stonehouse's works is currently being displayed in London, charting his extraordinary career that started when he joined the Royal Artillery and saw him awarded an MBE after his work as a secret agent. Stonehouse was an art student in the 1930s when he joined the Royal Artillery in 1939 and was posted on Guard Duty to the Orkney Islands. However his skills, particularly as a soldier fluent in French, were being wasted and he was soon recruited to work in Special Operations Executive (SOE) - a group of secret agents who were deployed across Nazi Europe to give information. His disguise was one of a French arts student called Michel Chapuis and he was sent to France with a radio hidden in his artist's box to transmit intelligence back to Britain. However after just three-and-a-half months he was captured and sent to a series of prisons and concentration camps over two years where he was tortured, put in solitary confinement and forced to carry out slave labour. During this time he was sent to five concentration and labour camps; Neue Bremm (Saarbrüchen), Mauthausen, Wiener Neudorf, Natzweiler-Struthof and Dachau until April 1945. But despite his incarceration Stonehouse's skills as an illustrator proved vitally important. While in Natzweiler he saw four women being marched to their deaths and later sketched their faces from memory. These sketches later helped identify four missing SOE agents from their photographs. He was often known as a spirited survivor. In Wiener Neudorf the guards made him draw portraits of them and their families. And in Natzweiler-Struthof he organised theatrical performances to distract prisoners as well as guards. Stonehouse became well known for his work in Vogue, including Two Studies of a Day Dress, 1955 . His iconic style led to a successful career at Vogue with illustrations such as The Complete Outfit 1952 . Stonehouse survived the war and was a witness in the War Crimes Tribunals where by chance he met New York socialite Harry Haller. Haller supported Stonehouse's move to America in 1946 and spotted his illustration skills. He was recommended as a portrait artist, but as fashion began to gain more popularity, his work was spotted by Jessica Daves, editor of Vogue. In 1952 he was appointed as an illustrator for the magazine - the first time one had been taken on by Vogue since 1939. Stonehouse worked there until 1962 and died of a heart attack in 1998. The discovery of his works was also an unusual  tale. Stonehouse's skill was spotted by the editor of Vogue at a time when fashion illustrations gained popularity . Stonehouse forged a successful career at Vogue for more than 10 years and his works are being exhibited . 'The Pencil Skirt' 1955 (left) and The Checked Dress (right) were designs that featured in Vogue magazine . He stored the work he had done between 1952 and 1958 at his brother's house in Suffolk. It was not until recently when his brother, then 97, moved house that he discovered his works. Some of his drawings of his experience of the war are on display in the Imperial War Museum while his accomplishments published in Vogue are being displayed at London gallery Abbott and Holder. Philip Athill, managing director at the gallery, said the exhibition had been very popular. Stonehouse posed for his picture in 1942 when he assumed the identity of a French art student . He said: 'It's very very rare that you get a person that has such a rare story to tell. Two authors have already expressed an interest in writing a book on him and his story was so extraordinary I can easily see it being made into a film.' Boston collector Frederic Sharf came across some of Stonehouse's works at an auction house and got in touch with the Imperial War Museum and his brother to piece together the illustrator's history to write 'Brian Stonehouse: Artist, Soldier, War Hero, Fashion Illustrator.' The exhibition of Stonehouse's works will be held at Abbott and Holder until Christmas Eve.","Brian Stonehouse was an art student and joined the Royal Artillery in 1939 .

"A witness in the Michael Brown trial claimed she had filmed the unarmed teen being shot with his hands in the air, but then lost the footage after she dropped her phone down the toilet. The witness, a mother-of-four, lives in an apartment complex adjacent to the street in Ferguson, Missouri, where Brown was killed by Officer Darren Wilson on August 9. Identified as 'Witness 41' in grand jury records released by St. Louis prosecutors, she testified on October 27 that Brown was shot while on his knees with his hands up. A witness in the Michael Brown trial claimed she had filmed the unarmed teen being shot with his hands in the air, but then lost the footage after she dropped her phone down the toilet . The woman didn't mention the recording while on the witness stand, but told prosecutors in passing as she leaving along with her godson, known as 'Witness 42'. According to prosecutor Kathi Alizadeh, she commented that it was 'too bad there weren't surveillance cameras in the complex' during the conversation in a corridor as the witness were leaving . 'Witness 41' replied that 'she had video of 'the entire thing on her phone' but had 'dropped the phone in the toilet' reports The Smoking Gun. Alizadeh then asked if she could have the phone so it could undergo a 'forensic examination' to determine if the video could be recovered. 'Witness 41' then explained that she had thrown the phone away because she was so mad. Rather than a missed opportunity for vital evidence which could have impacted the verdict, the bizarre admission seemed to harm the witness' credibility. 'Witness 41' testified on October 27 that she saw Officer Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown while he was on his knees with his hands up . Alizadeh notes that 'Witness 42', her godson – who lived next door – indicated that he had not heard the information before. 'This was news to him as well because he asked her where is the phone and, you know, he seemed to indicate that he had not heard that information before,' she told jurors. 'So I thought it was important that you know that.' Prosecutors gave the panel the option of recalling 'Witness 41' for further sworn testimony, but she never returned to the witness stand. The witness had first been interviewed about the case in her apartment on August 26, but had failed to mention any recording of the event. Instead ‘Witness 41’ told FBI agents that Officer Wilson had stood over his teenage victim and ‘just finished him up’ with a shot to the head. The interview took place prior to the publication of details of Brown’s autopsy which showed that he was not shot in the back or ‘finished’ by Wilson. The witness, a mother-of-four, lives in an apartment complex adjacent to the street in Ferguson, Missouri, where Brown was killed by Officer Darren Wilson on August 9 . When one of the FBI agents told 'Witness 41' that he didn’t believe her claims she became upset. She asked the interviewer to erase the recording of her interview and when they declined, she picked up the recorder and shut it off. After agreeing to resume the interview, ‘Witness 41’ said her ‘first statement was not completely true.’ When she retold her account, she changed one important fact and said her vantage point had been from behind Brown, not in front of the teenager. Despite all this, ‘Witness 41’ was called before the Ferguson grand jury and told the panel that she has been diagnosed with ‘mood swings, three personalities,’ and takes pills for a mental health condition.","'Witness 41' didn't mention the recording while on the witness stand, but told prosecutors in passing as she leaving .

Kirk Claus, pictured appearing at Leeds Crown Court, sold faulty vehicles with sand-filled radiators and false warranties to unsuspecting customers . The 47-year-old is said to have made more than £15million from the dodgy deals.

"By . David Martosko, US Political Editor for MailOnline . and . Lee Moran . Updated: . 14:34 EST, 18 December 2014 . President John F. Kennedy ordered his press secretary on February 2, 1962 to buy him as many of his favorite Cuban cigars as he could lay his hands on – and held off signing the Cuban trade embargo until his precious stogies were safely inside the White House. Kennedy asked Pierre Salinger to find at least 1,000 H.Upmann petit coronas, and gave him just a half-day to accomplish the task before they would become contraband. The next morning, Salinger recalled in rare video footage of his storytelling, he reported that he had bought up 1,200 of Cuba's finest exports – a feat the president pronounced 'Fantastic!' just before he signed a decree that banned all the communist country's products from the U.S. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . SMOKE ON DEMAND: President John F. Kennedy asked his press secretary to buy him 1,000 of his favorite Cuban cigars and waited to sign his U.S. trade embargo until he knew the tobacco was in the White House . PARTNERS IN CRIME? Pierre Salinger (left) was a regular cigar smoker, so he asked all the stores he knew to sell him every H. Upmann 'petit' cigar they had so JFK (right) could stock up . 'We went through probably the biggest disaster in the Kennedy administration, which was the Bay of Pigs,' Salinger recounted in the video. 'And about a month after the Bay of Pigs the president called me into his office about five in the afternoon.' 'He said, ""I really need some help"".' 'I said, ""What do you want, Mr. President?""' 'He said, ""I need cigars""."" 'The president smoked Cuban cigars,' Salinger explained. 'He smoked the ""petit Upmann,"" as I remember it.' 'I said, ""How many do you need?""' 'He said, ""A thousand"".' 'I said, ""When do you need them?""' 'He said, 'By tomorrow morning"".' ""That's a very tough assignment,' he remembered telling JFK, 'but I'll see what I can do.' LEGAL AGAIN: President Barack Obama lifted some of America's sanctions against Cuba on Wednesday, making it legal for Americans who travel there to bring back a limited supply of cigars . THEN AND NOW: Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro pictured in 1976 (left) and in 2009 (right) 'I was smoking a lot of cigars myself in those days,' he said, 'so I contacted a lot of my stores. And the next morning I got to the office at eight o-clock, and the president was already ringing me from the Oval Office – ""Come right in. Come right in"".' The hand-rolled H.Upmann cigar brand is one of Cuba's oldest. It was established in 1844 by two brothers, Herman and August Upmann, in Havana. The petit corona, known by aficionados as the 'petit Upmann,' was discontinued in 2002 but the factory later reinvented it along with its line of other 'vitolas,' or specific sizes and shapes. Originally it was a mild-to-medium-bodied cigar, only about the width of a man's pinky finger. Upmann used a blend of tobacco from the Vuelta Abajo region of Cuba to make the cigars, which were all hand-rolled. 'How'd you do?' President Kennedy asked him. 'I said, ""I did very well, Mr. President"",' he recalled. '""How many did you get?""' '""I got 1,200""' Kennedy repled, 'Fantastic!' Salinger remembers. And then, he says in the grainy footage unearthed by Janson Media, 'He opens up his desk drawer, and he pulls out the decree banning all Cuban products from the United States – and he signs it!'' At the time Kennedy signed his name to the paper, American teenagers were doing the Twist, the U.S. had yet to put a man into orbit around the earth, and a first-class postage stamp cost just 4 cents. Critics have long called the embargo a failed policy that has hurt ordinary Cubans instead of muscling the government toward reforms. It never managed to topple Fidel and Raul Castro. Raul is now in power and has been since Fidel fell ill years ago. When Kennedy announced the embargo, he citing 'the subversive offensive of Sino-Soviet communism with which the government of Cuba is publicly aligned.' JFK'S BRAND: H.Upmann cigars are a mild-to-medium blend favored by regular smokers . It went into effect just days later at the height of the Cold War, a year after the failed CIA-backed Bay of Pigs invasion meant to oust communism from Cuba and eight months before Soviet attempts to put nuclear missiles on the island brought the two superpowers to the brink of war. Striking a pose: JFK was photographed on many occasions enjoying cigars, and thanks to Salinger's story we know exactly what brand he smoked . Washington already had some limited sanctions in place, but Kennedy's decision was the beginning of a comprehensive ban on U.S. trade with the island that remained  intact until Wednesday. In 1996 the Helms-Burton law tightened the sanctions further. But President Barack Obama made a shocking move on Wednesday to reopen relations with Cuba and establish an embassy there. That means Americans who travel to Havana – and there will be thousands – 'will be able to return to the U.S. with some Cuban products, including Cohibas and other Cuban cigars,' according to Cigar Aficionado magazine. 'The changes are dramatic, if not complete,; the magazine's executive editor David Savona wrote. 'This news does not mean that Cuban cigars and other goods will appear in U.S. cigar shops tomorrow morning, but it does pave an important first step – and a big one – toward establishing normalized relations between the two countries.' The authoritative magazine's founder and publisher, Marvin Shanken, said Wednesday that 'for cigar smokers in America, Cuban cigars have long been the forbidden fruit. The cigar business was born in Cuba, and cigars made in Havana have a worldwide reputation for excellence.' 'We yearn for the day when our readers can have the opportunity to legally buy and enjoy cigars from every country.' As Cuban cigars go, the current incarnation of the petit Upmann is a bargain-priced item because of its small size, selling where the purchase is legal for the equivalent of $10. Under Obama's new rule, Americans coming back from Cuba will be limited to bringing $400 worth of goods with them, no more than $100 of which can consist of alcohol and tobacco.","JFK's press secretary told the story on video before his death, describing a evening mad dash to buy up the president's favorite Cuban stogies .

"It's a scene that turned many heads as Tolkien fans from all over the world flocked to New Zealand to celebrate the third and final Hobbit movie. About 200 attendees dressed as dwarves, elves and hobbits and wizards - all inspired by Lord of the Rings. Among them were five dedicated Australian fans, from Melbourne, who spent a combined total of $65,000 on their elaborate costumes. Needless to say it's a highly elaborate affair - one that's taken very seriously, especially by 23-year-old Victoria Gridley. Scroll down for video . Middle-earth fans from all over the world flocked to New Zealand last week to celebrate the third and final Hobbit movie, The Battle of the Five Armies. Among them include five Aussies (pictured) It's a highly elaborate affair - one that's taken very seriously, especially by 23-year-old Victoria Gridley. She's dressed as Bombur the dwarf . The Australian fans, all from Melbourne, spent a combined total of $65,000 on their costumes . Ms Gridley, of Croydon in Melbourne's east, isn't shy about her obsession with the fantasy world. 'The first time I went to New Zealand was with my best friend for the launch of the first Hobbit movie [An Unexpected Journey] in 2012 and we cried on camera,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Since then we've been going ever year and I love it.' Each year Ms Gridley designs and hand-makes her costume for the event. And this year's launch of The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies was no exception. 'I went as one of my favourite characters Bombur - a big dwarf with ginger hair,' she said. 'I think I spent about $750 on the whole costume, including the hair and fat suit. 'Including the two other years I dressed up for the event, I've spent about $2000 on the costumes - if not more.' The Aussie fans walked the streets of Wellington during their visit last week . 'Dressing up is like an escape from reality because life can be a bit boring for me sometimes,' Ms Gridley said . Dedicated fans have been visiting New Zealand since 2012 for the launch of the Hobbit trilogy each year . Many of the costumes are hand-made and designed by fans themselves . Middle-earth fans gather in together for a selfie in front of one of the costumes used in the Hobbit film . There were about 200 attendees who dressed as dwarves, elves and hobbits and wizards - all inspired by Lord of the Rings . Ms Gridley, who currently works at a call centre, has been designing costumes as a hobby for seven years. 'Dressing up is like an escape from reality because life can be a bit boring for me sometimes,' she said. She and her friends also like to walk the streets of Melbourne, and of Wellington when they're in town, dressed as characters from Middle-earth. In February, she plans on moving to New Zealand - living near the film sets of the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit. 'I'm going there because I got accepted into a costume construction course and I've already found a place that's literally just around the corner from where the movies were filmed so I'm really excited about that,' she said. To mark the final launch of The Hobbit trilogy, film director Peter Jackson lent more than 20 costumes and props from the third movie for 'The Middle of Middle-earth Costume Trail'. The trail, spread across 15 locations in Wellington which gives insight into the artistry behind the movies, opened last Thursday to coincide with the New Zealand launch of the film which premiered in London on December 1.

"Bruce Wilson, ex-boyfriend of former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard, should face corruption charges, according to the Royal Commission into Trade Union corruption. The first report into the year-long inquiry report was released on Friday, recommending prosecutors charge former union official Bruce Wilson and also Ralph Blewitt but also suggests some information can never be made public because it would place people in danger. During the hearings, Mr Wilson, a former union official had denied ever giving Ms Gillard 'wads' of cash and accused fellow witnesses of lying. Bruce Wilson, ex-boyfriend of former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard, should face corruption charges, according to the Royal Commission into Trade Union corruption . Former Australian Workers Union official Ralph Blewitt leaves during a break in his testimony at the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption, back in May. The Royal Commission investigated union slush fund activity, in particular one set up by Australian Workers Union officials 20 years ago, and has recommended charges be laid against Mr Blewitt . Employment Minister Eric Abetz, on Friday, released the interim report of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption which recommends charges against several people including former union officials Bruce Wilson and Ralph Blewitt . Mr Blewitt and Mr Wilson have been referred to Victorian and West Australian prosecutors by the royal commission. It says that prosecutors should consider charging both for obtaining financial advantage by deception and conspiracy over an infamous Australian Workers Union slush fund. They are among a range of union officials the royal commission has concluded could be charged. 239 witnesses gave evidence across eight months. At the centre of the controversy were claims that Mr Wilson paid for renovations to Ms Gillard's house, when the two were in a romantic relationship in the early 1990s. It also recommends the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions consider criminal charges against a range of CFMEU officials, in relation to various acts of intimidation and coercion. Also listed are recommendations that ASIC consider charges against the Queensland state secretary of the CFMEU for breaches of the Corporations Act. It says the Commonwealth DPP should also consider criminal charges against a range of Health Services Union officials for making false statements contrary to the Commonwealth Criminal Code. And it further recommends the Victorian secretary and assistant secretary of the CFMEU be considered by the Victorian DPP for prosecution for blackmail. The Royal Commission report says that prosecutors should consider charging Mr Wilson for obtaining financial advantage by deception and conspiracy over an infamous Australian Workers Union slush fund dating back some 20 years . Former union official Ralph Blewitt could face corruption charges. An interim report into Trade Union Governance and Corruption has identified several areas of concern about union election slush funds - namely their 'secretive' operations, deficient or non-existent record-keeping and that contributions to them may not have been voluntary . Employment Minister Eric Abetz released two volumes of the interim report at Parliament House in Canberra. A third volume dealing with serious criminal matters is confidential and won't be publicly released because 'disturbingly' it poses risks to the safety of certain individuals. 'The conduct which is part and parcel of the third and confidential report reveals grave threats to the power and authority of the Australian state,' he said. The report also identifies several areas of concern about union election slush funds - namely their 'secretive' operations, deficient or non-existent record-keeping, and that contributions to them may not be voluntary. Other concerns were that candidates often pleaded ignorance on funding sources, expenditure and debts incurred and that slush funds disproportionately advantaged incumbents. 'There is a culture of wilful defiance of the law that appears to lie at the core of the CFMEU,' the report found. Senator Abetz said that proved the powers of the Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC) must be restored. No objective reader of the report could doubt the urgent need to strengthen governance through the establishment of a Registered Organisations Commission (ROC), Senator Abetz claimed. Legislation to set up the ABCC and ROC has been stymied by parliament. 'I would have thought that anybody that is committed to the trade union movement would want to see a clean trade union movement - one where there is not criminality, where there is not thuggery, where there is not funny money dealings going on,' Senator Abetz added.","Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard's ex-boyfriend is set to face corruption charges .

"A nurse who treated dozens of severely injured victims of the Peshawar school attack has revealed how she is haunted by memories of the dying children and says she has not been able to sleep since the massacre took place. Despite having treated the victims of more than 300 terror attacks in her short career, Nargis Ghazi, 25, said the sight of scores of slaughtered children as young as five still wearing their uniforms on Tuesday has left her weeping continuously and unable to eat or drink. Ms Ghazi says she encountered so many dead bodies during the attack that she barely recalls individual faces, but remembers the injuries suffered by the innocent children as horrific, as cold-blooded Taliban terrorists fired automatic weapons indiscriminately before blowing themselves up. The young nurse spoke of her trauma amid as vigils and memorial services were held around the world for the 132 victims of the atrocity who were murdered at the school by six militants who carried out the attack on the orders of Pakistani Taliban leader Maulana Fazlullah. Scroll down for video . Trauma: Nargis Ghazi, 25, said the sight of scores of slaughtered children as young as five still wearing their uniforms on Tuesday has left her weeping continuously and unable to eat or drink . Tears: Describing her inability to rest since the attack, Ms Ghazi said: 'Believe me, I couldn't have slept even for five minutes. I couldn't close my eyes. I have taken tablets but there has been no respite' Speaking of the traumatic day, Ms Ghazi said frantic mothers were streaming in to Lady Reading Hospital, where she has worked since 2010, and running from bed to bed looking for their children in the hope they had somehow escaped being killed. The tragic reality is that the search was in vain for as many as 132 of these mothers, as their beloved child's body lay riddled with bullets inside the school where they'd believe them to be safe. Ms Ghazi described how, although she has treated the victims of 300 terror attacks, she has never had to deal with so many children victims before, as casualties are normally religious leaders or government officials. Two days since the attack took place, the memories are as vivid as ever for both Ms Ghazi and her many traumatized colleagues. 'Whenever I close my eyes, their faces come in my mind. I can still hear their cries. One of my colleagues has been weeping continuously since Tuesday after seeing the children at hospital. She has not been eating,' Ms Ghazi said. 'We are in such bad condition after seeing them [the dead children]. I don't know how their mothers and sisters have been coping with the situation,' she added. 'This incident will not leave me rest of my life. I will never be able to forget those faces. Their cries and helplessness of their mothers and sisters and fathers and brothers,' she went on to say.

Describing her inability to rest since the attack, Ms Ghazi said: 'Believe me, I couldn't have slept even for five minutes. I couldn't close my eyes. I have taken tablets but there has been no respite.' 'I cannot sleep... I try to eat but vomit after a few minutes,' she added. 'Whenever I try to sleep, the children come in my dreams. I still can feel their cries and pain. I think if I am going through this, what must the mothers be feeling?,' she added. In the aftermath of the attack, Ms Ghazi and her colleagues had been unable to console the victims' mothers because they had no idea what to say to them. 'They were in such [terrible] condition that we couldn't even gather the courage to console them... What could we say to them?' she said. Something else weighing heavily on the minds of the hospital workers is their own safety after the attack, with Ms Ghazi raising concerns that Lady Reading Hospital may be targeted by the Taliban. 'I am so worried about my security after the attack. You know their school was situated in high security zone near military offices. We live in hospital's hostel and we are so worried that terrorists can easily attack us. We may be their next target,' she said. Depraved: The Taliban gunmen who slaughtered 148 innocent people, including 132 children, are pictured just hours before the massacre.

A Pakistani Christian woman is seen deep prayer during a memorial for those killed in the school attack . Ms Ghazi's comments came as Pakistanis united in grief over the Peshawar atrocity - with Muslims and Christians holding vigils and memorials for the victims of the Taliban slaughter. Surprisingly a number of Islamic militant groups have also come forward to condemn the carnage. Most such groups have slaughtered civilians themselves, but the wave of outrage following the school attack is threatening the relative freedom they enjoy in Pakistan. The country is home to a range of armed militant groups. Some, like the Pakistani Taliban, fight against the state. Others have cosier ties with the authorities who use them against India and to jostle for influence in Afghanistan. Whether Islamabad moves against all of them equally will show whether the school massacre has finally spurred authorities to tackle militancy seriously, said Senator Afrasiab Khattak. 'They are all terrorists and the state has to clearly oppose them in all shapes and colours...So far they have not done so,' he said. The Afghan Taliban, a group Pakistani jihadists look up to, were the first of the Sunni Islamist armed groups to denounce the school attack as un-Islamic, despite often killing civilians themselves. An Afghan Taliban suicide bomber killed more than 50 people at a volleyball match last month.","Nargis Ghazi said she has been weeping continuously since massacre .

"A Michigan mother who allegedly gave her ten and 12-year-old sons marijuana for medical reasons has been charged with child abuse and faces up to six years in prison. Amy Renee Cunningham, 31, from the village of Mesick, apparently indicated that she preferred using cannabis over prescribed pills for her children. She reportedly gave the drug to her ten-year-old son to help with emotional issues and to his older brother to treat attention deficit disorder. Facing child abuse charges: Amy Renee Cunningham, 31, from the village of Mesick, apparently indicated that she preferred using cannabis over prescribed pills for her children . Wexford County Prosecutor Anthony Badovinac told MLive that the two children were allowed to take the marijuana by smoking it and started taking it in late March or early April. Dr. Shawn Jayakar from St. John Hospital in Detroit says he would not recommend using cannabis for such behavioral problems. 'Actually, ADD is linked to the use of marijuana,' he told WWJ radio. 'So I definitely would not recommend anyone with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to use marijuana, as it can make it worse, make it more difficult to concentrate, and makes you prone to further abuse of other drugs.' Dr Jayakar also said giving children pot at such a young age can affect cognitive abilities if accumulated over a lifetime. Cunningham reportedly came under police scrutiny after telling a Child Protective Services worker that she gave her children marijuana. She attended a pretrial conference at the 84th District Court in Cadillac on Tuesday. Controversial: She reportedly gave marijuana to her ten-year-old son to help with emotional issues and to his older brother to treat attention deficit disorder . The mother is charged with delivery/manufacture of marijuana and two counts of third-degree child abuse. The drug charge is punishable by up to four years in prison and the child-abuse charge carries up to two years in prison or five years of probation. The Associated Press left a message seeking comment Wednesday from Cunningham's lawyer. Michigan voters approved marijuana use for some chronic medical conditions in 2008. Under state guidelines, emotional issues and ADHD aren't qualifying conditions for medical marijuana use. Minors can get permission to use medical marijuana, but they must have a qualifying condition and meet other rules. In a similar case, a Minnesota mother has been charged with child endangerment for giving her 15-year-old son cannabis oil to manage the pain of a traumatic brain injury. A medical marijuana law in the state doesn't take effect until July.","Amy Renee Cunningham, 31, apparently indicated that she preferred using cannabis over prescribed pills for her children .

"The locals complain that they are being swamped by wealthy city dwellers buying second homes in their seaside enclave. But the buy-up looks likely to continue after St Ives in Cornwall was voted the most sought-after place to live in Britain. According to a poll by property website RightMove, people believe St Ives would be the most ideal location to reside in. Scroll down for video . Trouble in paradise: St Ives in Cornwall has been voted the place we'd all most like to live - but the locals are not happy, because it means they can no longer afford to live in their own town thanks to investors . The coastal locations of Poole, in Dorset, and Brighton came second and third, followed by the historic cities of Edinburgh and York. Liverpool and Harrogate also scored highly, followed by Bristol, Cardiff and Dartmouth. St Ives families say they cannot buy homes in their community because outsiders have flooded the market and sent prices rocketing beyond their grasp. Last month, locals called for all future new-build homes to be restricted to permanent residents only. The proposal was contained in a draft version of the St Ives neighbourhood development plan, which they hope will be voted into local planning regulations next year. Andrew George, the town’s Lib Dem MP, said high numbers of holiday homes in Cornwall meant some areas became ‘ghost communities’ in the winter when holidaymakers returned to their main residence. He said: ‘Without a doubt, high numbers of second homes do have a detrimental impact on the opportunities for local families to buy.’ But while many dream of living by the sea, others simply want to live near a good pub. The RightMove survey found that being within walking distance of a pub was more important than being near a park or supermarket when choosing where to live. If money was no object, people would choose a detached house with three bedrooms, one kitchen, two living rooms, two bathrooms, a garden and a utility room. Miles Shipside, a RightMove analyst, said: ‘While we gave people the chance to choose a home fit for royalty, on average they said they would be happy in a more modest home with plenty of space and practical features, instead of rattling around in a massive mansion. ‘This shows that the perfect home for many is one that they know they could possibly live in one day, depending on where they are looking to buy, rather than a pipe dream.’ Idyllic: But St Ives' Lib Dem MP said high numbers of second homes were having an impact on residents .","Seaside resort topped UK poll by the property website RightMove .

"It is a collection so diverse it contains adverts for Chelsea buns, plans for a bathing machine that creates a grand personal swimming pool in the sea and hastily scribbled designs for a grand palace with opulent staircases but no doors or windows. The thousands of papers collected by King George III reveals the personality of a King who was at once a proud father, eager architect and ruler with a tendency to distrust in his own ministers and want to make his own decisions. The collection of King George III has revealed 60,000 documents including drawings produced by his daughters, sensitive political documents and plans like this one drawn by the King himself which shows four opulent staircases and no means of entry and is likely to have been produced by him during a manic episode . The 60,000 papers which make up he collection also reveal the monarch had a propensity to hoard documents, possibly as a form of therapy during severe bouts of mental illness and manic episodes he suffered that led him to become known as the Mad King. The monarch painstakingly collated the documents throughout his time as ruler and is believed to have stored it next to his bedroom in what is now Buckingham Palace. 'This collection reveals a number of things about King George III,' said Peter Barber, head of map collections at the British Library which is cataloguing the huge haul of documents. 'First of all it shows his human side as a proud and doting father. It contains drawings of Frogmore and Windsor Castle produced by his daughters as well as a military plan drawn up by his favourite son at the age of 13. 'They are the sort of items that any proud father would keep. 'It also shows a person who is very interested in his country and wanted to learn about his people. He collected adverts for Chelsea buns and wire railings. The collection contains plans for a bathing machine used by the monarch to bathe in the sea in Weymouth . King George III built up the collection of images and maps himself, storing them at Buckingham Palace . 'And lastly it shows how he saw his role as King and felt it was important to reach his own decisions.' The collection contains sensitive and secret government information about English fortifications that would have been seen by the King but would usually have been returned to his ministers - indicating an innate distrust in his colleagues by the monarch who preferred to make his own decisions. It also betrays his keen interest in architecture, with many maps and plans from across the world, including his own scrawled designs. King George III was interested in maps and collected thousands like this  plan of Kingston Upon Thames . The ruler kept a number of documents himself as he wanted to make his own decisions rather than be guided . King George was interested in the development and architecture, keeping plans like this of Southwark . One of the papers features his plans for a palace at Kew, drawn in his characteristic enthusiastic but 'slightly obsessive' hand. Mr Barber added: 'If George had not been King he would have been an architect. He loved drawing plans for buildings. This collection contains two plans, one in pencil and the other one is rather savagely done. There are all sorts of strange things contained in the plan, which was probably for a large palace he was planning to build at Kew Gardens. 'It was probably produced during one of his manic episodes. It's got four staircases whereas the greatest of rulers at this time was usually satisfied with just one. It also does not seem to have any entrances.' A map of the Thames was found among 60,000 documents in the collection showing an interest in the country . Detailed maps were a key part of the collection and it is estimated to take around two years to catalogue . Mr Barber said one of the most unique things about the collection was that the monarch built it up and used it himself, unlike his collections of scientific instruments and books which he left to his assistants to manage. It reveals the personal side of the King - particularly in plans for a bathing machine, popular with prudish Victorians who wanted to swim in the sea without anyone seeing them. King George III ruled from 1760 to 1820 . The King's bathing machine was particularly large, allowing him to bathe naked in the sea at Weymouth in his own form of private swimming pool without ever being seen. As well as the scrawled plans and legal documents the collection also contains thousands of maps, showing the interest of the ruler in the rest of the world - despite the fact he only travelled as far as Weymouth. 'He was an armchair traveller,' said Mr Barber. 'He didn't actually travel further than Weymouth but through books and maps he eagerly learnt about the rest of the world and was able to do a grand tour of Italy. 'George probably didn't travel far because he was a conscientious leader and didn't want to be away from his work for too long.' Amongst the dozens of papers are also items the monarch is likely to have inherited, such as a 'birth certificate' for New York. This was likely to have been presented to the Duke of York in 1664 after it was captured by the English from the Dutch and renamed from New Amsterdam. He also collected early images of Canada and plans for churches in East London. Some of the items produced and collected by the King are likely to have been put into the collection when he suffered episodes of mania. Mr Barber added: 'The 1780s and 1790s were very hard years for George as he had lost the American colonies and had these really very severe attacks of mental illness. King George III is widely referred to as the 'Mad King' after suffering episodes of mania during his reign. He reigned from 1760 to his death in 1820 - one of the longest reigns by any British monarch in history. The eldest son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, George succeeded his grandfather George II at the age of 22, becoming the third Hanoverian monarch to reign. He was the first Hanoverian to speak English as his first language and to be born in the country. He is most remembered as the king who lost the American colonies and went mad and was famously depicted in Nicholas Hytner's 1994 The Madness of King George. But according to the Monarchy's official website, George's direct responsibility for the loss of the colonies is not great. He opposed their bid for independence to the end, but he did not develop the policies (such as the Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend duties of 1767 on tea, paper and other products) which led to war in 1775-76 and which had the support of Parliament. King George III reigned from 1760 to 1820 . The King suffered serious bouts of illness in 1788-89 and again in 1801, George became permanently deranged in 1810. During his episodes he frequently withdrew to Kew Palace leaving the country in crisis about who was to rule in his absence. In the last decade of his reign he was declared mentally unfit to rule and his eldest son - the later George IV - acted as Prince Regent from 1811. Some medical historians have said that George III's mental instability was caused by a hereditary physical disorder called porphyria. This has a number of symptoms including blue urine. However researchers at the University of London recently came up with a theory that his mania was caused by mental illness. They analysed his letters and speech, which were known to be so long the monarch would sometimes foam at the mouth. The monarch would sometimes have to be held to the floor by his assistants when he suffered convulsions. 'I think this collection was probably a sort of therapy, allowing him to escape from all of his weaknesses.' The British Library is cataloguing and digitising the collection and estimates due to its size the process could take two years. It is appealing for the public's help in funding the project.

"Police in Connecticut have arrested a 17-year-old who they say stole a 99-year-old woman's purse while she was delivering cookies to a local community center. The elderly woman was walking outside the L.P. Wilson Community Center in Windsor at about 9am Wednesday when the teen snatched her purse from her and fled, police say. Police say the suspect did not have a weapon and the victim, who was knocked to the ground, was not injured. Scene: The elderly woman was walking outside the L.P.

'It was disappointing to see right before the holidays – obviously as you know – there’s laws and statutes that protect that segment of our population,' Sgt. Christopher McKee told FoxCT on Wednesday. 'I know a lot of folks were very upset about it when they heard what the offense was that had occurred.' Senior citizen Terri Rousseau told the television affiliate station 'I would think [the community center] would be safe.' Following the robbery, police looked for the suspect in the community center and also used a K9 team, The Hartford Courant reported. The teen's name has not been released because of his age. He was charged Thursday with third-degree robbery, sixth-degree larceny and assault on an elderly person. His case is being handled in Juvenile Court. Capt. Kelvan Kearse told NBC Connecticut on Wednesday, 'This guy took advantage and made her a victim.' Kearse also explained that 'Crimes of this type tend to escalate during the holiday season, unfortunately.' Kearnes revealed before the teenager's arrest 'If he is the person we believe it to be, he does not live in town, but we are familiar with him.'

"Downing Street and the Home Office were last night said to be at war over a 'malicious' and 'petty' attempt to stop two of Theresa May's closest allies becoming MPs. In an increasingly toxic feud, it emerged that Nick Timothy, the Home Secretary's most senior aide, has been blocked from running in a safe Tory seat at the General Election. Another of her advisers, Stephen Parkinson, has also been suspended from the party's approved candidates list. Downing Street and the Home Office were last night said to be at war over a 'malicious' and 'petty' attempt to stop two of Theresa May's closest allies becoming MPs . Conservative HQ says the pair were kicked off the list after failing to campaign for the party in the recent Rochester by-election that was won by Ukip. But both men insist that as special advisers – whose salaries come from the taxpayer – they were barred by their code of conduct from actively campaigning. They are understood to have been backed by Mrs May, who is seen by many Tories as the favourite to succeed David Cameron. However Tory HQ claimed special advisers were given clearance to campaign in last month's by-election by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood's office, and that all advisers had been told to canvass. Mr Timothy and Mr Parkinson say they received no confirmation of this special clearance. One source said they had requested details from Sue Gray, the Cabinet Office head of ethics and propriety, on seven occasions but received no reply. Previous internal guidance on special advisers from David Cameron's political private secretary Laurence Mann, seen by the Daily Mail, said they could help in by-elections 'in their own time and outside office hours, but only by providing backroom support, for example stuffing envelopes ... you could not do telephone campaigning or door-to-door canvassing'. Mr Timothy wanted to stand for Aldridge-Brownhills in Walsall, West Midlands. Rea Rutherford-Carlisle, chairman of the local Tory association, said it was 'deeply concerning and completely unacceptable' that local activists had been 'deliberately misled' by Tory HQ about Mr Timothy when he ran for selection, which has a Tory majority of 15,266. Party chiefs are accused of falsely telling local activists that he had withdrawn from the race before suspending him from its list of approved candidates. Mrs Rutherford-Carlisle has told Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps that the constituency was suspending the selection of a candidate and demanding that he investigated the matter personally. Nick Timothy (pictured), the Home Secretary's most senior aide, has been blocked from running in a safe Tory seat at the General Election . In a letter, she told him that the committee considering candidates was 'told by a party official that Mr Timothy had withdrawn himself' from the race. She added: 'This would appear not to be the case.' In a letter to her, Mr Timothy said he wanted to make clear it was 'untrue' that he had withdrawn from the selection process, adding: 'I was informed that I have been suspended from the candidates' list. This, I was told, is because I did not participate in telephone canvassing during the Rochester by-election campaign. 'This decision cannot be valid because, as Theresa May's chief of staff, I am bound by the code of conduct for special advisers.' Mr Timothy, who has been blamed by No10 for fuelling speculation about Mrs May's leadership ambitions, declined to comment further last night. But a source said his treatment appeared 'malicious', 'petty' and 'inept', given that if he was selected for a seat he would have to leave the Home Secretary's side. Tory HQ disputed some of Mr Timothy's claims. A party source insisted Sir Jeremy's office and Miss Gray had cleared special advisers to take part in telephone canvassing in Rochester, as long as it was in their spare time, adding: 'It is not true that anyone said Nick Timothy had withdrawn, there will be no investigation.' Mr Parkinson attempted to win the Tory candidacy in Richmond, North Yorkshire, where William Hague is MP and the Tories had a 23,386 majority in 2010. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: 'Special advisers have always been able in their own time and outside office hours to take part in back-office activities. This approach was agreed with the Cabinet Office.' He was unable to say whether telephone canvassing – which appears in clear breach of the rules – had been approved.","Nick Timothy has been blocked from running in a safe Conservative seat .

"Police yesterday described claims that a Conservative MP strangled a boy of 12 as ‘credible and true’. Officers investigating three alleged murders linked to a VIP paedophile ring also backed claims that a Tory minister watched as another boy was murdered. Scotland Yard has now launched an extraordinary appeal for information from celebrities, politicians and foreign dignitaries who lived at or visited the exclusive Dolphin Square estate in central London in the 1970s and 1980s. Scroll down for video . Scandal: The Met is looking into explosive claims boys were abused and even killed by Conservative politicians at Dolphin Square, a block of flats in Pimlico, London . It comes after months of Daily Mail investigations concerning alleged abuse at Dolphin Square and the nearby Elm Guest House in south-west London. Detectives say they believe a witness who claimed he was sexually assaulted at Dolphin Square, in Pimlico, by senior MPs, spies and prominent military figures during ‘abuse parties’ over a period of almost a decade. The alleged victim, known only as Nick, says he was molested from the age of seven to 16. He has told how he saw a Conservative MP strangle a 12-year-old boy at an orgy in a London townhouse around 1980, and that a Conservative Cabinet minister watched two men kill another boy in a depraved sexual assault a year later. A third boy aged ten or 11 was deliberately run over in broad daylight in south-west London by an unknown member of the paedophile gang in 1979, he alleges. The man at the centre of the Dolphin Square inquiry says he was abused at depraved sex ‘parties’ from the age of seven. Known only by the pseudonym Nick, he claims to have witnessed horrific acts at the luxury estate in central London between 1975 and 1984. After being abused by his father, Nick says he was handed to a gang of top Establishment figures. He has described being driven by a chauffeur, along with a terrified 12-year-old boy, to a luxury townhouse where he watched as a Tory MP strangled the other child. Nick also said he saw a second boy being brutally murdered in front of a Tory Cabinet minister in 1981. A third boy, aged ten or 11, had died in 1979 after being deliberately run over by a member of the paedophile gang in a ‘warning’ to victims not to speak out, he alleges. He says he was taken to Dolphin Square at least ten times for ‘abuse parties’. He claimed one MP told him to thrash another boy - and ‘sexually punished’ him when he refused. After receiving counselling he contacted the investigative website Exaro in May, whose investigators described him as ‘intelligent and articulate’, before going to the police. Police have now appealed for potential witnesses who lived in or visited Dolphin Square, where Nick said the majority of the abuse took place, between 1975 and 1984. They confirmed for the first time they were looking at ‘allegations of serious and organised sexual abuse’ at Dolphin Square and other locations, including military bases, after Nick said he and several other boys were driven to properties in London and the Home Counties, where they were raped, cut and beaten. Now in his forties, Nick has helped to compile e-fits of the three alleged murder victims, whose names he never learned. Police are working through historical missing persons reports and unsolved child murders to look for possible matches. Detectives have spoken to the family of Martin Allen, who disappeared in 1979 aged 15, but are not currently linking him to Dolphin Square. Similarly, Sussex Police is reviewing the disappearance and murder of eight-year-old Vishal Mehrotra in 1981. The Royal Military Police is also investigating claims that military bases were used by a VIP paedophile ring. Scotland Yard first launched its investigation into Nick’s claims – Operation Midland – last month. Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald said: ‘Nick has been spoken to by experienced officers from child abuse teams and experienced officers from murder investigations. They and I believe what Nick is saying is credible and true.’ He continued: ‘There will be people who lived at, or visited, Dolphin Square from the early 1970s onwards who will have seen or heard something that they only now understand the significance of. Today I would like to ask former residents, current residents, or anyone who routinely went to Dolphin Square to think back and get in touch with us with any information they may have.’ The luxury estate has long been home to politicians, foreign dignitaries, and stars of stage and screen – as well as spies and glamour girls. Famous former residents include Harold Wilson and William Hague; Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies, key players in the Profumo Affair; and Sir Oswald Mosley, founder of the British Union of Fascists. Mystery: Police officers in Sussex are reviewing the disappearance and murder of eight-year-old Vishal Mehrotra (left). Right, his father Vishambar Mehrotra . Other venue: The Elm Guest House in South-West London, above, was frequented by VIPs and politicians where it is believed they abused vulnerable children . According to Nick, the estate also hosted sordid ‘parties’, where children were plied with whisky after being escorted from school. Unsolved: Martin Allen, 15, disappeared in 1979 . Det Supt McDonald said: ‘Today I want to appeal directly to those other young boys, now men, who were also subject to abuse at the hands of these men. ... I would ask you to trust me. I will support you, and do everything in my power to find those responsible and bring them to justice.’ Operation Midland falls under a wider umbrella of investigations, Operation Fairbank, exploring allegations of child abuse by VIPs. One of the most high-profile strands is Operation Fernbridge, concerning Elm Guest House. Tom Watson, the Labour MP who warned in Parliament two years ago that a paedophile ring was linked to No 10, said: ‘It will come as a great relief to Nick that his allegations are being fully investigated and taken seriously ... now is the time for any victims to speak to the police.’ Yesterday police also said they are probing claims that officers acted inappropriately in relation to child abuse probes from the mid-1970s until as recently as 2005. Last July it emerged that a dossier compiled by Geoffrey Dickens, naming Cyril Smith and other suspected Establishment paedophiles, had vanished after it was sent in 1983 to the then home secretary Leon Brittan. A recent Home Office inquiry failed to uncover the file, and Theresa May said she could not rule out a possible cover-up. The Government has planned an inquiry into the claims of a VIP paedophile ring – but is struggling to find a chairman. Lawyer Fiona Woolf and retired judge Baroness Elizabeth Butler-Sloss were both appointed but later had to step down due to their links to the Establishment.

"Convicted murderer Jodi Arias was pictured yawning in court yesterday as a jury prepares to decide whether she will be given the death penalty for the brutal killing of her ex-boyfriend. The former waitress, 34, from California, looked somewhat bored with proceedings during the retrial of her sentencing at Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix. Arias was convicted of murder last year for stabbing and slashing secret lover Travis Alexander nearly 30 times, slitting his throat so deeply she nearly decapitated him and shooting him in the forehead in 2008. Looking bored: Convicted murderer Jodi Arias was seen yawning during the retrial of her sentencing  at Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix yesterday . On Tuesday, it was revealed that she was allowed to testify as a witness in secret during the sentencing retrial in Arizona because of fears for her safety after her lawyers said she received death threats. Arias' lawyers had told the court that she did not feel she would be 'able to fully communicate what she wanted to say, communicate her remorse and go through all the mitigating factors and get them out there in front of the jury with the public here'. A three-member panel of the Arizona Court of Appeals said the trial judge, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens, agreed to the request from Arias' legal team despite feeling manipulated by the defendant. A state appeals court ruled last month that the judge had been wrong to close those proceedings to the public, and the appeals court on Tuesday confirmed suspicions that Arias herself had been the mystery witness in question. Brutal murder: Arias was convicted of murder for stabbing and slashing secret lover Travis Alexander nearly 30 times, slitting his throat so deeply she nearly decapitated him and shooting him in the forehead . At her last trial, she testified for 18 days, describing for jurors an abusive childhood, cheating boyfriends, dead-end jobs, a shocking sexual relationship with Alexander, and her contention that he was physically abusive . 'A defendant who testified in open court during the guilt phase of the trial cannot decide she will only testify in the penalty phase if the press and public are excluded and her testimony is sealed until after any verdict,' the appeals court wrote. After murdering Mr Alexander, Arias left his body in his shower where friends found him about five days later at his suburban Phoenix home. She acknowledged she killed Alexander, but claimed it was self-defense after he had attacked her. Prosecutors said it was premeditated murder carried out in a jealous rage after the victim wanted to end their affair and planned a trip to Mexico with another woman . Prosecutors said it was premeditated murder carried out in a jealous rage after the victim wanted to end their affair and planned a trip to Mexico with another woman. Weeks after Arias was convicted, the jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on her punishment. Her attorneys have since sought, unsuccessfully, to dismiss the death penalty as an option. If another deadlock occurs, the death penalty would automatically be removed as an option, leaving a judge to sentence Arias to one of two options: life in prison or life in prison with the possibility of release after 25 years. Left for days: Alexander was here, in this shower, for around five days before friends found his decaying body . Arias left the body of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander in his shower where friends found him days later at his suburban Phoenix home. Crime scene pictures from the first trial (pictured) revealed the brutal nature of the killing . At her last trial, she testified for 18 days, describing for jurors an abusive childhood, cheating boyfriends, dead-end jobs, a shocking sexual relationship with Alexander, and her contention that he was physically abusive. Her first trial drew a global following and inspired spectators to wait in line in the middle of the night to get a coveted seat in the courtroom. The cost to Arizona taxpayers for Jodi Arias' defense now tops $2.7million and the figure will keep rising as her penalty phase retrial continues.","Arias convicted of murder last year but jury was deadlocked on penalty .

"A drunken dog owner allegedly pinned a mother down to stop her rescuing her daughter as the six-year-old's face was bitten and torn by his Staffordshire bull terrier. Instead of preventing his dog Bruno attacking Demi Baines, Philip Rhodes leapt on her mother Karen to pull her to the ground and stop her dragging his dog away, a court heard. Jurors were told the 70-year-old then lay on top of Miss Baines as Demi was being savaged and drunkenly slurred to the dog: 'Get off her, get off her.' Demi Baines (right) was savagely attack by a dog whilst walking home with her mother Karen Baines (left) When police arrived, Rhodes was allegedly so drunk that he struggled to stand. Questioned by officers, he said: 'Are you nailing me to a cross? That's what they did to Jesus.' The Christmas Day attack outside Rhodes's home in Hyde, Greater Manchester, last year almost severed Demi's bottom lip and left her with wounds to her arm and back. She needed emergency surgery and will be scarred for life. At Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester, Miss Baines wept when she recalled her helplessness as the dog savaged Demi at 6pm while they walked home from a party. She said: 'Philip was outside his property. He appeared to be drunk. He was slurring and staggering. The dog came out from a field. It wasn't on a lead. The dog ran in front of us and I put my hand down and it licked the tip of my finger then all of a sudden it attacked my daughter's face. 'I thought it was going to jump up and lick her face but it was when I heard the growl I realised it was attacking her. 'It jumped on her chest and she stepped back because it knocked her. She was standing up for a while – it felt like forever – then after a few seconds it had her on the floor. It was on her face and I knew it was attacking her.' Demi (pictured left before the attack and right afterwards) was left with a severed lip and punctured arm . Demi (pictured before attack) was in hospital for three days, needed emergency surgery and is scarred for life . Miss Baines, 36, said she tried to wrestle the dog off her daughter before Rhodes stopped her. 'He jumped in and he got me on the floor,' she told the court. 'I was trying to get it to bite me and come to me rather than my daughter, then he jumped on me. 'I was underneath him and couldn't get up. I panicked and was kicking and screaming and he wouldn't let me up. He was slurring, 'Get off her, get off her'. I was scared the dog would kill her. It would have torn her apart. 'He kept grabbing me by my arms every time I went to grab the dog. I was trying to grab the dog by the collar and eventually got on my feet and shouted to my daughter who had managed to run off. 'Her lip was just hanging off. I felt like that dog was going to kill my little girl. 'He jumped on me and there was nothing I could do.' The scene where the dog attack happened on Christmas Day 2013, outside Rhodes's house and near to Ms Baines's property in Hyde, Greater Manchester . Alison Heyworth, prosecuting, said: 'This was a frenzied attack and Miss Baines was unable to assist her daughter because she was struggling with the defendant who had her on the ground. 'Eventually Demi was released by the dog and ran away. Miss Baines kept trying to grab it because she was worried it would chase her daughter but was still prevented by the defendant who was holding on to her.' Miss Heyworth added: 'The child was terribly injured. Her mouth had been severed completely in parts and she had a hole in her left arm and lower back. 'This was a horrific and terrifying attack by this defendant's dog on a child and the actions by this defendant prevented her mother from helping her.' Rhodes denies assault and being the owner of a dog which has caused injury while dangerously out of control. The trial continues.

"Douglas Holmes said his partner was told by Ynysboeth Primary School to take a video of their daughter Emmi-Rai performing in the nativity down from Facebook because of child safety fears . A couple were ordered to delete a video of their child performing in a nativity play by her school because of concerns about the online safety of pupils. Douglas Holmes said his four-year-old daughter Emmi-Rai had played the role of innkeeper in her nativity play at Ynysboeth Primary School in Abercynon. His partner Lisa Evans filmed their daughter's performance and posted the video on Facebook. But the next day she was asked to take it down by a teacher who appeared in the video. Mr Holmes, 30, said 'My partner doesn't usually post videos on Facebook. But some parents couldn't go to the play because of work. A friend of ours couldn't make it and we managed to catch her daughter in our video so she posted the video. 'She wasn't offending anybody but she was asked to remove it. We have removed it just in case they decided to take any further action. 'I was very angry when she came back from the school and told me they wanted her to take it down from her personal profile. We should be allowed to share our daughter's experience with other people if we want to.' The incident follows a number of disappointments for children who have seen nativity plays cancelled in recent years or their parents charged to watch. A spokesman for Rhondda Cynon Taf council said schools do not want to spoil parents' enjoyment of special occasions such as Christmas concerts, but there were occasions when the protection of children is necessary, particularly due to the widespread nature of social media. He said at Ynysboeth Primary School some parents had specifically requested that the child's images were not shared on social media. One group that campaigns for personal freedom called for 'common sense' to be used and urged the school to stop behaving like 'Scrooge'. Mother-of-four Miss Evans, 33, said she felt the school's reaction had been extreme and that she did not understand it because its website has a picture of every child anyway. She said: 'It is absolutely outrageous and has been blown out of all proportion. 'As far as I am concerned my parental rights have been taken away. 'We weren't told specifically told by the school not to put up any videos but politely asked if we could refrain from doing so - but it certainly wasn't an order. I never usually post videos - I only did it because a lot of parents had work commitments and couldn't make the play. 'One of the mum's was really grateful I'd posted it up and she thanked me because she hadn't been able to make it.' Miss Evans said she posted the video on Monday evening and was told by teacher to remove it the next morning, when she dropped her daughter off at school. She added: 'It was then that her teacher told me she had been made aware of the video and asked me to remove it because she was in it - for just three seconds. Proud mother Lisa Evans was told to take down a video of her daughter Emmi-Rai as the nativity innkeeper . Miss Evans, pictured with her daughter Emmi-Rai, said she felt the school had over reacted about the video . 'She did not mention the children or child protection - if she had of course I would have removed it immediately.' 'My Facebook settings are extremely protected and private - only my close friends can see anything I can post. 'The whole thing is totally crazy - at the end of the day the school website has a picture of every child in the school and that is open to anyone to see. I really don't know what all the fuss is about.' A spokesman for Rhondda Cynon Taf council said schools needed the permission of all parents to allow filming or photography of their children in school. He said: 'If just one parent or carer objects to group photography, then the head teacher does not allow it to happen. 'At Ynysboeth Primary School a significant number of parents or carers specifically requested that their children's images do not appear on social media. Miss Evans (left) was angry after she was told to remove the video of her daughter (right) in the school play . Mr Holmes, 30, said the couple believe they should be allow to share a video of their child if they wish to . 'The headteacher made it clear to the audience that photography was allowed, but not for distribution on social media. 'Unfortunately a minority ignored those wishes and published them anyway. 'There are children in our schools who are protected by means of court orders and under no circumstances can the identity or location of these children be revealed. To do so could expose them to unacceptable risk.' He said headteachers felt it was necessary to ban photography or filming of some events because they work closely with adoptive and foster carers to ensure the well-being and safeguarding of their children. Andrew Allison, from the Freedom Association said that 'common sense' was needed. He said: 'Child protection is obviously a serious issue, however, some common sense is needed here. Sharing a video of your child in a nativity play is a natural thing a proud parent does. 'Considering there is a photograph of every pupil on the school's website, and Miss Evans' security settings on Facebook are set to private, the school should stop behaving like Scrooge and allow other parents who couldn't attend the nativity play a chance to share the experience.' The incident in Abercynon follows a number of disappointments for children who have seen nativity plays cancelled in recent years or their parents charged to watch. According to a Netmums survey conducted earlier this month, just two in five schools allow parents and loved ones to take photographs freely at school plays. Staff at Ynysboeth Junior School in Abercynon requested that Miss Evans removed the video of her daughter . At one in six, cameras are banned completely, while 14 per cent of schools video the performance then charge parents for copies. And a third of schools ask parents to sign forms stating they will not share snaps on social media, the survey said. One mother who responded to the survey online said that she agreed with photographs not being shared on social media, pointing to her own situation involving her adopted son. She said that if his photograph was to be posted on social media  his birth parents might be able to determine his location - something, she argued, that would threaten his well-being. Online advice issued by Adoption UK states that adoptive parents should be wary of information posted on social media - by their family, and others. It states that 'without proper precautions children can be exposing details of their lives to anyone who logs on'. One school in Middlesbrough was today praised after it sent a letter to parents urging them not to post any photos taken at the school nativity on social networking sites. The letter, sent by St Edward’s RC Primary School, said it was a 'priority' for children to be kept 'as safe as possible'. The letter stated: 'Please could you ensure that you have not placed any photographs of Foundation Stage or Key Stage Christmas performances on to any social media websites including Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.' And the school, which was named best state school in the north-east by the 2014 Sunday Times Parent Power publication last month, has the support of parents who agree with the message, according to The Gazette. Official guidance issued by the Information Commissioner's Office states that parents should be able to take photos of their children at events such as school plays and sports days, without fear of breaching the Data Protection Act. In 2010, Christopher Graham, the Information Commissioner, urged parents  of children appearing in plays and other school events to 'stand ready to challenge any schools or councils that say ""Bah, Humbug"" to a bit of festive fun'. His comments came after one father, Lee Ingram, spoke out over being threatened with arrest when he notified a school that he wanted to take a photo of his daughter, then five, in her nativity in 2007. However, photographs are only exempt of the Data Protection Act if they are taken for personal use - to be put in a family photo album, for example. And there is debate as to whether social media falls under this exemption.","Douglas Holmes and Lisa Evans recorded video of daughter in nativity .

"Up to 99 per cent of Britons mix up the Biblical nativity story with common misconceptions about animals, stables and inns, a survey found today. These include Mary travelling to Bethlehem on a donkey, Jesus being born on Christmas Day and three wise men visiting him - none of which are mentioned in the world’s most-read book. Only 3 per cent of adults are aware that the Bible does not actually state the number of wise men who arrived to see Jesus - despite it often being portrayed as three, the Bible Society poll revealed. Scroll down to take the Bible Society's Christmas quiz . Christmas myths: Up to 99 per cent of Britons cannot correctly recognise the Biblical nativity story from common misconceptions about animals, stables and inns, a shocking survey found today . Just 4 per cent know that the Bible does not say how Mary got to Bethlehem, and less than a third correctly said Mary and Joseph were betrothed when she found out she would give birth to Jesus. Some 20 per cent were able to correctly say that Mary and Joseph travelled across the country after being told to do so by Caesar Augustus, with 5 per cent believing they were moving house. And one in four say Jesus was born on December 25, although there is no reference to a date in the Bible. The date on which we celebrate Christmas comes from the Roman festival Saturnalia. Meanwhile only 40 per cent of respondents could correctly state that the Bible says the angels told the shepherds: ‘Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will to all men.’ And just 1 per cent correctly identified that the Bible does not say Jesus was born in a stable. World's most-read book: One in four respondents to the survey carried out earlier this month said Jesus was born on December 25, although there is no reference to a date in the Bible . The society warned of a ‘growing decline in Bible literacy’ - adding that people aged at least 55 know the book's stories best, with the majority of correct answers being achieved by this age group. Bible Society group chief executive James Catford said: ‘Nine out of ten people don’t engage with the Bible and they might not realise that they’re missing out on a treasure trove of brilliant and engaging stories. ‘The Bible could be lost to future generations unless we all take action. That’s why in the week leading up to Christmas and beyond, we are encouraging parents to save a little time in their annual celebrations to help pass on one of the greatest stories ever told.’ The society was founded in 1804 by a group of people including William Wilberforce to encourage the wider ‘circulation and use’ of the Scriptures. The survey was carried out from December 3 to 5 by OnePoll among a sample size of 1,000 adults. According to the Bible… . 1.

"This is the terrifying moment a prolific robber grabbed a woman from behind and ripped a gold necklace from around her neck as part of a £20,000 street robbery rampage. In the shocking footage, Ralf Dautzenberg, 22, is captured on CCTV jogging up to the woman in broad daylight before wrenching the jewellery and fleeing from the scene in Hayes, west London. The brutal attack, which took place in March, was one of 12 that Dautzenberg carried out on defenceless Asian women during a six-month crime spree. Scroll down for video . This is the terrifying moment a prolific robber grabbed a woman from behind and ripped a gold necklace from her neck as part of a £20,000 street robbery rampage in London . His aim was to steal high-value gold necklaces, before selling them on for cash. His eldest victim was 72. After he was arrested, officers discovered a sickening photo of Dautzenberg posing with a huge wad of cash - the proceeds of his crimes. Just one necklace was found and returned to the owner. Dautzenberg, from Canning Town, north London, was today jailed for six years at Isleworth Crown Court after pleading guilty to 11 counts of robbery and one count of theft near his home between January and June this year. Ralf Dautzenberg, 22, from Canning Town, north London, carried out 12 attacks during his six-month crime spree . Detectives investigating the robberies revealed how Dautzenberg would approach his victims from behind, before grabbing their necks and tearing off their jewellery. The Met Police said he even resorted to violence on several occasions, punching one elderly victim on the head and knocking them to the pavement. He would then remove or change his clothes in a bid to avoid being caught. The attacks only stopped when he was arrested by a police officer. Investigating officer Detective Sergeant Barry Wilcock, said: 'Dautzenberg went to great lengths to identify and target vulnerable and innocent members of the public and avoid police detection by removing or changing his clothing immediately after offending as he fled the scene. 'It became clear that the violence he was using was escalating, with defenceless elderly victims being punched in the face for their jewellery. 'Every resource available to us was utilised, from forensic opportunities to intelligence and covert operations.' Police also told how Dautzenberg would rely on public transport to select a victim. He would sit on a bus or train sizing up the woman and jewellery she was wearing, before following them on foot and attacking them a short time after. He added: 'Had it not been for the sheer tenacity demonstrated in the pursuit and detention of Dautzenberg, I am in no doubt that he would have gone on to cause significant and possibly life changing injuries to innocent and unsuspecting members of the public.' In the shocking CCTV footage, Dautzenberg is captured jogging up to the woman from behind in broad daylight in Hayes, London . He then grabs the woman before quickly wrenching the jewellery from around her neck - the technique he used for all his attacks . February 26: Hayes, robbery of gold chain valued at £200 . March 6: Hayes, robbery of gold chain valued at £700 . March 26: Hayes, robbery of a gold chain - value unknown . Apri 16: Hayes, robbery of a gold chain valued at £1,700 .

May 30: Hayes, robbery of a gold chain valued at £700 . June 5: Hayes, theft of an Oyster card . One victim, who wishes to remain anonymous, said: 'This person made me vulnerable. This crime made me feel scared in my home. 'I wake at night having nightmares and images with flashbacks of what he did, I feel scared to walk on my own anywhere as he robbed me on the main road 11am. 'I came back to my sister's after the incident hysterically shaking and crying, in front of my two young children, my eldest is six and has never seen me like that. 'She still remembers and asks questions about the incident, and why he wanted to hurt me. 'My life has changed and his actions leave me sleepless at night. My necklace was given to me by my grandmother to bring me luck she lives in India and I may not see her again. 'I'm happy that he's caught as I would not like anyone to have to go through this or feel so vulnerable and scared.' After sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Richard Turner praised the team which investigated Dautzenberg's crimes. He said: 'I would like to place on record my recognition of the excellent detective work that went into this investigation. 'The dedicated enquiry team worked together with the Crown Prosecution Service to bring this violent offender to justice with the strongest and most compelling evidence. 'In total, Hillingdon CID investigated 25 individual offences of street robbery linked solely to Dautzenberg. This crime series came to a complete halt following his arrest and apprehension.' After the attack in March this year, Dautzenberg then flees from the scene, leaving the woman shaken and bruised . The brutal attack was one of 12 that Dautzenberg carried out on defenceless Asian women between January and June, mainly in a bid to steal high-value gold necklaces. His eldest victim was 72 . He added: 'Combating Asian gold theft remains a high priority for our policing team and we work tirelessly to support victims of violence and robbery through every stage of investigation. 'We want our community to feel safe and confident in any environment, but also remain aware of any potential dangers and immediately report any suspicious activity to the police. 'Every victim has undergone a horrific ordeal at the hands of Dautzenberg which will never be forgotten, and I hope that today's sentence will bring some closure and reassurance that this opportunist attacker is now behind bars.' Dautzenberg sold most of the stolen items but police managed to find some jewellery when they searched his home .","CCTV shows Ralf Dautzenberg, 22, attacking the victim in broad daylight .

"Police, bouncers and hospital workers are gearing up for one of the busiest weekends of the year as the office Christmas party season reaches its climax. The final weekend before December 25th will be marked by a spike in corporate festive gatherings, with pubs, bars and clubs preparing for bumper sales. Friday December 19th is considered by police to be the busiest night for Christmas parties, with many forces already tweeting words of advice for would-be revellers. Thousands of revellers will head out across the UK this Friday for work and social drinking events . Police are on high alert for disturbances and fights to cope with the fallout from Christmas parties . Party planners have said firms are beginning to splash the cash again this year, having emerged from the shadows of the economic slump which has blighted recent shindigs. However, social media experts believe the potential for long-term damage to their reputation is causing some people to tone down their antics - or forgo the festivities altogether - through fear that their drunken exploits will be the talk of the Twitter feed. Digital communications expert Warren Knight said: 'People are 100 per cent being more sensible than ever before because of social media - reputations can be lost in one night. 'Staff are behaving better, reducing their alcohol consumption or even deciding against going to their party because they don't want to end up doing something silly they later regret. Admissions to hospital due to alcohol misuse will likely rise on Friday . 'Instant communication, Instagram posts and checking-in facilities mean it is very difficult to delete something once it is online. 'People I speak to say the office Christmas party is getting more and more tame.' Street pastors are already turning to social media in an effort to use it as a force for good during party season. Christian Nightlife Initiatives have launched a #StaySafe campaign reminding revellers of responsible drinking and appropriate behaviour. A spokesman said: 'This Friday is one of the busiest nights within the night-time economy - the last Friday before Christmas. 'Generally it is also one of the busiest nights for police, ambulance, Accident & Emergency and street patrol projects such as Street Angels.' Their tips include drinking plenty of water, staying in groups of friends, and keeping money back to afford transport home at the end of the evening. Georgina Coleman, from bespoke venue operator Late Night London, said the Christmas party is enjoying a bumper year. She said: 'There are more cranes around London this year, more buildings going up, and that is a useful indicator of a change in the economy. 'We have seen a marked increase in the number of inquiries about Christmas parties, budgets have increased too, and the spend per head. 'People are also looking for something different - they don't necessarily want to hit the bar, they want something civilised and often with a sit-down meal or some sort of activity such as cocktail-making. 'This is only the first year after the economic slump so it's hard to draw too many conclusions but the signs are encouraging.' Whether you’re the host or a guest, be prepared to deal with the friend who has had too much to drink . Alcohol Concern’s Workplace Programme Manager, Lauren Booker, gives you some top tips… . 1. Designated Driver . Not only will having a designated driver (DD) ensure a safe end to the night, it will also avoid those lengthy late night taxi queues. Do a deal with the drinkers so they pay for the DDs soft drinks all night. Take the DD role in turn so everyone can have a drink if they want to and everyone gets a night off the booze, too. 2. Set the Pace . It can be hard to keep track of your drinking if you all get a round in. It also tempts you to drink more than you intended – after all, when it’s your round you don’t want to opt for the diet cola and when it’s someone else’s shout, it’d be a shame to miss out. Sticking to one type of drink throughout the night will help you keep a tally of how much you’ve had. Make sure to drink plenty of water, too. The Drink Coach mobile app can even send you a text to remind you to take it easy or let you know it’s time to go home, as well as keeping track of your units. 3. The Morning After… . Pounding head, dry mouth, sensitive stomach, never drinking again? Forget all the novelty hangover cures – the only thing that really works is time. It takes one hour for your liver to process each unit of alcohol so in the meantime, get plenty of fluids, plenty of rest and take at least one night off (preferably more) before drinking again. 4. The Night Before . There are things that you can do while you’re out to lessen the effects of tomorrow’s hangover. Firstly, drink less by alternating one alcoholic and one soft drink throughout the night. It will keep you hydrated and you’ll feel better in the morning. Secondly, don’t mix your drinks, the different tannins, sulphites and other additives can upset your stomach. Thirdly, don’t drink on an empty stomach, you’re more likely to feel ill. Finally, put a bottle of water by your bed before you go out so that it’s within easy reach when you wake up at 6am feeling queasy. 5. Behind the Wheel . A good night’s sleep and a hearty breakfast may make you feel better the next day but it doesn’t mean you’ll be safe to drive. Allow one hour for every unit consumed (a can of lager or a glass of wine can be about 3 units) and don’t drive until you’re sure all the alcohol is out of your system. A Chube breath test will help you workout whether you’re still under the influence. 6. Show me the way to go home . Make your plan for getting home before you go out. If you intend to stay out overnight, check with your host that this is a definite arrangement or book yourself into a nearby hotel. Keep a stash of cash and/or condoms somewhere about your person, too. Just in case. 7. Host with the Most . Try making a fruit punch or experiment with mocktails so that your non-drinking guests have the option of more than just cola or orange juice. Serve snacks at regular intervals, and don’t insist on refilling glasses if guests have had enough. If a guest does have a few too many, call them a taxi or let them sleep it off in your spare room. 8. The Best Guest . Few things are more embarrassing than having to phone up the party host to apologise for your drunken behaviour the night before. If you have a tendency to go overboard when celebrating, set yourself a limit and stick to it. Slow down your drinking and pace yourself throughout the night. Make sure you have mixers with spirits and eat something before you go out. 9. The One-Too-Many mate . Whether you’re the host or a guest, be prepared to deal with the friend who has had too much to drink. Encourage them to switch to water, lead them to the smallest room if they feel sick and sit them down somewhere quiet to recover. Check on them regularly and put them in the recovery position if they fall asleep. People are very vulnerable when drunk – violence, accidents, alcohol poisoning – so make sure your friend gets home safely. 10. Free now, pay later . If ‘Christmas Party’ means ‘free booze’ to you – beware! It can be very tempting to over indulge when the drinks are on the house. Not only can drinking too much too quickly be dangerous (the equivalent of a bottle of vodka in an hour can easily kill an adult male) but drunken behaviour in front of colleagues and loved ones can have repercussions long after the hangover has worn off.","The Friday before Christmas is one of the busiest in night-time economy .

"BBC bosses spent more than £2,500 on a week-long stay at luxury Los Angeles 'rock star' hotel Sunset Marquis. Director of television Danny Cohen and BBC1 controller Charlotte Moore both checked into the West Hollywood hotel, which describes itself as the 'coolest place in LA' and a 'sanctuary for West Hollywood's A-list elite' in May. The latest list of BBC expenses to be published revealed that Mr Cohen's seven-night stay at the hotel, which was organised through the corporation's central bookings system and paid for by the broadcaster, cost £1,385.87.

While in Los Angeles for the annual screenings, they are also understood to have taken part in meetings with other international broadcasters and with potential co-producers. Destination: The hotel boasts of offering '3.5 acres of Mediterranean oasis', located just off the famed Sunset Strip, and claims to be the place where the phrase 'Party like a rock star' was invented . The hotel bills itself 'as the home away from home for actors, comedians, writers, artists, filmmakers, fashion designers, supermodels, restaurateurs, billionaire entrepreneurs, and the newest breed of entertainer when the hotel opened its doors in 1963: rock stars.' It boasts of offering '3.5 acres of Mediterranean oasis', located just off the famed Sunset Strip, and claims to be the place where the phrase 'Party like a rock star' was invented. The hotel even has a Stay & Play package which offers guest the use of the EG-1 Traveler Guitar, in case any visiting rock stars have left their at home, and says there is room to park a tour bus in its underground car park 'if you happen to have one'. Sunset Marquis, which was recently renovated to mark its 50th year in business, was built by real estate developer George Rosenthal and opened in 1963. Venue: Sunset Marquis, which was recently renovated to mark its 50th year in business, was built by real estate developer George Rosenthal and opened in 1963, its restaurant is shown here . Among those who have used the hotel as a home from home are Jeff Beck, Bruce Springsteen, Steven Tyler, Gene Hackman and Elton John while, according to the hotel website, Neil Diamond used to perform by the pool to pay his bill. U2 have also stayed at the hotel, while singer Harry Connick Jnr reportedly met his wife, former Victoria's Secret model Jill Goodacre at one of the venue's two hotel pools. Today, hotel features 154 suites and villas, as well as a restaurant, spa and even a recording studio, while the hotel describes how it 'continues to attract new stars like Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson and various American Idol winners'. Its advertised rates range from $305 (£195) for a standard room, to $2,000 for a two-bedroom villa, which features a dining area for up to eight and an oversized marble, granite and tiled bathrooms with an oversized bath tub - meaning that the BBC managed to make a saving with a special rate. There is also the two-storey 'Presidential villa', which has its own private screening room and a semi-private elevator. A BBC spokesman told MailOnline: 'We're the world’s largest public service broadcaster, broadcast in 28 languages and have staff in 85 cities around the world – so it's unsurprising that our executives sometimes travel internationally and value for money is always a priority.'","Director of television and BBC1 controller in LA for annual screenings .

"A federal politician has slammed the #illridewithyou social media movement as a 'pathetic left wing' campaign. Nationals MP George Christensen hit out against the hashtag - which was started in the midst of the Sydney Lindt cafe siege to show  solidarity with the Muslim community - in a series of tweets on Wednesday. The member for Dawson, in north Queensland, wrote: '#illridewithyou is a typical pathetic left wing black arm band brigade campaign, casting Aussies as racists who will endanger Muslims.' National party MP George Christensen slammed #illridewithyou,  calling it a 'hating whitey' campaign . Twitter user Tessa Kum began what has become a worldwide phenomenon . Two hostages died in the early hours of Tuesday morning after being held hostage for 17 hours by self-proclaimed Islamic cleric Man Haron Monis. Another 16 hostages managed to escape after being forced to send out messages on social media, YouTube and to media outlets claiming Monis was working on behalf of the Islamic State. The #illridewithyou campaign has been endorsed high profile people from actor Russell Crowe to U.S. President Barack Obama - and has been used on social media more than 500,000 times. Mr Christensen followed up his first comment with another series of tweets, and replied to detractors while posting links to ring-wing blogs that criticised the two women who inspired and started the hashtag. '#weridetogether & #illridewithyou - typical lefty campaigns that creates false victims. Focus on real #sydneysiege victims: Tori & Katrina,' he wrote.

'Hating whitey' is a term used to describe 'anti-white racism of the Left', popularised by American conservative writer David Horowitz. One of Mr Christensen's colleagues, Liberal MP Ewen Jones, criticised Mr Christensen's stance and distanced himself from the comments. 'Completely insensitive and ignorant of the motive,' Mr Jones tweeted. Twitter user Tessa Kum (@sirtessa) began what has become a worldwide phenomenon, offering to sit next to members of the Islamic faith on transport if they were frightened to be seen in public wearing religious clothing. George Christensen pictured with Prime Minister Tony Abbott . After Ms Kum noticed a disturbing trend of anti-Muslim sentiments, she wrote to those on her regular bus: 'wear religious attire, & don’t feel safe alone: I’ll ride with you'. She was inspired after reading a Facebook post written by another woman, Rachael Brown, who saw a Muslim woman take her headscarf off on the train and offered to walk with her so she felt safe. Ms Kum told theABC that 'it just seemed that a simple way of promoting kindness would be to say if anybody catching public transport didn't feel comfortable just because of what they were wearing, I would sit next to them, so they weren't alone'. The hashtag was soon picked up by her 3,183 followers, gaining support from fellow Australians who offered lifts to work, promises of protection, and friendship to anyone feeling threatened.

"Britons are to get first sight of tens of thousands of job vacancies after ministers demanded an end to adverts being placed across the EU. Brussels rules used to mean that any jobs advertised on the government’s Universal Jobmatch had to be broadcast on an EU-wide website used by migrants looking for work. But a deal struck between member states means that the jobs will now only be seen outside the UK if employers request it. Scroll down for video . A deal struck by employment minister Esther McVey with other member states means that the jobs will now only be seen outside the UK if employers request it . The Universal Jobmatch website replaced the old system of jobcentres advertising vacancies on cards in their windows . Universal Jobsearch was launched in November 2012, and more than 7million people have registered to use it. More than 4million searches are carried out every day, with half a million vacancies on the site. It replaced the old system of jobcentres advertising vacancies on cards in their windows. However, EU rules meant that any of the adverts uploaded by 500,000 employers were replicated on an EU-wide jobs portal called ‘EURES’. The British government called for changes to be made to ensure people already in the UK saw the vacancies first. It comes as part of a crackdown on the ‘pull factors’ which attract EU migrants to Britain. The deal was struck by Employment Minister Esther McVey during a meeting with her European counterparts in Brussels. She told MailOnline: ‘We are giving businesses the choice of advertising their jobs only to British residents – it’s only right that they get that choice. ‘Under this Government, British nationals have accounted for two-thirds of the rise in employment. With new vacancies being created every single day, we want to make sure people here get the first chance to secure those jobs too. ‘The new rules will significantly reduce the number of jobs advertised in Europe and put British residents first – and we will continue work with countries across Europe to ensure the system remains fair to jobseekers and to businesses.’ Since the start of 2010, the number of British people in work has risen by 961,635, compared to a rise of 542,811 among EU nationals and an extra 456,503 people from the rest of the world . New figures released yesterday show that a record 30.8million people are in work in the UK. Since the start of 2010, the number of British people in work has risen by 961,635, compared to a rise of 542,811 among EU nationals and an extra 456,503 people from the rest of the world. Miss McVey added: ‘Behind these figures are individual stories of hard work and determination – stories of people turning their lives around, of families who are now feeling more secure over the Christmas period with a regular wage. ‘If we can tip the scale more in their direction it’s got to be a good thing.’ Miss McVey has held talks with Danish, Dutch, and Estonian employment ministers to secure further agreement on changes to the jobs market. At the start of this year the government toughened the rules on foreign workers accessing jobs in the UK. EU migrants are banned from claiming benefits for their first three months in the UK, and can only then receive Jobseeker’s Allowance for a maximum of three months.","EXCLUSIVE: Vacancies will not be automatically shown on EU jobs portal .

Samuel, 25, and Jonathan McKinley, 23, robbed and horrifically beat 35-year-old father Choudhry Zishan to death while he was on his way to work. The drunken thugs launched the attack on Mr Zishan and demanded his money before savagely beating him, ramming his head into a parked car. Today, a day after they were found guilty of murder, police videos show the McKinleys' apparent confusion at being told they were being arrested on suspicion of killing the 'family man'. Scroll down for video . A video shows the moment two brothers who brutally murdered a newsagent were arrested, with one asking police officers: 'I've been arrested for murder? This is a joke' During Samuel McKinley's (pictured) arrest, he said: 'Can I explain what happened here or not? I just don't know what I'm arrested for' Witnesses who heard the attack in Eastleigh, Hampshire, called police and described how the father-of-one was crying in pain as the brothers continued their violent attack. Mr Zishan, who had a five-year-old son and a baby on the way with his pregnant wife, could not be saved and died from extensive brain injuries. The brothers, from Eastleigh, were convicted of murder yesterday at Winchester Crown Court and could be jailed for life tomorrow. Several hours after the attack in the early hours of Sunday, March 30, police arrested both McKinleys on suspicion of murder and filmed the arrest with covert cameras. When arrested, Jonathan was secretly recorded saying, 'What?!  'Are you f****** stupid?! Are you actually being stupid?! Nah, come on, seriously. Nah, be serious.' During Samuel's arrest, he said: 'Can I explain what happened here or not? I just don't know what I'm arrested for. 'I've been arrested for murder? This is a joke.' Brothers Samuel (left) and Jonathan McKinley (right) murdered a newsagent in a mugging outside his home, but a video if their arrests shows their apparent confusion at being caught . Crime scene: Mr Zishan, who had a five-year-old son and a baby on the way with his pregnant wife, could not be saved and died from extensive brain injuries after the attack in Eastleigh . Three calls from witnesses to the police describing their accounts of the attack have also been released. One caller said: 'There are three youths outside my house. Two of them seem to be beating another one up, demanding money off him. 'One of them is yelling ""Give me your money. Give me your money."" And one said ""It's okay, I've got him in a headlock."" And they seem to be crashing into cars and things.' Another said: 'I think that someone's been mugged or attacked. I can see someone on the floor, and someone's saying ""Give me the money now"". Someone else was saying ""I will stab you if you don't give me the money.""' A witness added: 'There's a savage attack going on. They're battering him. They're hitting cars, going behind vans. They're chucking him around. You can hear it.' Witnesses described how the father-of-one was crying in pain as the brothers carried out their violent attack . Detective Superintendent Paul Barton, of Hampshire Police, said: 'There are agencies that can try and help people but some people are beyond help unfortunately. I suspect the McKinleys are in that situation. 'Choudhry Zishan was a family man and a businessman who was well known and liked within the community in Eastleigh. 'He'd been walking to work on the morning of Sunday, March 30, when he was approached by the McKinley brothers who tried to rob him. 'They'd been drinking throughout the night and things escalated quickly to the point where they threatened him and began beating him. 'It was a senseless, brutal and sustained assault that Mr Zishan did not survive. 'The brothers used some of the money they stole from him to buy more alcohol from a nearby garage. 'Later, when they realised what they'd done, they tried to dispose of the evidence by washing their clothes. 'Our thoughts are with Mr Zishan's family.'","Brothers beat newsagent Choudhry Zishan to death in vicious mugging .

"Barack Obama's historic peace-deal with Cuba after 50 years of cold war hostility was a breakthrough not to be sniffed at. But that didn't stop the US president having a try, when he got close and personal to a Cuban on Wednesday ... not a citizen, but a cigar. Significantly, it was the first time in 52 years that a US president has officially savoured the Cuban delicacy since John F. Kennedy stockpiled a secret stash of his favourite Havanas in the hours before he imposed a trade embargo on the Communist state in 1962. This, of course, doesn't include Bill Clinton's adventures with cigars and Monica Lewisnky in the Oval Office. Scroll down for video . Close to a Cuban: Obama was attending one of two White House receptions to welcome the start of Hanukkah when a guest handed him a large cheroot, which he took in his hand and ran under his nose . Obama was attending one of two White House receptions to welcome the start of Hanukkah when a guest handed him a large stogie. He took it in his hand and waved it in the air before running it under his nose for a whiff. The room fell near-silent as he paused to take in its aroma, before declaring it 'pretty good' to everyone's relief. 'I had the unique distinction of gifting the President of the United States with one of Cuba's finest cigars, a Montecristo Series at the White House…after a ceremony in which a Menorah was lit,' John Berzner, who offered the cigar to the president on Wednesday, told ABC News. He had packed just one cigar for the event, but felt compelled to present it to Barack Obama in celebration of the deal to begin normalising relations between the United States and Cuba, after 18 months of secret talks over prisoner releases brought a sudden end to decades of tension. 'Pretty good': The room fell near-silent as he paused to take in its aroma, before declaring it 'pretty good' to everyone's relief . When Berzner handed the cigar to Obama, he said: 'Mr. President, a Cuban cigar for you!' 'Oh, nice!' Obama replied as he lifted the cigar to his nose. 'The finest,' Berzner replied. The president approved, telling Berzner, 'Pretty good!' Nigel Savage, who was also a guest at the event and shot the video, added, 'The president definitely looked like he appreciated a good Cuban cigar.' It is unclear whether Obama kept the gift or handed it to the Secret Service. Legal again: President Barack Obama lifted some of America's sanctions against Cuba on Wednesday, making it legal for Americans who travel there to bring back a limited supply of cigars . The president's smoking habits have long been in the news. Obama last year told a United Nations official that he hadn't smoked a cigarette in years — mostly because of First Lady Michelle Obama. 'I haven't had a cigarette in probably six years,' Obama was overhead telling Maina Kiai at the U.N. General Assembly in New York back in September 2013. 'That's because I'm scared of my wife.' In 2009, the president said he was a 'former smoker' but he would 'constantly struggle' with kicking the habit. 'Have I fallen off the wagon sometimes? Yes,' he confessed at a press conference in 2009. 'Am I a daily smoker, a constant smoker? No. 'I don't do it in front of my kids, I don't do it in front of my family,' he added. 'And, you know, I would say that I am 95 percent cured. But there are times where...There are times where I mess up.' Michelle Obama in February 2011 said her husband stopped smoking about a year earlier. President John F. Kennedy was partial to a puff and even asked his press secretary to buy him 1,000 of his favorite Cuban cigars in the hours before he imposed the Cuban trade embargo . Obama is not the first US president to enjoy a Cuban cigar on occasion. It emerged this week that President John F. Kennedy ordered his press secretary on February 2, 1962 to buy him as many of his favorite Cuban cigars as he could lay his hands on – and held off signing the Cuban trade embargo until his precious stogies were safely inside the White House. Kennedy asked Pierre Salinger to find at least 1,000 H.Upmann petit coronas, and gave him just a half-day to accomplish the task before they would become contraband. The next morning, Salinger recalled in rare video footage of his storytelling, he reported that he had bought up 1,200 of Cuba's finest exports – a feat the president pronounced 'Fantastic!' just before he signed a decree that banned all the communist country's products from the U.S. Washington already had some limited sanctions in place, but Kennedy's decision was the beginning of a comprehensive ban on U.S. trade with the island that remained intact until Wednesday. In 1996 the Helms-Burton law tightened the sanctions further. But President Barack Obama made a shocking move on Wednesday to reopen relations with Cuba and establish an embassy there. That means Americans who travel to Havana – and there will be thousands – 'will be able to return to the U.S. with some Cuban products, including Cohibas and other Cuban cigars,' according to Cigar Aficionado magazine.","Obama was attending the White House Hanukkah reception on Wednesday .

"Online donors have contributed over $21,000 to the medical expenses of a Phoenix boy savagely mauled this summer in a park by a pit bull, whose life was controversially saved by a tens of thousands petition signatures and a judge's ruling. Kevin Vicente, 4, will never fully recover from the attack on February 20, but his mother has thanked the generosity and support they have received through internet donations in just 10 days since the fund open, with one anonymous donor giving $13,000. 'I wish that it had happened to me instead of him, but there's nothing I can do,' mom Flora Vicente told AZ Central. 'Then he sees me and says, ''Don't cry mommy, I love you''. But then five minutes goes by and the same thing happens again.' Mrs Vicente, whose family is in Guatemala, had to quit her job to care for her little boy. Savagely mauled: Kevin Vicente, whose face was virtually ripped off in a dog attack in February, has received over $21,000 in online donations in just 10 days . Scarred for life: Kevin Vicente suffered a broken eye socket and jaw in the February mauling, and has months, if not years, . of reconstructive surgery ahead of him . Spared: Mickey the pit bull who attacked four-year-old Kevin Vicente February 20 in Phoenix won a reprieve from a judge, who ruled that the dog will be neutered and defanged instead of being euthanized . Support: Kevin's mother, Flora Vicente (right), said she was disturbed by the support people gave the dog that attacked her son . Adding to her pain is the fact the animal responsible for her son's mauling - a pit bull cross named Mickey - arguably received more support than her child, whose face was virtually ripped off by the dog. 'It disturbed me at first that they placed more value on an animal than on a child, and that they made me feel very bad,' she said. 'For me he is worth gold.' In March, an Arizona judge spared Mickey's life, chosing to have him neutered, defanged and microshipped, rather than euthanized. 'There would be absolutely no possibility of the animal ever doing this to someone again,' Municipal Court Judge Deborah Griffin ruled, adding that the dog must remain in a facility for the rest of his life and cannot be adopted. Kevin  was left with a broken eye socket and jaw after the attack, and has months, if not years, of reconstructive surgery ahead of him. The question of whether the pit bull should live or die attracted a team of top death penalty lawyers, with candlelight vigils riling up thousands of animal lovers on social media, who placed blame with the dog's owners and child's baby sitter. Kevin was playing in a yard where his sitter had taken him, when he walked within the 18-foot radius of the dog's chain next door. Public outcry: The Change.org petition to save Mickey recieved 65,000 signatures . Gifts: Kevin has been receiving cards and presents from kind strangers . Getting better: Now 10 months after the mauling, Kevin is better but still has a long way to go . Donations: A fundraising effort for Kevin exceeded its goal of $20,000 in just over 10 days, and there is still a month remaining when donors can contribute to the site . Witnesses testified that little Kevin grabbed Mickey's bone and dropped it when the dog growled. When the toddler made no attempt to flee, the pit bull went on the attack, MyFox Phoenix reported. Guadalupe Villa, whose boyfriend's mother was looking after Kevin the day of the attack, filed the vicious-dog court petition that started the case, saying Mickey has a history of acting without provocation and killed one of her dogs. Animal advocates struck back, saying both the dog and boy are victims and Kevin's baby sitter was negligent in letting him play near the animal 'unsupervised.' They also argued the owner was fostering aggression by keeping the dog chained up. Life sentence: The white-and-brown pit bull will live out his days in an animal shelter without the possibility of ever being put up for adoption . Judge Griffin said several people shared some responsibility for the attack. The judge pointed out that there was a 'Beware of Dog' sign on the property's fence but the gate was left open and children were allowed to play near the dog. 'This whole case has been very, very distressing to me,' Griffin said, adding that Kevin will pay the price for the rest of his life. A half dozen animal rights advocates attended the hearing in T-shirts that bore a paw mark and a slogan, 'Save Mickey.' One of them, Veronica Lee, said the hearing showed that the baby sitter wasn't watching closely and that Mickey was kept chained. 'We were not here to put a dog above Kevin,' Lee said. 'We were just here to make sure justice was served.' Nightmare scenario: The dog grabbed Kevin's face and would not let go, causing severe injuries . Luis Acosta, who said he's not related to anyone involved in the case, disagreed with the judge's decision. 'Who is going to see to it five years from now that this dog still hasn't been adopted out?' Acosta said. Those hoping to rescue Mickey took their cause to Facebook, where a 'Save Mickey' page garnered more than 65,000 likes. On the Facebook page, the pit bull's supporters clarified Tuesday evening that Mickey's fangs will not be pulled out, but rather ground down. The dog's supporters recently used social media to organize a candlelight vigil and even a YouTube video plea. Animal rights activists also took their cause to Change.org, creating a petition to save Mickey from being euthanized that has drawn nearly 65,000 signatures - 10,000 shy of the threshold for the petition to be taken under consideration by the White House. Mickey has been living in a cage at the Maricopa County Animal Control and Care Center.","Kevin Vicente, 4, attacked February 20 in Phoenix by Mickey the pit bull .

"A popular pie eating competition had to be declared void – after the wrong-sized pies were delivered to the venue. A work experience chef was blamed for sending pies twice the official size to the Wigan Pie Eating Contest, held at Harry's Bar in the town. Meanwhile, the competition pies were delivered to a nearby party being held by someone celebrating their divorce. Scroll down for video . Champion scoffer: Barry Rigby, 37, a warehouse supervisor, won in a time of just 42.6 seconds . The contest went ahead anyway, with former champion Barry Rigby, 37, a warehouse supervisor, setting a time of 42.6 seconds. But it was for only half a pie after umpires decided that consumption of a full pie could result in a dangerous 'swallow stall'. Tony Callaghan, owner of Harry's Bar, said: 'The work experience lad was tasked with providing 24 competition pies, but mixed up the order and sent them to divorce party up the road. 'By the time we realised, it was too late.' Mr Callaghan added: 'We had to go ahead. It was a bit like Andy Murray replacing Roger Federer for a show game at the tennis finals in the O2, but everyone took it in their stride and demonstrated the professionalism of pie-eating at this level. 'It was a shame, because these lads practise long and often: you can see how seriously they take it, practising pie-eating late into the night on every street corner in Wigan town centre.' Dedicated athletes: Participants take part in a heat. They are eating half pies, after the trainee chef given the job of delivering the pies to the competition accidentally brought along snacks of the wrong size . Safety first: The pies had to be halved to cut the chances of a dangerous 'swallow stall' The cooked dimensions of the official competition pie should be a diameter of four-and-three-quarter inches and a depth of one-and-a-third inches, and a pie wall angle from base to top of between zero and 15 degrees. Minimum content cube dimensions of the meat and potato mix are two-fifths of an inch, and they must have 66 per cent meat content, not including pastry.","The Wigan Pie Eating Contest went ahead anyway after pies were halved .

"Just two days after the country's prime minister Nawaz Sharif promised to crack down on terror groups, a Pakistani court granted bail to the granted bail to the alleged mastermind of the 2008 terror attacks in the Indian city of Mumbai. Horrified by the attack on the Army Public School and College in Peshawar which left 148 pupils and teachers dead, Sharif promised 'to continue the war against terrorism till the last terrorist is eliminated.' Nonetheless, a court bailed Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, who is accused of planning the 60-hour siege on India's economic capital left 166 people dead, after 10 gunmen attacked luxury hotels, a popular cafe, a train station and a Jewish center.

Relations between the two nuclear-armed rivals worsened dramatically after the carnage which was blamed on the banned Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). The court's decision came less than 48-hours Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif vowed to crack down on terror groups in Pakistan, as the country reels from the attack on the Army Public School and College in Peshawar. At least Seven extremist gunmen who sprayed children with bullets as they sat receiving first aid tuition and exploded suicide bombs. Sharif also announced that a six-year moratorium on the death penalty would be lifted for those convicted of terror offences. None of this stopped a judge at a court in the country's capital Islamabad, from granting bail to Lakhvi, the man prosecutors say masterminded the devastating Mumbai attacks. 'We had moved a bail application with the Islamabad anti-terror court on December 10, today the judge granted bail to my client after hearing arguments from both sides,' his lawyer Rizwan Abbasi told AFP. Prosecutor Mohammad Chaudhry Azhar confirmed the court had granted bail.

Nightmare scene: The pictures of the school's interior emerged as Pakistan began three days of mourning . The horror of the Mumbai carnage played out on live television around the world, as commandos battled the heavily-armed gunmen, who arrived by sea on the evening of November 26. It took the authorities three days to regain full control of the city and New Delhi has long said there is evidence that 'official agencies' in Pakistan were involved in plotting the attack, something Islamabad denies. The sole surviving gunman from Mumbai, Pakistani-born Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, was hanged in India in 2012. The attacks traumatised India, exposing the antiquated weapons and methods of the local police force and revealing crucial gaps in the country's defences. They also derailed a nascent peace process between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan.

"A 15-year-old  was stopped from joining the ever-growing band of British girls fleeing to Syria to join ISIS fighters after  police stopped her plane on the runway seconds before it was about to take off. The young girl had secretly saved up to buy a ticket from London to Istanbul and planned to continue her journey through Turkey and over the border into Syria. Her family, who had no idea she had extremist views, reported her missing and Scotland Yard tracked her down to a jet about to leave Britain. After rushing to Heathrow officers realised the girl's plane was already taxiing along the runway, so the pilot was ordered to stop and the girl was taken home. Scroll down for video . Drama: Met anti-terror police stopped a jet on the runway at Heathrow (file picture) to prevent a 15-year-old fleeing to . But it emerged today another British 15-year-old girl was not spotted on board and she was able to continue on her journey to join fighters. The case is the latest in a series of cases where British teenage girls have decided to flee for Syria - often to become jihadi brides. A police source involved in the Heathrow raid on December said police ignored costs and disruption to stop the plane. Yusra Hussien, 15, from Bristol, left home in September but instead of going to class went to Heathrow where she caught a flight to Turkey and went on to Syria . 'The plane was taxiing down the runway but we managed to turn it round. This was a big decision to take because of all the disruption it caused. But we had to stop her going. It has probably saved her life,' he told the Evening Standard. It appears it was treated as a missing person's inquiry and she was not arrested. Police in Britain have been urging families to contact them if they believe their loved-ones are trying to leave for Syria so they can be stopped. Detectives say young women are being manipulated online with glamorous descriptions of life in Syria with ISIS, only to suffer a miserable existence when they arrive. Yusra Hussien, 15, from Bristol, left home in September but instead of going to class went to Heathrow where she caught a flight to Turkey. She boarded a plane with a 17-year-old British girl Samya Dirie, who she met online and the two are now believed to be in Syria, and may have married jihadist fighters. Police failed to stop schoolgirl Miss Dirie  despite being told she had run away with her passport. Three hours after her panicked parents alerted officers that she was missing, she was allowed to fly from Heathrow to Turkey. Her exit may have prompted the urgent response in the latest Heathrow case. In June 'terror twins'  Zahra and Salma Halane, both 16, of Chorlton, Manchester, are thought to have married in the war-torn nation since disappearing overnight from their home. Both have insisted that Allah had 'chosen' for them to be in Syria. The pair have 28 GCSEs between them and were planning to become doctors, having just finished their first year of sixth-form college, but were said to have been radicalised over the internet. Their father Ibrahim and mother Khadra travelled to the region to try to bring them home, but without success. The couple have 10 children and their 21-year-old son Ahmed is said to be fighting with Al Shabaab, a militant group in Somalia. Terror twins: Siblings Salma, left, and Zahra Halane, right, both 16,  fled for Syria to marry ISIS fighters . An ever-growing band of young women have left their families in Britain to join the jihadi cause in Syria. Researchers have identified six more such women through their online accounts – and warn this could be the tip of the iceberg. Many have formed ‘intense friendships’ in the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa, where they appear as content shopping with friends as declaring their hatred of the UK. Academics at King’s College in London said they have seen ‘a big uptake’ in the number of UK women going to Syria. As many as 600 Britons are believed to have joined Islamic forces fighting President Bashar Assad in the last three years. But many have become disillusioned with the brutal IS regime and associated groups.","Teenager secretly saved for Turkey flight and onward journey to Syria .

"The family of a woman stabbed to death in a violent attack on her way to work said today she was a 'wonderful and caring' mother and wife who worked hard to reduce crime in her community. Alison Morrison, 45, a member of the Harrow local safer neighbourhood board, suffered knife wounds all over her body as she was ambushed less than half a mile from her home. Her neighbour, satellite TV engineer Trevor Gibbon, 48, was arrested by police, who found a large bloody kitchen knife nearby. Killed: Alison Morrison, 45, lay fatally wounded in a pool of blood this morning as others rushed to her aid near her home in Harrow, north London. Her neighbour, satellite TV engineer Trevor Gibbon, 48, was arrested . Tragedy: The much-loved mother-of-one was stabbed in the street here in the way to work and witnesses said the attack lasted at least a minute . Other residents claimed that the pair had been locked in an increasingly bitter dispute over a shared driveway between their £410,000 end-of-terrace houses. Mrs Morrison's sister, Julie Brathwaite, 51, rushed from her home in Waterlooville, Hampshire, to be with her brother-in-law and nephew last night. Her brother-in-law Lee Richards, said: 'We are just shocked and devastated. 'She was a wonderful, caring mother and top professional. 'She was a great mum and did good work for the community. She was just the best person and we are only just starting to come to terms with our loss. We cannot believe what has happened.' She lived with husband Cedric, 46, and their son, who is 16, and as well as her work for Which? magazine she was proud to be vice-chair of the Harrow Safer Neighbourhood Board, set up to lower crime and help victims of crime in their area. Scotland Yard paid tribute to her work with them in Harrow and said she 'truly cared' about her community. Her niece Bianca Brathwaite said: 'She was everything you could ask for In a woman, she was strong and always stood up for herself and her family and is loved dearly'. One witness of the horrific attack, which took place during yesterday morning's rush hour, said: 'I was sitting in my room and heard some screaming I thought it was just people being silly. But on the third scream I ran outside and I saw [the attacker] on top of her. 'She was on the floor and a man was on top of her, attacking her. 'He had a big knife in his hands, I saw it flashing. It went on for about a minute at least. It's just so sad. It was awful. 'I think she was on her way to work.' The row was apparently ignited when the local council repaved the street, but did not drop the kerb leading on to the driveway. This led the neighbours to argue about who could park where.

Row: Mrs Morrison is also said to have installed a bright security light which upset her neighbour, while Mr Gibbon had erected CCTV cameras on his home which caused animosity between the pair . As it spiralled out of control, the pair, who apparently used to be close, stopped talking to each other. Other residents in the street in Harrow, north-west London, said matters got worse after Mrs Morrison's husband Cedric, 46, who underwent a kidney transplant several years ago, put up a bright security light. A year ago Mr Gibbon's partner, 52-year-old school teacher Maria Perrett, gave neighbours a handwritten letter saying they had installed a CCTV camera. Last night, one resident said: 'It has been going on for a couple of years. One had set up CCTV cameras and the other had a security light that seemed to be bothering them. Touching: Mrs Morrison's sister today left a note and a bouquet of flowers at the scene where her sister died . Other floral tributes were also left at the spot where Mrs Morrison was fatally stabbed yesterday evening . 'The road got repaved and there was an argument about the shared driveway and who could park where. 'One of them would park their car in a way that agitated the other. 'I never saw them rowing in the street but everyone was aware of it because they used to speak to each other but now they don't. Things seemed to have eased and I thought it was resolved.' Another neighbour said: 'It was all to do with the shared drive. 'The road and pavement were replaced and the kerb wasn't dropped – I think it was something to do with access. 'Last year or the early part of this year I saw them outside talking about it but they weren't shouting and arguing, just talking.' Mrs Morrison's family were too upset to speak last night as police stood outside their home. Just yards away, forensic experts were searching through bins in the shared driveway between their homes, which was cordoned off with police tape. Death: The woman was stabbed in Alexandra Avenue, a main thoroughfare through Harrow, north London . Mrs Morrison, who had a 16-year-old son, Kori, was a senior manager at consumer organisation Which? as well as a dedicated volunteer and adviser to charities. Earlier this year, she joined her local safer neighbourhood board, which aims to cut crime and tackle antisocial behaviour. Chief Superintendent Simon Ovens, Borough Commander for Harrow, said: 'I had the pleasure of knowing and working with Alison in her role as the Vice-Chair of our borough's Safer Neighbourhood Board. She was held in high regard locally, and truly cared about the borough. Her friends within the local community will be devastated by her loss. 'Her input to policing as a 'critical friend' has been invaluable, someone who always provided honest feedback. 'The Homicide and Major Crime Command quickly arrested a man on suspicion of Alison's murder, and their work is ongoing to establish the motive behind this crime'. Cllr David Perry, Leader of Harrow Council, said: 'Alison Morrison was passionately committed to creating a safer Harrow through her work with the Harrow Safer Neighbourhood Board and as a Community Champion, and it is terrible news that she has lost her life in this violent way in a borough she cared so much about. 'Alison’s colleagues on the Safer Neighbourhood Board are absolutely shattered by this news as are the staff of Harrow Council. Alison was a key member of the Board and a tireless advocate of its work.' Neighbours said they were 'devastated' at her death. Describing her as a 'nice girl', one added: 'This is such a shock to me. 'Especially in the run-up to Christmas. We only received a Christmas card from her yesterday.' One family friend said: 'Everyone is in bits. We cannot believe what has happened'. Which? group chief executive Peter Vicary-Smith joined the tributes to Mrs Morrison. He said: 'Alison was a hugely popular member of staff and her sudden death has come as a great shock to us all'.

"A new record has been set for the deepest fish ever seen in the world, at an incredible depth of 26,722 feet (8,145 metres). The snailfish was found at the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean, and breaks the previous record by almost 1,640 feet (500 metres). The finding was part of an international expedition that also found many other new species at the extreme depths. Scroll down for videos . Aberdeen University researchers have set a new record for the deepest fish ever found (shown in red ring). It was spotted 26,722ft down in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean. Called a snailfish it has a ghostly tadpole-like body and no scales. It is seen here swimming with crustaceans . The bizarre creature found is thought to be a snailfish, a 'ghostly' looking creature that has a tad-pole like body . They have large heads, small eyes and no scales, and are normally slightly larger than a human hand in length. Dr Alan Jamieson, from Aberdeen University said: 'This really deep fish did not look like anything we had seen before, nor does it look like anything we know of. 'It is unbelievably fragile, with large wing-like fins and a head resembling a cartoon dog'. Scientists say that fish cannot survive deeper than about  26,902ft (8,200 metres) in the oceans. They said this was the limit at which their tissues could withstand the crushing pressures. They survive using a molecule called trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which gives them their ‘fishy’ smell. Going deeper would require some other mechanism to survive. Scientists from Aberdeen University and Hawaii University captured footage of fish in more than 105 hours of video taken at the Mariana Trench. This was done with an Aberdeen-built machine used to venture into deep waters, known as the Hadal Lander. It is the UK's deepest diving vehicle and is equipped with a high definition underwater camera. The 30-day voyage was run by Schmidt Ocean Institute's research vessel, Falkor. Scientists carried out 92 dives across the entire depth range of the trench, which lies in the Pacific Ocean east of the Philippines and south of Japan, from 16,400 to 34,600ft (5,000 to 10,545m). They were also surprised to have discovered a rare 'supergiant' amphipod, a shrimp-like crustacean that can be up to 11 inches (28cm) long and was originally discovered in New Zealand in 2012. This is seen swimming with the snailfish in some of the footage. The bizarre creature found (shown) is thought to be a snailfish, a 'ghostly' looking creature that has a tadpole like body.

Dr Jamieson added: 'Knowing these creatures exist is one thing, but to watch them alive in their natural habitat and interacting with other species is truly amazing, we have learnt a great deal.' The Hadal Ecosystem Studies, published online, will give researchers new insights into the complicated ocean ecosystems by looking not only at the deepest point of the trench but also at different depths. 'Many studies have rushed to the bottom of the trench but from an ecological view that is very limiting,' said Dr Jeff Drazen, co-chief scientist from Hawaii University. 'It's like trying to understand a mountain ecosystem by only looking at its summit'. Scientists carried out 92 dives across the entire depth range of the trench, which lies in the Pacific Ocean east of the Philippines and and south of Japan, from 16,400 to 34,600ft (5,000 to 10,545m). They observed many species at diffferent depths including a large cusk eel, Bassozetus, seen here . Rat-tails, decapods, supergiants and snailfish are seen here at a depth of 23,005ft (7,012 metres). Dr Jamieson of Aberdeen University said: 'Knowing these creatures exist is one thing, but to watch them alive in their natural habitat and interacting with other species is truly amazing, we have learnt a great deal' Aberdeen University researchers, who have carried out 13 previous trips to the trench, say they have also set records by filming three other types of fish at previously unrecorded depths. They also successfully reached the bottom of the Sirena Deep, the trench's deepest point at 34,600ft (10,545 metres), solidifying their deep-sea lander as the UKs deepest diving vehicle. Dr Jamieson added: 'We are particularly proud of this vehicle given it was designed and almost entirely built in villages in Aberdeenshire in the Northeast of Scotland.' Wendy Schmidt, co-founder of the Schmidt Ocean Institute in California, also involved in the expedition added: 'Rarely, do we get a full perspective of the ocean's unique deep environments. 'The questions that the scientists will be able to answer following this cruise will pave the way for a better understanding of the deep sea, which is not exempt from human impact.'","Aberdeen University researchers set new record for deepest fish found .

"A teacher who has recently transitioned from being a man to a woman has shared the highs and lows of stepping into her new identity. Karen Adell Scot, 56, from Oakhurst, California, announced in March that she would be returning to her post at Yosemite High School not as Mr Gary Sconce, as she was formally known, but Miss Scot; having had gender reassignment surgery. Writing for Today, Miss Scot relayed the reaction she had from one of her female students, who told her: 'You know, I really liked Mr Sconce. He was a lot of fun. But you’re such a better teacher than Mr Sconce. Because you listen to us.' Science teacher: Karen Adell Scot, 56, announced in March that she would be returning to her post at Yosemite High School not as Mr Gary Sconce, as she was formally known (left) but as Miss Scot (right) Sadly for Miss Scot, her own family have been less accepting of her transition. Her former wife divorced her last September after 36 years of marriage because she didn't want to be married to a woman. Miss Sconce's son is 'trying to re-establish' a relationship, but only communicates intermittently. Her daughter warned her that if she had surgery to feminize her face, she'd be 'dead to her' - and followed up on her promise after Miss Scot underwent the surgery. 'I don't get many reciprocal texts or communications from her. And I don’t get to see her daughter, my granddaughter,' Miss Scot reports. 'My daughter was always a daddy’s girl. 'She always hung around with this hardheaded, conservative, military, law enforcement, masculine type of guy. That’s who I was. On the outside.' Mixed responses: While most of her students have embraced Miss Scot's new identity (pictured) her own family have been less accepting of her transition .

Big decision: Her daughter warned her that if she had surgery to feminize her face, she'd be 'dead to her' - and followed up on her promise. Miss Scot, pictured before (left) and (after) she underwent the surgery . Indeed, before Miss Scot started taking estrogen - a naturally occurring female hormone taken by men who are in transition - she describes herself as having been 'hyper' and 'uneasy.' Speaking to The Sierra Star earlier this year, Miss Scot said she had tried a variety of activities to convince herself of her masculinity; including college football, joining the military, becoming a sheriff's deputy, and teaching martial arts. She writes for Today: 'Imagine that you are swimming in the ocean and you get rolled by a huge wave. You don’t know which way is up. 'You're drowning. You’re suffocating. That’s what life felt like before my transition. 'Like struggling to survive under a tidal wave.'

Notice the profound diffference! [left]' New person: Before Miss Scot, pictured in November (left) and December (right), started taking estrogen, she describes herself as having been 'hyper' and 'uneasy' After Miss Scot finally summoned the courage to come clean about how she felt - that she'd been trapped in the wrong body for as long as she can remember - she hoped her wife would be able to get past it. Tragically, despite her former wife's best efforts, she found herself unable to and filed for divorce in September. Worse, Miss Scot found that after her transition, she realized she appreciated her ex-wife and loved her 'far more deeply' than she had when she was a man. She does, however, insist she 'understands' the undoubtedly difficult decision made by her ex-wife, and hopes they can still be friends. Say cheese: Miss Scot, pictured last month, claims that her sex change has left feeling 'alive for the first time' and overwhelmed with 'pure happiness and joy' While many former friends, acquaintances and colleagues have shunned Miss Scot's new identity, she focuses on the 'vast majority' of her students who have responded positively. 'As a woman in the classroom, I possess tremendous empathy and insight that I didn’t have as a man,' she writes. 'Now, I am calm, happy, easygoing and organized.' Miss Scot claims that her sex change has left feeling 'alive for the first time' and overwhelmed with 'pure happiness and joy.' She regularly writes to her estranged daughter to tell her how much she loves and cares for her. For now, it's all she can do.

"In the ultimate display of motherly love, Sydney siege hostage Robyn Hope refused to flee the Lindt Chocolate Cafe on Tuesday morning  without her daughter. Hope's daughter Louisa was being used as a human shield by the deranged gunman when Robyn was given the opportunity to escape with a group of hostages. Instead, the 74-year-old devoted mother, who was apparently one of the most vocal people inside the cafe, stayed put, demanding the gunman release her daughter. Scroll down for video . Injured hostage: Louisa Hope, 50, was held hostage by the self-styled Sheikh . 'While he was holding her, Louisa's mother was screaming at him telling him to let her go,' Louisa's ex-husband Tony told the Daily Telegraph. 'Louisa was saying, 'Mum, stop it', telling her to keep quiet. Her mum could have escaped apparently but refused to leave her daughter behind. What mother would? They are as close as mother and daughter can be.' Meanwhile, Robyn's son, Robert Honan, went to sleep with no idea his mother and sister were two of the 18 hostages who were taken during the Sydney siege. Robyn Hope, the mother of Louisa, was also held hostage in the Lindt cafe . The Queenslander was woken about 2.30am on Tuesday by a call from his shaken mother, who told him she had been shot and could not find his sister after they were separated in the chaos that followed the end of the siege,The Courier Mail reported. Louisa Hope,50, originally from Moruya on the far south coast of New South Wales, and her  mother, Robyn, were having coffee at the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place on Monday morning when self-styled Sheikh Man Haron Monis stormed in about 9.30am. Monis was brandishing a pump-action shotgun and held hostages inside the cafe for almost 17 hours as police swarmed the area. Louisa Hope - who featured in a hostage video - is pictured here being stretchered out of the Lindt Cafe . Mr Honan had been aware the siege was unfolding but had not considered that his family were part of it as the two women had an appointment he assumed they had attended. 'But they went there [to the cafe] first and never got to where they were meant to be going,' he told News Corp. Mr Honan said 'they were terrified and upset and had mixed feelings of they're alive'. The ex-husband and close friend of Ms Hope, who preferred to go by the name Tony V, told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday morning his former partner was injured during the last moments of the siege. He told how she was used as a 'human shield' by the gunman just before the crisis came to a bloody end. 'He'd used her for a human shield for most of the time that she was in there,' the ex-husband, who used to live in Bondi but now runs a restaurant in South Yorkshire in the United Kingdom, said. Hero: Tori Johnson, the manager of the Lindt cafe, tried to seize the gunman's weapon as the hostages frantically tried to escape . 'That was just before the young lad was shot when he went to take the gun off the gunman.' The dramatic siege - considered a terrorist event according to NSW Police Force protocols - came to an end about 2am on Tuesday morning when hostages attempted a mass escape and cafe manager Tori Johnson attempted to grab Monis' weapon. Monis was falling asleep but woke up as the escape was underway. 'He [Monis] had dozed off. He was falling asleep,' Tony said. 'Some rustling noises had woke him when the lad was trying to take the gun off him. 'That's when [Mr Johnson] was shot. Apparently that's when my ex-mother-in-law [Robyn] was then shot in the shoulder and that's when the police then went in... and that's when Louisa was shot in the foot.' Mr Johnson was killed as well as barrister and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson who died after she was taken to hospital. At least four people were injured and taken to hospital. Ms Hope's ex-partner, who spoke to family on Tuesday morning UK time, said the whole incident had been 'very frightening'. He had some words of support for his injured friend, who he said has been operated on and is recovering in hospital. 'I'd just give her a hug and just tell her to keep strong,' Tony said.

"Excavations of a colossal fortress built by King Herod the Great have uncovered the palace's dramatic entrance way. The arched entrance and corridor, built around 20 years before the birth of Christ, leads to a vestibule or lobby covered with coloured frescoes. The palace was built after Herod defeated the Parthians, originally from Iran, and decided to build a town and palace on the site 10 miles (16km) south of Jerusalem to celebrate his victory. Scroll down for video . Archaeologists from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Institute of Archaeology, discovered the colossal entrance (pictured) to the Herodium hilltop palace at the Herodyon National Park. The main feature of the entryway is a corridor with a complex system of arches spanning its width on three separate levels . The discovery was made by by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Institute of Archaeology. It was part of a wider dig that is ongoing at the Herodium site in the Herodyon National Park. The main feature of the entryway is a corridor with a complex system of arches spanning its width on three separate levels. Thanks to the supporting arches, the 65ft (20 metre) long and 19ft (6 metre) wide corridor has been preserved to a height of 65ft (20 metres). Hebrew University archaeologists, Roi Porat, Yakov Kalman and Rachel Chachy, said: ‘The corridor was built as part of Herod's plan to turn Herodium into a massive artificial volcano-shaped hill, a vast and impressive monument designed to commemorate the architect-King. Herodium is a hill, situated in the Herodyon National Park (pictured). Between 23 and 15BC, King Herod the Great constructed a fortress, palace and small town on the cone-shaped mound and was later buried there. Herod died in Jericho in spring 4 BC and was said to have been buried on the site . Herod (illustrated) was born around 73BC and was governor of Galilee. He was appointed King of the Jews by the Roman senate . Herodium is a hilltop fortress situated in the Herodyon National Park. Between 23 and 15BC, King Herod the Great constructed a fortress, palace and small town on the cone-shaped mound, and was later buried there. Herod was born around 73BC and was governor of Galilee until 40BC. The Parthian Empire then conquered Judea, which was under Roman control at the time, and Herod fled to Jerusalem. He sought refuge in Petra, where his mother was said to have been originally from, and was later appointed King of the Jews by the Roman senate. With Roman support, he took back the kingdom three years later, and began building the fortress a decade after that. Archaeologists believe the palace was built by slaves and contractors and consisted of four towers - believed to have been where Herod lived - as well as frescoes, an aqueduct, elaborate mosaic floors and corridors connected by archways. The site is the highest peak in the Judean desert, stretching 2,450ft (758 metres) above sea level. According to biblical accounts, when news of Jesus’ arrival reached the king, he was said to have felt threatened and ordered all newborn babies in Bethlehem to be killed. The Bible portrays him as a tyrant that would stop at nothing to keep his throne. In Matthew 2:16, the gospel wrote: ‘When he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.’ There were even accounts that the king killed three of his own sons, out of fear of losing his crown. However, few other historical accounts of this massacre have been reported. Archaeologists believe the palace was built by slaves and contractors (illustrated left) as well as frescoes, an aqueduct, elaborate mosaic floors and corridors connected by archways. His body was buried in a tomb on the site of the fortress, which archaeologists claimed to have uncovered in 2007 (pictured right) Herod died in Jericho in spring 4 BC of an illness dubbed ‘Herod’s Evil’, which is thought to have been a combination of cirrhosis of the liver, hypertension, and diabetes. His body was buried in a tomb on the site of the fortress, which archaeologists claimed to have uncovered in 2007. However, last year, experts ruled this location out because the tomb was too small for a ruler known for his decadence and love of ambitious, large scale architectural projects. Experts at the time also said the said the building where the tomb was said to have been found has an awkward layout with two staircases above the tomb, and is not symmetrically aligned with the rest of the complex, which would have been a design faux pas not fit for a king. They also believe that the ruler, known for his expensive taste, would not have settled for a coffin made of local stones. The original palace vestibule, blocked when the corridor became redundant, was also exposed (pictured). This room was decorated with painted frescoes and also showed signs of the rebel occupation during the Great Revolt of 66 to 71 BC. These signs included Jewish Revolt coins and crude temporary structures . ‘During the course of the excavations, it became evident that the arched corridor was never actually in use, as prior to its completion it became redundant.' Experts believe that when Herod became aware of his impending death in 4BC, he decided to convert the hilltop complex into a memorial mound and royal burial monument. ‘Whatever the case, the corridor was backfilled during the construction of the massive artificial hill at the end of Herod's reign,' continued the archaeologists. ‘The upper section of a new monumental stairway stretching from the hill's base to its peak, constructed during the course of this building phase, appears to have been built over it.’ The palace was built after Herod defeated the Parthians and decided to build a town on the site 10 miles (16km) south of Jerusalem (marked) to celebrate his victory . The original palace vestibule, blocked when the corridor became redundant, was also exposed. The discovery of official clay seals (pictured) may prove there was a ruler, or at least government activity, in the region during the 9th century BC . For centuries, scholars have either dismissed King David and King Solomon as mythological figures, or disputed the era in which they ruled over the Israelites, as told in the Bible. But the discovery of six official clay seals may finally prove that there was a ruler in the region during the 9th and 10th century BC. Although the bullae don't directly reference David or Solomon, they do suggest the presence of a government and political activity during their respective supposed reigns. This room was decorated with painted frescoes and also showed signs of the rebel occupation during the Great Revolt of 66 to 71 BC. These signs included Jewish Revolt coins and crude temporary structures. In addition, the excavations in the arched corridor also showed evidence of the Bar Kokhba Revolt period that took place between 132 and 136 BC. This included a series of hidden tunnels dug on the site by the rebels as part of the guerrilla warfare they waged against the Romans. The archaeologists said: ‘Supported in part by wooden beams, these tunnels exited from the hilltop fortress by way of the corridor's walls, through openings hidden in the corridor. ‘One of the tunnels revealed a well-preserved construction of 20 or so cypress-wood branches, arranged in a cross-weave pattern to support the tunnel's roof.’ Shaul Goldstein, Director of Israel's Nature and Parks Authority, added: ‘In the future, the excavation of the arched corridor will allow visitors direct access to the Herodium hilltop palace-fortress, in the same way that Herod entered it two thousand years ago. ‘There are also plans to provide tourists with direct access to the structures on the slope, the Royal Theater and the Mausoleum, via the earlier monumental stairway, to the hilltop Palace.’","Discovery was made by Hebrew University of Jerusalem archaeologists .

"The injured planet-hunter, Kepler, was left crippled in space last year after Nasa said it had given up attempts to fix the telescope. But all was not lost. Rather than abandoning the spacecraft, a team of Kepler engineers thought up an ingenious way to keep it running using the subtle pressure of sunlight. And now, their efforts have paid off, with Kepler spotting its first alien world since being wounded by the loss of two of its gyroscope-like wheels in May 2013. Scroll down for video . This artist's portrays the first planet discovered by the Kepler spacecraft during its K2 mission. Located 180 light-years from Earth, toward the constellation Pisces, the planet is too hot for life as we know it . The planet, dubbed HIP 116454b, is 2 and a half times the diameter of Earth and follows a close, nine-day orbit around a star that is smaller and cooler than our sun. Located 180 light-years from Earth, toward the constellation Pisces, the planet is too hot for life as we know it. However, it is close enough to be studied by instruments, scientists claim. 'Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, Kepler has been reborn and is continuing to make discoveries,' study lead author Andrew Vanderburg, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), said in a statement. 'Even better, the planet it found is ripe for follow-up studies.' The artistic concept shows Kepler operating in a new mission profile called K2. Using publicly available data, astronomers have confirmed K2's first exoplanet discovery proving Kepler can still find planets . Kepler was launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of finding new stars and planets. During that time it has confirmed 132 planets and spotted more than 2,700 potential ones. Several of these worlds are 'super-Earths' with up to 10 times the Earth's mass situated in 'habitable zone' orbits where conditions may be suitable for life. In December 2011, Kepler found a new Earth-sized planet orbiting a star just 352 light years away. It was found lurking in the Kepler star field and was named Kepler-21b. In January last year, scientists used Kepler's data to estimate that there are at least 17 billion Earth-sized exoplanet. In August 2013, Nasa announced that the broken planet-finding telescope wasto remain crippled in space after scientists gave up attempts to restore it to full working order. The spacecraft, which cost £395 million, was launched in March 2009 with the chief aim of searching for Earth-sized planets that might support life. Kepler's onboard camera detects planets by looking for transits - when a distant star dims slightly as a planet crosses in front of it. The smaller the planet, the weaker the dimming, so brightness measurements must be exquisitely precise. To enable that precision, the spacecraft must maintain steady pointing. In May, data collection during Kepler's extended prime mission came to an end with the failure of the second of four reaction wheels, which are used to stabilise the spacecraft. Rather than giving up on the stalwart spacecraft, a team of scientists and engineers crafted a strategy to use pressure from sunlight as a 'virtual reaction wheel' to help control the spacecraft. The resulting K2 mission promises to not only continue Kepler's planet hunt, but also to expand the search to bright nearby stars that harbour planets that can be studied in detail and better understand their composition. K2 also will introduce new opportunities to observe star clusters, active galaxies and supernovae. The Kepler probe was launched in 2009. Since the K2 mission officially began in May, it has observed more than 35,000 stars and collected data on star clusters and dense star-forming regions . Small planets like HIP 116454b, orbiting nearby bright stars, are a scientific sweet spot for K2 as they are good prospects for follow-up ground studies to obtain mass measurements. Using K2's size measurements and ground-based mass measurements, astronomers can calculate the density of a planet to determine whether it is likely a rocky, watery or gaseous world. 'The Kepler mission showed us that planets larger in size than Earth and smaller than Neptune are common in the galaxy, yet they are absent in our solar system,' said Steve Howell, Kepler/K2 project scientist. 'K2 is uniquely positioned to dramatically refine our understanding of these alien worlds and further define the boundary between rocky worlds like Earth and ice giants like Neptune.' Since the K2 mission officially began in May, it has observed more than 35,000 stars and collected data on star clusters, dense star-forming regions, and several planetary objects within our own solar system. It is currently in its third campaign. The Kepler probe has found hundreds of new planets. Several of these worlds are 'super-Earths' with up to 10 times the Earth's mass situated in 'habitable zone' orbits where conditions may be suitable for life .","Nasa said it had given up on fixing the planet-hunter in May 2013 .

Tracy is totally against other forms of cardio, such as running, where you repeat your movements over and over. That, she says, will bulk muscles. Along with the aerobics you must do a series of 40 toning Pilates-style moves, which change every ten days. Meal sugesstions include 'power juice' made from kale, spinach, beetroot and apple. Then there is the sweet potato corn pudding (one cooked sweet potato, one raw corn on the cob - blended together till smooth); the carrot parsnip puree (carrots and parsnips - blended); the blueberry and apple sauce (blended until smooth); the gazpacho (also blended until smooth) and protein soup. Everything is grilled, steamed or poached. No bread, potatoes, pasta or rice are allowed and there are no fats, no dairy, no salt and no red meat.

"A Christmas storm could drench the East Coast next week and ruin holiday travel plans for millions. According to forecasts, rain and snow will sweep virtually the whole eastern seaboard from Monday, pushing showers as far west as Texas. On Tuesday and Christmas Eve the precipitation is expected to intensify, with strong winds and rain storms lashing vital commuter routes along the I-95 corridor and causing a travel nightmare those headed home. Storm's brewing: On the east coast rains could begin as early as Monday and drive up the coast . Spread: By Tuesday the rain is forecast to cover around a third of the country, including virtually the whole eastern seaboard and the South . Snow could also take hold around the northernmost states, with wind effect snow pummeling areas around the Great Lakes and Ohio valley, according to the Weather Channel. The coming storms - whose precise tracks remain uncertain - will be bad news for many of the 98million people that the AAA expects to make significant Christmas journeys this year. The vast majority of travelers will go by car, contributing to what is expected to be the busiest Christmas travel season since records began. Air passengers - expected to number 5.7million - could also suffer, with the fierce winds and rains threatening to choke up hub airports in the northeast, with conditions particularly intense on Christmas Eve. Travel trouble: Lightning storms could hit vital commuting routes on Christmas Eve - as tens of millions take to busy roads . Iced Christmas: The rain eases off for the big day, according to this forecast, as snow continues to strike Pennsylvania, upstate New York and much of New England . The bad weather is expected to kick in Monday, with rain spread right along much of the East Coast from mid-Florida as high as New York, with precipitation falling as snow in the west of the Empire State and parts of Pennsylvania. On Tuesday the predicted storms get worse, with rain pushing west over all the South, as far as west Texas. A mixture of rain, snow and ice is expected over New England. Ohio, Indiana, Michigan and Illinois are also predicted to be pummeled with rain, with snow replacing it further west over Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin. The bad weather is expected to keep up through Christmas Eve. Thunderstorms could strike alongside high winds in the I-95 corridor, while a cold front may sweep in from the Great Lakes and freeze over Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia. Rain will continue over virtually the whole East Coast, according to the predictions, causing trouble at major airports just as many will be hoping to catch a last-minute flight to reunite with friends and family. A rain and snow storm will move in at the same time over the upper west coast, bringing rain and ice across Washington, Oregon and northern California. On Christmas Day itself the rain is expected largely to have abated, but snow will be the order of the day in the northeast, with flurries due over Pennsylvania, upstate New York, Vermont and New Hampshire. The predicted bad weather makes a holiday double whammy for the year after rains and snow devastated travelers over Thanksgiving.","Rains predicted to start Monday in the east and spread from there .

"You'd be excused for thinking the willingness to brave a vast expanse of snow and ice, and a fair degree of danger, would be a prerequisite for spending the night with a polar bear. But not in France's Loire Valley, where you can not only share the same space as the giant carnivores but enjoy a glass of champagne and gourmet dinner by a log fire while doing so. Visitors to the La Fleche Zoo's polar bear lodge pay from £157 ($246) per night to stay in the three-star accommodation with large bay windows looking onto the enclosure polar bears Taiko and Katinka call home. Taiko the polar bear is the star attraction at La Fleche Zoo's hugely popular lodges which look onto his enclosure . A woman compares her hand size with Taiko, as the Loire Valley zoo's male polar bear inspects his latest guests . Visitors to the lodges can sip champagne in one of eight lodges, and also have gourmet meals brought to the room . The bears can, and do, come right up to the glass of each of the eight lodges, which are a world away from the Arctic Circle origin of the creatures. The 'A night at home with the bear' concept was launched in October this year - though the 68-year-old zoo has had accommodation since 2013 - and such is the interest the western France zoo says it has the rooms sold until the end of 2015. The rooms are based on arctic lodges, and with capacity for six people work out at 200 euros per person person per night. The lodges have proven such a success that six more are set to be open by 2016, with an African savannah-themed equivalent to follow. Sleeping with animals is a growing trend around the world for zoos looking for ways to stay afloat. While London and Los Angeles' zoos have met success hosting night-time parties at their parks, staying the night in luxury takes a visit to a whole other level. Taiko and his female companion Katinka make regular appearances that visitors pay from 200 euros to experience . A man watches Taiko from the comfort of a day bed at the French zoo as part its 'A night at home with the bear' concept . Taiko frolics in his pond while two women look on in wonder . On Friday, the National Zoo and Aquarium in Australia's capital Canberra opened a new resort which allows guests to have a bubble bath next to bears and sleep with sharks just a glass panel away. Guests staying in one of the Jamala Wildlife Lodge's 20 luxury rooms can also dine with lions and hand-feed giraffes from a treehouse. Its Ushaka Lodge surrounds a monkey facility and an aquarium, with access to feeding the sharks. Back in France, La Fleche isn't alone in offering visitors close-up encounters in resort-style comfort. Sainte-Croix has an 18-month wait to stay in its deluxe wolf lodge while Cerza's resort is also a hit. Each room can sleep six people with bookings all full until the end of 2015 . Taiko goes about his business as a tourist includes the giant carnivore in his mobile phone selfie . Sophie Huberson, from France's national union of leisure, amusement and cultural spaces, says each zoo that has introduced lodges on site have increased their revenue. 'They'll all end up following this model, which lets them increase their capacity to invest,' she said. 'Those which don't evolve will see their visitor numbers drop.' Northern France's Beauval, the country's most successful zoo, has two hotels outside the park - the first being built in 2008 - and will open a third in 2015. That will have a China theme in tribute to their resident pandas and take their overall capacity to 900 rooms. 'They told us it wouldn't work,' said managing director Rodolphe Delordhe. 'Today, people are spending their holidays here.'","La Fleche Zoo in the Loire Valley, France, allows guests to sleep in lodges next to polar bears .

The anonymity allows her to be candid and raw, revealing intimate details of her experience as 'the other woman'- a position she had never imagined being in. Starting out as a young PR agent in the Australian media scene, Ava has described herself as 'naive and innocent', and perhaps too willing to believe what the man she loved was telling her. Scroll down for video . Ava Reilly has captured the attention of thousands of readers around the world, divulging her darkest secrets under a pen name in her blog Confessions of a Millionaire's Mistress . 'I posted my first confession last year when the affair was still very raw,' Ava told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was like talking into a mirror, it was therapeutic, but I never expected so many people to respond to it,' she said. 'There are all these people who have been in the same situation that I was in, men and women all over the world.' 'I was able to be real, honest, and raw, someone people can relate to.' Ava was just out of high school, learning the ropes of the PR industry, and eager to prove herself. 'When I first entered the industry I was very naive but I knew two things: I had to keep my wits about me, and the first right impression could really give me the foot in the door,' she wrote. After being given a tip-off by a friend about a high-profile businessman who needed PR assistance on an upcoming project, Ava contacted the man who would soon enter her life in a way she had never anticipated. 'I knew I was onto something huge- I could feel it in the depths of my soul- but little did I know how significant this was going to become both professionally and personally.' The anonymity allows her to be candid and raw, revealing intimate details of her experience as 'the other woman'- a position she had never imagined being in . 'I posted my first confession last year when the affair was still very raw,' Ava told Daily Mail Australia . 'My life was about to turn upside down and there was nothing I could do to stop it.' Ava began writing down her life in the form of her 'Confessions', which has now been turned into a book which details 'the rollercoaster highs and lows' of her relationship with very successful, but very married Hugh Montgomery. Drawn into a glittering life of parties, jewellery, expensive dinners, Ava quickly fell for Hugh, despite resisting his advances for weeks. She said that it took her a long time to let him in, to truly trust him, because she had been broken by so many men in her life. 'I have very few memories of my early childhood...there are many more that shaped the fear of intimacy I still experience.' Finding out that Hugh, a name she uses 'to respect the privacy of his family', was not entirely truthful with her, was devastating. Hugh had told her that he was separated from his wife, and constantly denied any suggestion that he was still involved with her. 'I knew I was onto something huge- I could feel it in the depths of my soul- but little did I know how significant this was going to become both professionally and personally' Drawn into a glittering life of parties, jewellery, expensive dinners, Ava quickly fell for Hugh, despite resisting his advances for weeks . 'I knew in my heart and very deep down that this wasn't true, but I didn't want to believe it, despite so many warning signs,' she said. 'When I was writing my blog I was struggling with myself morally, because although he'd plainly said he'd been separated I had a feeling in my gut it wasn't true,' Ava said. Drawn deeper into the relationship, and throwing herself into her soaring career in PR, Ava blocked out what she suspected about Hugh and . Ava said that by the time she confronted him, she was in too deep, and returned even though she knew it made her 'the mistress'. 'Anything before I knew was not my fault, but anything after that I needed to confess,' she said, explaining how the title of her blog, and now book, came into being. Feeling the weight of her conscience, Ava took to writing to soothe her, launching her very public journal to connect with others and explain her actions. 'I haven’t seen a book out there about this topic which wasn't The Scarlet Letter,' Ava told Daily Mail Australia. 'When I started confessing I wasn't aware of the real situation, and now I'm putting my hand up,' she said.

'I don't recommend getting into something like this, especially given the heartache and torture involved.' Ava said that the only way for her to move forward was for her to accept what she had done and move on. Keeping his name out of the spotlight was important for her because 'his wife still doesn't know, and I don’t want him or his family to get hurt,' Ava said. 'I will always love him, but some people are very innocent of the whole situation'. And who is Hugh? 'If I told you his name, you wouldn't believe me,' she said. For Ava, her whole experience has been an incredibly painful one, which has taught her a lot about herself and the way she wants to approach her life. 'Do whatever makes you happy do it, but don’t hurt anyone. If you knowingly go out there and hurt people, you can't class yourself as a good person.'

"Russia's Foreign Minister has warned his American counterpart that fresh sanctions against Moscow could damage relations between the two countries 'for a long time'. Sergei Lavrov made the comments to John Kerry during a phone call amid growing concerns for Russia's crisis-hit economy. It came as a spokesman revealed Russian President Vladimir Putin has invited North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un to Moscow for the 70th anniversary of the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two. Defiant: Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the West of building a 'virtual' Berlin Wall to contain Russia . Phone threat: Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, left, told his American counterpart John Kerry, right, that further sanctions against Moscow could damage relations 'for a long time' Russia's economy is suffering as a result of both Western sanctions imposed as punishment for the annexation of Crimea and falling global oil prices. The rouble lost almost half its value last week and the stock market hit a five-year low. Russians, worried about the collapse in the rouble, are rushing to buy durable goods such as cars and electronics before prices rise and their savings devalue as the rouble tumbles. In the Moscow Branch of Ikea shoppers fought their way to the tills as they scooped up last ditch purchases. Flat pack panic: Shoppers pack into the Moscow branch of Ikea to snap up goods before an anticipated price rise . The Swedish firm has now been forced to temporarily stop sales of kitchen furniture and appliances in Russia because it could not meet increased demand. 'Ikea Russia is temporarily stopping sales of kitchen furniture and appliances due to a large number of customer orders.' The Russian central bank has been frantically selling off foreign currency in a bid to to try prop up the rouble. Russian President Vladimir Putin has invited North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to Moscow next year to mark the 70th anniversary of the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two, the Kremlin's spokesman said on Friday. It would be Kim's first foreign visit since taking the helm of the reclusive east Asian state in 2011. His personal envoy came to Moscow last month in the framework of efforts by the two Cold War-era allies to improve relations. Russia marks the former Soviet Union's World War Two victory every year on May 9. Moscow needs North Korean cooperation in boosting natural gas exports to South Korea as Gazprom wants to build a gas pipeline through North Korea to reach its southern neighbour. Pyongyang is also seeking support from Russia, a permanent veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council, against international criticism over accusations of human rights abuses and its nuclear programme. The U.N. General Assembly committee dealing with human rights passed a resolution last month calling for the Security Council to consider referring North Korea to the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has also said North Korea is ready to resume stalled international talks on its nuclear programme. A new US law means President Barack Obama has the power to impose further sanctions if he so chooses which analysts say would be aimed mainly at Russia's defence industries. The new legislation also gives the president the power to provide both lethal and non-lethal military assistance to Ukraine. Yesterday the EU issued new sanctions banning investment in Crimea and said cruise ships will not stop at its ports. Under the new restrictions, European Union companies will not be allowed to buy real estate in Crimea, finance local companies or supply related services. Tourism services are also banned, with cruise ships barred from Crimea ports, except in an emergency. Russia annexed Crimea earlier this year after holding a referendum which was widely seen as corrupt after weeks of unrest. European Council president Donald Tusk said: 'We should send a strong signal on our readiness to further support Ukraine, also financially, as we have done politically today by making the existing sanctions on Crimea and Sebastopol more effective.' Yesterday in a show of defiance Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the economic problems on external factors and said the crisis over Ukraine was caused by the West, which he accused of building a 'virtual' Berlin Wall to contain Russia. The former KGB spy said Russia must diversify its economy to reduce dependence on oil, its major export and a key source of state income, but he gave no details and has said many times during 15 years in power that he will do this. And he showed no sign of heeding a call by EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini for 'a radical change in attitude towards the rest of the world and to switch to a cooperative mode'. Putin's popularity has soared over the annexation of Crimea but the rouble's decline could erode faith in his ability to provide financial stability, an important source of his support. An opponent, former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, said problems would mount as prices are expected to surge next year and Putin would need 'an exit strategy' to leave power. But Putin said he felt the 'support of the Russian people', though he had not decided yet whether to seek a new six-year term in an election due in 2018. Asked about Ukraine, where Russia has irked the West by backing pro-Russian separatists fighting in two eastern regions, Putin said Moscow wanted a political resolution to a conflict that has killed 4,700 people. Russian President Vladimir Putin visits a Defense Ministry control room during a meeting with senior military officials in Moscow . He also called for 'political unity', suggesting he does not intend to annexe the regions that have rebelled, and avoided calling them 'New Russia', a phrase he has used in the past. But he blamed NATO for the worst relations between Moscow and the West in decades. 'Didn't they tell us after the collapse of the Berlin Wall that NATO would not expand eastwards? But it happened immediately. Two waves of expansion. Is that not a wall? ... It's a virtual wall,' he said.

"Fed up with rowdy holidaymakers from Britain and other countries, authorities in Magaluf have announced plans to crack down on the kind of antics that have earned it the reputation of ‘Shagaluf’. Lawmakers are planning to ban pub crawls and drinking in the street 'because it does not benefit the municipality', and fly in British police officers to patrol the main tourist strip of Punta Ballena in a bid to rid the Mallorcan resort of its unsavoury image and transform it into a ‘mature tourist zone’. The notorious holiday resort is overrun with booze-fuelled and sexually-charged tourists, especially young Britons, and local residents and officials with the municipality of Calvia have finally had enough. Scroll down for video . Lawmakers are planning to ban pub crawls and drinking in the street in the notorious holiday resort . The Spanish island in the Mediterranean Sea has long been a popular destination for young Britons looking for sun, sand, cheap booze and sex. In July, authorities announced restrictions on tourist pub crawls a week after shocking video emerged showing an 18-year-old Northern Irish woman performing oral sex on 24 men in a nightclub in return for a free drink. After the move was announced hotel occupancy by Britons fell by three per cent, but officials are undeterred even though they risk losing more tourists. At the time, elected officials said they would do whatever it takes to clean up Magaluf's image. This week, Jaime Martinez, the minister of tourism for the Balearic government, told local media that Magaluf would become a ‘mature tourist zone’ in time for next year’s tourist season. Government officials say Magaluf would become a ‘mature tourist zone’ in time for next year’s tourist season . That means public spaces will be ‘rehabilitated’ to eliminate public disorder and businesses which cater to holidaymakers, including bars and event organisers, have been given six months to submit plans explaining how they will modernise and conform to the new rules. Eugenia Frau, deputy minister of tourism for Calvia, said authorities will have ‘complete control’ to ensure that the doors of bars and discos close at midnight. Teresa Palmer, a local delegate for the Balearic government, said citizens are ‘horrified’ by the debauchery that has attracted worldwide attention. She said Magaluf is ‘not a lawless city’ and the rowdy behaviour is a result of ‘a problem of incivility and education’, Deia reported. In addition to public drunkenness, she said other problems reported by locals include drug use, robberies related to street prostitution and violence on party boats. Officials from the municipality of Calvia want to fly in British police officers to patrol the main tourist strip . She is asking Spain’s Civil Guard to deploy teams who specialise in handling large crowds to assist local officers. Last year, Magaluf brought in police from France and Germany to patrol the main tourist strip, and Ms Palmer said the patrols were effective because tourists showed more respect for officers from their homeland. Last year, 223 visitors from the UK were expelled from hotels, an increase of nearly 75 per cent from 2012, when 129 were forced out. As of July, 92 Britons have been kicked out of Magaluf hotels in 2014, according to the Palmanova-Magaluf Hotel Association. It is estimated that one million Britons a year visit the area, spending approximately £628m (€800m). Spain’s Civil Guard has been asked to provide teams who specialise in handling large crowds . Given all of the troubles with rowdy holidaymakers resorts are now starting to go out of their way to attract mature tourists, and Palma de Mallorca, just east of Magaluf, has implemented fines of up to £470 (€600) for bad behaviour. It is part of a trend that is sweeping across Spain as residents urge local governments to bring an end to drunken and sexually-charged tourists’ free-for-all. Earlier this year, the seafront town of Tossa de Mar, on Catalonia’s Costa Brava, banned stag and hen parties during the month of August and placed them under strict regulations throughout the rest of the year. Authorities will have ‘complete control’ to ensure that the doors of bars and discos close at midnight . The rules are aimed at party planners – not individual groups of visitors – who organise booze cruises, treasure hunts and other events. The town is taking action after locals complained about drunken and scantily-clad partygoers urinating in the street and singing loudly in the town’s squares in the early morning hours. On the outskirts of Barcelona, the picturesque fishing village of Barceloneta has become a popular stop for young tourists thanks to its all-night raves. Last August, furious locals held protests at blocks of flats rented to holidaymakers, with chants of ‘out, out, out drunken tourists’. The protests were organised after a photo posted online showed three naked Italian tourists running out of a supermarket.","Officials from the Mallorcan resort are fed up with drunken debauchery .

"The head master of one of the most exclusive schools in the U.S. has been arrested on child pornography charges. Christopher Wheeler faces 25 counts of child porn after a search of his Tower Hill school campus home and office in Delaware, and his private plane. The 53-year-old, who is also accused of abusing underage boys, turned himself in on Friday after police asked for the public's help in finding him. Arrested: Tower Hill head teacher Christopher Wheeler is facing charges of child pornography . The unmarried head teacher, who adopted a boy from a Russia in the 2000s, had not been heard of since moving out of the school after the October 22 investigation, according to Delaware Online. The headmaster, who presided over . Tower Hill's 750 pupils aged 3 to 18, was missing for two days before . turning himself in on Friday. A search of his house, office and private plane last month allegedly uncovered 25 explicit digital images of men engaged in sexual acts with young boys. The affidavit for the search alleged . that Mr Wheeler had also abused three boys, though Tower Hill school, . where parents pay up to $26,400 a year in tuition, was quick to distance . students from the investigation. Mr Wheeler has been charged with child pornography but no other charges relating to the allegations of abuse have been made. 'He is in custody. The Child Predator . Task Force made arrangements for him to turn himself in,' Jason Miller, . spokesman for the attorney generals office, said. Accusations: Christopher Wheeler allegedly admitted abusing a boy in a letter written to the victim . 'During the search, multiple computers and other digital media, along with other evidence, were seized,' Mr Miller told USA Today. 'A . forensic examination of the computers and digital media conducted by . the Delaware Child Predator Task Force recovered multiple images of . child pornography.' Officials . at the day school, one of the top 50 in the U.S., have not commented . about the arrest, but spokeswoman Nancy Schuckert said the school was . cooperating with authorities. In a statement sent to parents on Monday, trustee chairman Earl J. Ball III said: 'We are not aware of complaints about Dr Wheeler’s conduct while he was at Tower Hill.' Reassured: Tower Hill School says no complaints have been made so far about Wheeler during his time there . Exclusive: Tower Hill School in Delaware, where tuition costs up to $26,400 a year, hired Wheeler in 2004 . The head, whose adopted son Nikolai is a professional golfer, was taken on by the exclusive school in 2004. He had previously been assistant head of school and dean of admissions at Lake Forest Academy in Illinois. Tower Hill, whose alumni include TV personality Dr Oz and Senator Chris Coons, added that Mr Wheeler was 'thoroughly vetted' before being offered the $360,876 a year position. He is accused of abusing a minor for up to a year while living in Illinois, according to the investigation. The private pilot and composer also allegedly abused two adolescent boys in their Pennsylvania home about 30 years ago, when he was staying with their family. In July, Mr Wheeler allegedly admitted to the sexual abuse and apologized after receiving a letter from one of the alleged victims. 'These recent events have been . devastating, and I do not know that there is a good way to respond to . such a disturbing scenario,'Mr Ball wrote in his statement to parents at Tower Hill, as details of the case emerged. Investigation: Police allegedly found 25 images of men having sex with boys in Wheeler's Tower Hill home . Family: Christopher Wheeler's son and professional golfer Nikolai, who he adopted from Russia . The school, which halted its own investigation at the request of prosecutors, said it will resume its inquiry at a later date. Mr Wheeler's attorney, Thomas Foley, denied that the head teacher had fled from authorities despite a statement released on Thursday saying police were looking for him. After moving out of the head master's house Mr Wheeler stayed with family out of state, according to Mr Wheeler, who added: 'He was under no order by anyone to stay close by.' Mr Foley made arrangements for Mr Wheeler to hand himself on Friday, after hearing that he was wanted by authorities. The head teacher and composer, who used to work as dorm adviser in New York's St Paul's School in Garden City, is being held on $1.5 million bail as he waits for a preliminary hearing on Friday.","Tower Hill head teacher faces child porn charges .

"The parents of the man accused of murdering 12 people in a gun rampage at a movie theater have said their son does not deserve to be killed for his crimes. Robert and Arlene Holmes, whose son James is to face trial for a brutal 2012 shooting in Aurora, Colorado, also denied their son is a 'monster' on the grounds that he is mentally ill. They argued Holmes, who is also accused of injuring 70 people in the massacre at a screening of Batman film The Dark Knight Rises, should be allowed to plead guilty by reason of insanity and begin a life of treatment, rather than go on trial. Scroll down for video . Plea: Robert and Arlene Holmes, whose son James is accused of killing 12 people at a movie theater in Colorado, said he should not be killed if he is found guilty. The couple is pictured above inJuly . 'Not a monster': James Holmes, pictured in court in June 2013, ought to be institutionalized instead of killed, his parents said . Prosecutors are adamant Holmes should face the death penalty in front of an open court, which is due to select its jurors next month. Media have been given permission to televise the trial - which Holmes's parents argued could prove traumatic in a letter to The Denver Post. While they acknowledged that many of those affected 'would like to see our son killed', they said lifelong treatment would be 'best' for him. 'He is not a monster. He is a human being gripped by a severe mental illness,' they wrote. Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to charges of killing 12 people and injuring 70 in the 2012 attack at a movie theater in Aurora outside Denver. Jury selection is scheduled to start January 20. His parents, who live in Rancho Penasquitos, California, say they also would like to avoid a traumatic trial. One option would be a plea deal allowing him to plead guilty to the charges in exchange for life in prison without parole. 'If that happened, our son would be in prison the rest of his life, but no one would have to relive those horrible events at a trial the media has permission to televise,' they wrote. They say the best option for their son would be if he is sent to an institution for the mentally ill, which could happen if he is found not guilty by reason of insanity. Holmes' parents say they have spent every moment of the two years since the shooting thinking about the victims and their families and friends. 'We are always praying for everyone in Aurora. We wish that July 20, 2012 never happened,' they wrote. The letter is the first public comment by Holmes' parents about the shooting since some brief comments made through a lawyer immediately after the attack in which they also expressed support for him. They have not disclosed details of their son's condition or whether they had any warning that he might become violent. As the parents of James Holmes, we have spent every moment for more than two years thinking about those who were injured, and the families and friends of the deceased who were killed, in the theater shooting in Aurora. We are always praying for everyone in Aurora. We wish that July 20, 2012, never happened. Our son pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to the charges associated with these shootings. Defense attorneys for our son first stated in open court in May 2013 that James was diagnosed in Colorado with a serious mental illness. Prior to July 20, 2012, he never harmed anyone and he had no criminal history. We understand that if our son is found not guilty by reason of insanity, he could go to an institution that provides treatment for the mentally ill for the remainder of his life. This result would prevent any future harm to him and others. We realize treatment in an institution would be best for our son. We love our son, we have always loved him, and we do not want him to be executed. We also decry the need for a trial. A lengthy trial requires everyone to relive those horrible moments in time, causing additional trauma. In the criminal justice system, the prosecution and defense can agree to a sentence of life in prison, without parole, in exchange for a guilty plea. If that happened, our son would be in prison the rest of his life, but no one would have to relive those horrible events at a trial the media has permission to televise. We do not know how many victims of the theater shooting would like to see our son killed. But we are aware of people's sentiments. We have read postings on the Internet that have likened him to a monster. He is not a monster. He is a human being gripped by a severe mental illness. We believe that the death penalty is morally wrong, especially when the condemned is mentally ill. We are not alone in our sentiments. The Murder Victims' Families for Human Rights, an international organization of family members of murder victims and family members of the executed, and the National Alliance on Mental Illness formed the 'Prevention, Not Execution Project,' aimed at ending the death penalty for people with severe mental illness. Our family has not given interviews to the media because we do not want coverage of ourselves. We mourn the deaths and the serious injuries and emotional trauma of the others who were in the theater. The focus should be on the injured and their healing. Source: The Denver Post .","Robert and Arlene Holmes asked for mercy in letter to Colorado newspaper .

"It was once a Pontins Holiday Park filled with boisterous families, but this Norfolk centre has been left derelict. Haunting photos reveal the abandoned park six years after it finally closed for good. The former Pontins Holiday Park in Hemsby, Norfolk, played host to more than 2,400 guests in its heyday, but eventually closed to the public in 2008. Scroll down for video . Even the Queen Victoria pub is boarded up and eerily quiet since the site finally closed down six years ago . The family friendly centre once had everything a holidaymakers needed, from pools and sports courts to a pub for the grown-ups . An old go-kart attraction looks like it has seen better days as moss grows on the signs and grass covers the once tarmacked track . Now cottages, go-karting race tracks, games pitches and even the local pub are falling into ruin at the 20-acre site. The eerie images show how the once-popular ideal of holiday parks, which were launched in the 1940s and became a staple for families over the following 30 years, have quietly become less fashionable. Now the only visitors to the 'ghost town' are the wildlife that has moved in and the occasional urban explorer keen to re-visit the sense of forgotten holidays. The holiday cottages were once popular self-catering options for families looking for an affordable break in the UK . Locals have complained that the abandoned site has turned into an eyesore, but plans to turn it into a residential area have fallen through . Once the fashionable way to holiday, family-friendly parks have become less popular in the last three decades as international travel has become easier . Sports pitches where children once played and shouted have been left to become overgrown in the Norfolk centre . Pontins Holiday Parks were founded by Fred Pontin in 1946 and enjoyed huge success for decades, even launching the careers of TV stars. While Butlins workers were known as Red Coats, Pontins had its own Blue Coat entertainers. Even the cult British comedy movie Holiday On the Buses was filmed at the Pontins Holiday Park in Prestatyn. Stars from Bobby Davro and Shane Ritchie to Bradley Walsh launched their careers at Pontins, with former Steps singer Lisa Scott-Lee also crediting her days as a Blue Coast as the start of her entertaining career. A local who used to work at the site says it is the silence which is the strangest sensation as it was always a hive of activity . Pontins Holiday Parks were founded by Fred Pontin in 1946 and enjoyed huge success for decades but have fallen out of favour in recent years . The holiday parks were once cutting edge attractions, filled with entertainment for both adults and children, but few still remain open . The parks were sold off several times after 1978 with many closing as holidays abroad became more popular and now only six remain operational. The land agents for the Hemsby Holiday Park Northern Trust had hoped the site might be developed for residential use but there were objections from local residents and plans were withdrawn. It remains on the market for tourism and leisure use. Objections from locals over a plan to turn the park into a residential area have seen it stay on the market for tourism use . In the six years the attractions has been closed it has fallen into disrepair, suffering extensive damage and decay .

Pontins was once the ultimate holiday experience and even launched the careers of several TV stars who are still acting today . The famous Blue Coat entertainers were a favourite at Pontins, but now just six branded holiday parks remain open to the public . The overgrown remains of Pontinsin Hemsby serve as a reminder fo teh popular way to holiday between the 1940s and 1970s . Now the once cutting edge facilities have been left to rot, with locals daubing graffiti on walls and even in the empty pool . Pontins used to hold its own Star Search talent contests and several former workers went on to become TV stars and singers . One local who used to work at the camp at the height of it’s popularity said: ‘It’s hard to imagine this place was always packed with people having happy holidays. ‘What gets me most is the silence because it was always so noisy with kids laughing and screaming and everyone enjoying themselves. ‘The same families would come back year after year because they love it here so much. You wouldn’t believe it to look at it now. ‘Now we joke that it looks more like the set of an apocalypse zombie movie when all the people have disappeared.'

"Pakistani jets and ground forces killed 77 militants in a northwestern tribal region near the Afghan border, officials said on Friday, days after Taliban fighters killed 148 people — most of them children — in a school massacre. The military said its ground forces killed 10 militants while airstrikes killed another 17, including an Uzbek commander late on Thursday night. Another 32 alleged terrorists were killed by security forces in an ambush in Tirah valley in Khyber on Friday as they headed toward the Afghan border, the military said. On Friday morning, troops killed 18 more militants during a 'cordon and search operation' in Khyber, the military said. Scroll down for video . Retaliation: The Pakistani military killed 67 Taliban militants in air strikes and ground assaulkts in response to the school massacre atrocity . The military said the army chief, Gen. Raheel Sharif, was traveling to Khyber Friday to meet with troops taking part in the ground operation. Meanwhile, a Pakistani prosecutor said the government will try to cancel the bail granted to the main suspect in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks — a decision that outraged neighbouring India and called into question Pakistan's commitment to fighting militancy. The violence at a school in Pakistan's northwest earlier this week stunned the country and brought cries for retribution. In the wake of the mass killing the military has struck targets in the Khyber tribal region and approved the death penalty for six convicted terrorists. Macabre: Pakistani Frontier Corps personnel look at bodies of militants who were killed in a military operation in Tirah, near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border . Pakistani security forces killed at least 67 suspected militants  as operations against insurgents intensify in the wake of a Taliban school massacre that killed 149 people . On Friday morning, troops killed 18 more militants during a 'cordon and search operation' in Khyber, the military said. Khyber agency is one of two main areas in the northwest where the military has been trying to root out militants in recent months. Khyber borders Peshawar, where the school massacre happened, and militants have traditionally attacked the city before fleeing into the tribal region where police can't chase them. The other area is North Waziristan, where the military launched a massive operation in June. In the southern province of Baluchistan, Pakistani security forces killed a senior Pakistani Taliban leader along with seven of his associates in three separate pre-dawn raids, said a tribal police officer, Ali Ahmed.

Army chief Gen. Raheel Sharif  signed death warrants of six 'hard core terrorists' convicted and sentenced to death by military courts, the army said. It was unclear when the military planned to hang the six men, but authorities generally move quickly once death warrants are signed. Such executions are usually carried out at prisons under the supervision of army officers and then the bodies are handed over to relatives for burial. There was no information on the men or the crimes for which they were convicted. The news came after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday announced that he would lift a moratorium on executions in terrorism-related cases. The government has not yet carried out any executions. Evil: Taliban fighters who allegedly stormed an army-run school in Peshawar pose for a picture before carrying out the atrocity. The death warrants of six 'hard core terrorists' convicted and sentenced to death by military courts were also signed . Controversy: Meanwhile, a Pakistani prosecutor said the government will try to cancel the bail granted to Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi (centre), the main suspect in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks . The lifting of the moratorium was aimed at demonstrating the government's resolve. But the decision by an anti-terrorism court Thursday to grant bail to the main suspect in the Mumbai attack, Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi, called into question that commitment. Lakhvi is one of seven people on trial in Pakistan for the assault, but the trial has produced no results so far. It has been closed to the media. India reacted with outrage to news of Lakhvi's pending release. Special public prosecutor Abu Zar Peerzada said he would appeal to the High Court to cancel the bail and said Lakhvi had not yet been released.","148 people, mostly children, killed when Taliban fighters stormed school .

"Apple has come under fierce criticism for ditching Google Maps from its new operating system in favour of its own geographical app. Some users are fuming over the poor quality of the replacement maps, which have odd routes (via rivers), incorrect addresses (miles away) and preposterous images (feet is a measurement, not an appendage). But it has now emerged that the damage was entirely self-inflicted - Apple made a deliberate decision to dump Google, as the search giant is too much of a threat to its future business. Oops! The road to the Hoover Dam looks more like a roller coaster than a highway on Apple's new maps . Oui or Oy? The Eiffel Tower has become the leaning tower of Paris . The new Maps: With Google removed from the iPhone, users have been getting to grips with the new - but sometimes inaccurate - solution from Apple. At left, for example, Apple thinks 550 King St in Massachusetts is 250 'feet' away . Users were highly critical of Apple . Maps for iOS6 when it was released on Wednesday, complaining that there . were errors abound in the new application and it was 'pretty but dumb'. And when a senior tech executive was . asked by the Guardian whether the change was made by Apple itself or by . Google, the reply came: 'Duh - not Google.' Both companies have worked closely . together in developing Google Maps for the iPhone - a service which many . smartphone users have become heavily dependent on. But, since Google's Android operating . system Android is the main rival to iOS, Apple has been reluctant to . co-operate, and has now decided to go it alone when it comes to mapping . for the iPhone. The split had apparently been planned . for over a year - but when Apple got round to releasing its own map . software, the response was withering. Many users are now hoping to hang on . until Google makes a Maps app for iOS6 - as long as Apple does not block . the software from appearing on the App Store. Architecture? The Brooklyn Bridge has been rendered unwalkable! Squashed: Someone has sat on Indianapolis . Apple has decided to go it alone and . produce their own app, purchasing numerous mapping companies in the past . few years to prepare for the transition. They worked with Waze, TomTom and . other companies for the mapping data, but the venue search results will . rely heavily on Yelp's database, rather than Google's, and are thus . vastly inferior. While the new app has some improvements, it leaves a lot to be desired. Google's . popular Street View option is no longer available, replaced with .

'iPhone customers will suffer,' Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst at Forrester Research, said to Businessweek. 'Apple . believes that they can deliver a better experience for customers than .

For now, iPhone users will be able to reach Google Maps through a mobile Web browser. TomTom has defended the product saying that as more people use it, it will improve. TomTom defended the integrity of the . map software, saying it provided only the data, and was not responsible . for how Apple used it within the app. A . spokesman said: 'The user experience is determined by adding additional . features to the map application such as visual imagery. 'User experience fully depends on the choices these manufacturers make.' 'We . are confident about our map quality, as selling 65 million portable . navigation devices across the world and more than 1.4m TomTom apps for . iPhone in the past two years reaffirms this quality.' Side By Side: Apple users hoping to find this comic book store will need some good luck . Where? The TCF Bank Stadium in Minnesota must have grown legs .

'Here in Manhattan, where I live, basic search by building names is profoundly degraded in Apple's maps search. ""Bloomberg"" doesn't find the Bloomberg Tower; on Google Maps it's the first result.' He continued: 'Searching for its address ""731 Lexington Avenue"" yields that address on Lexington Avenue in Brooklyn. It's fine to think that perhaps I wanted the address in Bed-Stuy, but even appending ""NY, NY"" or ""Manhattan, NY"" still yields the Brooklyn address. Google maps has none of these comprehension issues.' The final verdict? 'Apple's made a new product that actually is pretty but dumb,' he said.

"With holiday travel upon us, many jet-setters will be venturing to new and distant locales over the upcoming winter months. But with these exotic destinations and once-in-a-lifetime experiences may also come a very real fear of unknowingly falling victim to a dreaded travel scam. Whether it's a taxi driver attempting to overcharge your fare or an airport tag-team stealing belongings at security checkpoint, Cheapflights.co.uk has highlighted the seven most common travel scams - and how to avoid them. Heading stateside? Fake wake-up calls are of particular concern and it's not uncommon for an unsuspecting hotel guest to receive a late-night call from a caller pretending to be from the hotel front desk, asking for credit card information. In such an instance, hang up - and call the front desk yourself to confirm that it was really them and not a prisoner using a smuggled cell phone. For those taking a quick weekend break to Eastern Europe, be on the look out for fake plain clothes police officers with semi-legitimate looking badges and be sure not to fall victim to the infamous 'baby toss.' A scheme used by groups of panhandlers or beggars, a woman will toss something toward you that vaguely resembles a swaddled baby. Before a tourist can realise that the 'baby' is really just a doll, the group has already made off with money or valuables. Keep in mind, however, that these horror stories aren't meant to scare - instead, they are cautionary tales to encourage holidaymakers to be vigilant and aware of those who may look to take advantage. Cheapflights.co.uk spokesperson Oonagh Shiel said: 'Highly-organised tourist cams play on travellers' trusting nature, their lack of local knowledge and desire to save a bit of cash.' 'Often, victims don't realise they've been caught out until it's too late. Even the most seasoned traveller may be targeted in unfamiliar surroundings, so minimise risk by keeping your passport secure, your belongings close to your body, and by leaving all unnecessarily expensive items at home. 'Our key piece of advice is to keep your wits about you at all times,' she added.","Even experienced travellers may fall victim in unfamiliar surroundings .

"A former party-lover has given up cocktails, cigarettes and burlesque dancing and converted to Islam after falling for a Muslim man nine years her junior. Mother-of-three Claire Birkill, 37, from Nottingham, overhauled her lifestyle after a trip to Gambia in January where she met fiance, Sarif Jallow, 28. In her days of burlesque dancing, she would parade around in nothing but knickers and nipple tassels. Claire Birkill, left, now Jameela, has changed her ways as well her her name after converting to Islam, right . Ashamed: The mother-of-three now regrets pictures like this from her days as a burlesque dancer . But since converting, she now covers up in a hijab and says she is ashamed she was once such an exhibitionist. She's also changed her name by deed poll to Jameela. She said: 'Before I enjoyed weekly burlesque classes. I would strip down to silky corsets and do sexy dances. Now I'm so ashamed of my past, I can barely look at old photos. I feel like I've been reborn.' Jameela, who has three children aged six, 16, and 18, met her fiance, Sarif, following the breakdown of her first marriage and said it was love at first sight. She explained: 'My eight-year marriage broke down in 2013 around the time I decided to study tourism at college.' As part of the course last January, she travelled to the Gambia, West Africa, where she met Sarif. 'He was a teacher and nine years younger than me but it was love at first sight,' Jameela said. 'He was so intelligent and kind. On the last day of the trip in March he told me he loved me. 'As I left the airport I cried and cried for three hours straight.' Party animal: Jameela used to love going out drinking before converting to Islam . Changed her life: Now she's happier and healthier after meeting Sarif, right, who proposed in March . Back home, Jameela, then still Claire, spoke to Sarif on the phone every night and he proposed weeks later. She used to be a Methodist but after listening to Sarif talk about his religion, she decided to research it on the internet and 'immediately felt a connection'. She said. 'It's about peace, empathy, love and kindness, all things I believe in. I realised I needed to become a Muslim.' She converted in a special ceremony in June and changed her name to one that's traditionally Muslim. She has not asked her children to convert, leaving them to make their own decisions on whether they want to follow a path of religion. She also began observing Ramadan, explaining: 'It's a month-long period of prayer, fasting, charity-giving and self accountability for Muslims. It was difficult but incredibly fulfilling. Romantic thoughts are forbidden during Ramadan, so I banned myself from talking to Sarif in daylight hours because I got too turned on by his voice.' It's a far cry from her former hedonistic lifestyle. As a young woman, she had a weakness for cigarettes and alcohol and was often promiscuous. She said: 'Before becoming a mum I'd think nothing about bringing a man home after a night out. Normally it was alcohol-induced but I'd never do it now. Long distance love: The couple will initially live apart as Sarif works as a teacher in Gambia and Jameela doesn't want to pull her youngest son out of school in the UK . 'I used to smoke 40-a-day too. I was like a chimney and nearly always had a cigarette in my hand. I can't imagine smoking now, ruining my body.' She added: 'I used to get through at least a bottle of gin a week too. I was a huge G&T fan and would relax with a few in the evenings. That was just a normal week. 'If I went out with the girls, I'd drink more. I loved cocktails and would work my way through the menus in bars. 'The next morning I'd feel terrible and would waste the day feeling sorry for myself. When I think of how I behaved, I'm so ashamed.' She's also now given up her hobby of burlesque dancing, which she started in 2012 after signing up for classes at a local dance studio. 'I wanted to improve my body confidence. I would perform routines, starting off fully dressed and ending up in just silky pants and nipple tassels,' she explained. 'I'd never dream of doing it now. 'Looking at pictures of me in a pink silk basque I see it is very un-Islamic. Islam believes a woman's body is just for her husband.' Mocked: Not everyone has been supportive of Jameela's decision to chance religion . The way she eats and dresses on a daily basis has changed dramatically too. 'I travel ten miles to ensure I only buy Halal meat from a specialist butcher. I used to joke ""don't wake me up in the morning unless bringing me a bacon butty and coffee"" – I'd never say that now. 'Giving up bacon has been the hardest thing but Halal prohibits it. 'I always cover my legs as requested to by Islam. I found the headscarf quite restrictive at first. But now I wear it tighter because I want to.' Jameela said Sarif was 'heartbroken' when she told him about her past but she said: 'He knows how committed I am now and believes I've changed.' Sarif is still living in Gambia and the couple will continue to have a long distance relationship after they marry because Jameela does not want to disrupt her youngest son's education. Given up alcohol: The mother used to get through at least a bottle of gin a week . 'After the wedding we will live apart. Because of the age of my youngest son, I won't take him out of school, so I can't leave the UK,' she said. Jameela said she's never been happier since meeting Sarif and changing her religion but the decision has cost her a number of friends. She is often mocked or abused when she goes out in public wearing a hijab. She said: 'Some friends don't want to know me anymore and others are refusing to call me by my new name.

"Islamic State has turned its hand to human organ trafficking to fund  terror across the Middle East, it has been claimed. The jihadist group has until now filled its $2million-a-year war chest from a variety of shadowy sources including oil production, human trafficking and drug smuggling. But it was revealed today that it has been recruiting foreign doctors for months to harvest the internal organs not only from the bodies of their own dead fighters but also from living hostages - including children - snatched from minority communities in Iraq and Syria. Scroll down for video . Lucrative: The terror organisation even set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market . Evil: The jihadist group has until now filled its $2million-a-year war chest through a variety of shadowy sources including oil production, human trafficking and drug smuggling. The shocking news was revealed in a report by al-Monitor news website, citing an Iraqi ear, nose and throat doctor named Siruwan al-Mosuli. He told the site that IS commanders have hired foreign doctors to run an extensive organ trafficking system from a hospital in the captured city of Mosul, northern Iraq, that is already beginning to generate huge profits. It claims the terror organisation has even set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market. '[Al-Mosuli] said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors,' the report's author wrote. 'Information then leaked about organ selling.' Shocking: But it was revealed today that it has been recruiting foreign doctors for months to harvest the internal organs not only from the bodies of their own dead fighters but also from living hostages - including children - snatched from minority communities in Iraq and Syria . Black market: The report claims the terror organisation has even set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market . The report went on: 'Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.' Most of the organs are then smuggled out of Syria and Iraq into neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia or Turkey where criminal gangs sell them on to shady buyers across the globe, the Assyrian International News Agency reported. While organ harvesting may be the most shocking of IS' revenue streams, the report highlights a string of others that contribute to the group's $2million annual income. One tactic is smuggling families and individuals into other countries. The report highlights one instance when a family paid ISIS over $8,000 per individual to sneak them into Turkey. Drugs in Europe: IS' drug business has become so successful in recent months that the Russian Federal Drug Control Service claims that IS now supplies half of Europe's entire heroin market . Drug smuggling is another. Al Monitor's report claims that IS traffics Afghan heroin into Europe from the city of Nineveh, which the Russian Federal Drug Control Service (RFDCS) says is generating 'significant revenues.' Its drug business has become so successful in recent months that the RFDCS claims that IS now supplies half of Europe's entire heroin market. 'The large-scale movement of Afghan heroin acts as an ongoing financial base aiding the functioning of the Islamic State, which secures huge profits by providing half of the total heroin supplied to Europe via destabilized Iraq and some African heroin, which is sent from Iraq to Europe,' the Russian Federal Drug Control Service issued in a statement. However, crude oil still remains IS' biggest earner, pulling in more then $1million per day as it is produced from oil refineries captured in besieged towns.","IS is hiring foreign doctors to harvest organs in hospitals in Iraq and Syria .

"A babysitter in Upstate New York bashed her five-year-old cousin in the head and strangled him to death before throwing his body over a guardrail into a ditch and covering it with snow on Thursday, police have revealed. Tiffany Vanalstyne, 19, then allegedly called police to made up a story about little Kenneth White being kidnapped by two masked men in an effort to cover her tracks - sending authorities on a desperate search across Albany County, New York to find the boy. 'I'm angry that we had a five-year-old killed and basically thrown away like a piece of trash. It's sinful and it's sad,' Sheriff Craig Apple, who was visibly shaken by the horrific murder, said today. Kenneth was brutally murdered Thursday afternoon as his twin sister Cheyenne and little sister Christine were playing in another room in the trailer where they lived in rural Knox, New York, police say. Scroll down for video . Horrific: Tiffany Vanalstyne, 19, strangled her cousin, 5-year-old Kenneth White, and then bashed him in the head until he was dead, police say . Vanalstyne showed no emotion as she was led into court on Friday to be arraigned on a charge of second-degree murder. Police haven't commented on a motive . Kenneth's body was found just 40 yards from the trailer where he lived in rural Knox, New York, outside Albany. He had been thrown into a ditch and his body covered with snow . Vanalstyne was charged with second-degree murder today. Her mother Brenda Vanalstyne told a judge that her daughter suffers from bipolar disorder, which she takes medication for. Authorities have refused to comment on a possible motive for the murder. Kenneth, Cheyenne, Christine were being cared for by their aunt Brenda after both their mother and father lost custody of the children. They lived with  Brenda Vanalstyne for for more than a year and she had been granted legal custody about nine moths ago. The mother of the children lives 25 miles away in Amsterdam, New York. Their father lives in Massachusetts. Authorities described conditions inside the red-and-white striped as dangerous and are working to make sure Kenneth's two sisters never return there. Police say that after a doctor's appointment on Thursday, Brenda Vanalstyne dropped the three White children and at home and left her daughter Tiffany to babysit them. Tiffany Vanalstyne killed Kenneth just minutes after Brenda left the home on Thursday afternoon, authorities believe. She then took his body down the road and threw it into a ditch. She covered it with snow to ensure it couldn't be seen by passing cars, police say. After the murder, Tiffany Vanalstyne called her mother and told her that Kenneth had been kidnapped by two masked men who barged into the trailer and pinned her to the ground. Brenda, who was just minutes from home, told her daughter to call 911. Tiffany showed no remorse when she was interviewed by detectives. She glared at reporters as she was led into court . Left in charge: Kenneth and his two sisters were placed in the custody of their aunt Brenda Vanalstyne (right) a year ago. Her daughter Tiffany (left) is charged with murdering Kenneth after she was left in charge . Horrific: Kenneth White, 5, was dumped in a ditch and covered with snow about 40 yards from the trailer where he lived . Hoax: The boy's babysitter told police he had been kidnapped by masked men, prompting a massive search and an Amber Alert. Police later determined that story to be false . On Friday police blocked off the road near where Kenneth was found murdered . Police immediately initiated an Amber Alert and launched a massive search for a black pickup truck that Vanalstyne described as the getaway vehicle. State police, the US Marshals and the FBI joined local officers in in the hunt, which began about 1.30pm. Sheriff Apple said that as they continued to question Vanalstyne about the kidnapping her story began to fall apart - she was inconsistent and many of the details didn't make sense. The search for Kenneth and the mysterious black truck continued, but detectives began to investigate Vanalstyne, as well. Shortly before midnight, a police dog made the grim discovery. Kenneth's body was buried in snow about 40 yards down the road from the trailer. Sheriff Apple said the horrific Christmastime murder has rattled even veteran detectives on his police force. His eyes welled with tears at a pretty conference today as he described how he was going to go home and hug his three sons.

"Prince Harry, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie were among the guests today, as Glasses Direct founder Jamie Murray Wells married his long-term girlfriend, barrister Lottie Fry. The traditional country wedding took place at Dorchester Abbey and saw guests, among them Ben Fogle and his wife Marina, descend on the pretty Oxfordshire village of Dorchester-on-Thames. But it was the royal contingent that drew the most glances, with Princess Beatrice, once again showing off her increasingly chic sense of style, stealing the show in her £910 pale blue wool coat by French label, Carven. Scroll down for video . Helping out: Prince Harry helps to usher a pair of adorable little bridesmaids, both sporting angel wings, into the pretty church . Stay put! Neither appeared to want to be ushered anywhere but the prince persisted - and eventually succeeded . Ready for the day: Prince Harry arrives for the wedding sporting a white rose in his buttonhole . Last minute preparation: Harry is recently returned from Lesotho, where he visited projects run by his charity, Sentebale . The happy couple: Jamie Murray Wells and his new bride leave the church (left) and right, the former Miss Lottie Fry arrives with her father . Harry, 30, was dapper in morning dress, while Princess Eugenie opted for a wool-tweed coat, a pared-down charcoal wool dress, a neat pair of black court shoes and a cream cocktail hat by milliner Juliette Botterill. But even Beatrice and Eugenie's fashion sense couldn't compete, when Harry turned babysitter for the afternoon, helping out with a pair of angelic little bridesmaids - much to everyone's delight. Mr Murray Wells, 31, is a long-standing friend of both Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and advised Kate during her abortive attempt to start a fashion retail business prior to her 2011 marriage. Now with a turnover in excess of £40m a year, Glasses Direct, which was founded while Mr Murray Wells was still a student, is one of the most successful online businesses in Britain. As a result, its founder has garnered numerous accolades, among them the CBI's Growing Business gong, the Shell Livewire award and the Daily Mail's Enterprising Young Brit prize. Mr Murray Wells was also handed a prestigious Queen's Award for his hard work in 2009 and is a volunteer mentor to aspiring entrepreneurs for the Prince's Trust. Scrubs up well! Prince Harry was dapper in morning dress, which he enlivened with a chequered blue tie and yellow waistcoat . Tough job: Harry appears to be having trouble with his buttonhole as he makes his way towards the church . Looking good: Princess Beatrice, who was stylish in a £910 Carven coat, arrived at the wedding with her sister Princess Eugenie . Busy time: Harry is fresh from a visit to Lesotho, where he visited projects being run by his HIV/AIDS charity, Sentebale . Former flame: Astrid Harbord, who is allegedly a former girlfriend of Prince Harry, was also among wedding guests . But despite his business success, it is his network of high profile friends that have garnered him the most headlines. Many, including Thomas Inskip, Harry Aubrey Fletcher and Jack Mann were also at the wedding, as was James Meade - another close friend of both William and Harry. Other guests included Prince William's former girlfriend Olivia Hunt and Astrid Harbord who is allegedly a former flame of Prince Harry's. Indeed, so well connected is Mr Murray Wells, he this year made it onto the Tatler List - the society bible's guide to the movers and shakers at the top end of British society. As well as describing his many business achievements, the newlywed's entry describes him as being a member of the 'Gloucestershire royal posse' and a 'thoroughly nice' person. 'He hunts with the Beauforts,' his entry continues, 'parties with Guy Pelly in Ibiza and has a chauffeur-driven Bentley. Thoroughly nice and a good shot, his favourite jumper is a green V-neck.' Another person who is partial to a green V-neck is Prince William, who, with his brother, will be among the royals to descend on the Queen's Norfolk estate, Sandringham, next week. Harry, who is fresh from a flying visit to Lesotho, and William will be among the group who make their way to the Church of St Mary Magdalene for the traditional Christmas Day service, along with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. The Queen has already arrived at the Norfolk estate, which has been owned by the royal family since 1852, and was pictured getting off the train at Kings Lynn station yesterday.

Fellow guests: Prince William's ex girlfriend Olivia Hunt (left) was also at the service, as was long-time friend James Meade (right) It is also from Sandringham that the Queen's annual Christmas speech is broadcast, usually uncontroversially, although this year looks set to change all that. Bookies, among them William Hill and Coral, have suspended betting on the Queen revealing abdication plans in this year's speech. Although Buckingham Palace sources have previously said the Queen will never step down, betting was halted following a flurry of surprise wagers. 'Throughout the year there has been major speculation about the Queen's future but the gamble has really caught us by surprise,' said Coral's Nicola McGeady. 'As far as we are concerned there's no smoke without fire when bets like this come through all in succession, so we have decided to be safe rather than sorry and pull the plug on the market.' A Palace spokesman refused to comment, but did point to the pledges made by the Queen in her 21st birthday speech in 1947. Then, the Queen said: 'I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.' Confidantes: Model Katie Readman (left) is friends with Cressida Bonas while Jack Mann (right) is a close friend of Prince Harry . Ready for Christmas: The Queen arrived to begin her Christmas break at Sandringham in Norfolk yesterday . In her June 1953 Coronation Day speech, she also said: 'I have in sincerity pledged myself to your service, as so many of you are pledged to mine.' Although it is rare for British monarchs to step aside, with Edward VIII the only monarch to do so, the practice is considerably more common in Europe, where no less than four have stood down in the last two years. 2013 was the busiest year for abdications, with Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, King Albert II of Belgium and Pope Benedict XVI all stepping down. The following Spring, King Juan-Carlos of Spain, 76, announced plans to step down on the grounds that 'I don't want my son to grow old waiting like Prince Charles'. He formally abdicated on the 18th June, making him the fourth European monarch to do so in less than a year. Despite the flurry of abdications, the Queen has always stated that she has no plans to do the same, despite being older than all of the four. One monarch who may yet do so is Denmark's Queen Margrethe, 74, who has been on the Danish throne for 42 years and has an heir, Crown Prince Frederik, of the same age as 46-year-old King Felipe. However, despite claims in an Australian magazine that an announcement is imminent, sources close to the Danish queen have said she has no intention of stepping down and described the reports as 'all lies'.

"It opened to great fanfare promising spectacular views across London, but the first guests of the Shangri-La in The Shard got rather more than they bargained for. A design fault appeared to give the ultimate 'peeping Tom' view into other rooms, with guests complaining about unwanted sights and the Shangri-La hastily erecting some modesty blinds. So perhaps it is unsurprising that the luxury hotel on The Shard's 34th to 52nd floors has been voted the worst hotel opening of 2014 by expert reviewers at Luxury Travel Intelligence. The global members organisation put together its ultimate list of the best and worst hotel openings of 2014, with London accommodation taking the top spot in both lists. While the Shangri-La at The Shard was voted worst, with the capital's boutique hotel Han Yard taking third place, the independent Beaumont hotel in London's Mayfair was praised for its Art Deco-inspired rooms and perfect service and took first place for the best hotel opening of the year. Andy Murray's Cromlix House was also praised by the organisation, taking 10th place in the best hotel openings list and praised for creating 'a stand out country house hotel experience, enhanced by warm and caring staff, who are mostly locals.' So, who else got it right this year and who got it  wrong? Here we give you the best and worst new luxury hotels of 2014..... The worst of the lot: A design fault at Shangri-La means guests can look into neighbouring rooms . Best of the best: The Beaumont in London opened in September and was deemed 'perfect' by LTI's experts . THE BEST . 1. Beaumont, London . Opened by Chris Corbin and Jeremy King, famed for their dining empire including London's The Wolseley, the Beaumont was their long-awaited foray into the hotel world. LTI said it was no surprise that the hotel opening was pushed back several times, so that everything would be perfect. And experts concluded that 'perfect it is'. They said: 'In fact it feels like it has been there forever, and the Art Deco inspired rooms and suites are warm and welcoming. The Colony Grill Room is outstanding and deservedly one of the hottest reservations in town.' The Club Lounge of The Beaumont. The hotel came first in the list of best new luxury hotel openings of 2014 . Entrance Lobby, The Beaumont: Hotel's opening was pushed back  to ensure everything was perfect . 2. Portrait, Florence . This luxury boutique hotel has unbeatable views of the Ponte Vecchio. And LTI loved the huge rooms and suites. Couture shoemakers Salvatore Ferragamo own it – and the family have poured heart, soul and money into what is a wonderful property. Portrait in Florence: This luxury boutique hotel has unbeatable views of the Ponte Vecchi . Andy Murray's Cromlix hotel was praised for its country atmosphere and charming local staff, putting it in 10th place . Third place: Lowes Regency Hotel  had a lengthy refurbishment but is an iconic property in a superb location . 1.) Beaumont, London . 2.) Portrait, Florence . 3.) Loews Regency, New York . 4.) Four Seasons, Moscow . 5.) Maalifushi, Maldives . 6.) Cape Weligama, Sri Lanka . 7.) Raffles, Istanbul . 8.) Four Seasons, Dubai (Jumeirah Beach) 9.) Waldorf Astoria, Amsterdam . 10.) Cromlix House, Scotland . *According to research by LTI (Luxury Travel Intelligence) 3. Loews Regency, New York . OK, so this is not really a new hotel as such – but the lengthy and well-executed refurbishment has revealed a property that is new in many regards. This iconic property still offers a superb location and some of the largest rooms and suites in the city. The experts love the lighter, cleaner lines of the décor. 4. Four Seasons, Moscow . As Four Seasons continue their prolific global expansion, it would be easy for the brand (and LTI) to become a little blasé. But they rarely put a foot wrong. Here, they have created a wonderful, warm and luxurious hotel in a stunning location. It’s a shame that they couldn’t get the spa (set to be one of the best in Moscow) ready in time for the opening – an oversight, which marks them down in our books. 5. Maalifushi, Maldives . A little isolated, compared to most of the top resorts, and on a tiny piece of atoll real estate, just 800 metres by 200 metres, thereby delivering a real Maldives experience. Wonderful island chic accommodations, a great spa and plentiful in/on water activities make this our new favourite Maldives destination. Fourth: Four seasons in Moscow 'rarely put a foot a wrong' and have created a 'warm and luxurious hotel' Fifth: Maalifushi in Maldives has 'chic accommodations' and a 'great spa' as well as water activities . 1.) Shangri-La, London . 2.) SLS, Las Vegas . 3.) Ham Yard, London . 4.) Park Hyatt, New York . 5.) ME, Ibiza . 6.) ME, Mallorca . 7.) One and Only, Hayman Island . 8.) The Brando, French Polynesia . 9.) Peninsula, Paris . 10.) Waldorf Astoria, Dubai . *According to research by LTI (Luxury Travel Intelligence) THE WORST . 1. Shangri-La, London . What views! We're not talking about the amazing London skyline stretched out below you from your room – but, rather, those direct views into neighbouring rooms. And when you can see them, you know they can see you too... This disastrous design fault has already been well documented by the global media, but we have witnessed it first hand on two occasions and it is very disconcerting. The hotel’s solution has been to fit blinds, but then you are in just another hotel room, which completely erodes the whole purpose of staying here, in one the tallest building in Europe, as room décor and size is only on par with the average London 4/5 star hotel. 2. SLS, Las Vegas . SLS Miami failed to impress us, but after three days at SLS Las Vegas we would have returned to the Miami location in a heartbeat. There is so much wrong here – including poor location, poor management and many of the hotel’s dining and entertainment options failing to draw the crowds, meaning shutdowns (or limited opening hours). Second worst: SLS  was deemed to have a 'poor location, poor management' and fails to 'draw the crowds' Many of SLS's dining and entertainment options failed to 'draw the crowds' meaning limited opening hours . 3. Ham Yard, London . We are long-standing fans of the wonderful hotels created by Tim and Kit Kemp. But this one sadly falls well short of their usual high standards. It has a feel of a pop up and appears unfinished and lacking in warmth and character. The overall exterior look is very corporate and jars with the unique character of Soho. In time it could blossom – and if anyone can achieve this it is the Kemp duo. They have their work cut out on this occasion. 4. Park Hyatt, New York . There is much to like about this property, but after three visits we have one important issue, which seems to have gone unaddressed (so far) – and that is noise levels. Traffic and construction noise, from insufficient glazing, is a major design flaw at this 24-hour location – with huge implications. Fourth worst: Despite having much to like, experts thought Park Hyatt was noisy from 'insufficient glazing' 5. ME, Ibiza . The ME brand disappoints yet again. We have real issues here with poor management, service and food. And we are also surprised at how such a major financial investment could be followed by such low standards.","LTI Luxury Travel Intelligence sent experts to grade all  new luxury hotels .
Best new property was The Beaumont in London, second was Portrait .
Worst hotel was Shangri-La in London as guests can see into other rooms .

"Embattled real estate mogul Tim Blixseth was taken away in handcuffs on Thursday after a federal judge ordered the onetime billionaire jailed until he accounts for millions of dollars he owes his creditors. Blixseth's lawyers said they were uncertain how long it would take for them to come up with the answers sought by the court, meaning he could remain in jail for some time. The incarceration of the 64-year-old Blixseth marks a dramatic turn in his six-year legal struggle against accusations that he illegally drained more than $200 million from Montana's Yellowstone Club, the ultra-luxury resort that Blixseth created with his former wife near Yellowstone National Park. Tim Blixseth (pictured in 2009) real estate mogul Tim Blixseth was taken away in handcuffs on Thursday after a federal judge ordered the onetime billionaire jailed until he accounts for millions of dollars he owes his creditors . Before he was taken into custody, Blixseth spent more than two hours on the witness stand trying to explain what happened to a just a fraction of that money — $13.8 million in proceeds from the sale of another property that he owned in Mexico. A clearly-exasperated U.S. District Judge Sam Haddon said Blixseth had offered no proof to back up claims that he spent all the money. The judge rejected as insufficient the hundreds of pages of financial records presented by Blixseth's attorneys. Many of those documents were in Spanish and had been submitted just two days before Thursday's long-scheduled hearing. 'You are missing the boat here,' Haddon told Blixseth's attorneys at one point. 'The whole of this man's presentation is substantively based on hearsay.' He later said Blixseth appeared to have made a deliberate effort 'to thwart or delay compliance with a court order.' After finding Blixseth in contempt of court, Haddon said the Washington state resident will remain jailed until he can provide a full accounting of the money. Haddon also held open the possibility of further sanctions but gave no specifics. Blixseth showed little reaction as Haddon handed down his order. The incarceration of the 64-year-old Blixseth marks a dramatic turn in his six-year legal struggle against accusations that he illegally drained more than $200 million from Montana's Yellowstone Club . Moments later, two U.S. Marshals asked Blixseth to hand over his wallet, belt, watch and tie before they placed him in handcuffs and led him away. Blixseth attorney Michael Ferrigno said many of the documents that could show where the money went are in Mexico, with no easy way for them to be retrieved. 'We are really in a tight spot,' Ferrigno said. 'The judge is taking this seriously, and we are, too.' Attorneys for his creditors had asked in recent court filings for Blixseth to be jailed. That came after they had been repeatedly stonewalled by Blixseth on the issue for more than a year, obtaining only 'bits and pieces' of what happened to the money from the Mexico property, according to Charles Hingle, an attorney for the Yellowstone Club Liquidating Trust, which represents the Yellowstone Club's creditors. Hingle declined comment after Thursday's court hearing in Butte. Haddon last year found Blixseth in contempt of court for selling the property in Mexico in defiance of another judge's instructions. Blixseth delayed potential court sanctions for more than 10 months with an unsuccessful appeal to the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. The case stems from the 2008 bankruptcy of the Yellowstone Club, a private ski and golf resort with a membership that has included Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and former Vice President Dan Quayle. The case stems from the 2008 bankruptcy of the Yellowstone Club, a private ski and golf resort with a membership that has included Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and former Vice President Dan Quayle . The club emerged from bankruptcy in 2009 under new ownership. Its creditors have spent the years since trying to collect on $241 million in civil judgments from courts that ruled Blixseth fraudulently drained money from the club for his and ex-wife Edra's personal use. Business Insider reported in October that the club was a favorite site among both extreme athletes and the extremely wealthy. To join you have to purchase property on the grounds, with a price tag anywhere between $2 million to $26 million for a ranch. The clubhouse is also available for those who don't want to own a house there. Besides the copious amenities and gorgeous views of the slopes, there's also cutting-edge luxury brands available. Golfer Phil Mickelson shipped several $800 luxury Italian helmets to the club last year that gave their wearers the ability to plug their phones into a speak built into the helmet. That would be a popular item with the high-powered Wall Street traders often found on a ski run. Blixseth claims attorney fees and other expenses consumed all of the $13.8 million he received from the 2011 sale of the Tamarindo resort, which included hotels and condominiums in the state of Jalisco. He originally paid $40 million for the property. Judges have broad discretion in how they police those who come into their courtrooms for civil proceedings, including sending them to jail.","Tim Blixseth was taken away in handcuffs on Thursday after a federal judge ordered the onetime billionaire jailed until he accounts for millions of dollars he owes his creditors .

"Mercedes-Benz New York Fashion Week is being forced to leave Lincoln Center's Damrosch Park after its February 2015 shows. The biannual event, which has been at the 2.4-acre space since leaving Bryant Park four years ago, has been court-ordered to leave in a pre-trial settlement, reports CBS News. The plaintiffs in the case - various community groups - argued that Fashion Week and other events held there violated the New York State Public Trust Doctrine, which states that city-owned spaces cannot be privatized. Though the park is managed by and adjacent to Lincoln Center, it is still New York property. So long, Fashion Week! The biannual event will have to find a new home after its February 2015 shows . 'We're going to get flowers and benches and there's going to be a park again,' said Olive Freud, the president of one of the groups who filed the lawsuit. 'We're all very happy here. 'We objected to the whole idea of demolishing a park and of throwing the public out and of making this a place for raising money. Private people aren't supposed to be making money on it.' According to blog A Walk in the Park, 57 trees and countless plants were destroyed to make way for events in the park, and all will have to be replanted as part of the settlement. Descendants of Walter Damrosch, the long-time conductor of the New York Symphony Orchestra and for whom the park is named, are also satisfied with the agreement. 'I was horrified to learn about the demise of Damrosch Park,' said Sidney Urquhart, his granddaughter. 'It is ironic that a family of German immigrants, who brought so much to the musical life of this city and this country have been pushed aside by a German manufacturer of flashy cars.' The well-heeled masses will have to head elsewhere! Though it's been suggested Fashion Week will eventually end up at Culture Shed when it opens in 2018, it's unclear where the 8-day event will be held in the meantime . It has yet to be determined where Fashion Week - an eight-day spectacle where the who's who of fashion editors and buyers go to see designers' latest creations - will go after its last shows at Lincoln Center in February. New York's former mayor Michael Bloomberg has suggested that the event could eventually move to Culture Shed, an under-construction event space that is part of the Hudson Yards development on the far west side of Manhattan. The six-story building, however, isn't slated to be open until 2018. In the meantime, designers may have to get creative about where they hold their shows - which more and more of them have been doing lately anyway. Of the more than 300 shows during the week, less than 100 were held at Lincoln Center in recent years. Many designers have opted for spaces that allow them greater creative freedom and a slower turnaround (at Lincoln Center and Bryant Park, shows are stacked back-to-back, forcing designers to clean up and move out at an alarming pace) - not to mention a cheaper price-tag. Lincoln Center's Fashion Week venues cost between $15,000 and $60,000 to rent, cites Fashionista. Those costs - along with publicity, models, stylists, and a host of other show necessities - make $200.000 'a reasonable amount' to expect to spend for a show.","The eight-day style spectacle has been court-ordered to leave after its February 2015 shows .

"A 63-year-old retired man in California has been charged with the 1989 stabbing death of a transgender woman at her home. Police say Douglas Gutridge, 37 at the time, killed 35-year-old Carla Salazar in Santa Ana. He spoke to detectives in the aftermath of the crime — and while DNA evidence linked him to the scene nearly six years ago, there wasn't enough evidence to file charges until a new cold case team stepped in. 'A case isn't just made on just forensic evidence,' said Chief Carlos Rojas, of the Santa Ana Police Department. Douglas Gutridge (left),63, has been arrested a quarter century after he allegedly stabbed to death 35-year-old Carla Salazar (right) at her home in Santa Ana, California . Christine McFadden (pictured), a friend of victim Carla Salazar, said she had given up on the justice system, but never gave up on Salazar, whom she loved like a sister . The motive for the killing is not clear, but investigators believe the pair had a brief, consensual relationship. Salazar was killed on June 28, 1989, and had been seen in an elevator with a man earlier that night evening. She was reported missing after missing work, and was found stabbed to death by a friend and her apartment manager, the Los Angeles Times reported. Gutridge was arrested last week and is being held on $1 million bail. He faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted. Gutridge (left) was first interviewed in the aftermath of the stabbing in 1989, but police didn't have enough evidence to charge him. Chief Carlos Rojas (right), of the Santa Ana PD, says a cold case taskforce has used new technology to re-examine crucial DNA evidence and get enough for an arrest . Close friend Christine McFadden (in red), was shaken up Thursday as she told reporters about Salazar's murder . One of Salazar's closest friends, Christine McFadden,she never thought they'd find a suspect, but learning an arrest had been made gave her hope. 'We gave up on the justice system but we never gave up on her,' she said. Gutridge is expected back in court on January 2.","California police say they have solved the 1989 stabbing death of Carla Salazar, a phone operator in Santa Ana who was killed in her own home .

"Just a 20 minute drive along the coast from the centre of Marbella lies the Kempinski Hotel Bahia - a five-star resort with all the class and style of the popular holiday city but, thankfully, without the gaudy reality TV stars swanning around like they own the place. Whether I was just fortunate enough to avoid the cast of The Only Way Is Essex during my visit to Hotel Bahia or whether they always opt for a more convenient location for the nightlife I can't be certain, but I suspect it's the latter. This particular property - one of more than 80 owned by Kempinski throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa - doesn't need to be right in the thick of things. In fact, that's the beauty of it. The outside of the Kempinski Hotel Bahia, which is situated near Estepona and Marbella on the Costa del Sol . An aerial view of the hotel and its spacious grounds which lead down towards an area of beach . Visitors can cool off in one of three outdoor pools, while there is also an indoor pool for the winter months . Monarch, the scheduled leisure airline, operates flights to Malaga from Birmingham, East Midlands, London Gatwick, London Luton and Manchester airports with fares, including taxes, starting from £32.99 one way . For further information or to book Monarch flights, Monarch Holidays or Monarch Hotels, please visit www.monarch.co.uk . During my stay I felt no desire to wander outside of the hotel grounds, which handily include their own section of beach. My feet could be on the sand within two minutes of closing my room door. Not bad, eh? The hotel is designed to provide guests with everything they need for the entirety of their stay - a choice of restaurants and bars, three outdoor pools and an indoor one, spa treatments and a sauna, a gym, tennis courts and water sports on the aforementioned beach. The only time I ventured away from the 147-room complex was to play two of the Costa del Sol's most popular golf courses - Finca Cortesin and La Reserva - which are just a couple of around 50 in the surrounding area. But more about that later. Numerous palm trees are reflected in one of the hotel's pools as the sun sets in southern Spain . The hotel's Cabana del Mar restaurant specialises in fresh seafood served the Adalusian way . One of the hotel's two bars (left) provides guests enjoying the sun with refreshments throughout the day . If you do fancy exploring southern Spain then the beautiful village of Estepona is less than two miles away. Day trips to Malaga, Seville, Granada and Cordoba are also an attractive option for those wanting to use the hotel as a base, rather than just a retreat. From the moment you walk through the large revolving doors and into the vast reception area it's clear that Kempinski pride themselves on quality. From the decoration of the hotel to the softness of the robe hanging on the back of each bathroom door, the service offered by each smiling member of staff to the taste of the fresh fish served in the beachside seafood restaurant. No wonder the vast majority of guest reviews found elsewhere online are overwhelmingly positive. I witnessed people of all ages enjoying the luxurious surroundings during my trip in mid-September - families with toddlers in tow, couples both young and old and groups of friends, some of which were using the hotel as their HQ to test out the plentiful fairways and greens of southern Spain. Our man Joe Strange poses outside the Kempinski Hotel Bahia after spending two days at the resort . The hotel backs directly onto an area of sandy beach which guests can enjoy peacefully . The sun beams down on the Kempinski hotel - one of more than 80 owned by the company worldwide . The hotel is 75km from Malaga airport, or more importantly about an hour's drive. Its location adds something extra to the plush grounds and top-of-the-range facilities - beautiful views of the Rock of Gibraltar and, if it's clear enough, the northern coast of Africa. The hotel's Arabic-Andalusian design distinguishes it from other coastal hotels in the area, while its lush subtropical gardens cover an extensive area of 45,000 square metres. With 132 spacious rooms and 15 luxury suites, all of which enjoy either a terrace or balcony with views of the garden and the sea, the hotel never  seems too busy even when at full capacity. During my two-night stay I was able to sample food from two of the hotel's restaurants and drinks at both of its bars, including their signature The Golfer cocktail - a refreshing mix of vodka, melon and lemon sorbet. There are plenty of sun loungers and beds surrounding the pools for guests to put their feet up and relax . The hotel has views of Gibraltar and the northern coast of Africa when the sky is clear enough . A typical sea view from one of the 132 standard rooms at the five-star Kempinski hotel . The culinary highlight was a delicious sea bass fillet, which followed a delightful mini curried chicken burger, scallops and three different varieties of tomato with the region's famous Jamon Iberico de Castano - chestnut-fed ham to you and me. That tremendous meal arrived after a day spent at La Reserva, one of the most visually-stunning and challenging golf courses on the Costa del Sol. Although my performance left much to be desired, the course was on par with the popular Finca Cortesin I'd played the day before. Both showed off the local landscape, with lush fairways, devilish rough and water features aplenty providing a difficult test for golfers of all abilities. While I left realising lessons are a must in 2015, both courses provided me with the most enjoyable golfing experience of my life. Finca Cortesin is one of the Costa del Sol's most well known and popular golf courses . The first hole at Finca Cortesin is a tricky par four with a hilly fairway and bunkers surrounding the green . A large lake on hole three is sure to have golfers aiming right to avoid going into the water . Every now and then I'd hit a Rory McIlroy-style shot and admire it landing on the perfectly manicured putting surface or flying straight down the greener-than-green fairway. It sure beat a rainy afternoon at my local pay-and-play. La Reserva and Finca Cortesin are just two of more than 20 courses to offer special packages and prices for guests of Kempinski Hotel Bahia, adding another incentive for those wanting to test out their skills in Spain. But whether it's golf or simply a relaxing break you're after, Kempinski Hotel Bahia has the facilities, staff and quality of service to ensure you return home and immediately want to go back. I know I will. La Reserva is another popular track in the Costa del Sol and it's only 20 minutes from Hotel Bahia . The 18-hole course will provide even the most talented of amateur golfers with a stern test . La Reserva's stunning clubhouse welcomes those golfers completing the 18th hole .","The Kempinski Hotel Bahia is just a 20-minute drive from Marbella .

"Likely Republican presidential contenders Marco Rubio and Rand Paul are already clashing over President Barack Obama's recently announced shift in U.S. policy toward Cuba. Paul has said that lifting a more than 50 year embargo on Cuba is 'probably a good idea' while Rubio has swiftly made himself the face of opposition to normalizing relations with the Communist country. The argument between the two Republican senators escalated last night when Florida Sen. Rubio, who is the son of Cuban immigrants, claimed that Kentucky Sen. Paul 'has no idea what he’s talking about' when it comes to his parents' home country. Scroll down for video . Florida Senator Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is pictured here standing alongside Florida Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen during a press conference in Miami, Florida on Wednesday about the United States' decision to restore full diplomatic relations with Cuba and open an embassy in Havana for the first time in more than a half century. Rubio has taken a hardline stance against the issue . Paul has placed himself at odds with several possible Republican presidential challengers, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, also of Cuban descent, by aligning himself with the president and coming out in support of removing trade and travel restrictions on the Latin American country located less than 500 miles off the Florida coast. 'This announcement today will be remembered as a tragic mistake,' Cruz warned on Wednesday after Obama's announcement. 'Just like the administration did with Iran, right when the administration was feeling the maximum pain it throws them an economic lifeline and continues the brutal repression and dictatorship of the Castro brothers,' he said on Fox News. Likewise, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush wrote on Facebook that 'Cuba is a dictatorship with a disastrous human rights record, and now President Obama has rewarded those dictators. Bush became the first Republican candidate to officially acknowledge that he is exploring a presidential run earlier this week, just one day before Obama confirmed that his administration was reestablishing high-level diplomatic relations with Cuba. The former governor of the state with the largest Cuban-American population called Obama's move a 'misstep' and argued that it 'undermines America's credibility and undermines the quest for a free and democratic Cuba.' During a radio interview this week Paul said 'if the goal was regime change, [the embargo] sure doesn’t seem to be working.' 'Probably, it punishes the people more than the regime because the regime can blame the embargo for hardship,' he added. Rubio fired back at Paul on The Kelly Report on Thursday night and said, 'Like many people who have been opining, he has no idea what he’s talking about. 'Look, Venezuela's economy looks like Cuba's economy now,' he told the Fox News show's host, Megyn Kelly. 'You can't even buy toilet paper in Caracas. And there's no embargo on Venezuela. What Venezuela has in common with Cuba, is they both have adopted radical socialist governmental policies. 'And I would expect that people would understand that if they just took a moment to analyze that, they would realize that the embargo is not what's hurting the Cuban people,' he continued. 'It's the lack of freedom and the lack of competent leaders.' Rubio tore into Kentucky Sen. Paul on Thursday night over Paul's decision to come out in support of the president's Cuba policy shift. Paul 'has no idea what he’s talking about,' Rubio accused . Rubio has said he will use his position on the Senate Foreign Relations committee to block the creation of a U.S. embassy in Cuba and will oppose the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo on the country, which only Congress can authorize. In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, Rubio called Obama's decision 'a victory for oppressive governments the world over and will have real, negative consequences for the American people.' Rubio argued that 'the opportunity for Cuba to normalize relations with the U.S. has always been there, but the Castro regime has never been interested in changing its ways. 'Now, thanks to President Obama’s concessions, the regime in Cuba won’t have to change,' he asserted. He went on to say that the U.S. policy shift 'is based on the illusion—in fact, on the lie—that more commerce and access to money and goods will translate to political freedom for the Cuban people. 'Cuba already enjoys access to commerce, money and goods from other nations, and yet the Cuban people are still not free. 'They are not free because the regime—just as it does with every aspect of life—manipulates and controls to its own advantage all currency that flows into the island. More economic engagement with the U.S. means that the regime’s grip on power will be strengthened for decades to come—dashing the Cuban people’s hopes for freedom and democracy.' The U.S. is the only country in the world that restricts interactions with Cuba. The White House told reporters this week that it has become clear in the last 53 years that the 'unilateral' embargo has not had the intended effect. 'The rest of the world is actually on the other side of this issue. They criticize our sanctions regime policy against Cuba and it actually interferes with our ability to bring to bear pressure from the rest of the international community on the Castro regime to better respect human rights,' the president's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said. While high-profile Republicans are mostly aligned in their opposition to the White House's policy, polls taken this year on the issue show that Cuban-Americans in the the influential voting state of Florida share Paul's views as do the majority of Americans across the nation. A Florida International University poll of Cuban-Americans in South Florida taken in June found that 68 percent of the demographic is in favor of reestablishing diplomatic ties with Cuba and 69 percent want travel restrictions eliminated. A majority also said they were in favor of doing away with trade restrictions, 52 percent, and that the embargoes have not worked, 71 percent. And nationally, majorities of Americans in both political parties support resuming relations with Cuba, a total of 56 percent, according to an Atlantic Council poll taken in February.","Kentucky Sen.

"Endangered Indochinese tigers fight and frolic in the water and between rocks, doing what comes naturally, in these impressive images from photographer and filmmaker Peter Adams taken at Thailand's controversial Tiger Temple. The attraction has come under fire from animal welfare groups for the way their star attractions are treated, but Adams was nothing but impressed when he visited the park linked to the Theravada Buddhist temple in Kanchanaburi in western Thailand. And while tiger selfies are usually the order of the day, the 55-year-old from Gloucestershire wanted to capture the young tigers up to mischief rather than laying about for tourists. Endangered Indochinese tigers show their power and grace in the water at Thailand's Tiger Temple . Peter Adams took this series of action images while at Tiger Temple as a tourist Tigers play - or fight - in the water at the sanctuary . The park is linked to the Theravada Buddhist temple in Kanchanaburi in western Thailand. Adams, 55, of Gloucestershire, wanted to capture the young tigers up to mischief rather than laying about for tourists . 'I spent a day visiting the temple as a normal tourist but was able to get incredibly close to the tigers,' Adams says. 'They were young and extremely playful, instigating some of the games with some of the monks who have brought them up, so they're used to human contact.' Adams says he was able to get within touching distance of the tigers while they played together in their enclosures and watched them get showered and fed. 'It seemed incredible to me to get so close to these magnificent creatures, even to stroke them,' he says. 'It did feel slightly surreal taking these pictures being so close to something essentially wild and dangerous and to see their tremendous power as they run towards you. 'My instinct told me to back away, but my urge to get strong photographs was telling me to get closer.' 'There has been some controversy over the temple as there is with a lot of wildlife centres, however during my visit the tigers seemed very well treated and looked after. 'It was a magical experience.' One tiger surveys the area from the height of a rock, and prepares to pounce on its pals . A tiger shows how tall it can be on two legs while two others clash with their huge paws simultaneously catching each other on the face . Nowhere to go! This clash isn't going to end well for one tiger as the big cat with the higher ground strikes the other with its paw . Tiger Temple, which was founded in 1994, houses more than 100 tigers and visitors can bottle feed the cubs. In a review by Care For the Wild International based on a combination of animal welfare measures along with media coverage and compiled reviews, Tiger Temple received an 'unacceptable' rating of six out of a possible 50. A Care for the Wild investigation in 2008 says it 'exposed cruelty and other serious issues' but they say in recent years opinions on the attraction are divided. The Zoo Review score was boosted by positive appraisals from TripAdvisor and Google. 'It is obvious that many people love the Tiger Temple as it gives them the chance to get close to the tigers. Many claim not to see evidence of mistreatment or cruelty,' says the review. 'However, focussing purely on animal welfare criteria, the Tiger Temple seems to deserve an Unacceptable rating, as the conditions of the tigers is of extreme concern.'","Photographer and filmmaker Peter Adams captured tigers frolicking at the controversial Tiger Temple .

"It may have been the wedding of the year, but Kim Kardashian, who wore three different hairstyles on her fairy tale day, has failed to make Vogue's best wedding hair of all time. The 34-year-old Vogue cover star, who wed Kayne West on May 24th with a hairdo inspired by Ali McGraw in Love Story, lost out to both modern and timeless brides alike. From Poppy Delevingne's tousled locks and Gisele Bündchen's beach waves to Audrey Hepburn's flower crown and Priscilla Presley's bouffant, Kim's modern do' with a retro nod failed to make the cut. Scroll down for video . It may have been the wedding of the year, but Kim Kardashian, who wore three different hairstyles on her fairy tale day, has failed to make Vogue's best wedding hair of all time . 'The requirements are simple enough: something blithe, timeless, and not overworked; understated glamour with ethereal panache,' stated Vogue. Chris McMillan, who styled Kim's hair on her wedding day, as well as for her pre-wedding brunch at the Valentino estate and the rehearsal dinner, believes her bridal blow-dry was 'very fashionable, very chic, and very modern,' he told Hollywood Life. So could this be a snub for Kim? Though Anna Wintour had previously defended her decision to put Kim and Kanye on the April cover of Vogue, she recently suggested that the choice was 'tasteless'. According to Fashionista, the magazine editor said at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York: 'I think if we just remain deeply tasteful and just put deeply tasteful people on the cover, it would be a rather boring magazine!' She added that even from the very beginning, Vogue was never about pleasing everyone. 'The first celebrity that I put on the cover of Vogue was Madonna, and that was considered completely controversial at the time, too,' she explained.

Farrah Fawcett with her famous va-va-voom curls on their wedding day to Lee Majors in 1973 . For Kim's wedding look, Chris gave her a 'classic blow-dry with a round brush' after applying 'a little bit of Full Mousse at the crown.' He continued: 'We did a center part... it reminded me of Ali MacGraw in Love Story. 'Then I added a small pump of Satin at the ends of Kim’s hair to make it look shiny and healthy. I really wanted her hair to look as healthy, pretty, and youthful as possible.' Because of Kim's veil, Chris tucked her hair behind her ears to keep the look 'simple and elegant. The whole look was very modern, chic, and different,' he explained. Model Caroline Trentini took a more relaxed approach to the neat knot style popular among many timeless brides . Diana Ross opted opted for a sleek bun during her church wedding to Norwegian businessman Arne Næss,  in Romainmotier, Switzerland, in 1986 . Having discovered that she looked best with her hair pulled back off her face Grace Kelly resolved to stay that way - including on her wedding day to Prince Rainier .

Mia Farrow cut her hair into a pixie crop right before her wedding to Frank Sinatra on July 19, 1966, with a pair of fingernail scissors while working on the Peyton Place TV series at Fox Studios . Brides who did make Vogue's list include Jemma Kidd, Countess of Mornington, who wore her hair in a sleek center part, with a tight bun tied at the nape of her neck. Stylist Vanessa Traina Snow, Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy and Dianna Ross all echoed Jemma's neat knot, while model Caroline Trentini took a more relaxed approach to the style. Flower crowns (Audrey Hepburn and Jane Birkin) and Marcel waves (Lauren Bacall and Ingrid Bergman) also feature prominently in the list, as do romantic braids (model Bette Franke) and gently tousled waves (Poppy Delevingne, Kate Moss, Brigitte Bardot and Gisele Bündchen) - featuring plenty of inspiration for any bride-to-be.

"Fiorentina manager Vincenzo Montella has suggested that his side might have got the better deal when Egyptian winger Mohamed Salah moved to La Viola on loan as part of Juan Cuadrado's January transfer to Chelsea. Chelsea paid £27 million to prize Cuadrado away from the Serie A club with Blues outcast Salah offered as a makeweight exchange.

"The hackers who brought Sony Pictures to its knees over 'The Interview' are now demanding the film studio bow down further by removing all traces of the film from the web and ensure it is never released. In a new email sent to executives at Sony Pictures, the hackers crowed about their victory after the release of the movie was canceled. The group, calling itself Guardians of Peace, said it would not leak the remaining Sony hacked documents it has if the company complied with their demands, CNN Money reports. The company responded by taking town the website for 'The Interview' and turning the film's YouTube channel private so the videos can't be viewed by the public. Scroll down for videos .

"A Philadelphia Fire Department paramedic has sparked outrage for posting a photo to Instagram showing two black men pointing guns at a white cop with the caption: 'Our real enemy.' Marcell Salters has now apologized for posting the image and the caption, which continued: 'Need 2 stop pointing guns at each other & at the ones that's legally killing innocents.' Police Union President John McNesby slammed the post as 'despicable' and defamatory, Fox29 reported. The image, which shows two black men with guns raised at a white police officer's head, is from a rap video by Uncle Murda and Maino called 'Hands Up', which they wrote after the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, who were both died at the hands of officers over the summer. 'Despicable': Marcell Salters, a Philadelphia paramedic, shared this image to his Instagram page showing two black men holding guns to the head of a white police officer with the caption: 'Our real enemy' On Thursday, Mayor Michael Nutter condemned Salters' decision to share the photo and caption, calling its message 'reprehensible'. 'We celebrate the exercise of our First Amendment right to expression,' he said. 'But there are clear limits, and this posting went far beyond standards of decency. Inflammatory speech or behavior like this is simply irresponsible and could potentially incite others to inappropriate actions.' After the uproar, Salters, who works at medic 23 in southwest Philadelphia in the same building as 19th district police, posted an apology to his Facebook page. 'I would like to deeply apologize to anyone i have offended [sic],' he wrote. 'That post was out of anger of what is going on around the world (mike brown, eric garner & etc) & past experiences that i have had with the police. 'My intentions was not to slander or hurt anyone or my brothers in blue. Again i am sorry.' Under investigation: An investigation into Salters' conduct is now being carried out, the mayor said . Despite his apology, Salters made a comment on Facebook - that he later deleted - saying he 'never did or will like police', the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. 'Because of what i do i have to work with them but dont have to like them,' he said. 'There are numerous crooked & corrupted cops (mostly white) & mostly they harass, beat, or kill innocents (mostly blks).' Other friends also jumped to his defense on his page, saying he didn't need to apologize because he was talking 'from experience'. On the account, he can be seen in his medic's uniform and his URL for the page is 'Medic Salters'. Nutter said he has asked Fire Commissioner Derrick Sawyer to conduct an investigation into the paramedic's conduct. He said any disciplinary actions would be brought following the investigation. Apology: After the post caused uproar, Salters apologized and said he had shared it out of anger at police brutality across the country and out of experiences he had had with the police . Support: But many of Salters' friends said the fire department paramedic had no reason to apologize . 'I'm asking that all of us be particularly mindful of our actions and expressions regarding matters of public safety and our first responders,' he said in his statement. 'We need to respect them all, and they must respect our citizens as well.' Joseph Schulle, head of the firefighters' union Local 22, told the Inquirer that he expected Salters would be disciplined because he made a comment about the post while on duty. The initial Instagram post was made while he was off-duty, he said. McNesby, of the police union, added: 'You don't want to see anybody lose their jobs especially around the holidays. But if the charge of stupidity was in their handbook he'd probably get a life sentence.'","Marcell Salters posted image to Instagram  with the caption: 'Need 2 stop pointing guns at each other & at the ones that's legally killing innocents'

"Rafael Nadal is counting on antibiotics to control his appendicitis so he can get through the Shanghai Masters this week. World No 2 Nadal began feeling pain in his abdomen late on Saturday, and the next day went to the hospital where the doctors confirmed he had the early stages of appendicitis.

The 14-time major winner said the risk of his condition getting worse after three days of steady improvement 'is always very, very low.' 'I am not going to go for surgery. That's great news for me today. That's why I'm here practicing for 45 minutes, and trying to play tomorrow. But obviously I am not in my best condition,' he said. Nadal said he will talk with his doctors when he returns to Spain after the tournament about whether he will need to have the appendix removed. 'My idea is take it out, but you can imagine that I didn't (think) much about that yet. I am here in Shanghai. I just want to try. Then when I go back home, I will talk about the situation with my doctor,' he said. Nadal is suffering from appendicitis but will still play in the ATP Masters 1000 event in Shanghai this week .

"They might benefit from lower insurance policies and have the wealth of experience behind them, but older drivers are much worse at driving if distracted. Scientists have found that mature motorists, who are typically regarded as being safer than younger drivers, are far more likely to have an accident if they attempt to text while behind the wheel. They found that while all motorists tended to perform worse when trying to send messages on a mobile phone, those who were aged between 45 and 59 years old performed worse. Despite having less experience behind the wheel, the research suggests that younger motorists get less distracted by using their mobile phone to send text messages than their older counterparts . Professor Randall Commisaris, a pharamceutical scientist at Wayne State University, in Detroit, Michigan, said the findings showed that older drivers struggled to cope with distractions, despite having more experience. Indeed, he said that many older drivers believe they can get away with using their mobile phone while behind the wheel because they think they are better, safer drivers than those with less experience. A US-based company claims to have developed a ‘texting gun’ that can recognise the frequency of a text message, allowing police to fine people for doing it. The Sniffer Sleuth II apparently uses similar technology to cable repairmen when they are searching for where a cable is damaged. Virginia based ComSonics says its device, which looks like a speed gun, can detect frequencies that are specifically used to send text messages. This would allow police to distinguish between motorists who are making phone calls, sending text messages or whose devices are transmitting data, perhaps when using satellite navigation software. In addition, the device can apparently even work out which person in the car is texting, so it will not alert police to issue a fine if it spots frequencies from a passenger. The device has yet to be given legislative approval amid some privacy concerns, but Malcolm MacIntyre of ComSonics told the Virginian-Pilot it was ‘close to production.’ He said: 'Generally, people believe that younger drivers are more easily distracted and therefore would be more susceptible to the dangers of texting and driving. 'However, our study - which included drivers ranging in age from 18 to 59 - demonstrated just the opposite. 'Although texting while driving had a negative impact on drivers of all ages, younger drivers were less distracted by texting, and older drivers' performance was much worse because of their texting.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Accident Analysis and Prevention, tested the driving of 50 motorists aged between 18 and 59 years old who all owned smartphones and indicated they were prolific texters able to send messages with one hand. The study showed that while sending messages, about 50 per cent of all the drivers strayed from their line while trying to text. However, among those aged between 45 and 59 years old, 100 per cent of the motorists strayed from their lanes while texting. For subjects between the age of 35 and 44 years old, 80 per cent of subjects left their lane when texting and 40 per cent of those between 25 and 35. The best performing group were drivers aged between 18 and 24, where just a quarter strayed from their lane while texting. The findings have alarmed motoring groups, who emphasis that drivers who are distracted by sending text messages are less likely to spot oncoming hazards and are more likely to have accidents. Motorists were tested for their ability to stay in a lane while driving a simulator and texting at the same time . Around 50 per cent of motorists admit to having texted while behind the wheel of their car, according to some surveys. Using an Apple Watch while driving could put you in prison for up to two years, motoring experts have warned. When the gadget is released next year, it will allow users to make and receive calls, check their messages and monitor their health by operating the device on their wrists. But people who use Apple Watch while on the road are at risk of causing fatal crashes and will face the same penalties as those caught on their mobile phones. This is according to the London-based Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) who has warned that smartwatches will 'significantly' impair driving performance. Existing research by the IAM on smartphone use between 2006 and 2010 found distraction from a mobile phone was a contributory factor in 1,960 road accidents, 110 of which were fatal. And last year texting while behind the wheel overtook drink driving as the biggest cause of death among teenagers in America. More than 3,000 teenagers were killed in car crashes caused by texting while driving compared to 2,700 from drink driving. In the UK, however, motorist are banned from using their mobile phones while driving and face a fine of £60 if caught. The Government has announced it is considering increasing the on the spot fine to £90. Yet around 150,000 drivers are convicted each year of offences involving a mobile phone. Some states in the US also ban the use of mobile phones. Professor Commissaris said it was possible that younger drivers were better at texting while driving because they find the use of such technology more intuitive. He said: 'It is possible that, relative to younger drivers, older drivers spend more of their texting time looking at their cell phones and not at the road - this could increase driving errors in our older drivers. 'Alternatively, it is possible that older drivers do not differ from younger drivers with respect to the time spent looking at their phones, but they are more distracted by texting while driving because they are less able to manage the cognitive demands of multitasking.' Doreen Head, assistant professor of occupational therapy at Wayne State University, added: 'There is a perception that more-experienced drivers can text and drive more safely because they can manage distractions better than less-experienced drivers. Wayne State University found middle aged drivers were far more likely to stray from lanes while texting . 'Not only are adults sending the wrong message because they are telling young people to do as they say, not as they do, but they are also putting themselves and others in harm's way.' A spokesman for the AA said that even if younger people were better able to cope with texting and driving at the same time, they should not try to as the research showed it still increases the risk of having an accident. He said: 'In many ways these findings are irrelevant in the UK as texting in any form while driving is illegal. 'If someone is involved in an accident when driving then the judge will throw the book at them.'","Study was conducted by Wayne State University in Detroit using 50 drivers .

"Convicted serial child molester Jerry Sandusky will not be getting his $4,900-a-month pension back, it was revealed today. The former assistant football coach at Penn State lost the benefit two years ago after he was sentenced for sexually abusing young boys, some of whom he had met through his charity benefiting underprivileged youths. Sandusky's attorney Chuck Benjamin said Friday the State Employees' Retirement System issued a 122-page opinion with the decision not to restore the pension. Benjamin says he plans to challenge the ruling in a lawsuit. Scroll down for video . Down and out: Former Penn State University assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky lost a legal battle to restore his $4,900-a-month pension, a benefit that was canceled two years ago after he was sentenced for child molestation . The decision followed a recommendation in June by a hearing examiner who said Sandusky had already retired by the time the Pension Forfeiture Act was expanded in 2004 to add sexual offenses to the crimes that trigger forfeiture. The 70-year-old Sandusky is serving a decades-long sentence and appears likely to die in prison. His wife, Dottie, would be in line to continue collecting 50 per cent of his pension benefits upon his death. Mrs Sandusky has stood by her husband's side throughout the trial and even after his conviction, insisting that he was innocent. The wife of the former football coach has been unwavering in her support, attacking the media and even their adopted son, Matt, who appeared as a witness for the prosecution during the trial accusing Sandusky of molesting him from the time he was 8 years old. 'All I can say at this point is we're looking forward to litigating the revocation of the pension in court,' Benjamin said. 'That's the next step of this process. We've exhausted our administrative remedies, and now we'll be filing papers within the next 30 days in court."" The hearing examiner, Michael Bangs, had said that the retirement system had improperly applied the forfeiture law to Sandusky for crimes he committed as a retiree. The good wife: Sandusky's loyal wife, Dottie (left), would be in line to continue collecting 50 per cent of his pension benefits upon his death . Sandusky testified for nearly three hours by video link earlier this year at a hearing before Bangs regarding the forfeiture. He was the only witness called by his lawyers. Sandusky spent decades as Penn State's defensive football coach before retiring in 1999. Penn State employees do not work for the state government but are eligible to participate in the state pension system. Sandusky collected a $148,000 lump sum payment at the time he retired, and a total of $900,000 in pension payments by September 2012. He was convicted by a jury of sexual abuse of 10 boys and sentenced to 30 to 60 years.","The former assistant football coach at Penn State lost the benefit two years ago after he was sentenced for sexually abusing 10 boys .

"An Arizona sheriff known for crackdowns on people living in the country illegally is giving up his last major foothold in immigration enforcement efforts that won him popularity among voters but gradually were reined in by Washington and the courts. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's office revealed late Wednesday that it was agreeing to disband a controversial squad that has raided businesses to arrest more than 700 immigrants who were charged with using fake or stolen IDs to get jobs. 'He has proved that when he gets involved in immigration enforcement, he tramples on the U.S. Constitution, at great expense to taxpayers and public safety,' said Cecillia Wang, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who won a racial profiling case against Arpaio's office. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio says he's disbanding his criminal employment squad, ending his last major foothold in immigration enforcement after the courts and federal government have gradually reined in his powers in recent years . The revelation that Arpaio was voluntarily closing his criminal employment squad comes after the sheriff's office was stripped of special federal immigration powers, found to have racially profiled Latinos in traffic stops, and investigated by federal authorities for alleged civil rights violations. The courts also have thrown out many of Arizona's immigration laws. Arpaio still retains limited power to confront illegal immigration, such as a civil law that imposes business-license punishments on employers who knowingly hire immigrants in the country illegally. The sheriff's office didn't respond to a request Thursday to interview Arpaio. But it issued a statement saying the squad will be disbanded early next year, and that grant money used in the enforcement of the ID theft laws will be returned to the state. The revelation that Arpaio was voluntarily closing his criminal employment squad comes after the sheriff's office was stripped of special federal immigration powers, found to have racially profiled Latinos in traffic stops, and investigated by federal authorities for alleged civil rights violations . The sheriff's road to immigration enforcement began in 2005 as voter frustrations grew over the state's status as the then-busiest in immigrant smuggling and state lawmakers started responding to their complaints about Arizona's porous border with Mexico. Like other local police bosses, Arpaio previously left immigration enforcement to federal authorities. He explained his decision to enter immigration enforcement as addressing a public safety concern. And he eventually set up squads that focused on immigrant smuggling and businesses that hired immigrants. 'We don't go after the addicts on the street,' Arpaio said in a 2005 interview about his newly formed smuggling squad, likening his immigration crackdown with his approach to investigating drug cases. 'We go after the peddlers. Same philosophy.' His supporters have said the sheriff was the only local police boss to do something about illegal immigration in the face of inadequate federal enforcement. Like other local police bosses, Arpaio previously left immigration enforcement to federal authorities. Critics say Arpaio picked on powerless immigrants because it was popular with voters. They said Arpaio focused too much on rank-and-file immigrants and gave too little scrutiny to smugglers and employers who hired immigrants in the country illegally. Arpaio's immigration efforts reached their peak around 2010 when he launched immigration patrols known as 'sweeps.' During those stings, deputies flooded part of a city — in some cases, heavily Latino areas — over several days to seek out traffic violators and other offenders. Immigrants who were in the country illegally accounted for 57 per cent of the 1,500 people arrested in the 20 sweeps conducted by his office since January 2008, according to figures provided by Arpaio's office. But a backlash was brewing in Washington and in the courts. In late 2009, Washington stripped some of his deputies of their power to make federal immigration arrests. A federal judge last year ruled Arpaio's office systematically racially profiled Latinos in traffic and special immigration patrols. The sheriff vigorously denies the court's conclusions. A federal judge last year ruled Arpaio's office systematically racially profiled Latinos in traffic and special immigration patrols . Arpaio's now-disbanded immigrant smuggling squad recently came under scrutiny from the judge in the profiling case after allegations of misconduct surfaced this year, including whether a squad member was shaking down people who were in the country illegally. The sheriff himself has been criticized by the profiling case's judge for not embracing the changes needed to remedy constitutional problems with some of his agency's traffic stops. The judge is moving closer to launching a contempt-of-court case against Arpaio for repeatedly disregarding orders in the profiling case. Even though his involvement in immigration enforcement has gradually dwindled over the years, Arpaio still speaks up on the subject. Last month, he filed a lawsuit that seeks to dismantle President Barack Obama's executive order that lifts the threat of deportation from millions of immigrants living illegally in the United States.","Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's office revealed late Wednesday that it was agreeing a his squad .

"Fears are growing for the safety of part of the Elgin marbles loaned to Russia, as British museum trustees admitted they were worried the sculpture might not come back. The unveiling of the headless statue of Greek river-god Ilissos at the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg yesterday prompted a furious diplomatic row with Greece. But Dr Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum, responded by claiming the Greek authorities had never formally asked for the sculptures to be returned, let alone requested to borrow them. The choice of Russia as the first recipient of an Elgin statue sparked further controversy given tensions between the Kremlin and the West over Ukraine and the Malaysia Airlines MH17 crash. Scroll down for video . A sculpture of the Greek river god Ilissos, part of the Elgin marbles, has been unveiled in St Petersburg . Patience Wheatcroft, one of the British Museum's trustees, admitted that when the board discussed the loan some were concerned the piece might not come back. 'There is always a risk that someone will do something untoward. But we decided that it was a very unlikely event and that there would be sufficient pressure to ensure that the object was returned. It was a unanimous decision and we were absolutely united,' she told The Telegraph. The statue's unexpected move from the British Museum came after a journey cloaked in secrecy for security and to ensure maximum impact. Maurice Davies, partner at the Museum Consultancy and former head of policy at the UK's Museum Association said 'it was a very bold risk'. He warned that the decision could 'easily backfire' because of the worsening relations between Russia and the West. Dr Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum (centre right), responded to critics by claiming the Greek authorities had never formally asked for the sculptures to be returned . But he said it also showed the possibility of cultural co-operation and shows there are 'alternatives to war and national power'. Prime Minister David Cameron expressed confidence over the sculpture's future amid fears that Number 10's frosty diplomatic relations with Vladimir Putin could impact its return. He said there was 'trust' and a 'working relationship' between the museums involved. Sir Richard Lambert, Chairman of The Trustees of the British Museum, said the loan was only approved 16 days ago as they wanted to 'leave room for flexibility if the political relationship between Europe and Russia changed'. The Prime Minister of Greece, Antonis Samaras, once again accused Britain of 'looting' and said the decision to lend the statue to Russia 'provokes the Greek people'. But Dr MacGregor from the British Museum pointed out that Greece has never actually asked for them back. Sir Richard Lambert, hairman of The Trustees of the British Museum, said the loan was only approved 16 days ago as they wanted to 'leave room for flexibility' if the political relationship changed . School children look at an empty plinth of the Ilissos statue, part of the Elgin Marbles, in the British Museum . 'The Greek claim to the Marbles is a political question,' he said. 'What's clear is that the Greek position on the sculpture is the government's. It's not a position that comes out of an academic or conservation issue,' he told The Times. 'The Greek government has never asked the trustees of the British Museum for the return [of the Marbles]. It's always been done through the media or through someone else.' It had also 'never asked to borrow' them.' The 2,500-year-old sculptures were removed from the Parthenon in Athens by Lord Elgin in the 19th century. Since the late actress-turned-politician Melina Mercouri launched the restitution campaign in the 1980s, numerous attempts to win back the Marbles have failed. Leading state archaeologists and culture ministry officials asked to borrow the Marbles before the 2004 Athens Olympics, for the duration of the Games. In exchange Britain was offered its pick of 32,000 statues and vases dating back to the 5th century BC, and co-operation with the Acropolis Museum, but the offer was rejected. Officials in Athens say they were offered permanent loan in exchange for complete resignation of ownership rights to the Marbles. The proposition was discussed but no deal was ever reached. This year Athens hired lawyer Amal Clooney for a legal fight and she said Greece had 'just cause' for the return of the marbles. The Elgin Marbles are a collection of classical Greek marble sculptures, inscriptions and architectural members that were mostly created by Phidias and his assistants. The 7th Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce,  removed the Parthenon Marble pieces from the Acropolis in Athens while serving as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1803. In 1801, the Earl claimed to have obtained a permit from the Ottoman authorities to remove pieces from the Parthenon. On display: The Elgin Marbles (pictured at the British Museum) are a collection of classical Greek marble sculptures, inscriptions and architectural members that were created by Phidias and his assistants . As the Acropolis was still an Ottoman military fort, Elgin required permission to enter the site. His agents subsequently removed half of the surviving sculptures, as well as architectural members and sculpture from the Propylaea and Erechtheum. Earl: The 7th Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce (pictured), removed the Parthenon Marble pieces from the Acropolis in Athens while serving as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire . The excavation and removal was completed in 1812 at a personal cost of around £70,000. The scupltures were shipped to Britain, but in Greece, the Scots aristocrat was accused of looting and vandalism. They were bought by the British Government in 1816 and placed in the British Museum. They still stand on view in the purpose-built Duveen Gallery. Greece has sought their return from the British Museum through the years, to no avail. In February, while attending the Berlin Film Festival to promote The Monuments Men, George Clooney was asked by a Greek journalist whether Britain should allow Greece to reclaim its historic art. He replied: 'You have a very good case. Maybe it wouldn't be a bad thing if they were returned. That is a good idea, a fair thing to do.' Amal Alamuddin Clooney's law firm Doughty Street chambers yesterday confirmed that she had travelled to Athens, where she will remain until Thursday, at the invitation of the Greek government. Her visit is 'in connection with the Parthenon sculptures that are presently on display in the British museum', it said. The authenticity of Elgin's permit to remove the sculptures from the Parthenon has been widely disputed, especially as the original document has been lost. Many claim it was not legal. However, others argue that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognizable.","One of the Elgin Marbles has been unveiled in a St Petersburg museum .

Mojang has announced it is teaming up with Telltale Games to create a spin-off called Minecraft: Story Mode. Minecraft: Story mode will be a 'cool', narrative-driven game about Minecraft and will be launch 'some time' during 2015 - although the exact date wasn't announced . But the developers did not reveal the exact date of release, in its official post. Minecraft: Story Mode will be available on Xbox consoles, PlayStation consoles, PC, Mac, iOS, and Android-based devices. Earlier this month, the original Minecraft: Pocket Edition game was made available on Microsoft's Windows Phone for the first time. Microsoft bought Mojang in September in a deal said to be worth $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion). Although Story Mode will be compatible with Microsoft's own Xbox range, as well as its Windows software, there was no mention of it being launched on Windows Phone.

'We’re not intending on creating an official story for [character] Steve, or explaining the world of Minecraft in detail,' explained Mojang. 'It will be a cool game.' Telltale, which makes 'The Wolf Among Us', added: 'As 2014 comes to a close, we are delighted to confirm our partnership with Mojang to create a new episodic game series based on one of the most popular video games in history - Minecraft. 'Set in the world of Minecraft, the series will feature an original story, driven by player choice. 'It will not be an add-on for Minecraft, but rather a separate standalone product that will premiere in 2015 on consoles, computers and mobile devices.' The firm said the game series will mix new characters with familiar themes, in an 'entirely original Minecraft experience, inspired by the Minecraft community and the game that continues to inspire a generation.' Minecraft founder Markus Persson sold the hugely-popular game to Microsoft in September. After the deal was finalised, Mr Persson left the company. In a statement released at the time, Mr Persson said: 'I'm leaving Mojang. 'A relatively long time ago, I decided to step down from Minecraft development. 'Jens [Bergensten] was the perfect person to take over leading it, and I wanted to try to do new things. 'I was at home with a bad cold a couple of weeks ago when the internet exploded with hate against me over some kind of EULA situation that I had nothing to do with. I was confused. I didn’t understand. I tweeted this in frustration.

'I’m not an entrepreneur. I’m not a CEO. I’m a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have opinions on Twitter. 'As soon as this deal is finalised, I will leave Mojang and go back to doing Ludum Dares and small web experiments. 'Considering the public image of me already is a bit skewed, I don’t expect to get away from negative comments by doing this, but at least now I won’t feel a responsibility to read them. 'I’m aware this goes against a lot of what I’ve said in public. I have no good response to that. 'I love you. All of you. Thank you for turning Minecraft into what it has become, but there are too many of you, and I can’t be responsible for something this big. Minecraft founder Markus Persson sold Minecraft to Microsoft in September, in a deal that was said to be worth $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion). The latest Windows Phone version (pictured) includes all of Minecraft’s mobile features, including Survival mode, Creative mode and multiplayer features when played on Wi-Fi networks . 'In one sense, it belongs to Microsoft now. In a much bigger sense, it’s belonged to all of you for a long time, and that will never change. It’s not about the money. It’s about my sanity.' Minecraft is available on PCs and for Xbox Live on the Xbox 360, and in the last two years it has become the top online game for the Microsoft console.

"Tatler's latest editorial  lays out the rules of etiquette surrounding a threesome . Tatler has long been the go-to read for anyone interested in learning how the other half lives - or seeing fellow aristo chums in the party pages. But now the upper class bible and subject of a BBC documentary, has shared its etiquette tips for a rather racy social situation - how to behave in a threesome. The rules laid out include guidelines on personal hygiene and how to pick the third member, if you're a couple. The article notes: 'In sex, as in life, generosity and manners are important - particularly in a threesome. 'It's like talking to people on either side of you at a dinner party; you must share your attention equally and not allow anyone to feel left out.' The magazine recommends  upping the normal standards of personal grooming (because 'the stakes have been doubled'). It also  wisely suggests ensuring you are STD-free before sharing a bed with two people. Besides these basic courtesies, the magazine explains how to have a terribly polite and correct ménage à trois without offending well-to-do friends or rocking your social circle. According to Tatler, if you decide to get frisky at somebody else's house it is rude not to at least extend the offer of a threesome to the host first. And whatever the venue, you can only change your mind about your participation before clothing has been removed. To leave once people are naked is classed as 'poor form'. Once the deed is done, it is apparently acceptable to leave swiftly, without the normal obligatory emotional moments, post-coital embracing or morning-after breakfast. If, and when, you run into someone with whom you've shared a threesome, Tatler offers very clear rules on behaviour. Leaving no room for error it explains: 'When you next bump into the participants - at a party, for example - look them in the eye, kiss them on both cheeks (face cheeks, mind) and act insouciant.' It is correct behaviour to  invite the host if you engage in a threesome at a party or another person's house . The eyebrow-raising article is a far cry from Tatler's usual fare, covering the latest faces at debutante balls and explaining how to behave when invited to a friend's Tuscan villa, a piece which appeared in this month's edition of the glossy magazine. From society to sex, glossy magazine Tatler is the Bible for correct etiquette in every situation . Although Tatler's readership is small, it represents one of the richest (and poshest) of any publication in the UK. However, while threesomes might be becoming popular among the rich and titled, not everyone is a fan. Rowan Pelling, former editor of Erotic Review and sex columnist, says: 'I tend to think that there's a sort of sexism at play. 'Most men are very keen on two women and a bloke, but not at all interested in two blokes and a woman (unless they happen to be a premier league footballer, that is). 'And then there's also the truth - in my observation of friends who've dabbled in them - that someone gets left out. 'I've seen couples invite another person in, only for one party in that couple to get carried away about the new individual, sometimes carrying on an affair behind their partner's back. 'Three is always a slightly unsatisfactory, someone's-left-out number. Just as three friends at school are always forming new dynamics and leaving someone out.' Tatler was recently the star of a BBC2 documentary, Posh People: Inside Tatler which followed the workings of the historic magazine as editors and writers attempted to capture the upper class zeitgeist.

"It's often been said crows show a remarkably high level of intelligence - they can remember faces, use tool, and communicate in sophisticated ways. But a new study has found they are even smarter than first thought, as they can solve complex tasks previously thought possible only by humans, apes and monkeys. And most impressively, they performed the tasks spontaneously - without any prior training. Scroll down for video . Research led by Lomonosov Moscow State University in Russia tested the intelligence of crows. The study found they could solve a shape-association task (shown). It involved picking similar - but not matching - shapes to find food. Two crows were found to be successful 78 per cent of the time . The research, published in Current Biology, was carried out by psychology professor Dr Ed Wasserman from the University of Iowa and three researchers from Lomonosov Moscow State University in Russia. 'What the crows have done is a phenomenal feat,' said Dr Wasserman . 'That's the marvel of the results. It's been done before with apes and monkeys, but now we're dealing with a bird; but not just any bird, a bird with a brain as special to birds as the brain of an apes is special to mammals.' Researchers studying New Caledonian crows recently discovered the clever corvids display a preference for holding a stick tool on a certain side of their beaks - and this could be to make the most of their wide field of vision. The researchers believe the birds may be trying to keep the tip of the stick in view of the eye on the opposite side of their heads, so they can see clearly in order to use tools in the most dexterous way. Lead scientist Dr Alejandro Kacelnik, from Oxford University, said: ‘If you were holding a brush in your mouth and one of your eyes was better than the other at brush length, you would hold the brush so that its tip fell in view of the better eye. This is what the crows do.’ New Caledonian crows surprised experts with their ability to use sticks to extract larvae from burrows and, in captivity, retrieve food placed out of reach. The study, published in the journal Current Biology, also suggests that the birds' unusually wide field of vision actually helps them to see better with one eye. The study involved two hooded crows that were at least two years old. The birds were placed into a wire mesh cage into which a plastic tray containing three small cups was occasionally inserted. The sample cup in the middle was covered with a small card on which a colour, shape or number of items was pictured. The other two cups were also covered with cards - one that matched the sample, and one that didn't. During this initial training period, the cup with the matching card contained two mealworms; the crows were rewarded with these food items when they chose the matching card, but they received no food when they chose the other card. Once the crows had been trained on identity matching-to-sample, the researchers moved to the second phase of the experiment. This time, the birds were assessed with relational matching pairs of items. These relational matching trials were arranged in such a way that the shapes on the test cards did not precisely matched the sample card, eliminating control by physical identity. For example, the crows might have to choose two same-sized circles rather than two different-sized circles when the sample card displayed two same-sized squares. 'What the crows have done is a phenomenal feat,' said Dr Wasserman. 'That's the marvel of the results. It's been done before with apes and monkeys, but now we're dealing with a bird; but not just any bird, a bird with a brain as special to birds as the brain of an apes is special to mammals' What surprised the researchers was not only that the crows could correctly perform the relational matches, with a success rate of 78 per cent - 50 per cent being regarded as chance - but that they did so spontaneously, without explicit training. 'That is the crux of the discovery,' Dr Wasserman said. Russian researcher Dr Anna Smirnova studies a crow making the correct selection during a relational matching trial . 'Even if brute force methods had to be employed - by giving the crowns reward on correct trials and withholding reward on incorrect trials - successful learning and transfer of relational matching behavior would have been noteworthy.' 'The fact that the crows spontaneously engaged in correct relational matching makes the present results truly remarkable.' He added: 'This was a very artful experiment. 'I was just bowled over by how innovative it was.' However, the researchers conceded that the earlier identity matching-to-sample training may have given them some background knowledge for this more complex test. Nonetheless, even that in itself would be an 'intriguing matter for future study,' they wrote in their paper. Dr Anthony Wright, neurobiology and anatomy professor at the University of Texas-Houston Medical School, said the discovery ranks on par with demonstrations of tool use by some birds, including crows. 'Analogical reasoning, matching relations to relations, has been considered to be among the more so-called ""higher order"" abstract reasoning processes,' he said. 'For decades such reasoning has been thought to be limited to humans and some great apes. The apparent spontaneity of this finding makes it all the more remarkable.' Dr Joel Fagot, director of research at the University of Aix-Marseille in France, agreed the results shatter the notion that 'sophisticated forms of cognition can only be found in our ""smart"" human species. Accumulated evidence suggests that animals can do more than expected.' Dr Wasserman conceded there will be skeptics and hopes the experiment will be repeated with more crows as well as other species. He suspects researchers will have more such surprises in store for science. 'We have always sold animals short,' he said. 'That human arrogance still permeates contemporary cognitive science.'","Research led by Lomonosov Moscow State University in Russia tested intelligence of crows .

"There has been a great deal spoken about the sweltering heat and humidity England will face in Manaus when they play Italy on Saturday night. But how does it actually feel to run and exercise in such testing conditions? With the help of a Battersea Park biodome, an industrial-sized heater and a treadmill, Adam Shergold found out. It takes less than 10 seconds for the first bead of sweat to start trickling its way down from my forehead, off the tip of my nose and on to my soon-to-be-saturated shirt. It's a little disheartening for someone who considers themselves fairly fit, and is currently in training for a half-marathon, to be perspiring so uncontrollably after just a minute or so of exercise.

The hard yards: Shergold winds down after running for 10 minutes in the 'Mini-Manaus' biodome built by Ladbrokes in Battersea Park . Welcome refreshment: The cold water is very much necessary after completing the 'Mini-Manaus' challenge . The thermometer reads 31C, the average temperature in Manaus at this time of year, and the humidity sits just above the 80 per cent mark. These are conditions in which even walking down the street is an effort, so playing 90 minutes of high-intensity football is not an attractive option. I manage about 10 minutes of running on the treadmill, working up from a walk to an all-out sprint, before the temptation to throw water all over myself becomes too great. Each match at the World Cup will factor in drinks breaks, and these will be absolutely essential for the players to take on water or an energy drink and rehydrate.

"Peter Reid says the inaugural Indian Super League heralds a time for India to shed its ‘poor boy image’. The 58-year-old former England international midfielder is manager of Mumbai City who kick off the new season on October 12 against Atletico de Kolkata .

The league has taken three years to get off the ground, and those involved hope it will help loosen cricket’s stranglehold on India’s sporting public. Similar to the steps taken by the USA’s NASL in the 1970s, the league will boast some big names, albeit ageing ones, from Europe, with Freddie Ljungberg, Nicolas Anelka, Robert Pires, Alessandro del Piero, Mikael Silvestre and David Trezeguet among them. The league represents a huge investment with money coming from India’s booming businesses and Bollywood stars but the aim is to attract younger generations to participate and sustain the interest across the country. Reid said: ‘I feel this is the right time for football in India to shed its poor boy image. This is what happened in England when open terraces went and seating was forced on the teams. The rate of a ticket is high but, now, everything comes at a price. ‘The key message is that football can make everything attainable. We are working with the community too and encouraging their participation. I’m a big cricket fan and cricket is huge here but we want football to become another major part of their lives.’ World Cup winner Marco Materazzi has come to India as player-manager for Chennaiyin FC . Former Arsenal forward Robert Pires (R) is another superstar to join the inaugural ISL . R‘We went to watch a game the other day and there was real mixture of people in the crowd. All aspects of life and that’s what we want football to be about. It’s a game for the people and we want the people of India to embrace the sport and fall in love with the game,' he added. Reid has welcomed Anelka and Ljungberg to Mumbai over the past few days as excitement mounts for the season’s kick-off and he insists he aims to entertain but win. ‘I have a philosophy and I like to use the wingers. But I have to look at my players and play according to strength. If I have players who pass the ball, then we pass the ball. But in these conditions (heat and humidity), we need to adapt well, not pass the ball excessively. Anelka is looking to resurrect his career after leaving the Premier League under a cloud of controversy . Former Arsenal midfielder Freddie Ljungberg rests during a training session ahead of the season's start . ‘We want to be able to adapt our style to win. I am not preparing anyone in Mumbai City to face Barcelona. However, what people forget about Barcelona is their pressing game, the way they get the ball back. If we can get that kind of shape at the back, I would be happy. ‘It’s a simple process, when you have the ball, keep it...when you don’t, try and get the ball.’ Talking to the Times of India, Reid added: ‘I am coming here to coach players I don’t know. Obviously I know Nickolas Anelka, I know Freddie Ljunberg, but the Indians, I am learning. ‘It is a new league, it’s exciting. The players are getting to know me.’ India icon Sachin Tendulkar added to the romance of the occasion  by bringing in former East Manchester FC player Duleep Menon to play for his franchise Kerala Blasters, who are coached by David James. Menon, 27, has been drafted in after impressing during a friendly playing for Central Excise against Blasters in Thrissur. Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar has started his own franchise, Kerala Blasters, coached by David James . Ex-Liverpool playmaker Luis Garcis shakes hands with former cricket captain and Atletico De Kolkata co-owner Sourav Ganguly . Duleep, from Kochi, studied in England in 2011 and played for semi-pro side East Manchester who play in the Premier Division of the FBT Manchester Football League. ‘I was stunned to see Sachin at the hotel lobby in the morning,’ said Duleep. ‘I couldn’t say a word when he conveyed his best wishes to me and tears trickled down from my eyes. Sachin asked me to calm down. It feels like a dream.’ David James said: ‘He was superb against us in that practice game. Soon after the match I said that we could make use of this guy.’","The inaugural Indian Super League kicks off on October 12 .

"With a sheer drop of 1,300ft visible beneath your feet, walking along this suspension bridge onto a glass platform jutting off the edge of a cliff is not for the fainthearted. Opened to the public on Wednesday, the new bridge offers spectacular views of the Alps, but at such dizzying heights only the bravest are likely to test their mettle. The 'stairway to nothingness' at the Dachstein Glacier is only for visitors with 'nerves of steel', the resort's website reads. A bridge for the brave: The bridge at the Dachstein Glacier resort in Austria meanders around the stunning mountain range before descending 14 steps to a glass viewing platform, shown right . Test your mettle: The bridge was opened to the public on Wednesday but, with its vertigo-inducing views, only the bravest are likely to cross it . Taking in the view: Visitors to the Dachstein Glacier resort in the Alps take a few moments to look out over the mountain range situated at 1,300ft in the Alps . The suspension bridge, situated near the town of Schladming, leads to fourteen descending steps off a cliff, ending on a glass platform with vertigo-inducing views of the mountains below. Their reward, however, is the 'pure freedom' of hovering above a 400-meter (1,300-foot) drop while taking in the spectacular landscape of the Austrian Alps. The 100-meter-long bridge, which took six months to build, is the highest in Austria. Adrenaline junkies: These visitors to the Dachstein Glacier resort are some of the first to see the stunning views from the walkway . At the top of the mountain: The bridge is situated at the highest point in Austria and offers unrivalled views over the Alps . Don't look down: Visitors bravely look over the glass wall at the 1,300ft drop to the bottom of the mountains . Technical director Karl Höflehner, who oversaw this spectacular project, said: 'I am absolutely delighted that we managed to reach agreement with the nature conservation authority, which means that all visitors to the Dachstein can now experience the breathtaking sensation of being suspended above the rock face as they gaze over the Alps.' The work on the suspension bridge was at times carried out in exceptionally challenging conditions but Mr Höflehner said the most important thing was that the work was completed with none of the construction workers being injured. The resort website claims that the end result is one of the most spectacular ways 'of savouring the superb natural backdrop of the Dachstein glacier'. Boosting trade: The Dachstein Glacier resort is one of the most popular in Austria - with its new suspension bridge expected to draw more visitors .

"A four-year-old has been left with a hole in his nose from a leaking battery which was stuck for a month after medics allegedly mistook it for a Rice Krispie. Arif Miah from Bedford eventually had the battery removed after four and a half weeks when a black liquid started oozing from his nose and ears. His parents fear he could have breathing problems for the rest of his life because of the hole in his septum – the division between the two nostrils. They are considering legal action against Bedford Hospital after medics refused requests for an X-ray and were adamant that the blockage was caused by a Rice Krispie. Scroll down for video . Arif Miah, four (left) has been left with a hole in his nose from a corroding battery and his father Arju (right) fears he could have breathing problems for the rest of his life . Parents Arju and Shipa Miah, both 26, first took Arif to the hospital in November after their other son Akram, two, said he had put a battery up his older brother's nose. Doctors helped the couple give Arif a 'mother's kiss' where she put her mouth over his, closed his unblocked nostril and gently blew to dislodge the item, but he was not given an X-ray. 'If they had taken us seriously in the first place, none of this would have happened. I asked them for an X-ray but they said no. 'They said it was a Rice Krispie because when they looked in his nose they saw a scab that was the colour of a Rice Krispie. I think it was the acid from the battery scabbing up. 'A simple X-ray would have shown the battery and they would have removed it immediately. 'I'm really angry with the hospital, I feel that they just didn't listen to me and now my son could be facing problems for the rest of his life.' The four-year-old eventually had the battery removed after four and a half weeks when a black liquid started oozing from his nose and ears . Several days after the hospital visit a black liquid started oozing from his ears and nose and his parents took him to their GP. They diagnosed 'an infection' and sent them back to their home with antibiotics. But last week Arif began having trouble breathing and his worried father took him back to A&E at Bedford Hospital where he was seen by four doctors. They told them to come back the following day to get the battery removed because there were no doctors available in the Ear, Nose and Throat department. It was eventually removed on December 12 when Arif was given a general anaesthetic. 'He's such a beautiful little boy and now he could potentially have long-term health problems,' said Mr Miah. Bedford Hospital said there  was no record of the battery being mentioned when Arif was first taken to A&E . 'I dread to think what might have happened if it had been left any longer.' But the hospital claims staff were never told the youngster had a battery in his nose. A hospital spokesman said there was no record of the battery being mentioned when Arif was first taken to A&E on November 11. But Mr Miah insists he told medics that he thought his son had put a battery up his nose on the first visit. A hospital spokesman said: 'Arif first attended A&E with his parents on November 11 with a suspected foreign body up one of his nostrils. 'Staff were able to remove an object, which turned out to be a Rice Krispie, and checked that the nasal airways were clear. 'The parents were advised to see their GP if they had any further concerns. 'We were not made aware by his parents on this occasion that they suspected Arif had placed a watch battery up his nose; had this been mentioned he would have been referred to an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist immediately for further investigation. 'Arif's parents have not approached us regarding the care he received, so we would welcome them to contact us so that we can look into this matter further. 'In the meantime Arif will continue to receive follow-up care with our specialists to monitor his recovery. 'He added: 'It is important to point out the dangers of children and small batteries. 'As in the case of young Arif, they can cause permanent damage in a relatively small period of time. 'If a parent suspects their child has placed a battery up their nose they should seek medical advice straight away. 'The battery would be removed urgently, as was done in the case of Arif once we were made aware.'","Arif Miah, 4, has been left with a hole in his nose from a corroding battery .

"Ride-sharing giant Uber is testing a new, exclusive - and more expensive - car service in a little city that could - Los Angeles. The company announced this week that UberLUX is now active for clients in Tinseltown, promising to bring a 'luxurious experience'. The offering involves rides in high-end vehicles, such as Tesla Model S, Mercedes Benz S-Class or BMW 7-Series, from Uber's top-rated drivers. The option appears to be the first step of an expansion, with plans to take Uber from a taxi alternative into a limousine service. Lux: The service promises only high-end vehicles, like Mercedes, and drivers that are top-rated . Clients eligible for the new service were alerted by email from the company on Thursday, according to The Hollywood Reporter. It was also announced on their website's blog. UberLUX comes at a price, however. The base fare of a regular ride - Uber Black-  is $8, with a minimum price of $15. The minimum fare of an UberLUX ride is $30. The service has been trialed in other cities around the world as part of a pop-up feature. L.A. is the first though to officially have it. It will eventually be available to all people in the city, not just select clients. Key market: UberLUX has been tested in cities all over, but Los Angeles was the ideal starting platform . Uber has come under fire in recent weeks on different fronts. Last month, executive Emil Michael said at a New York dinner party that the company should spend 'a million dollars' hiring a team to 'dig up dirt' on journalists who report unfavorably about Uber. The company was then forced to overhaul and upgrade their security operations after several female passengers reported being raped by Uber drivers. Driver Alejandro Done, 46,  pleaded not guilty on Wednesday in Cambridge District Court to charges of rape and kidnapping, allegedly assaulting a woman he was driving phone on the backseat of his car. A total of four women in Boston have come forward claiming they were assaulted by drivers, not specifically Done. This week, during a siege in Sydney, Australia that saw the city go into lockdown, Uber was accused of upping its minimum fare to $100 amid a major demand for cars during the hostage crisis. In September 2012, Uber changed its charge policy so that it could adapt to busy periods. 'The system determines or approximates an amount of available service providers for providing the service at the given time,' the patent application reads, according to The Huffington Post. reads. 'Based on the determined amount of requesters and the determined amount of available service providers, the system adjusts a price, relative to a default price, for using the service provided by one or more service providers.' It is not illegal to adapt a service cost based on demand. However critics argue that, while hotels and airlines do such a thing regularly, Uber is the unique situation of being able to call in more drivers.","UberLUX made available to LA clients Thursday .

"Holland will take to the field in the World Cup against Chile on Monday without their record goalscorer - and Robin van Persie's absence creates a curious stat for the Dutch football team. When you think of the Dutch national side, you immediately think of the likes of Marco van Basten, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Edwin van der Sar. Yet, for the first time in 221 matches, Oranje will line-up for a match without a player whose surname starts with 'Van'. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Holland fan gets Louis van Gaal and Robin van Persie inked on his back . Vanless: Robin van Persie's (left) suspension means Holland will play without a 'Van' in their side . History: Holland coach Louis van Gaal (right) will field a side without a 'Van' in it for the first time in 221 games . Suspension: Van Persie's ban means there are no 'Vans' for Holland for the first time since May 29, 1996 . Absent: Van Persie wipes his forehead during a training session at the Corinthians Arena in Sao Paulo . Fitness: Rafael van der Vaart was forced to withdraw from Holland's World Cup squad through injury . Van Persie, who has scored 46 goals in 86 internationals, picked up a yellow card in each of Holland's matches with Spain and Australia, resulting in a one match ban. And, as the Manchester United striker is the only 'Van' in their Brazil World Cup squad, Louis van Gaal's side will start with a vanless XI for the first time in 18 years. The last time the Flying Dutchmen did not have a 'Van' on the field was when they beat China 2-0 on May 29, 1996. Interestingly, Holland will still be managed by a 'Van' in the form of Van Gaal, but he will be unable to name any players bearing that name in his squad for the Chile encounter. Edwin van der sar (goalkeeper) - 130 caps (1995-2008) There can only be one choice in goal for this five-a-side team and it has to be Van der Sar. During a glittering career he won the Champions League with both Ajax and Manchester United, as well as eight league titles. He also holds the world league clean sheet record after going 1,311 minutes without conceding a goal for United during the 2008-09 season. You wouldn't be scoring a lob past him, that's for sure... Stopper: Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar (left) played for Manchester United and Ajax during his career . Save: Van der Sar kept a world league clean sheet record of 1,311 minutes for Manchester United in 2008-09 . Rafael van der Vaart (attacking midfielder) - 109 caps, 25 goals (2001-) This five-a-side team is all about goals, goals and yet more goals. You'll find very little defending in it. Van der Vaart is a wonderfully gifted midfielder who has played for Ajax, Hamburg, Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur - and he can provide the assists for the deadly front three here. He would have been in the Holland squad but a calf injury curtailed his involvement. Will have to do all the tracking back in this side mind... Creative: Rafael van der Vaart is an extremely skilful player who scores goals and provides assists . Robin van Persie (striker) - 86 caps, 46 goals (2005-) What needs to be said about RVP that hasn't already? The Manchester United striker is his country's record goalscorer with 46 goals and he has terrorised defences in the Premier League for years. After banging goals in left, right and centre for Arsenal for no reward, he finally won a league title under Sir Alex Ferguson in 2012-13. Already has three goals at this World Cup, and expect more when he returns from his enforced rest. Absence: Van Persie will not play against Chile on Monday after picking up two yellow cards . Amazing: Van Persie's opening goal of the tournament showed incredible improvisation for Holland . Ruud van Nistelrooy (striker) - 70 caps, 35 goals (1998-2011) In our midfield/front three, RVP is accompanied by the deadly Dutch finisher that is Van Nistelrooy. PSV Eindhoven, Real Madrid, Hamburg, Malaga and Manchester United were among the clubs for who Van Nistelrooy fired in endless goals, bringing him five league titles. From inside the penalty area, has there ever been a finisher more clinical? Expect very little movement around the court though... Clinical: Ruud van Nistelrooy was a poacher who scored goals for fun throughout his career . Marco van Basten (striker) - 58 caps, 24 goals (1983-1992) Six league titles, two European Cups and the 1988 European Championship hardly seem enough reward for a striker of such supreme talent. Injury prematurely brought to an end a fantastic career for a player who shone on the field for Ajax, AC Milan and Oranje. He scored 277 goals throughout his career and many of them spectacular, most memorably his volley against the USSR during the 1988 European Championship final in West Germany. No team of 'Vans' would be complete without him, even if he is injured. Expect truly special goals on the court from this man. Class: Holland's Marco van Basten is one of the greatest strikers to have ever played the game . Simply the best: Van Basten's goal had everything - an outrageous piece of skill on a huge occasion . Rafael van der Vaart's enforced World Cup absence due to a calf injury ensured that only Van Persie took to field as a 'Van'. It is likely that Van Persie's absence will hit the Dutch hard as they face a Chile side who have taken the World Cup by storm. Both teams head into the match with two wins from two games, and Van Persie's three goals have helped the Dutch dispose of Spain and Australia. However, with Arjen Robben also having scored three times in Brazil already, Oranje do have another World Cup player at their disposal. Holland only need a draw to top Group B, but a win for either side would set up a likely quarter-final tie with Mexico, whereas the loser would probably be forced to take on hosts Brazil. The match takes place at the Corinthians Arena in Sao Paulo. Talisman: With Van Persie suspended, Arjen Robben will need to continue his goalscoring form . Goals: Robben has already netted three times for Holland at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . High five: Van Persie (left) slaps the hand of coach Van Gaal after scoring against Spain . Double vision: Van Persie (right) is suspended but manager Van Gaal (left) will coach the Holland side . Ban: Van Persie is suspended for Holland against Chile as they look to top Group B .","Louis van Gaal will name a side without a 'Van' against Chile on Monday .

The Spaniard fought back from 3-1 behind to stun the No 20 seed in a final set to move through to the last 16 . It was the second major upset that the man from Tenerife has caused after he beat Wes Newton in the first round before Christmas. Reyes, who averaged 88.42 and hit nine 180s, said: ‘I’m speechless. I can’t believe this – it is amazing.’ ‘All my friends and everybody in Spain is watching over the internet because it is not on TV there and we got a lot of messages before this game.’ A frustrated Painter said: ‘It was comical and slightly embarrassing to lose over seven sets to someone with an 88 average. ‘If he can win the in the second round of the World Championships with an 88 average then I’ve got to look at myself. ‘I’m not quite sure how I lost it, but if you don’t take your chances and put people away you pay the price.

"With the World Cup's other posterboys - Neymar and Lionel Messi - both impressing in their opening games, it was the turn of the world's current best player Cristiano Ronaldo to strut his stuff in Brazil. Sadly, Portugal didn't read the script involving a goalscoring return that saw Ronaldo carry his side to improbable victory - as they were humbled 4-0 by Germany at the Arena Fonte Nova. A red card in the first-half for Pepe didn't help Portugal's cause and, while the captain tried in vain to influence the outcome, Ronaldo was generally chasing a lost cause.

At 3-0 and a man down, Ronaldo's World Cup opener could be reduced to an opportunity to recover his match fitness and perhaps score a consolation goal. 51mins: Portugal manage a rare foray forward and Ronaldo threads a nets pass into the area only for a lack of communication between his teammates leads to Nani stealing the ball from Coentrao before it rolls out of play. 59mins: Ronaldo wins a free-kick from distance and takes up his traditional wide stance before thumping into the German wall as he fails to add to his tally of two World Cup goals - scored against Iran (2006) and North Korea (2010). Lean on me: Cristiano Ronaldo is consoled by Real Madrid teammate Sami Khedira at half-time . Still got it! At least Cristiano Ronaldo didn't show any adverse reactions to his recent injury problems . 65mins: Expectations are briefly raised from Portugal fans as Ronaldo picks up the ball and races forward. But, with his options limited by Pepe's sending off, he elects for an optimistic long drive that is blocked by Hummels. 74mins: Ronaldo goes ballistic after Portugal are denied what appears a bonafide penalty after Eder is brought down in the box chasing a blocked effort from Nani. The severity of Ronaldo's protestations suggest he is more concerned about getting his name on the scoresheet than the overall score. 77mins: German 4-0 Portugal Only moments later, the leading scorer at the 2010 World Cup, Muller completes his hat-trick with a simple tap-in from close range on his 50th international appearance . Not going to plan: Cristiano Ronaldo would have been hoping for a better introduction to the World Cup . Catch me if you can: Cristiano Ronaldo tries in vain to drag 10-men Portugal into the reckoning after the interval . One man team? Cristiano Ronaldo is left exhausted after he attempts to change to course of the game alone . 83mins: Ronaldo is still racing around the pitch as the game enters its final 10 minutes, allaying any fears over his fitness - but a second free-kick of the afternoon is aimed in the same place as the first, somehow managing to hit Lahm in a one-man German wall. 91mins: Ronaldo's final contribution to the evening is another free-kick. This time he clears the ball with a thunderous effort that forces Neuer to make an excellent save and deny Ronaldo even a small moment of personal glory. With Pepe likely to miss the rest of the group stage and worrying injuries to the likes of Almeida and Coentrao, Portugal face a daunting task to qualify from a group that also contains Ghana and the USA whether Ronaldo is firing on all cylinders or not. Germany, meanwhile, look awesome. Going ballistic! Cristiano Ronaldo pleads in vain after referee Milorad Mazic denies Portugal a late penalty .

"Britain is exporting more goods to countries outside the European Union than those inside it for the first time since we joined the Common Market in the 1970s. Firms are entering growing markets in Asia and Latin America in what economists are hailing as a ‘revolution in the orientation of British trade’. The shift will cheer the Coalition, which has made great efforts to boost international trade – with David Cameron, Vince Cable and William Hague all touring emerging economies to try to forge profitable links. Boost: David Cameron has made great efforts to increase international trade through the Coalition government . The figures will also be welcomed by Tory Eurosceptics as a sign that a looser relationship with the EU would not disadvantage the UK. According to a report by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), the UK has exported more goods to non-EU countries over the past three months than it did to its traditional main export market in Europe. Over the period, some 51 per cent of British exports went outside the EU – a rise of 13.2 per cent compared with the same time last year. Meanwhile, exports to within the EU fell by 7.3 per cent. Scott Corfe, of CEBR, said: ‘Exports of services, which are arguably more important for the UK economy, have always been more heavily based on the non–EU markets. ‘But in the last three months a revolution in the orientation of British trade has taken place, with non-EU exports of goods exceeding EU exports of goods by 1.5 per cent. This is the first three month period for which this has been so since the 1970s, we believe.’ Exchequer Secretary Chloe Smith said: ‘The Government is working hard to drive export-led growth and make progress in emerging markets. ‘These numbers are an indication that Britain can earn its way in the world and, coming soon after the news that the UK is a net exporter of cars for the first time since the 1970s, is positive news amidst the turbulence in the eurozone.’ British trade shifted away from the former colonies to Europe as trade barriers came down after the war. And trade to Europe increased when Britain joined the then Common Market on January 1, 1973. But with the eurozone mired in recession, exports to fast-growing non-EU economies are soaring. The value of exports to China was 26.3 per cent higher in the three months to the end of May than it was in the same period last year – though China still only accounts for 3 per cent of total UK exports. Exports to Hong Kong were up 14.9 per cent and sales of goods to Japan rose 5.2 per cent. In contrast, exports to Italy fell 19.8 per cent, those to Spain fell 9.2 per cent and those to France fell 9.1 per cent. Sales to Ireland dropped 5.3 per cent and exports to Germany – Europe’s biggest economy – were down 2.3 per cent. Conservative MP Dominic Raab said: ‘The European market accounts for less than half of UK exports and less than a sixth of our national income. ‘As this research highlights, Britain’s future trading opportunities lie with the rising economies of Asia and Latin America. ‘There is a real risk that insular EU navel-gazing distracts us from the global outlook that we need to deliver jobs, investment and business opportunities in the future.’ A poll of 2,000 businesses by the British Chambers of Commerce found that most firms – some 85 per cent – do not want further EU integration. The survey found that only 12 per cent wanted to leave the EU altogether. But almost half – 47 per cent – want to negotiate a looser relationship and only 9 per cent of want further integration. John Longworth, director general of the BCC, said: ‘Both the Government and the Opposition should carefully consider how we can get a single market that works for business while ensuring that legislation from Brussels doesn’t damage our economic prospects.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘As our closest neighbour and the world’s largest single market, Europe will always be a key trading partner and being successful there is central to our economic recovery.’","UK has exported more goods  to non-EU countries over past three months than traditional Euro export market .

"Real Madrid will trigger the latest saga in Luis Suarez's colourful career by bidding around £76million for the Liverpool striker. The Anfield club, who will complete a deal for Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen on Thursday, have been bracing themselves for this to begin and have given out clear signals that the player is not for sale. The player himself has said that there is nothing to be concerned about because he is happy on Merseyside and the club is going in the right direction. Waving goodbye? Real Madrid will try to trigger Luis Suarez's release clause at Liverpool with a £76m bid . However, even those close to the 27-year-old admit they can't say for sure what his final answer will be if Madrid keep increasing the mark on their bid. Last year Liverpool showed admirable resolve to keep their man out of Arsenal's clutches and Brendan Rodgers admitted it was his greatest test as a manager to turn around what at one stage seemed an irretrievable stance from Suarez. He did it with such aplomb that the Uruguayan hugged him in recognition after receiving his PFA Player of the Year award last month. Yet Real Madrid are a greater proposition than Arsenal. The prospect of lining up with Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo in a stable of Galacticos is bound to appeal and they have the financial clout to make deals happen. Enticement: The prospect of lining up with Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo (right) is sure to appeal to Suarez . Madrid will also offer various makeweights with Fabio Coentrao, who has agreed a new contract, and Alvaro Morata already mooted. Liverpool will counter that with them he can remain THE Galactico no matter who else they sign but it could be a fretful summer as the opening salvos are fired. Thomas Muller and Louis van Gaal could be re-united soon as Bayern Munich grow agitated at their forward's demands for re-assurances. Sportsmail reported Manchester United's interest in the Germany star last month and German newspaper Bild claims an official approach was made two weeks ago for the 24-year-old. Van Gaal gave Muller his chance at Bayern when there were calls for new players to be brought in and that has not been forgotten by the player despite his affiliation with his boyhood club. Friends re-United? Thomas Muller and Louis van Gaal could be back together at Old Trafford . United have distanced themselves from links with Bayern and their priority remains to recruit in midfield and defence but with offers coming in for Javier Hernandez and Danny Welbeck, checking on Muller's price and availability makes good business sense. United have been offered Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal by intermediaries but know Real Madrid are keen too on the highly-rated Chilean. Sporting Lisbon, meanwhile, have rejected a £27m offer from Monaco for United target William Carvalho. Norwich City are likely to be priced out of a move for Jordan Rhodes. Blackburn do not want to sell and will demand a prohibitive £15million if pushed. The Scotland striker scored 25 goals last season and has 52 in 87 games for Blackburn since his £8m move from Huddersfield Town. End of the road: Blackburn have slapped a £15m price tag on star striker Jordan Rhodes (right) The Yorkshire club also agreed a 25 per cent sell on clause so they will be keen to see if Blackburn can hold on to their prized asset. Norwich are expecting offers from the likes of QPR and Crystal Palace for Gary Hooper who is keen to leave despite not handing in an official transfer request while Feyenoord are showing an interest in Ricky van Wolfswinkel. On Thursday they completed the £3m transfer of Lewis Grabban from Bournemouth. Newcastle have held further talks over the possibility of signing Bafetimbi Gomis. The free agent striker who has left Lyon is holding out for big wages of around £100,000 a week and that will limit his options in this country. QPR are weighing up an offer but have other targets too while Swansea are waiting on talks with FC Twente's Luc Castaignos and what bids come in for £19m-rated Wilfried Bony. Dictating terms: Bafetimbi Gomis (right) is a free agent and will want £100,000 a week . Gomis is also wanted by Galatasaray although they have expressed an interest in Mario Balotelli. Newcastle have a deal in place for Tenerife's Ayoze Perez but are surprised at Leeds United's valuation of Ross McCormack, as reported in Sportsmail, and have touched base again about Ajax captain Siem de Jong. There were a few well-known faces in the crowd at Holland versus Wales on Wednesday night. QPR manager Harry Redknapp, Hull boss Steve Bruce and Southampton sporting director Les Reed were all spotted in the Amsterdam crowd. Crystal Palace midfielder Jonathan Williams was particularly impressive and did himself no harm amid illustrious company. The 20-year-old is attracting interest from Swansea but Hull and Southampton will also be taking note of what he could offer. Manchester City midfield prospect Emyr Huws also did enough in his cameo appearance to have scouts talking. Impressive: Jonny Williams (right) did himself no harm against Holland in front of interested scouts . Free agent Chris Basham has agreed a move to Sheffield United. The 25-year-old, who can play in . defence or midfield, left Blackpool at the end of the season and has had . interest from a number of Championship clubs but has been attracted to . Nigel Clough's plans at the ambitious League One club. He is having a . medical today. Sheffield . United have also made an approach for Halifax Town striker Lee Gregory . but Millwall have bid around £100,000 also for the 25-year-old. Chelsea are continuing to monitor Youri Tielemans at Anderlecht. They are not alone, however, as Manchester City, Tottenham, United and Arsenal have also watched his progress since he became Belgium's youngest Champions League debutant at the age of 16 years, four months and 25 days last October. Now 17, Roma have also made enquiries about the midfielder as have Juventus, which may prompt some bidding for his services. Keeping watch: Many of the Premier League's big boys have their eye on Anderlecht's Youri Tielemans . Sunderland . have made enquiries for Argentinian striker Luciano Vietto. The skilful . 20-year-old forward has already been compared to the other diminutive . strikers that have come out of Argentina but wants to make his own name . by impressing in the Premier League.
