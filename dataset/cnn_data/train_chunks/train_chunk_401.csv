"Blizzard Entertainment, maker of ""World of Warcraft"" and ""StarCraft II,"" has been blamed by some for creating games that are so addictive people can't turn away. On a recent trip to South Korea, CNN met with people who have been in treatment centers for gaming addiction who said they played some of the company's most popular games at the exclusion of other activities -- foregoing sleeping and eating to keep playing. In extreme cases, people in South Korea have died after playing online games for days on end without stopping for rest, according to news reports. Psychologists disagree about the merits of gaming and Internet addiction; the United States has called for more study of the topic and does not currently list Internet addiction as an official disorder on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Blizzard Entertainment issued the following statement to CNN concerning allegations that its games promote addictive behavior. Among the highlights: The company says it's games can be enjoyed ""with minimal time commitments,"" and it says ""it's never our intent for our players to play our games to the exclusion of other activities."" Take a look at the full statement and let us know what you think in the comments: . ""Games are meant to be a source of entertainment, and as with movies, books, sports, and music, we recognize that different people participate for different durations. With any form of entertainment, we feel it's important to exercise personal responsibility and be mindful of outside obligations. It's never our intent for our players to play our games to the exclusion of other activities. We also feel that a person's day-to-day life should take precedence over any form of entertainment and that it's ultimately up to the individual game player or his or her parent or guardian to determine how long he or she should spend playing any game. It's important to note that players are able to jump into our games and accomplish appreciable and fulfilling goals, such as competing in matches, completing quests or matches, purchasing or selling equipment for their characters, hunting monsters, and socializing with friends, in a short amount of time, making our games enjoyable with minimal time commitments. ""Our ultimate goal as a game company has always been to make the best games that we can possibly make. With games like 'World of Warcraft' and 'StarCraft II,' we feel we've created rewarding experiences that players worldwide are able to enjoy at their own leisure.""","Blizzard: ""It's never our intent for our players to play our games to the exclusion of other activities""

"(CNN) -- Last week Apple announced that it is closing a serious security vulnerability in the iPhone. It used to be that the phone's encryption only protected a small amount of the data, and Apple had the ability to bypass security on the rest of it. From now on, all the phone's data is protected. It can no longer be accessed by criminals, governments, or rogue employees. Access to it can no longer be demanded by totalitarian governments. A user's iPhone data is now more secure. To hear U.S. law enforcement respond, you'd think Apple's move heralded an unstoppable crime wave. See, the FBI had been using that vulnerability to get into peoples' iPhones. In the words of cyberlaw professor Orin Kerr, ""How is the public interest served by a policy that only thwarts lawful search warrants?"" Ah, but that's the thing: You can't build a ""back door"" that only the good guys can walk through. Encryption protects against cybercriminals, industrial competitors, the Chinese secret police and the FBI. You're either vulnerable to eavesdropping by any of them, or you're secure from eavesdropping from all of them. Back-door access built for the good guys is routinely used by the bad guys. In 2005, some unknown group surreptitiously used the lawful-intercept capabilities built into the Greek cell phone system. The same thing happened in Italy in 2006. In 2010, Chinese hackers subverted an intercept system Google had put into Gmail to comply with U.S. government surveillance requests. Back doors in our cell phone system are currently being exploited by the FBI and unknown others. This doesn't stop the FBI and Justice Department from pumping up the fear. Attorney General Eric Holder threatened us with kidnappers and sexual predators. The former head of the FBI's criminal investigative division went even further, conjuring up kidnappers who are also sexual predators. And, of course, terrorists. FBI Director James Comey claimed that Apple's move allows people to place themselves beyond the law"" and also invoked that now overworked ""child kidnapper."" John J. Escalante, chief of detectives for the Chicago police department now holds the title of most hysterical: ""Apple will become the phone of choice for the pedophile."" It's all bluster. Of the 3,576 major offenses for which warrants were granted for communications interception in 2013, exactly one involved kidnapping. And, more importantly, there's no evidence that encryption hampers criminal investigations in any serious way. In 2013, encryption foiled the police nine times, up from four in 2012 -- and the investigations proceeded in some other way. This is why the FBI's scare stories tend to wither after public scrutiny. A former FBI assistant director wrote about a kidnapped man who would never have been found without the ability of the FBI to decrypt an iPhone, only to retract the point hours later because it wasn't true. We've seen this game before. During the crypto wars of the 1990s, FBI Director Louis Freeh and others would repeatedly use the example of mobster John Gotti to illustrate why the ability to tap telephones was so vital. But the Gotti evidence was collected using a room bug, not a telephone tap. And those same scary criminal tropes were trotted out then, too. Back then we called them the Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse: pedophiles, kidnappers, drug dealers, and terrorists. Nothing has changed. Strong encryption has been around for years. Both Apple's FileVault and Microsoft's BitLocker encrypt the data on computer hard drives. PGP encrypts email. Off-the-Record  encrypts chat sessions. HTTPS Everywhere encrypts your browsing. Android phones already come with encryption built-in. There are literally thousands of encryption products without back doors for sale, and some have been around for decades. Even if the U.S. bans the stuff, foreign companies will corner the market because many of us have legitimate needs for security. Law enforcement has been complaining about ""going dark"" for decades now. In the 1990s, they convinced Congress to pass a law requiring phone companies to ensure that phone calls would remain tappable even as they became digital. They tried and failed to ban strong encryption and mandate back doors for their use. The FBI tried and failed again to ban strong encryption in 2010. Now, in the post-Snowden era, they're about to try again. We need to fight this. Strong encryption protects us from a panoply of threats. It protects us from hackers and criminals. It protects our businesses from competitors and foreign spies. It protects people in totalitarian governments from arrest and detention. This isn't just me talking: The FBI also recommends you encrypt your data for security. As for law enforcement? The recent decades have given them an unprecedented ability to put us under surveillance and access our data. Our cell phones provide them with a detailed history of our movements. Our call records, email history, buddy lists, and Facebook pages tell them who we associate with. The hundreds of companies that track us on the Internet tell them what we're thinking about. Ubiquitous cameras capture our faces everywhere. And most of us back up our iPhone data on iCloud, which the FBI can still get a warrant for. It truly is the golden age of surveillance. After considering the issue, Orin Kerr rethought his position, looking at this in terms of a technological-legal trade-off. I think he's right. Given everything that has made it easier for governments and others to intrude on our private lives, we need both technological security and legal restrictions to restore the traditional balance between government access and our security/privacy. More companies should follow Apple's lead and make encryption the easy-to-use default. And let's wait for some actual evidence of harm before we acquiesce to police demands for reduced security.","Schneier: Apple closed serious security vulnerability in the iPhone, enabling wide encryption .

"Shezanne Cassim has a renewed appreciation for freedom after spending nine months behind bars in the United Arab Emirates. The 29-year-old from Minnesota had been working as a business consultant in opulent Dubai before authorities arrested him and four friends in April over a parody video about wannabe gangsters. ""It was just great to see my family relieved,"" Cassim, who was released last week, told CNN's ""New Day"" on Wednesday about his first day home in the United States. ""(I) went home and we just talked. Didn't do anything special, but that was (what was) special about  it. It was nice to sleep on a real bed and just enjoy (the basic comforts) that we all take for granted."" Cassim's video depicts a ""combat school"" in the Dubai district of Satwa, where the ""gangsters"" are trained. The training includes how to throw sandals at targets, use clothing accessories as whips and call on the phone for backup. The beginning of the video clearly explains that it's fictional. But without warning, Cassim said, he was interrogated and arrested in Dubai before being transferred to a maximum-security prison in Abu Dhabi. Last month, UAE authorities sentenced Cassim and two of his friends to one year in prison for defaming the country's image. For months, Cassim said, he and others detained in the case didn't know why they were behind bars. ""We had no idea of what our crime was. We had no idea how long we'd be in prison for. We weren't actually told what our crime was until five months later, after we were taken in,"" he said. ""Even then, we heard rumors of the charges, and they kept on changing."" UAE authorities said the video violated newly enacted cybercrime laws and posed a threat to national security. Back home, family members never stopped fighting for his freedom. They said ""Shez"" simply made a 19-minute video that pokes fun at a clique of Dubai teens influenced by hip-hop culture. ""My eldest-brother instincts kicked in, and it was a feeling of ... do everything we can to get him out,""  Cassim's brother, Shervon Cassim, said on ""New Day."" As word of the ordeal spread, even lawmakers and celebrities took up his cause. Comedian Will Ferrell posted a video asking for his release. Authorities released Cassim early for time served and for good behavior. He arrived home in Minnesota last Thursday. In his CNN interview, he said he had no idea how much attention his situation had gotten until he returned. ""I knew that my family had gone to the media, but I wasn't really sure how widespread it was,"" he said. Shortly after his return, he said he had done nothing wrong, saying he had been ""tried in a textbook kangaroo court"" and convicted without evidence. On Wednesday, Cassim said he agreed -- up to a point -- with comments that UAE Prime Minister Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum made to the BBC, saying his detention was a mistake. ""To a limited extent, I do agree with him that it was a mistake, but really I feel that it was more than just a mistake. Nine months in prison is not just a mistake,"" Cassim said. He said he believes the reason for his detention was clear. ""Due to the political situation there, they're scared of democracy. They wanted to send a message to the UAE public, saying, 'Look what we'll do to people who do just a silly YouTube video, so imagine if you do something that's actually critical of the government.' It's a warning message, and we're scapegoats,"" he said. Cassim's brother said the family hasn't yet decided whether to take legal action against the UAE. ""We have a great attorney, so all options are on the table,"" Shervon Cassim said. When asked whether he would ever go back to Dubai, Cassim -- who moved to Dubai after college in 2006 to work for PricewaterhouseCoopers -- said Wednesday that he's ""still thinking about that."" ""I do care about the city, and I believe it can be better,"" he said.","Family has not yet decided if they will take legal action against UAE, brother says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Nancy Pelosi says there are 14 million reasons why Chuck Schumer is wrong. In an intraparty feud about political strategy, the House minority leader on Tuesday called out the No. 3 Senate Democratic leader for saying that it was a mistake for Democrats to focus on passing health care reform in 2010. ""After passing the stimulus, Democrats should have continued to propose middle class-oriented programs and built on the partial success of the stimulus, but unfortunately Democrats blew the opportunity the American people gave them,"" Schumer said in a remarks focused on political messaging heading into 2016 at the National Press Club. New York's Schumer added, ""We took their mandate and put all our focus on the wrong problem -- health care reform."" When asked whether she agreed with Schumer's assessment, California's Pelosi didn't mince words in a written statement provided to CNN. ""We come here to do a job, not keep a job. There are more than 14 million reasons why that's wrong,"" Pelosi said. The 14 million figure Pelosi cites references those Americans who now have health care coverage since the law was enacted. It adds together those who have signed up through health care exchanges, those allowed to say on their parent's health care plans through age 26 and those getting coverage through the expansion of the Medicaid program. Pelosi's office also maintained that the Affordable Care Act has had a positive economic effect in terms of bending the cost curve over the long term. They also took issue with the notion that the House, under Pelosi's speakership, wasn't focused on the economy after Obama was elected. An aide noted that the House passed a jobs bill the Democratic-led Senate did not take up, and the original version of the stimulus bill the House passed was larger than the final version the Senate approved. Later Tuesday, an White House official also weighed in. As did a couple of former White House officials. An aide to Schumer said the New York Democrat has hinted at this concern in the past. Schumer supported the Affordable Care Act, but from a political timing standpoint, he thought the party could have done other things before turning to health care. But in moving to stake out the party's message going forward, Schumer put himself at odds with Pelosi, who was one of the fiercest champions of passing the legislation through the House in 2010. The controversial bill passed without a single Republican vote, and the House GOP filed a lawsuit last week to challenge President Barack Obama's authority to make changes to the law. CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report .","Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York has questioned Democrats' timing in passing health reform .

"Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, Cal Perry describes speaking with Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal in a secret location in Damascus, Syria. Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal hinted to CNN at a potential shift in the group's policy toward Israel. DAMASCUS, Syria (CNN)  -- Sitting in a room with the top Hamas leader -- a man Israel would prefer dead -- is not an easy feeling, knowing that at any second a missile could shatter the building, killing everyone inside, myself included. And, of course, it is no surprise why Israel has Khaled Meshaal at the top of its hit list. He is known to have ordered bombings that have targeted Israeli civilians, blowing up cafés, markets and malls across Israel. CNN senior correspondent Nic Robertson and I recently sat down with Meshaal in a secret Hamas ""safe house"" in the middle of Damascus. The walls were adorned with the pictures of Hamas members who have carried out suicide bombings that have killed hundreds of Israelis. We sipped coffee uneasily as we waited for Meshaal to emerge for an interview that was more than three years in the making. Suddenly and without warning, the Hamas leader appeared. Dressed in a suit, he smiled as he greeted us. ""You are more than welcome,"" he said in broken English, a common phrase you hear in the Middle East. He then explained he was more than willing to discuss anything we wished, ranging from a captive Israeli soldier to the peace process to U.S. foreign policy. The still abducted Israeli soldier, Cpl. Gilad Shalit, was a key part of the interview, and Meshaal was more than willing to talk about him.  Watch Meshaal talk about Gilad Shalit » . ""We did not blackmail Israel, and we gave free information to Gilad Shalit's father and his family that Gilad Shalit is still alive. When he asked us to bring him a medical glasses for his sight, we did so as humanitarian duty. We treat Gilad Shalit in a humanitarian way that is in line with the Palestinians' morals,"" he said. Read Israeli father reject Hamas claim . Robertson began to ask about Hamas' view of the United States and the Bush administration's foreign policy. Suddenly, Meshaal hinted at a potential shift in Hamas' policy toward Israel. The slightest chance of change, of course, depends on events, according to the Hamas leader. ""Hamas changed a lot and great efforts have been made to conform with the realistic positions of Palestinians and Arabs. When Hamas says with other Palestinians forces that we demand for a Palestinian country as the border was back in 1967. Isn't this a development change?"" he said. Shortly after the interview began, the room filled up with his guards and those that work with Meshaal. They wanted to hear what he had to say as much as we did. In the middle of the interview, one of his guards handed him a cell phone. He had a brief conversation and apologized to us for the interruption. ""Who was that?"" I asked one of my contacts. The answer: ""A very powerful Arab leader."" I asked, ""Who?"" My contact shook his head. It was clear at that moment, I would never know who it was that called. During the interview, it was impossible not to look at our surroundings. This was a safe house where the leader of Hamas avoids assassination attempts. The safe house was a simple building. It reminded me of something one of my Hamas contacts said to me weeks earlier in a neighboring country, ""I am just a poor man, serving a cause I know to be just."" There were two levels to this safe house -- upstairs was a reception room with elaborate decorations, framed pictures of the late Sheik Ahmed Yassin and the Al-Aqsa mosque. The lower level of the safe house was only three rooms. Only the basics exist in the place. A few tables, couches and plastic chairs. Hamas security was everywhere -- checking everything and keeping a keen eye on us. Just a request to use the bathroom involved an escort. Meshaal is a complicated, calculating man. To his people, he is seen as a humanitarian and as the leader of Hamas. To Israel, the United States and a list of other nations, he is seen as a terrorist. Israel has openly blamed him for terror attacks across their country. They also say he is responsible for the abduction of Shalit. On June 25, 2006, Shalit was abducted by Hamas. Three days later, Israel flew four jets over Syrian President Bashar Assad's palace -- a clear message to both Syria and Meshaal. Shimon Peres, the former prime minister and current president of Israel, blamed Meshaal, marking him as a prime target on Israel's strike list. Not necessarily a surprise -- they have tried killing him before. Next month will mark the 10-year anniversary of an assassination attempt on Meshaal's life by the Israeli intelligence organization Mossad. While Meshaal was living in Jordan in 1997, Mossad agents breached the building in which he was sleeping. They injected poison into his ear. The Jordanian authorities quickly discovered what had happened and through pressure from both the Jordanian king and some U.S. officials, Israel eventually provided Meshaal with the antidote he needed to survive. ""I am 51 years old, and the past 10 years have been a gift from above,"" he told CNN. Which is why he now resides in Syria, living in an undisclosed location, using a variety of secret safe houses from which he leads Hamas. When he speaks, Palestinians and Israelis equally listen to every word, because he may be the only man who can assure the Palestinians will honor a cease-fire with Israel if one is ever agreed upon. He has led Hamas ever since an Israeli missile literally split Hamas's spiritual leader Yassin in half, killing him in downtown Gaza in 2004. Of course, because he is such a target, gaining access to Meshaal is nearly impossible, especially for a Western news organization. Why he agreed to talk to CNN at this moment remains a mystery to me. But after months and years of persistence, the day had finally arrived. Robertson and I met in Damascus. We started Friday in a hotel lobby, with a member of Hamas sitting at a table with the two of us. As is tradition in the Arab world, we had a cup of coffee while talking with this man, one of my Hamas contacts. Our phones and BlackBerries were surrendered -- all electronic equipment except the cameras handed over, put into bags, and our names written on the bags. From the hotel, we were escorted through the streets of Damascus, winding our way through narrow streets, constantly looking in the rear-view mirror. Suddenly the car stopped and we were hurried inside. The security was as tight as it could possibly be. We were searched thoroughly. ""It's not that we don't trust you. It's that you may not know who has been tampering with your things,"" one of the Hamas members said. The interview with Meshaal lasted around 90 minutes, but it seemed to fly by far faster. He discussed the role of Saudi Arabia and how Hamas' relationship plays into wider regional politics. He spoke of mistakes he believes the Americans have made -- especially not backing the Hamas government in Gaza, which was democratically elected -- and much, much more. ""Israel is even destroying the interests of [the] international community and for this I believe that the Americans should change their policy and to knock the right door. America is still knocking the wrong door,"" he said. I know one thing for sure: Everyone he mentioned and spoke of will listen carefully to each word he said. Palestinians and the Arab world will cling to his words, but perhaps his most captivated audience will be the state of Israel.

"The video of Mitt Romney deriding the 47% of Americans ""who are dependent upon government"" re-ignited a debate about social class in America this week, exactly one year after the Occupy Wall Street movement first took to the streets to protest rising inequality. At a $50,000-a-plate fundraiser, Romney scoffed at that 47% ""who pay no income tax"" and ""believe they are victims."" Romney's comments bothered many Americans because he seemed to be attacking some of the most vulnerable members of our society. Aside from whether they actually ""believe they are victims,"" research has consistently shown that people lower on the social totem pole suffer significantly worse mental and physical health than those better off, including higher rates of heart disease, depression, suicide, several forms of cancer and death. Yet a new line of psychological research suggests there's another victim of inequality: the rich themselves. In fact, Romney's comments could make him the poster child for this research. Opinion: It's not all over for Romney . In a series of studies, researchers have found that attaining high social status impairs key social and emotional skills. For instance, a 2010 study published in Psychological Science  found  that people of higher socioeconomic status were worse at reading other people's emotions, a skill known as ""empathic accuracy,"" a basic part of empathy. In a follow-up experiment, the researchers -- including Dacher Keltner, my colleague at UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center -- made people feel higher or lower on the social ladder. Regardless of their actual socioeconomic status, people temporarily made to feel upper class had a harder time reading other people's emotions; people made to feel lower class showed better empathy. This suggests that there's something about the experience of high status that hurts our ability to connect with others emotionally. Other studies have suggested that high status makes people less compassionate, less generous and less interested in connecting with others in general . Here's why the people at that $50,000-a-plate dinner should care about this research: The skills that seem to be impaired by elevated status are the same skills that research has strongly linked to leading a happy, meaningful life. So as the super rich in this country assume an ever-loftier status above the 47% (or the 99%), they risk depleting their own reserves of happiness. ""Being compassionate, having empathic accuracy, being trusting and cooperative -- these are keys to social connection and, in turn, happiness,"" says UC Berkeley post-doctoral researcher Paul Piff, the lead author of a study that found that people of higher socioeconomic status were less willing to share money with a stranger or make charitable donations. (However, when they were made to feel lower status, they became more generous; the opposite was true for people made to feel high status -- they became stingier.) Opinion: Romney better off as a Latino? Indeed, perhaps the dominant finding to emerge from positive psychology research over the past decade is that our happiness (and health) is largely determined by the quality and quantity of our social connections. Perhaps that's why ""pro-social"" behaviors and emotions -- compassion, empathy, altruism -- have been so strongly linked to happiness. Consider: Research by Sonja Lyubomirsky, a leading happiness researcher, has consistently found that people report feeling happier after doing nice things for others. Several neuroscience studies have found that giving to others activates pleasure regions of the brain. Research by psychologists Lara Aknin and Elizabeth Dunn has even suggested that spending money on others makes you happier than spending on yourself. And a Canadian study published last year, led by Myriam Mongrain, found that after people supported others compassionately for just five to 15 minutes every day for a week, the compassionate people reported significant gains in happiness and self-esteem six months later. These findings suggest an explanation for why, once Americans attain an annual income of $75,000, more money doesn't seem to bring more happiness: Beyond that point, perhaps our elevated sense of status brings with it the harmful social and emotional effects that undercut the joys of more money. Sure enough, one recent study found that people who were wealthier, or were just temporarily made to feel wealthier, were worse at savoring everyday pleasures, a key to happiness, according to prior research. The research linking wealth and empathy certainly suggests one reason why Romney has seemed to demonstrate callousness and trouble connecting with voters on the campaign trail, with his comments about the 47% being just the latest example. In light of this research, the video of Romney carries another troubling implication: that inequality may be self-perpetuating, making the rich less likely to feel compassion for the poor, thereby increasing the economic gap between them. Opinion: Romney, Americans are not moochers . But we probably don't need to read too much research to appreciate how this empathy gap is bad for Romney's happiness. Just look at a new Pew Research Center poll , which shows that he trails President Obama by 8 percentage points, and 43 points in the area of ""connects well with ordinary Americans.""

"Jessie Frank had spent the entire day trying to get home. When a man in a collared shirt and tie placed her carry-on luggage in an overhead compartment and pointed her in the direction of her seat, she didn't give it a second thought.  She assumed he must have been an off-duty pilot. ""As the plane descended into Atlanta, the flight attendant announced that there was a special guest on board,"" wrote Frank, in a letter to Delta Air Lines CEO Richard Anderson. ""He was riding in a jump seat, because he had given up his place to allow one more person on that flight. That special guest was you: Richard Anderson, CEO of Delta."" After she landed, Frank shared her story and gratitude in an open letter on her Facebook page. Since posting the letter, it's been shared nearly 1,500 times, commented on dozens of times, and received nearly 200 ""likes."" In her open letter to Anderson, Frank mentioned that she really wanted to pick up her daughter, who suffers from Type 1 diabetes, from camp. While someone else could have picked up her daughter, ""pick-up day gives me a glimpse into that special world where she's just like everyone else, she's a little bit of a different person for the rest of the day,"" wrote Frank. ""By the next day, it's back to the harsh realities of managing a difficult, deadly, incurable disease that kills 1 in 20 before the age of 18."" Initially coming from New York, Frank had been rerouted to Washington, and had waited for hours at Reagan National Airport before being led down the gateway, then told there were no seats available, and then waived back into the plane. Rushing to make it home before Friday, Frank was worried she wouldn't make it home in time to pick up her 12-year-old daughter. Frank told CNN that while she's not a ""big Facebook person,"" she thought it was important to share her incredible experience. She's read up on Anderson since that night, and says he seems like the ""Sam Walton"" of the airlines. Wanting to share her story with Delta, Frank reposted her letter on Delta's Facebook page. Since June 17, it's gotten 194 ""likes"" and dozens of comments, including a personal thanks from a Delta employee named Cecelia. Saying she couldn't remember the last time she flew an airline other than Delta, Frank says the comments she's received are 99% positive, and has been overwhelmed with the responses. While Frank doesn't expect to hear from Anderson, she hopes her open letter ended up on his desk, and that he knows how much she appreciated his gesture. Anderson was returning to Atlanta from a business trip,said Delta spokeswoman Betsy Talton.","Delta CEO gives up his seat to passenger Jessie Frank .

"The Washington Redskins, stinging from a letter by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and dozens of fellow Democrats calling on the league to force the team to change its racist name, apparently fumbled a desperate Twitter appeal to fans. ""Tweet @SenatorReid to show your #RedskinsPride and tell him what the team means to you,"" the maligned team wrote to its 305,000 Twitter followers on Thursday. But be careful what you ask for, especially on Twitter. ""This team has ZERO self-awareness.lol,"" one person tweeted. ""Lifelong 'Skins fan and I strongly believe it is time to change the name,"" wrote another. ""How do you not see what a bad idea this is,"" said another tweet. ""Please don't do this to yourself. DON'T,"" another person wrote. Faiz Shakir, Reid's digital director, said the majority of responses favored a name change. ""In the five to 10 minutes following it, we were pleasantly surprised by the overwhelming outpouring  of opposition to the team,"" he said. ""It was 50 to one at one point."" Redskins spokesman Tony Wyllie said the claim reminded him of the famously incorrect ""Dewey defeats Truman"" banner headline. ""They declared victory within the hour and as the night went on, more and more momentum swung our way,"" he said. ""That's the good thing about our country. People can express themselves and have a healthy dialogue."" In a letter to the NFL last week, the senators stepped up pressure on the league to force the Washington Redskins to change their name by invoking the heated racial controversy triggered by basketball's Donald Sterling. ""I would hope that the team does reflect on why there was so much organic opposition to the name,"" Shakir said Friday.  ""I don't know if they're living in bunker mentality over there and don't realize that this name has caused so much anger. But if they are in that bunker mentality, hopefully (Thursday's Twitter response) causes them to climb out of that and see the fact that there is a lot of deep-seeded opposition and anger to the name."" Responding to the senators' letter, Redskins President Bruce Allen invited Reid to a game to ""witness first-hand that the Washington Redskins are a positive, unifying force for our community in a city and region that is divided on so many levels."" Allen said the term Redskins originated as a Native American expression of solidarity, and that the team logo was designed by Native Americans. Joel Barkin, a spokesman for Oneida Indian Nation of central New York, said the team's Twitter appeal demonstrated how much the Redskins underestimate the passions surrounding the issue. ""This is a complete disregard for those that are calling for a change,"" he said. ""It's a fundamental misreading of the issue at large."" Last week's letter, signed by 50 Democratic senators and released by Reid, urged pro football's commissioner, Roger Goodell, to take action over concerns that continued use of the Redskins brand is offensive to Native Americans. They asked Goodell to follow the lead of NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who took tough measures against Sterling after the longtime owner of the league's Los Angeles Clippers was recorded making comments offensive to African-Americans. ""Today, we urge you and the National Football League to send the same clear message as the NBA did: that racism and bigotry have no place in professional sports,"" the letter said. Responding to the Senate letter, the NFL said last week it has ""long demonstrated a commitment to progressive leadership"" on diversity. ""The intent of the team's name has always been to present a strong, positive and respectful image. The name is not used by the team or the NFL in any other context, though we respect those that view it differently,"" the league statement said.

"Lindsey Vonn's comeback to the World Cup skiing circuit was put on hold Friday as she faces a race against time to compete in the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The American superstar was set to return to competitive action at Beaver Creak next week, but suffered a major setback in training in Colorado Tuesday when she suffered a partial tear of one of her reconstructed knee ligaments. ""While her rehab is progressing, she is not at a point where she will be able to ski next week and is unfortunately withdrawing from the race at Beaver Creek,"" spokesman Lewis Kay said. ""She will continue to do therapy with an eye at racing in Lake Louise,"" he added. That event takes place on the weekend of December 6-8 with two downhills and a giant slalom on the program. Vonn, the reigning Olympic champion in downhill, is focused on defending her title in the Sochi Games which start on February 7, hoping to emulate the feat of compatriot Picabo Street  at the 1998 Games in Nagano. She suffered the original injury in a crashing fall at the world championships in Austria last February and has been receiving treatment from Colarodo-based orthopedic surgeon Bill Sterett. ""Lindsey is recovering very quickly from abrasions to her face and contusions to her shoulder blade,"" Sterett reported in comments released through Kay. ""Beyond that, she has a stable knee with an MRI finding of a partial tear of her ACL graft. With therapy, she is progressing well while not losing any of the strength she worked so hard to achieve.""

"While many people spent Christmas Eve doing last-minute shopping, two American astronauts had a more challenging matter to attend to Tuesday. In orbit more than 200 miles above Earth, flight engineers Rick Mastracchio and Mike Hopkins embarked on a spacewalk Tuesday morning to repair part of the International Space Station's cooling system. The spacewalk ended at 2:23 p.m. ET Tuesday and lasted 7 hours and 30 minutes, NASA said. More than four hours into the job, the two astronauts had successfully bolted a replacement ammonia pump module into its location and were working to connect lines to allow the ammonia to flow, NASA said in a tweet. There was a slight kink in the work when one of the fluid lines tangled. The astronauts untangled it, but when they did, the line released some ammonia flakes that landed on their space suits. It was not a leak, but some residue, NASA spokesman John Ira Petty said. The ammonia that landed on the spacesuits will require the spacewalkers to air out their suits before going back into the station, but is otherwise not a big deal, he said. The two engineers were carrying out the second in a series of expeditions needed to replace a malfunctioning pump, which circulates ammonia through loops outside the station to keep equipment cool. The pump developed problems December 11 when an internal valve stuck in an incorrect position. The space station's life support system remains up and running, but operations were cut back as a result of the problem, NASA said. It is the second Christmas Eve spacewalk in history, according to NASA. The two astronauts spent about 5½ hours outside the space station Saturday working to remove the problematic pump. Spacesuit problem . Mastracchio used a different spacesuit after a small amount of water leaked into the cooling system of the one he wore Saturday. NASA said the issue with the suit, which happened at the end of the spacewalk, was unrelated to a problem experienced in July when water pooled in an Italian astronaut's helmet, causing a spacewalk to be cut short. ""Both Mastracchio and Hopkins reported dry conditions repeatedly throughout Saturday's activities and the two were never in danger,"" the agency said. NASA had installed new safeguards, including snorkels inside the spacesuits that would allow astronauts to take breaths if water formed and they had to return to the space station. Tuesday's spacewalk was the 176th to support the space station's assembly and maintenance, according to NASA. The previous Christmas Eve spacewalk took place in 1999, the agency said, when Discovery astronauts Steve Smith and John Grunsfeld spent more than eight hours refitting parts of the Hubble Space Telescope. The others on board the International Space Station at the moment include Russian cosmonauts Mikhail Tyurin, Sergey Ryazanskiy and Oleg Kotov and Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata.","NASA: The spacewalk has concluded, lasting 7 hours and 30 minutes .

"Clear skies allowed for more evacuations and rescues in flood-devastated Colorado on Friday, but the forecast through Sunday called for more heavy rain. Even after the last of the storms, authorities can't say how long it will take to reach residents who will remain isolated by devastated roads. The confirmed death toll reached four when Boulder County officials recovered the body of a woman who had been swept away after getting out of her vehicle Thursday, Sheriff Joe Pelle said. Authorities already had recovered the body of a man who left the same car and tried to save the woman. One other death had been reported in Boulder County and one occurred in El Paso County. President Barack Obama declared an emergency for Boulder, Larimer and El Paso counties, FEMA announced Friday. The declaration allowed FEMA to bring in four rescue teams, the largest ever deployment in Colorado, officials said. More heavy rain is forecast through Sunday for the region, on top of the 15 inches some parts of the state have already received. ""This isn't over,"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. On Friday, National Guard troops using ""high-profile"" trucks to wade through water were evacuating the entire Boulder County town of Lyons, which had been cut off since the flooding began Wednesday night. ""It just really felt like God came down and saved us. It felt great,"" Melinda Villa said of the National Guard's arrival at the Lyons apartment where she was stranded with her 1-month-old infant. She said, ""I just felt like I was trapped. No phone, no water, barely any formula for my baby, barely any food for us."" Jonathan Linenberger described a Noah's Ark-style evacuation as he, his fiancee and four dogs and three cats greeted the National Guard truck. ""We had to go (through) knee-deep water, at least. We had to wade our animals across into the truck to get them there,"" said Linenberger. ""That was the first thing you can grab, your loved ones -- and that's what we have."" The National Guard also was evacuating the entire population -- 285 people -- from the town of Jamestown by helicopter, CNN affiliate KCNC-TV reported. Four helicopters were being used for rescues in Boulder County Friday, Pelle said. The sheriff said helicopters also may have to be used indefinitely to deliver food and water to residents along damaged rural roads. ""Please know we're working hard,"" Pelle told residents who might see his televised news conference. ""We're concerned about you. But you're going to have to be patient. Please know this is an unprecented event."" About 80 people in Boulder County have been reported missing or ""unaccounted for"" by relatives, Sheriff's Cmdr. Heidi Prentup said. The University of Colorado canceled Saturday's scheduled football game against Fresno State. In Larimer County to the north, Sheriff Justin Smith surveyed the heavily damaged Big Thompson Canyon by air Friday. Some people remain stranded in homes there, he said, adding, ""How we're going to get them out -- it's going to take a damn long time."" However, he said the break in the rain Friday allowed school buses to begin evacuating students who had been stranded at a school. Smith described widespread damage to roads. He estimated 17 miles of Highway 34, a major artery, will need to be rebuilt. Lyons rescue . The National Guard effort to get residents out of Lyons began shortly after daybreak. About 100 troops in 21 heavy vehicles able to ford high waters streamed into the city to begin moving residents out, Gov. John Hickenlooper said. Residents had been entirely cut off, without water or sewer service,  in many cases without electricity, facing what Fire Chief J.J. Hoffman said in a Facebook posting was a ""very large disaster."" It was unclear when the evacuation would be complete. ""I encourage all of you -- stay strong!"" Hoffman wrote on the fire department's Facebook page. ""We will make it through this, we are here for you and doing the absolute best we can with the resources we have to get to each and every one of you!"" As Lyons evacuees arrived at a shelter set up in a church in nearby Longmont, they told stories of houses ripped off their foundations as the St. Vrain Creek turned into a violent river, CNN affiliate KMGH reported. KMGH reporter Theresa Marchetta said evacuees also described homes dangling off cliffs. Some people in Lyons still were awaiting rescue, evacuees said, and some residents had chosen to stay. Marchetta said evacuees told her there had been a town meeting and residents were checking on each other to ensure no one was missing. Danger elsewhere . State transportation officials issued an emergency alert to residents in some of the hardest-hit counties, warning them to stay off roads because many are unstable and could give way without notice. They also closed Interstate 25 from the Wyoming line south to Denver. Part of Interstate 70 also was shut down. In Fort Collins, some residents had been urged to leave their homes. And in Denver, police responded when a man was swept into a drainage pipe with his dog. Both were saved after traveling two blocks in the water, police said on Twitter. The rains sent virtually every waterway in Boulder County coursing out of its banks, and massive water flows washed away roads and bridges, flooded homes and stressed numerous other bridges. In the early hours Friday, flood sirens sounded in Boulder County as emergency officials feared that debris-caked canyons might give way and send another wall of water crashing through the city of Boulder and neighboring communities. ""All residents are warned to go to higher ground immediately due to the potential for flash flooding along the creek,"" Boulder's Office of Emergency Management said. Emergency management warned that ""there are mudslides at the mouth of Boulder Canyon 400 feet long and four feet deep as the sides of the canyon give way due to the saturation from the days-long rain."" Authorities continued to warn of the danger of mudslides Friday night. HLNTV.com: 8 stunning Colorado flooding Twitter photos . Hickenlooper warned an extensive recovery is ahead.

"Like Mitt Romney and John McCain, Hillary Clinton will (probably) run for president in 2016 as a grandparent. This seemingly unremarkable fact has triggered a spasm of media self-analysis: is Clinton the victim of a sexist double standard? It's a question that has been -- and will be -- asked often. We keep asking, because we refuse to see the plain answer. Hillary Clinton is not the victim of a double standard. She is the beneficiary of a double standard. Consider the grandmother question. If elected in 2016, Hillary Clinton will be the second oldest president in U.S. history, after Ronald Reagan. At age 69, will she be too old? That was a question people felt free to discuss when John McCain ran for president. CNN.com reported on June 15, 2008: . ""Listen to some Democrats, and you'll think the 71-year-old Arizona senator is a man lost in a perpetual fog. He is 'confused' and has 'lost his bearings' or is 'out of touch.'""  The ""lost his bearings"" innuendo was used by candidate Barack Obama himself, in a May 2008 interview with Wolf Blitzer. Nor was age deemed an inappropriate question in earlier elections. CNN reported: . ""Roughly one-third of respondents in most recent national polls say that McCain's age could impede his ability to effectively govern the nation. ... Approximately one-third of voters expressed similar concerns about Bob Dole's age in 1996 and Ronald Reagan's age in 1984. (Dole was 73 years old in 1996. Reagan was 73 in 1984.) ... (O)lder voters tend to worry more about the age issue than other voters."" Yet a question that commentators generally agreed was relevant in 1984, 1996 and 2008 is a question that Hillary Clinton supporters now deem insulting, offensive and unfair to women. In a roundup of the question, BBC News found room for the following quote: . ""Both men and women face age discrimination, but it's no secret that, for women, ageism mixes easily with sexism. ... And obsessing over a woman's year of birth is often a slightly more respectable substitute for the latter."" In a headline, the liberal website Salon likewise dismissed the issue of Clinton's age as ""sexist."" The column underneath rationalized why: . ""Putting an age limit (even a pundit-prescribed one) on the presidency will have a disparate impact on female candidates, given that most are older than their male counterparts when they start their political careers."" In other words: as between Hillary Clinton on the one hand, and John McCain or Bob Dole on the other, the same standard is a double standard. The same method applies to the discussion of Hillary Clinton's marriage. The Clinton camp's view seems to be: When it's helpful to Hillary, her marriage is urgently relevant; when that marriage might be politically harmful, it's sexist and insulting to mention it. When Hillary Clinton sought the Democratic nomination in 2008, she argued that her tenure as first lady ought to qualify as a bona fide job credential. She told National Public Radio in March of that year: . ""I represented our government and our country in more than 80 countries, and I know that people are nitpicking and that's fair -- it's in a campaign. But compare my experience, even after the nitpicking, with Sen. (Barack) Obama's. I mean, let's look at this objectively here, and I think my experience is much more preparatory for the job that awaits."" Yet when Republican likely candidate Rand Paul suggested that Hillary Clinton ought to be held to account for some of the scandals of her husband's administration, Team Clinton went into outrage mode. The influential columnist David Corn (Mother Jones/MSNBC) chuckled, ""Paul's waving of the Monica flag has been dismissed by pundits on the right and left as odd and irrelevant. ..."" But the truth is just the opposite of what Clinton and her team would like remembered. While the first lady contributed comparatively little to the foreign and economic record of the Bill Clinton years, she was arguably the central mastermind of the Clinton presidency's scandal management. A 2007 biography revealed that it was Hillary Clinton's team that hired the private investigators assigned to ""destroy"" former Clinton mistress Gennifer Flowers when that matter went public in 1992. New papers from the Clinton library depict Hillary Clinton pioneering the attack on Monica Lewinsky as a ""narcissistic loony tune."" (Until it became clear that Lewinsky would not cooperate with prosecutors, the imputation that Lewinsky was a crazy, untrustworthy stalker would serve as the White House's first line of defense against the 1998 sex scandal.) Hillary Clinton's most trusted aide, Sidney Blumenthal, led a campaign of vendetta against journalists and politicians who got crosswise with the Clintons, including, notably, Susan Schmidt of the Washington Post. There's no particular reason to expect a Hillary Clinton presidency to restore the economic growth record of the 1990s. Hillary Clinton's foreign policy achievements are nebulous and doubtful, as she herself has had to acknowledge. But the one thing we can feel most sure of about a second Clinton White House is that it will revert to the scorched earth politics of personal destruction that Hillary Clinton field-marshaled 20 years ago -- and that the Barack Obama campaign warned Democrats against in 2008. (One of the ironies of a Hillary Clinton presidency will be to watch Republicans belatedly discover Barack Obama's scandal-free personal integrity.) Hillary Clinton asks two things of us. On the one hand, she wants to be judged exactly as we'd judge a similarly accomplished man in politics. On the other hand, she wants us always to remember that the hopes of all womankind are fixed on whether she personally gets the job she wants. As she said on the night she conceded the 2008 Democratic nomination to Obama: . ""Although we were not able to shatter that highest and hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you it has 18 million cracks in it, and the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time, and we are going to keep working to make it so, today keep with me and stand for me, we still have so much to do together, we made history, and lets make some more."" ""Keep with me."" ""Stand for me."" Hillary Clinton did not end her drive for the nomination with a  message of hope and inspiration for some future female nominee. She ended it with a reprise of Douglas MacArthur's, ""I shall return."" Amy Poehler captured exactly this version of gender justice in a classic 2008 ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch: ""I need to say something. I didn't want a woman to be president. I wanted to be president and I just happen to be a woman."" In that one highly specific sense, then, the Hillary Clinton standard is always single: whatever it takes.","Some have said raising topic of Hillary Clinton's age is sexist .
If Clinton runs and wins in 2016, she would be the second-oldest president .
David Frum: Clinton says she wants to be judged by same standard as men .

"(CNN) -- Two Comedy Central funnymen are apparently entering into the partisan political fray with rallies of their own in the nation's capital. Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert have set October 30 as the date for their respective rallies. On Thursday night's airing of ""The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,"" the comedian announced plans for a ""Rally to Restore Sanity."" ""See you October 30 on the National Mall to spread the timeless message, 'Take it down a notch for America,' "" he said. Stewart dubbed the event a ""clarion call for rationality."" ""A million moderate march, where we take to the streets to send a message to our leaders and our national media that says, 'We are here! We ... are only here until 6 though, because we have a sitter,'"" he said. On ""The Colbert Report,"" which airs immediately after Stewart's show, Colbert fired back with plans for his ""March to Keep Fear Alive."" ""Now is not the time to take it down a notch. Now is the time for all good men to freak out for freedom,"" Colbert said. Stewart said on his Thursday show that he had reserved a spot on the National Mall. ""The forms have been filled out, the checks have been written,"" he said. Stewart and Colbert have submitted one application for a permit for the Washington Monument grounds on October 30, National Park Service spokesman Bill Line confirmed Friday. ""A permit is not finalized yet, and they are still working through a resolution as for any event,"" Line added. Stewart is known more for commentaries on his 30-minute show than publicity stunts. But Colbert has engaged the public several times outside his show's New York studio, filing papers to run for president in South Carolina and shaving his head while taping his show in Iraq to show support for troops. In a nonscientific online poll after the death last year of Walter Cronkite, Time magazine named Stewart ""America's most trusted newscaster."" Stewart captured 44 percent of that vote, with NBC's Brian Williams finishing a distant second at 29 percent. See the poll results here . Actual scientific polling in 2007 by the Pew Research Center for People and the Press found Stewart tied for fourth place as viewers' favorite news person, ranking alongside Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw, Brian Williams and CNN's Anderson Cooper, and just behind Katie Couric, Charles Gibson and Bill O'Reilly. See the Pew poll results here . In a separate Pew survey, 16 percent of Americans said they regularly watched ""The Daily Show"" or ""The Colbert Report."" Those numbers are comparable to some major news programs. For instance, 17 percent said they regularly watched Fox News' ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" and 14 percent watched PBS' ""NewsHour With Jim Lehrer"" regularly. See the full survey results . The announcements come less than three weeks after conservative talk-show host Glenn Beck hosted a much-publicized ""Restoring Honor"" rally on the National Mall, urging large crowds to ""turn back to God"" and return America to the values on which it was founded. That event drew criticism for its timing and location -- on the 47th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech, delivered in the same place. The Rev. Jesse Jackson told CNN at the time that Beck was mimicking King and ""humiliating the tradition."" And other civil rights activists gathered nearby with the Rev. Al Sharpton and his National Action Network in a ""Reclaim the Dream"" rally. Stewart first publicly floated the idea of a counter-rally in a profile in the September 12 edition of New York magazine. ""Maybe we would do a 'March of the Reasonable,' on a date of no particular significance,"" Stewart says in the article. Read the New York magazine profile . The website logos and icons created for the Colbert and Stewart rallies mimic Beck's, using identical typography and similar stylized images. ""We're looking for the people who think shouting is annoying, counterproductive, and terrible for your throat; who feel that the loudest voices shouldn't be the only ones that get heard,"" the website for the ""Rally to Restore Sanity"" says. The ""March to Keep Fear Alive"" site takes a more alarmist approach: ""Never forget -- 'Reason' is just one letter away from 'Treason.' Coincidence? Reasonable people would say it is, but America can't afford to take that chance.""

"The Los Angeles riots 20 years ago this week were sparked by the acquittal of four L.A. police officers in the brutal beating of suspect Rodney King a year earlier. The turbulence that led to more than 50 deaths and $1 billion in property damage all began with a traffic violation. A poor decision to drink and drive led to a 100-mph car chase and a chain of events that would forever change Los Angeles, its police department and the racial conversation in the United States. King, then a 25-year-old convicted robber on parole, admittedly had a few drinks under his belt as he headed home from a friend's house. When he spotted a police car following him, he panicked, thinking he would be sent back to prison. So he took off. Rodney King: What happened in 1991 . ""I had a job to go to that Monday, and I knew I was on parole, and I knew I wasn't supposed to be drinking, and I'm like, 'Oh my God,'"" King told CNN last year. Realizing he couldn't outrun police but fearing what they might do to him when they caught him, King said he looked for a public place to stop. ""I saw all those apartments over there, so I said, 'I'm gonna stop right there. If it goes down, somebody will see it.'"" It did go down. Four police officers, all of them white, struck King more than 50 times with their wooden batons and shocked him with an electric stun gun. "" 'We are going to kill you, n****r,' "" King said police shouted as they beat him. The officers denied using racial slurs. King was right in his expectation of a beating, but his hope of having a witness was fulfilled in a big way. Not only did somebody see it, somebody videotaped it -- still a novelty in 1991, before people had cellphone cameras. The video showed a large lump of a man floundering on the ground, surrounded by a dozen or more police officers, four of whom were beating him relentlessly with nightsticks. One officer's swings slow down as he appears worn out by his nonstop flailing. King was beaten nearly to death. Three surgeons operated on him for five hours that morning. The dramatic video of the episode appeared on national TV two days later. At last, blacks in L.A. -- and no doubt in other parts of the country -- had evidence to document the police brutality many Americans had known about but had denied or tolerated. Overheard on CNN.com: Rodney King 'had demons. But called them his own' ""We finally caught the Loch Ness Monster with a camcorder,"" King attorney Milton Grimes said. Four LAPD officers -- Theodore Briseno, Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind and Sgt. Stacey Koon -- were indicted on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and excessive use of force by a police officer. In April 1992, after a three-month trial in the predominantly white suburb of Simi Valley, three of the officers were acquitted of all charges. But the jury, which had no black members, was deadlocked on one charge of excessive force against Powell. A mistrial was declared on that charge. Powell's attorney, Michael Stone, said the unedited video worked against King and helped prove the officers' case. ""Most of the nation only saw a few snippets where it's the most violent. They didn't see him get up and run at Powell,"" Stone said. ""In a use-of-force case, if the officers do what they're trained to do, how can you find them guilty of a crime? And the jury understood that."" Still, black Los Angeles exploded in outrage. Rioters rampaged through the streets, looting businesses, torching buildings and attacking people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. On the third day of rioting, King emerged from seclusion to make a plea that echoes to this day: ""People, I just want to say, can we all get along?"" he said. ""Can we get along?"" The rioting ended, but the divisions and debate did not. Nearly a year later, the four officers were tried in federal court on civil rights charges. This trial would be very different from the first: It took place in Los Angeles, two African-Americans were picked for the jury and King actually testified this time. ""There was no way in the world that any jury would acquit all of the defendants again,"" Stone, the defense attorney, told CNN. King's own testimony may have hurt the federal case, as he hedged on whether police had used racial slurs during the beating. King told CNN in 2011 that slurs definitely were uttered, but he said he vacillated on the stand because his mother had advised him to avoid talking about race. Ultimately, Koon and Powell were found guilty, while Briseno and Wind were acquitted. ""It was like ... I just hope we just get one. I hope we just get one on that,"" King said. ""If we get one, we're good. So to get the two, I was really happy."" ""We got half-justice,"" his attorney, Grimes, growled, but the verdicts and the 30-month sentences seemed to satisfy the community. There was no unrest. One more trial awaited: Rodney King's lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles. This time, there was only one African-American on the jury, and she was a force to be reckoned with. ""Half of them had no sympathy whatsoever,"" Cynthia Kelly told CNN, referring to her fellow jurors. ""They did not care at all. They just didn't care. Like, 'He broke the law. He deserved what he got.'"" ""I told them they were crazy!"" she recalled. ""It was about justice for what happened to him. No one deserves to get beat like that."" Eventually, the other jurors came around, and King was awarded $3.8 million in damages. It was finally over. But the aftereffects continue to this day. King sometimes still wears a protective vest in response to a fear of reprisal and some genuine threats. And he's had several more run-ins with the law, including a 90-day jail stint in 1996 for a hit-and-run involving his wife at the time. Last year, on the 20th anniversary of the beating, King was pulled over without incident and ticketed for a minor traffic violation. Later in the summer, he was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving. He pleaded guilty in February to a misdemeanor reckless driving charge in connection to that arrest. He was fined $500, given 20 days' home detention, placed on probation for three years and ordered into a nine-month sobriety education program. People have long wondered why King kept getting into trouble. ""The trouble that they see me in is a part of my life that I'm working on,"" he told CNN last year. In 2008, he appeared on the VH1 reality show ""Celebrity Rehab."" ""I'll always have an issue when it comes to alcohol. My dad was an alcoholic, the addiction part is in my blood,"" he told CNN. ""What I've learned to do is to arrest my addiction. Arrest it myself, so I don't get arrested."" Things have changed at the LAPD in the past 20 years. The upper ranks are much more diverse. Changes also have been made -- sometimes under court order -- in the way certain neighborhoods are patrolled and in how complaints are handled. ""The main impact that the Rodney King case had is that it accelerated change,"" journalist Lou Cannon said. ""It's not tenable any longer in the United States of America for a police force of a major city to govern without having the community being a part of that governance."" King has just released a memoir, ""The Riot Within,"" in which he describes his difficult upbringing and reflects on the beating and its aftermath. In an interview this week on CNN, King said he has forgiven the officers who beat him nearly to death. ""Yes, I've forgiven them, because I've been forgiven many times,"" he said. ""My country's been good to me, and I've done some things that wasn't pleasant in my lifetime and I have been forgiven for that. ""... It's like something happening bad in my own house,"" he continued. ""This country is my house, it's the only home I know, so I have to be able to forgive -- for the future, for the younger generation coming behind me, so ... they can understand and if a situation like that happened again they could deal with it a lot easier.""

"Up to 1 million revelers are expected to pack Times Square in New York City for this year's New Year's Eve celebration, but not without some added security to help ring in 2015. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday an increase in police personnel throughout the city this New Year's Eve, most visibly at Penn Station, the Port Authority bus terminal, as well as LaGuardia and JFK airports. ""New Year's Eve is a time of celebration for New Yorkers, and an increased security presence will help ensure that tonight remains a safe and festive time for all,"" Cuomo said. Thousands of officers, including some additional personnel, will also be patrolling Times Square for the New Year's Eve ball drop, NYPD Chief of Department James O'Neill told reporters. The announcement comes on the heels of the December 20 ambush of two NYPD officers who were gunned down in their patrol car. In the following days, a law enforcement official told CNN the city would increase security around the New Year's Eve celebration due to increased threats against police officers. O'Neill said the city was on high alert in the wake of the killings. ""In light of what happened two weeks ago on Saturday, of course there's a concern for every member of the New York City Police Department,"" O'Neill said. ""This is something that's in real recent memory. This is something that every cop in New York City is concerned about."" As is usual every year, thousands of police officers -- both in uniform and civilian clothing -- will be present in Times Square during the huge event, O'Neill said. But amid calls for protests on social media, the department planned on adding more officers as a precaution. ""People have an absolute right to protest ... as long as they do it peacefully and laws aren't broken,"" he said. ""That's the way we're going to police the event.""","Official: Thousands of police will patrol Times Square on New Year's Eve .

"There's something addictive about that moment when you hand someone a homemade treat and that person's face lights up as if you've just given him or her a hug. It turns baking into therapy, food into an olive branch and those you share it with into a family. I've experienced that joy for many years, by virtue of being the delivery girl every winter. I may have switched from wearing hair bows and Christmas dresses to newsboy caps and tall boots, but that feeling stays the same, and I always come bearing gifts. Ever since I can remember, December is when my mother takes to the kitchen like a magician and begins to turn out hand-crafted happiness. The aroma of sweet cakes baking in the oven or candy bubbling hot in a pot on the stove greets me at the end of each day. The sugary sensation alone is enough to make you swoon, especially on a bitterly cold day. Take one bite of pound cake, English toffee, pralines, baklava or sugared pecans and you know that this didn't come from the store. Yet again, my mom has a way of making you feel as though she has baked all of the love in her heart into each treat. When you taste it, you know she made it with you in mind. Opening a wax paper-lined decorative tin and popping a piece of chocolate- and pecan-coated crunchy toffee into your mouth is bliss. I know this for myself, but I've heard it from others. Over the years, the gifts have gone out to countless friends, family members, teachers, co-workers, customers and colleagues. My dad and I are the proud delivery folks for my mother's creations, soaking up the good karma vibes wherever our dispensing takes us. Every reaction just makes my day, and I collect the compliments to take home and share with my mom. It's witnessing the excited expressions on my friends' faces as they recognize the telltale shopping bags bulging with tins. Other times, it's handing out that extra tin I always carry ""just in case"" when I see someone, perhaps an acquaintance, who seems down or unhappy, and watching that person's face transform into a beaming smile. One year on ""delivery day,"" an ice storm hit our North Georgia town and knocked out the power at my high school. Mr. Friedman, my English teacher (and oracle), was without a lunch, but he feasted on the treats all day. Although he had a little bit of a sugar buzz, I'll never forget the utter contentment on his face as he sat munching toffee and pound cake in between and during classes, a Bob Dylan-esque cap sitting jauntily on his head. It is, somehow, a perfect memory. My mother has been making people feel this way for at least 25 years. And luckily, she has taught me the same recipes, so I can spread a similar joy. The woman has mastered pralines and sugared pecans, finicky candies that can so easily set up like cement without an intrepid hand to control the process. And a few years ago, she decided to take on a new challenge: English toffee. Now when I say challenge, I mean this in relation to a woman who is fearless in the kitchen. At 6 years old, she was standing on a kitchen chair over the stove and trying to make candy with half of the things she needed. If she had three of the required ingredients, she was ""going for it."" No amount of failure deterred her, and to this day, I've never seen anyone so tenacious. These days, my mom churns out batches of her own recipe for English toffee without a second thought. So when I tell you not to fear making toffee, or any candy, it comes with the reassurance and tips provided by ""the magician."" Don't let the list of instructions intimidate you -- it's to be sure you've got all you need to know! Make it one time and you'll feel like a pro, and an excellent gift-giver. Screw your courage to the sticking place and take up the challenge to defy expectations of sub-par gifts or gift cards with delightful homemade treats. English Toffee . (Makes almost 3 ½ pounds) Ingredients: . ½ cup water . 2 teaspoons of butter, melted, to brush foil . 2 cups sugar . 2 tablespoons light corn syrup (this makes the texture less like peanut brittle) 1 teaspoon salt (if using unsalted butter) 3 cups chopped pecans . 12 ounces milk chocolate chips . 6 ounces semisweet chocolate chips . 1 pound of unsalted butter, or 1 pound of lightly salted butter if opting out of the salt . Tools to make it easier on yourself: . Candy thermometer . Double boiler . Heavy-bottomed medium saucepan . Two ¼-inch, 15"" x 20"" plywood boards . Pizza cutter . Wide heavy-duty aluminum foil . Instructions: . 1. Tear off 23"" in length of 18""-wide, heavy-duty aluminum foil and brush the matte, non-shiny side with melted butter. Fold 2 ½"" on each side, forming a makeshift pan. This should leave you with a 13"" x 18"" surface on which to pour the hot toffee.  This fits perfectly on the plywood with some room around the edges. This will function as your ""pan"" for the toffee. An actual pan keeps in the heat, which doesn't allow the toffee to set up as quickly. The board will also keep the hot candy from scorching your work surface. 2. Stir together the ½ cup water and corn syrup. 3. Pour this mixture into a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add sugar and butter and clip your candy thermometer to the side of the pan before it gets hot. Turn on the heat to medium high, stirring constantly. 4. While this is cooking -- it should take a while to reach 310 degrees Fahrenheit -- put ½"" of water in the bottom component of the double boiler and turn it on low. Pour your chocolate chips into the top component and melt chocolate. Once the chocolate is melted, turn it off and it's ready to spread on the toffee. 5. Chop pecans and have them ready to sprinkle on the finished toffee. 6. The candy is going to start bubbling and thickening, and eventually turn a caramel color, until it reaches 310 degrees (the ""hard crack stage"" in candy making). 7. When it reaches that temperature, remove from heat immediately. 8. Carefully pour candy onto foil evenly. If need be, you can grip the plywood base to tilt it in the right direction if it doesn't spread. 9. If you use these exact measurements, wait 4-5 minutes before cutting the toffee. If you use a smaller space, you will need more time for the candy to cool. 10. Using a pizza cutter (blunt is best; sharp will go through the foil, but if all you have is a sharp pizza cutter, use a light hand), run through the toffee length and width to create 1 ½-inch squares. (If your pizza cutter doesn't leave an impression, it's still too warm and you might want to wait another minute before trying again). This will help the toffee to break later, rather than forming definite squares. 11. After cutting, lift the top part of double boiler off and dry the bottom of it so it doesn't drip onto the candy. Take a spatula and spread a thin layer of chocolate over the top of the toffee. You can use just enough to cover the surface, but thickness is up to personal preference. 12. Liberally sprinkle the chopped pecans on top of the melted chocolate. 13. Place an unbuttered sheet of foil on top of the toffee and tuck foil around edges. Place your second board of plywood on top and flip it over. 14. After flipping, remove the top board and let sit for 1-2 minutes before you remove foil. If you peel the foil and it starts to stick, wait another minute and it should come off. 15. Once you peel off the foil, repeat the chocolate and nut process. 16. Cover this with another piece of foil and the second plywood board, and flip it over again. 17. Remove the top piece of foil and, retaining the bottom piece of foil, slide it off of the board and onto a wire cooling rack. 18. Sit the wire rack in the coolest room of your house. The toffee needs to cool for at least a few hours. 19. After it is cool, break the toffee into pieces. It usually breaks where the pizza cutter went through. If it isn't breaking into even pieces, it doesn't matter. 20. Store the toffee in wax paper-lined tins at room temperature and it will keep for weeks.","Homemade treats are easy to make and sure to please .
Put English toffee in decorative tins or plastic bags for a sweet gift .

"Former President Bill Clinton commanded the largest speaking fees of his career in 2011, earning $13.4 million and exceeding his previous record by 25%. Clinton's fees were detailed in Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's annual financial disclosure report, released Monday. A CNN analysis of those records shows that the former commander-in-chief has earned $89 million from paid speeches since leaving the White House in January 2001. While it is not unusual for former presidents to command millions of dollars in speaking fees after leaving office, Clinton is the only one subjected to strict disclosure requirements as a result of his wife's position as a high-ranking federal official, first as a U.S. senator and now as secretary of state. ""The work he does around the world has given him a very unique perspective. Not just a former president's perspective, but also the very unique perspective from his philanthropic work,"" said Norman Stowe, a communications executive in Vancouver, British Columbia, who organized an economic conference with both Clinton and George W. Bush last October. ""He's really a gifted speaker. He speaks in a language that everyone can understand."" Clinton delivered 54 paid speeches in 2011, roughly the same as his 2010 workload, but the marked increase in income can be credited to six overseas events that earned him the largest single paydays of his career. The most lucrative was a November speech in Hong Kong to Swedish-based telecom giant Ericsson -- $750,000. Clinton also earned $700,000 for a March speech to a local newspaper publishing company in Lagos, Nigeria, and $550,000 for a November speech to a business forum in Shanghai, China. He earned $500,000 apiece for three events in Austria and Holland in May and in the United Arab Emirates in December. Prior to 2011, the most Clinton had earned from a single event was $525,000 for a 2008 speech in Edmonton, Alberta. The former president's previous record for speech income earned in one year was in 2010, when he earned $10.7 million for 52 events. His speech earnings last year were nearly double the $7.5 million he earned in 2009. Almost half of the former president's speech income last year, $6.1 million, came from 16 speeches delivered in 11 other countries, ranging from Canada to Saudi Arabia. The remainder was earned in 38 domestic speeches delivered in nine states and the District of Columbia. In 11 years as a private citizen, Clinton has delivered 471 paid speeches and earned an average of $189,000 per event. He has visited 27 states, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. His popularity on the international lecture circuit has taken him to 52 countries, where he has earned roughly $51 million. Last month, Hillary Clinton traveled to her 100th country as the nation's top diplomat, which likely makes the Clintons among the most well-traveled couples in the nation. The former president's most popular destination outside of the United States has been Canada, where he has participated in 58 paid events for a total of $9.9 million, followed by the United Kingdom, where he earned $3.2 million for 16 events, and Australia and Mexico, where he delivered 13 speeches apiece for $2.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively. Clinton also has delivered 11 speeches each in China and Germany for $3.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Within the United States, Clinton has spoken at 66 paid events in New York, 41 in California, 28 in Florida and 18 in Las Vegas. Clinton's annual earnings from speeches have varied from year to year depending on his schedule and availability. He gave only six paid speeches for $875,000 in 2004, when he spent much of the year writing his memoirs and recovering from heart bypass surgery. His $13.4 million haul from 2011 more than doubles the $5.7 million he earned in 2008, when he spent half the year campaigning for his wife's unsuccessful presidential bid. That year, Hillary Clinton loaned her presidential campaign a total of $13.2 million out of the couple's personal funds. The Clintons ended up eating the cost of that loan because the campaign was unable to repay the amount by the deadline required by federal campaign finance laws. However, since Hillary Clinton suspended her presidential campaign on June 7, 2008, her husband has earned $36.3 million in speaking fees for 162 events, canceling out the impact of the loan by almost three-fold. Clinton was an elected official on a fixed government salary for all but two years from 1977, when he took office as the Arkansas attorney general, until leaving the White House in January 2001. ""I never had any money until I got out of the White House, you know, but I've done reasonably well since then,"" said Clinton of his earning power at a 2010 forum in Cape Town, South Africa. When President Barack Obama first nominated then-Sen. Hillary Clinton to his cabinet in December 2008, the former president agreed to a number of steps to guard against possible conflicts of interest that might arise from his various post-presidential activities. In particular, he has agreed to allow State Department and White House ethics officials to review his slate of proposed speaking engagements. The Center for Public Integrity, a public interest watchdog group, estimated in a report last year that former President George W. Bush had delivered almost 140 paid speeches for at least $15 million in his first two-and-a-half years since leaving the White House. At the time, a spokesman for Bush's office declined to comment on the accuracy of that report. Clinton's and Bush's offices did not respond to a request for comment on this article.","Former President Clinton earned $13.4 million in speaking fees in 2011 .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Wednesday ordered executive-branch agencies to extend to employees' same-sex partners the same benefits provided to their opposite-sex partners, to the extent allowed by law. The move followed up on Obama's memorandum last year that extended some benefits to same-sex partners of government workers and ordered federal agencies to review additional benefits that also could be available under existing laws. ""That process has now concluded, and I am proud to announce that earlier today, I signed a memorandum that requires executive agencies to take immediate action to extend to the same-sex domestic partners of federal employees a number of meaningful benefits, from family assistance services to hardship transfers to relocation expenses,"" Obama said in a statement. Since taking office in January 2009, Obama has called for the repeal of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy that bans openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service. Under criticism from gay rights activists for a lack of progress on the issue, congressional Democrats pushed for legislative action that led to a recent compromise with the White House and the Pentagon on a conditional repeal once the military completes a review on how to implement the change. The compromise language has passed the House and the Senate Armed Services Committee, with a full Senate vote expected in coming weeks. The president also has urged Congress to pass the Domestic Partners Benefit and Obligations Act, which would extend family benefits now available to heterosexual federal workers to gay and lesbian federal workers as well.","Obama orders government agencies to extend more benefits to same-sex partners of federal workers .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Four days after Haiti's earthquake, a 2-month-old baby girl was brought to a field hospital barely alive, her skull fractured, her ribs broken, her pulse dangerously low. Doctors at the makeshift hospital in Port-au-Prince knew the baby had only hours to live if they didn't get her to a pediatric intensive care unit. Assuming she was an orphan -- she'd been found in the rubble of an apartment building in the arms of a dead woman -- they whisked her to a plane headed to Miami, Florida. They had no idea that back in Port-au-Prince, a couple named Nadine Devilme and Junior Alexis were frantically searching for their baby girl. The couple's efforts to reunite with their daughter in the United States has been an odyssey of grief, legal entanglements, DNA tests and strength to persevere when it seemed all hope had been lost. Searching for their lost baby . When the earthquake hit Haiti on January 12, Devilme was at home with her daughter and her babysitter. She watched in horror as the floor fell apart beneath them and Jenny fell headfirst through a hole, followed by the baby sitter. Devilme herself was knocked unconscious. The next thing she knew, she awoke at a local hospital. Her husband, who was not at home when the quake struck, rushed to be by her side. She told him to go back to their home and search through the rubble to look for Jenny. For four days -- Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday -- Alexis came back with the same news for his wife: he couldn't find Jenny. Then on Saturday, a neighbor arrived with news: someone had found Jenny and taken her to a hospital. Which hospital? The neighbor didn't know. The couple searched hospitals nearby but found no sign of their daughter. Finally, they learned that she had been taken across town to a field hospital set up near the airport by the University of Miami, and then flown to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. Thrilled to learn their daughter was alive, the couple then learned they couldn't see her. With no passport and no visa, they had no way to get to the United States. They couldn't even prove the baby was their daughter. By that time, many were calling her ""Baby Patricia,"" the name given to her after the ambulance driver who got her to the plane to Miami on time. Now Devilme and Alexis set out to prove that this little girl was theirs -- that she wasn't Baby Patricia, but Baby Jenny. Proving they were the parents . Through the International Red Cross, Devilme and Alexis requested a DNA test to prove they were the parents. Little happened for weeks, partly because of a legal dispute over whether the baby should be a ward of the state of Florida or a ward of the federal government, according to Mark Riordan, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Children and Families. ""I can't sleep at night,"" Devilme said March 6 in Creole through a translator. ""This is all that I have. She's my only child."" To show that Jenny was her child, Devilme showed a visiting journalist Jenny's vaccination record from the local hospital and a small blue Bible inscribed with the baby's name and date of birth. While he awaited the DNA test, Alexis carried around a black-and-white copy of a photograph, sent to him through the Red Cross, of the baby in her crib at the hospital in Miami. ""I look at the picture and I cry,"" he said in March. ""That's all I have, is this picture."" Then Mark Lapointe, a Haitian-American lawyer in Miami, took interest in the case and became the attorney for the baby, who was referred to as ""Unknown Haitian Baby"" in court hearings and ""Jane Doe"" at her foster home in Miami. He asked Miami attorney Roberto Martinez to represent Devilme and Alexis. Together, the lawyers pushed for a DNA test, and on March 16, Nadine Devilme and Junior Alexis were informed of the results: She wasn't an unknown baby or Jane Doe or Patricia -- she was their baby, Jenny Alexis. ""This is a case where these were really good parents, and I can't wait for these parents to be reunited with their baby,"" Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Cindy Lederman said at a hearing March 17. ""This is one happy day."" A tearful reunion . It took another two weeks of legal maneuvering to get Devilme and Alexis passports and visas, and on Monday, after 84 anxious days, they were reunited with their daughter. First, they were taken from the tent city where they've been staying to the Port-au-Prince airport. For the first time, the couple met the lawyers who'd been helping them, as well as Dr. Arthur Fournier, the University of Miami doctor who arranged to have their daughter flown to the United States. ""This is what they call in Creole a mirak -- a miracle,"" Fournier said at the airport. The couple then flew to Miami and were driven to His House, the foster care provider where Jenny has lived since being released from the hospital. When Devilme and Alexis walked through the door of the cottage where Jenny lives, they immediately sunk to their knees, embracing their baby and crying. Jenny smiled and looked around, made eye contact with her parents and the foster care worker who cared for her in her parents' absence. ""It was impossible to have a dry eye,"" said Martinez, who was present at the reunion. The parents have a one-year ""humanitarian parole"" -- a type of visa -- from the federal government and can apply to have it renewed, according to Donald Cannava, a lawyer for the Florida Department of Children and Families. Jenny is still receiving care for a fractured skull and receives physical therapy for her injured arm, which she still can't use properly. But in general, she's in good health, a far cry from the emaciated, frail child brought to Miami nearly three months ago. ""She's a fat little baby,"" Martinez said. ""She's a happy, bouncy little kid.""","Haitian couple's efforts to reunite with their injured daughter in the U.S. has been an ordeal .

"Lady Gaga singing ""If I Ever Lose My Faith in You""? Martin Short leading a seeming cast of thousands (OK, dozens) doing ""Yankee Doodle Dandy""? Bruno Mars performing ""Message in a Bottle""? It can only be the Kennedy Center Honors. This year's broadcast, which aired Tuesday night, paid tribute to R&B great Al Green, the multitalented Sting, Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks, dancer Patricia McBride and comedian Lily Tomlin. It's hard to do wrong with a Green song, and Earth, Wind & Fire led off with a heartfelt version of ""Love and Happiness."" The band was followed by such performers as Jennifer Hudson (""Simply Beautiful""), Usher (""Let's Stay Together"") and Mavis Staples and Sam Moore (""Take Me to the River""). Green was visibly moved by the tribute. McBride was feted with performances by dancers including Tiler Peck and Misty Copeland, and Hanks enjoyed a speech from David Letterman and Short's song-and-dance routine. (Oh, and Pentatonix did ""That Thing You Do!"" from the 1996 movie Hanks directed, wrote and appeared in.) Tomlin received compliments from Garrison Keillor, Jane Fonda and Jane Lynch, among others. And then there was Sting. Gaga sang to him, giving ""Faith in You"" a little Green-esque soul. Herbie Hancock played for him. Bruce Springsteen, Mars and members of Sting's musical ""The Last Ship"" performed for him. An appreciative Hanks had an amusing way of sizing up the show. ""It's not unlike a very healthy way of watching your life flash before you eyes,"" he said. The show was recorded December 7.","Notables paid tribute to Kennedy Center honorees .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- A man tried to enter the hospital room of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi overnight, as the leader recovered from being hit in the face Sunday. The man was detained. No further details about him were immediately available but Italian media reported that he was carrying a knife. Berlusconi, for his part, will remain in the hospital at least one day longer than expected, his doctor said Wednesday. The PM will be hospitalized at least through Thursday, Alberto Zangrillo announced, citing Berlusconi's difficulty eating and ongoing pain. ""Having said this, the clinical conditions of the prime minister are reassuring. We are reassured, not worried. And, I believe I can say that the prime minister will be dismissed tomorrow early afternoon,"" he said. He also said Berlusconi, 73, would not participate in public events for 10 to 15 days after his release. Berlusconi spent a troubled night with pain in his neck, his spokesman said. His night was ""worse than previous ones,"" spokesman Paolo Bonaiuti said, though he attributed Berlusconi's unease partially to his enforced absence from work. ""All his life he has been a very hard-working man. To try to keep him still, to keep him off work, is a titanic task,"" Bonaiuti said. Read about Berlusconi's year of woes . Berlusconi suffered broken teeth and a fractured nose in the Sunday attack, in which a man threw a souvenir replica of Milan's cathedral at him and hit him in the face. Zangrillo said he does not believe Berlusconi will suffer permanent scars and that his teeth can be reconstructed. Berlusconi's recovery will take another 25 days, Interior Minister Roberto Maroni told Italy's Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Parliament. The attacker, Massimo Tartaglia, 42, was arrested shortly after the attack and is now in a Milan prison. Police found Tartaglia was carrying other objects, including pepper spray and a large crucifix in his pockets, which showed the attack was premeditated, Maroni said. Tartaglia had bought the replica of the Duomo di Milano, the city's central cathedral, at a souvenir shop, he said. Tartaglia attacked Berlusconi ""because he harbored hatred against the premier,"" Maroni said. There has been a climate of hatred against Berlusconi in recent months, the interior minister said, with many anti-Berlusconi Web pages. Maroni said he is thinking of introducing regulations to block them. His words echoed those of Senate speaker Renato Schifani, who visited Berlusconi in the hospital Monday and said he was pained by the ""hatred"" that led to the attack. Berlusconi, a conservative media mogul-turned-politician, has been dogged by allegations of corruption and is the middle of a messy divorce from his second wife. The three-term prime minister faces trial on tax fraud charges after Italy's top court struck down an immunity law that shielded him from prosecution. He denies the charges, calling them politically motivated. His wife of 19 years, Veronica Lario, filed for divorce in May after allegations that an Italian businessman hired escorts for the premier and that Berlusconi had attended the birthday party for an 18-year-old girl, with whom he has denied having an inappropriate relationship. Berlusconi remains popular among the Italian public, however, with his approval ratings holding well over 50 percent. He won a third term in 2008, and his conservative coalition has control of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","A man tries to enter hospital room of recovering Italian PM Berlusconi .

"(CNN) -- The Secretary of the Navy issued censure letters Friday to four naval officers for the roles they played in a series of raunchy videos shown aboard the USS Enterprise between 2005 and 2007, a spokesman said. The letters, which cannot be appealed, effectively end the officers' careers as they will prevent promotion, said Navy spokesman Capt. Danny Hernandez. Capt. Owen Honors, who lost command of the aircraft carrier soon after the videos were made public, was issued a letter. Letters were also issued to Rear Adms. Lawrence Rice and Ron Horton, who were commanders of the Enterprise at the time Honors, then the ship's second-in-command, was making and showing the videos. Capt. John Dixon, former executive officer of the Enterprise who took over as second-in-command after Honors, also was censured. Adm. John Harvey, head of Fleet Forces Command, said this month that in addition to the top brass, he would send nonpunitive ""letters of caution"" to 32 officers and sailors who helped produce and broadcast the videos. Those letters will not become part of those individuals' permanent files. In January, Harvey removed Honors as commanding officer of the Enterprise, claiming that the captain demonstrated poor judgement with videos he created on the carrier between 2005 and 2007. The videos, which mocked gays and simulated masturbation and naked shower scenes, created an uproar when they became public. Honors claimed that the videos were morale boosters and helped inform the crew about important issues. Naval investigators found 55 videos stored on the carrier's computer system, and 25 were determined to be vulgar and objectionable and in violation of proper behavior, Harvey has said. Shortly after news of the videos broke, the Enterprise left for the Middle East with a new commanding officer. CNN's Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.","Secretary of the Navy issues letters of censure to four naval officers .

"Months after a secret e-mail search controversy at Harvard College, Evelynn M. Hammonds announced on Tuesday that she will step down as dean on July 1, according to a statement posted online. Hammonds came under fire in March for conducting a search of the e-mail accounts of resident deans in an effort to find who leaked information regarding a cheating scandal involving more than 100 students. The Harvard Crimson, the daily newspaper of Harvard College, published an article in April titled, ""To Rebuild Trust, Hammonds Must Resign."" The article concluded by stating ""With Hammonds's resignation, Harvard can begin to bridge the rift of trust between the administration and the community it serves."" Hammonds said in a statement that the e-mail controversy was ""not a motivating factor"" in her decision to step down as dean. ""I was never asked to step down,"" she said. ""I have been in discussions to return to academia and my research for some time."" Hammonds will take a sabbatical after 11 years of continuous service before returning to her teaching program and her scholarship, the statement says. ""Being dean of Harvard College has been an immensely rewarding experience for me,"" said Hammons in the statement, ""But I miss engaging deeply with my scholarship and teaching."" ""I'm grateful to [Hammonds] for all she has done to help our undergraduates thrive,"" said President Drew Faust, ""and we will be fortunate to continue benefiting from her talents and wisdom."" Harvard students forced to withdraw amid cheating scandal . In 2008, Hammonds became the first African-American and the first woman to be named dean of Harvard College. After the scandal in March, the school apologized for the way it handled the secret search. ""While the specific document made public may be deemed by some as not particularly consequential, the disclosure of the document and nearly word-for-word disclosure of a confidential board conversation led to concerns that other information -- especially student information we have a duty to protect as private -- was at risk,"" said a statement from Hammonds and Michael D. Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. ""Consequently, with the approval of the dean of FAS (Faculty of Arts and Sciences) and the University General Counsel, and the support of the dean of Harvard College, a very narrow, careful, and precise subject-line search was conducted by the University's IT department,"" they added. Smith and Hammonds stressed that the search was limited to administrative accounts and that it did not involve a review of e-mail content. ""To be clear: No one's e-mails were opened and the contents of no one's e-mails were searched by human or machine,"" they said. The search successfully identified a resident dean who had forwarded a confidential e-mail. However, after review, school officials determined the dean in question had committed ""an inadvertent error and not an intentional breach"" by sending the message to two students. ""Operating without any clear precedent for the conflicting privacy concerns and knowing that no human had looked at any e-mails during or after the investigation, we made a decision that protected the privacy of the resident dean who had made an inadvertent error and allowed the student cases being handled by this resident dean to move forward expeditiously,"" Smith and Hammonds said. ""We understand that others may see the situation differently, and we apologize if any resident deans feel our communication at the conclusion of the investigation was insufficient,"" they added. News of the secret search drew immediate criticism from some members of Harvard's faculty. Harry Lewis, a professor and former dean of Harvard College, said on his blog that he will likely move most of his personal e-mails to another account, keeping his Harvard address just for business. He described the way the school handled the case as dishonorable. ""Why not tell people you are reading their e-mail? Would it not be the honorable thing to do? What is to be gained by not doing that? Other than avoiding, perhaps, the embarrassment of acknowledging that you are doing something to which the targets would reasonably object if they knew it,"" he wrote. A month prior, the school had announced that more than half the students implicated in the cheating scandal had been required to withdraw for a time. More than 100 students were investigated for plagiarism or for having ""inappropriately collaborated"" on a course's take-home, open-book spring final exam. The class was Government 1310: Introduction to Congress, according to The Harvard Crimson. Many of those who were not forced to withdraw faced disciplinary probation at the Ivy League institution in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the remaining were cleared.

"White Lodging -- a company that maintains Hilton, Marriott, Sheraton and Westin hotel franchises -- has apparently suffered a data breach that exposed guests' credit and debit card information in 2013, independent security researcher Brian Krebs said. Banking industry sources noticed fraud among hundreds of cards that had been previously used at Marriott hotels, wrote Krebs, who first reported that Target had suffered a massive data breach around Black Friday last year. ""But those same sources said they were puzzled by the pattern of fraud, because it was seen only at specific Marriott hotels, including locations in Austin, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, Louisville and Tampa,"" Krebs wrote. ""Turns out, the common thread among all of those Marriott locations is that they are managed"" by White Lodging, he said. White Lodging, based in Merrillville, Indiana, issued a statement Monday saying the breach occurred from March 20 to December 16 and affected only people who used their credit cards in the affected hotels' restaurants and bars. The 14 hotels include Marriott, Radisson, Renaissance, Sheraton, Westin and Holiday Inn franchises around the country. Marriott said it will continue to monitor the situation. ""We are working closely with the franchise management company as they investigate the matter,"" spokesman Jeff Flaherty said. ""Because the suspected breach did not impact any systems that Marriott owns or controls, we do not have additional information to provide."" White Lodging is just the latest American business to investigate a security breach. The hacking of Target's systems could be the largest breach in U.S. retail history. It affected up to 110 million customers, including 40 million credit and debit cards and up to 70 million customers' personal information. CNNMoney: Tips for Target customers . The retailer discovered the breach in mid-December, notified customers several days later, and launched an investigation with the help of a private security firm and law enforcement. Since Target's disclosure, high-end retailer Neiman Marcus announced more than 1 million customer cards were compromised in a breach last summer. And last month, crafts retailer Michaels said its systems may have been breached. It isn't immediately clear if these possible attacks are related. Security experts have warned it is likely other companies were targeted by the hackers who hit Target. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder spoke about a federal investigation at a Senate hearing last week. ""We are committed to working to find not only the perpetrators of these sorts of data breaches, but also any individuals and groups who exploit that data via credit card fraud,"" Holder said.

"A three-speed global economy faces risks from a currency crisis in emerging markets or unsustainable debt in the US and Japan, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has warned. Speaking ahead of the International Monetary Fund's spring meeting in Washington next week, Ms Lagarde said that the world was dividing into three groups -- some countries doing well, some on the mend and some still in trouble. Her speech highlights a new phase for the global economy in which the uneven pace of growth around the world is creating new financial imbalances that could sow the seeds of a future crisis. ""We do not expect global growth to be much higher this year than last. We are seeing new risks as well as old risks,"" Ms Lagarde told an audience in New York on Wednesday. ""In far too many countries, improvements in financial markets have not translated into improvements in the real economy."" Emerging economies were growing fast, she said, but low interest rates in advanced economies were prompting them to build up debt and foreign exchange exposure that could cause trouble. ""Over the past five years, foreign currency borrowing by firms in emerging markets has risen by about 50 per cent,"" said Ms Lagarde. ""Over the past year, bank credit has increased by 13 per cent in Latin America and 11 per cent in Asia."" She said that developing countries needed to respond by beefing up bank supervision, restricting credit to fast-growing areas, imposing capital requirements that changed with the economic cycle and monitoring their foreign exchange exposures. Ms Lagarde endorsed quantitative easing by central banks such as the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan, but said that rich economies should use fiscal policy more aggressively so there was less pressure for interest rates to stay low. Countries on the mend included the US, Sweden and Switzerland, she said. But she warned that the US was cutting its deficit too fast in the short term, harming growth, but tackling its long-run deficit too slowly. She criticised sequestration under which the US is lopping off $85bn from public spending this year. ""This risks throwing away needed growth, especially at a time when too many people are still out of work,"" she said. But she said that, despite progress on fiscal policy, government debt would hit 108 per cent of gross domestic product this year. ""This is the major policy challenge facing the United States today and it must be met. Otherwise, the substantial gains that have been made can be too easily lost."" Countries that still had work to do included the euro area and Japan, said Ms Lagarde. In the euro area, the main problem is the banking system. In keeping with the IMF's imposition of a restructuring on Cypriot banks, she said ""the priority must be to continue to clean up the banking system by recapitalising, restructuring or -- where necessary -- shutting down banks."" In Japan, she warned that the public debt of 245 per cent of GDP ""looks increasingly unsustainable"" and that a clear plan to tackle it was an ""urgent priority"". But Japan must also act ""to finally break free of the deflation trap"" and it needed to ""rely more on monetary policy to kick-start growth"".","IMF chief: A three-speed global economy faces risks from a currency crisis in emerging markets .

"(CNN)The first indication that something was wrong was a phone call from his daughter's Denver area school to let Assad Ibrahim know that she had not come to class. He dialed her cell. And she answered. But, officials say, she didn't tell him that she was on her way to Syria to join ISIS. She was just late for class, that's all, Ibrahim's daughter told him on Friday, according to the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office, which filed a runaway report. The American girl of Sudanese descent also kept quiet about her two girlfriends, Americans of Somali descent, who were flying with her to Turkey by way of Germany. Two more girls, sisters . Those two had told their father, Ali Farah, that they were going to the library. But when Farah got home from work, a visitor came calling, according to the documents. Apparently, it was Ibrahim. Farah should check to see if his daughters' passports were missing, the visitor told him -- just like his daughter's passport was. Sure enough, they were gone, along with $2,000 in cash. The two families called the FBI. They said they thought the girls were on their way to Turkey. The agency put out a notice on their passports. German authorities intercepted the trio, ages 15, 16 and 17, at Frankfurt airport and put them on a plane back to the United States, where they were greeted by FBI agents. The three girls were questioned and released. Two U.S. officials say they had planned to join militants with ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Out of the blue . The girls' parents say they had no idea their children planned to travel. None of them had ever run away before. Their disappearance hit them out of the blue, the way other ISIS related incidents are popping up in the Western world. Two more turned up in tandem with the girls' runaway attempt. On Monday, a radical convert to Islam in Canada ran down two soldiers in his car, killing one of them.  Martin Rouleau Couture, 25, then led police on a chase before his car rolled into a ditch in the town of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, southeast of Montreal. He exited the car, and police shot him dead. Back in July, Couture, too, had tried to join foreign jihad, and Canadian police arrested him on his way to Turkey. But they could not charge him and had to let him go. And this week, a video turned up of a 17-year-old Australian boy standing with ISIS fighters and threatening to behead Western leaders, including President Obama, then fly the ISIS flag over the White House. Colorado teen pleads guilty in plan to join ISIS . ISIS' draw . ISIS has, for an anti-Western organization, been surprisingly attractive to young recruits from the West, as well as to some young women. More than 100 of the foreign fighters have come from the United States, according to intelligence estimates; hundreds more from Europe, which is geographically closer to the fight. Every week, five more people from the UK alone join ISIS, a British police commissioner said Tuesday. And that's a conservative estimate. ""We know that over 500 British nationals traveled to join the conflict,"" said Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe from the Metropolitan Police. ""Five a week doesn't sound much, but when you realize there are 50 weeks in a year, 250 more would be 50% more than we think have gone already,"" he said. To put things into perspective, though, thousands more come from the Middle East and Africa. More than 3,000 have joined from Tunisia. Sense of belonging . It's more than just a radical interpretation of Islam that is drawing teens to the extremely bloodthirsty militant group, a former CIA officer says. ""They're often times searching for an identity, because what the jihadis are actually pushing is a specific narrative, which is: Your people (Muslims) are being oppressed in this place called Syria; your government is doing nothing; we're the only ones who are actually going to help you out,"" said Aki Peritz.  ""Why don't you join the fight?"" Richard Barrett of The Soufan Group says many of the teens lack a sense of belonging where they live, and they believe ISIS can give it to them. ""The general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in Syria suggests camaraderie, good morale and purposeful activity, all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism, designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own self-esteem,"" he says. And ISIS constantly cranks the PR machine, making expert use of slick videos and social media. Echoing back West . ISIS' global digital reach has terror experts in the United States worried about security at home as well. There are terrorist groups in Yemen and in Syria with stated ambitions of striking on American soil, but another threat is more probable, says counterterrorism expert Matt Olsen. ""I would say the most likely types of attack is one of these homegrown violent extremists or lone offenders in the United States, and (with) the rise of ISIS and the number of people going to Syria...the likelihood does go up."" Self-styled attackers like the Boston Marathon bombers could be the result. The use of the Internet makes terrorists more vulnerable to tracking, but that has become more difficult since Edward Snowden revealed secret U.S. surveillance programs. Opinion: What lures Americans to Syria fight? Girls' online activities . In Denver, the 17-year-old girl was apparently the instigator of the trip, having planned it for months, two U.S. officials said. But all three researched the plan online, visiting websites where extremists discuss how to get to Syria. The online activity didn't set off any tripwires the FBI typically uses to flag possible jihadist sympathizers, the officials said. The FBI is combing all of their communications to see if anyone was helping them.  Their parents think ISIS was behind the trip. Investigators are also not sure the girls had even worked out the final goal for their travel. As was the case with the Canadian, Couture, the investigation into the travel will probably not lead to charges, especially because the girls are minors, the two U.S. officials said. On Monday, Sheriff's Deputy Evan Driscoll visited the two girls of Somali descent in their home and had a conversation with them. ""The girls explained that they stole the $2,000 and their passports from their mother,"" he wrote in the runaway report. They wouldn't tell Driscoll why they flew to Germany. The deputy called dispatchers and had the girls' runaway listing removed. CNN's Pamela Brown, Evan Perez, Holly Yan and Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this report.","All three girls skipped school and took a flight to Germany, wanted to go to Turkey .

"(CNN) -- An Irish atheist group has published a series of quotations on religion in an attempt to challenge a blasphemy law that went into effect on New Year's Day. The 25 ""blasphemous"" quotations include the words of Jesus, Mohammed, Mark Twain, Salman Rushdie and Bjork. Atheist Ireland published the list on its Web site Friday. It says it aims to challenge the law, which makes blasphemy a crime punishable by a €25,000-($35,800) fine. ""Despite these quotes being abusive and insulting in relation to matters held sacred by various religions, we unreservedly support the right of these people to have published or uttered them,"" the group said on the site. ""We unreservedly support the right of any Irish citizen to make comparable statements about matters held sacred by any religion without fear of being criminalized, and without having to prove to a court that a reasonable person would find any particular value in the statement."" Lawmakers in staunchly Catholic Ireland passed the law in July, but it came into force January 1. A person breaks the law by saying or publishing anything ""grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion, thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion."" Those found guilty of breaking the blasphemy law may try to defend themselves by proving that a reasonable person would find literary, artistic, political, scientific or academic value in what they said or published, the law says. Atheist Ireland called the law ""silly and dangerous,"" because it provides an incentive for religious outrage. ""We believe in the golden rule: that we have a right to be treated justly, and that we have a responsibility to treat other people justly,"" the group said. ""Blasphemy laws are unjust: They silence people in order to protect ideas. In a civilized society, people have a right to to express and to hear ideas about religion even if other people find those ideas to be outrageous."" The group urged the Irish government to repeal the law. It also asked lawmakers for a referendum on removing all references to God from the Irish constitution.","Law, making blasphemy a crime punishable by a $35,800 fine, came into effect January 1 .

"""You're listening to Fukushima FM."" The cheery jingle on the radio reminds you of a different time in this part of eastern Japan, a different world that existed before March 11, 2011. Driving past houses that residents can no longer call home, you can still see sandbags holding down tarpaulins on damaged roofs. They're the result of the devastating earthquake and tsunami more than two years ago, and repairs the owners have not yet been able to carry out. We're inside the original 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone, an area completely evacuated after the tsunami knocked out vital cooling systems for three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, causing them to melt down and emit radioactive material. Residents can now return to certain parts of the outer exclusion zone but only during the day. The government does not want to run the risk of accumulative radiation exposure if people stay for a full 24 hours. By the side of the road we pass along, teams of workers are clearing the ground of radiation and have been since the summer of 2011. It's a colossal task that involves painstakingly removing the top layer of soil and grass to remove as much absorbed radiation as possible. The government-funded operation will have cost $1.5 billion by the end of this fiscal year, according to the Japanese government. On any given day up to 8,000 people are working on the clean-up around Fukushima Prefecture. More than a year ago, the workers here wore full protection suits, today they simply wear gloves and the basic face masks you can see anywhere in Japan -- a sign that the radiation level here has dropped. Thousands of industrial-size black bags hold the contaminated soil. They are lined up in fields, waiting for their final resting place -- wherever that may be. This is a reminder that the problem of what to do with radioactive water at the crippled Fukushima plant is not the only storage issue this country has to deal with. During the day, the steady volume of traffic in this outer part of the exclusion zone belies the invisible threat that still exists. It's a threat that two-and-a-half years later has residents wondering when, or even if, they will be able to move back home.","Operation to clean up irradiated areas around Fukushima nuclear plant continues .
Original 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone around crippled facility remains .
Residents only allowed access to outer parts of this area for limited periods .
New radioactive leaks at plant continue to cause concern two and a half years on ."
"More than two years on from the worst nuclear disaster in a quarter of a century, the situation at Japan's stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant remains toxic, prompting the Japanese government to announce new measures to attempt to deal with radioactive leaks. The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), has been criticized for its handling of the disaster, with the country's Trade and Industry Minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, comparing its stopgap approach to a game of ""Whack-a-mole."" The government has now stepped in and pledged $470 million to try to tackle the leaks, through measures which by its own admission are unconventional and untested. How did we reach this point? When the 2011 tsunami swamped the plant, located 149 miles (240 kilometers) north of Tokyo on Japan's eastern seaboard, it cut the power to vital cooling systems for the three reactors in use at the time, resulting in the second-worst nuclear accident in history after Chernobyl in 1986, as the reactors melted down and leaked radioactive material into the atmosphere. TEPCO has since been pumping huge volumes of water into the plant -- hundreds of tons daily -- to cool the crippled reactors that once powered the plant. This water, which becomes highly radioactive once it comes into contact with the plant's fuel rods, has been stored in makeshift, hastily-built storage tanks around the site -- about 1,000 so far -- containing enough irradiated water to fill about 160 Olympic-sized swimming pools, with about 400 tons added to the tanks daily. Scientists who monitor radiation levels offshore have pointed to evidence of an ongoing leak for more than a year, but it was only recently that TEPCO admitted it was occurring. Last month, TEPCO said one of the storage tanks at the site had leaked 300 tons of toxic water, prompting Japan's nuclear regulator to declare the situation a Level 3 serious incident, its most serious assessment since the 2011 meltdowns. It has since stated that several tanks and pipes at the plant are suspected of leaking toxic water. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Level 3 applies to situations in which there is ""severe contamination in an area not expected by design, with a low probability of significant public exposure."" More leaks feared at Fukushima . Why are these holding tanks leaking? The leaks that have occurred so far have been in a type of storage tank using plastic seals. About 350 of the 1,000 tanks in place are constructed in the same way. These are the ones that were constructed hastily in the aftermath of the disaster as a makeshift measure -- but, two and a half years on, are beginning to fail. Michael Friedlander, a nuclear engineer and former U.S. power plant operator, told CNN the eventual failure of the tanks years after they were deployed on a supposedly temporary, emergency basis is illustrative of TEPCO's ad hoc, unsustainable response to the disaster. ""Given the cards they were dealt, building a tank farm to hold the water in in the heat of the emergency, there was really there only one option, so I don't fault them for that,"" he said. But beyond the emergency response, TEPCO had demonstrated no long-term vision for dealing with the problem, he said. ""You can't be getting rid of 400 tons of water a day with no end in sight,"" he added. ""Their strategy was never sustainable. You've got all this radioactive material sitting there next to the plant with effectively no long term strategy for dealing with it."" Is this the only problem? There's also an issue with groundwater, which flows from the hills surrounding the plant and gets contaminated in radioactive areas. In July, TEPCO admitted that radioactive groundwater was leaking into the Pacific Ocean from the plant, even though an underground barrier was built to seal in the water. How much radiation is there? In July, TEPCO disclosed that water from test wells around the reactor buildings showed concentrations of radioactive tritium in one well as high as 500,000 becquerels -- a unit of radioactive intensity -- per liter of water. By comparison, Japan's maximum safe level of radioactivity in drinking water for adults is 300 becquerels per liter. This month, a sharp spike in radiation levels was detected in some of the pipes and storage tanks -- the highest reading was 1,800 millisieverts per hour at the bottom fringe of the tank. Readings of 220 and 70 millisieverts per hour were measured at the bottom of other two tanks. And TEPCO said it found a dried stain under the pipe with a 230 millisieverts per hour radiation measurement. The average person in an industrialized country is naturally exposed to 3 millisieverts a year. Experts say that after a single acute exposure of 1,000 millisieverts, people tend to start feeling nauseated. Exposure at 5,000 millisieverts over the course of a few hours can be fatal. What threat does the current leak pose? ""In the grand scheme of things, is it a potential threat to Tokyo or the countryside outside the plant proper? Truthfully, no,"" said Friedlander. ""In the event one of the tanks ruptures due to another seismic event would it make a huge mess? Absolutely."" It also represents a threat to the workers at the plant if they come into contact with radiation at that level. Some experts have suggested that contaminated water may need to dumped into the ocean at some stage. Japan fed up with 'whack-a-mole' approach to Fukushima . How dangerous would this be? ""In the context of the original accident and ground leakage they've had going on for 2.5 years? After a short period of time you probably couldn't even detect it, quite honestly,"" said Friedlander. ""The currents, the background radiation that's already there -- the contaminated water would get diluted out by the vastness of the Pacific."" Fisheries around the area have closed as the catch is not fit for consumption. ""But a good responsible nuclear operator would do everything possible to clean that water up to the best technological standards of today -- which is very clean. It's only the residue that technology can't clean up that gets put in the ocean."" How radiation can be removed from the contaminated water? ""With off the shelf technology you can get rid of nearly all radioactivity to below detectable levels,"" he said. One exception was tritium, which he said, ""requires completely different technology that you couldn't deploy on this scale."" Aside from that, technology existed to be able to process the water to acceptable levels for release. What are the options to halt this leakage? TEPCO has proposed setting up a subterranean barrier around the plant by freezing the ground around it, preventing groundwater from leaking into the damaged plant and carrying radioactive particles with it as it seeps out. The plan to freeze the ground presents significant technical challenges. It could involve plunging thousands of tubes carrying a powerful coolant liquid deep into the ground surrounding the stricken reactor buildings. The technology has been used before in the construction of tunnels, but never on the massive scale that the Fukushima plant would require. Will it work? According to Friedlander, this technology has only really been employed as a temporary solution, during construction projects for example -- but to attempt to use the freezing option as a long-term option would make little sense. He said the only viable option is to clean the water to a standard where it can be released.  ""I get it's going to take 40 years to decontaminate those buildings,"" he said. ""But there has to be a way to figure out where groundwater intrusion is coming from and stop it. There has to be a way of doing that from outside the buildings -- you can't be getting rid of 400 tons of water a day with no end in sight. ""This is nothing more sophisticated than when your basement at home leaks. There's well established technology for dealing with groundwater intrusion in facilities. ""But freezing the ground for 40 years doesn't sound like a sustainable solution.""

"(CNN) -- Three men who escaped from prison in Belgium in a daring helicopter escape committed a string of robberies on Saturday, a police spokesman said. Ashraf Sekkaki is considered to be one of Belgium's most dangerous criminals. The escapees, who include a man considered to be one of the country's most dangerous criminals, robbed a bank, a gas station and two storage facilities, said the Bruges police spokesman Sunday. ""In two hours they did four robberies,"" said the officer, who declined to give his name. ""We think they need money."" He added that he did not know if the alleged crimes were captured on CCTV, and that police have no idea where the fugitives are now. The fugitives are Mohammed Johry, Abdel Had Kahjary Mulloul and Ashraf Sekkaki. Sekkaki is considered one of Belgium's most dangerous criminals, Interpol said, with more than 16 convictions for violence, including bank robbery and kidnapping. Accomplices of the three inmates hijacked a helicopter on July 24 and forced the pilot to land in the prison courtyard, Interpol said. ""It was just like in a film,"" helicopter pilot Ludwig Louwagie told the Belga news agency. He said a couple had booked a sightseeing tour of the Bruges region. While in flight, the man suddenly pressed a weapon against his temple, Louwagie told Belga. The man took away his headset so the pilot couldn't talk to ground control and forced Louwagie to land in the prison courtyard, he said. ""I tried to land next to the prison, but the weapon was still pressed hard against my temple,"" he said. ""I had no choice."" He was unhurt, Belga reported. A 22-year-old man of Moroccan origin was an accomplice to the group but had to stay behind because the helicopter couldn't carry everyone, the Belga news agency reported. The jailbreak prompted Interpol to issue an international alert to police around the world to be on the lookout for the men. Jailbreaks by helicopter are becoming ""far too common"" worldwide, Interpol Secretary-General Ronald Noble said. CNN's Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","Men who escaped Belgian prison in helicopter committed string of robberies .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- The shooting at Fort Hood was captured on video by a soldier using his cell phone camera as he hid from the shooter, but he was ordered to erase it, the soldier said Friday. Pfc. Lance Aviles spoke of the video as he testified on the third day of the Article 32 military hearing for Maj. Nidal Hasan, who is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 in the November 2009 shooting. Aviles said he was told by a non-commissioned officer, who Aviles said was acting on the orders of an officer, to delete the video on the same day of the shooting. He did not describe to the court what the video contained. It was not immediately clear whether the military would look into why the video was ordered deleted. A Fort Hood official, who insisted on anonymity because of the ongoing criminal investigation into the shootings, said, ""Since this matter was raised during the Article 32 hearing, it is for the Article 32 hearing officer to decide whether to make further inquiries to the soldier's chain of command for additional information."" Aviles also testified that he saw the gunman stop to reload and considered rushing him. But by the time Aviles got up, he said, the shooter ""had already loaded another magazine. So instead of running to him, I ran off to the right."" Hasan, partially paralyzed, was wheeled into the courtroom by a blue-uniformed police officer. Occasionally he used his arms to reposition himself in his chair while listening to the testimony. Spc. Megan Martin, speaking via video from Kandahar, Afghanistan, said she constantly relives the events of the day. She said she was not injured, but ""it was a nightmare that reoccurs every day."" Despite the trauma, she said she did not seek to delay her deployment to Afghanistan. ""I wanted to carry on the mission as my fellow soldiers would have wanted me to,"" she said.","NEW: Pfc.

"Coal is the new gold in South Africa -- it's also one of the worst polluters on the planet. South Africa is the world's fourth largest coal exporter with over 40 billion tons of the fossil fuel in reserves, according to the government. While the Chamber of Mines reported sales of some $10 billion last year. But the of host of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, currently taking place in Durban, is under increasing pressure to curb its addiction to coal -- the world's most notorious contributor to the greenhouse gases blamed for contributing to climate change. From South Africa to America, Europe to China, coal is the bedrock on which most world economies have been built. Reducing its use, many countries argue, will reduce productivity and growth. ""If today we say no to coal, that means we have to switch off all our power plants in South Africa,"" said Dipuo Peters, South Africa's Minister of Energy. ""What is going to happen to our country? We need to keep the lights on. We need to grow the economy and create jobs. As we speak 25% of our people are unemployed."" Developed countries have pledged to contribute $100 billion towards a Green Climate Fund that would subsidize efforts by developing nations to reduce their carbon emissions. But with the economies of developed countries under strain many fear these funds will never materialize. Complicating matters even more is the argument around whether the world's second biggest economy, China, should be entitled to such a subsidy. In the meantime, with more power stations either being built or planned, South Africa's coal mining industry is likely to continue to grow. It is also creating opportunities for young entrepreneurs like Andre Magiya. ""People want coal in big numbers,"" the mining logistics businessman said. ""We cannot satisfy the export market as it is. ""And locally the hospitals use coal, manufacturers use coal, even the prisons. Everywhere there is demand for coal."" Europe has been South Africa's main coal export market, but orders from India and China have rapidly grown in recent years. Still, it is domestic demand that drives the industry: Over 90% of South Africa's electricity, produced by power utility Eskom, is generated from coal. The government-controlled company has some of the biggest power plants in the world and is busy building more -- a move that has attracted the attention of international environmentalists Greenpeace, who recently staged a demonstration at a power plant under construction in the Mpumalanga province. ""This country has been mining coal since the 1860,"" said Melita Steele of Greenpeace. ""It has formed the backbone of the economy and it's what Eskom knows. ""So what do you do when you are in an electricity crisis? You invest in what you know. Even though the government is talking nicely about climate change we are not seeing the action and we are not seeing the urgency."" China and the United States are undoubtedly the world's worst air polluters, but South Africa leads in Africa -- and activists say it should be leading in clean energy as well. ""Less than 1% of this country's energy is green which is a sorry tale. We are seeing more significant action from countries like Lesotho in this regard,"" said Steele. At the last U.N. climate change conference, COP16 in Copenhagen, President Jacob Zuma committed to reducing 34% of South Africa's carbon emissions by 2020 and some progress is being made. Several initiatives to create electricity from waste are already underway. Africa's biggest sugar producer, Illovo, says with the right incentives from government it could invest in equipment that could see it produce 1.6 gigawatts per hour of power from sugar fiber called baggase -- power it could add to the national grid. Peters says the government will conclude discussions with the sugar industry soon and in the meantime it is investigating other alternatives. Several wind and sun energy projects already have the government's financial backing. ""We have got a plan of one million solar geysers (solar water heaters) by 2014. One million solar geysers saves 3,000 megawatts. Three thousand megawatts is a potential power plant, and we are saying being able to do that is an indication of our commitment,"" she said. It's a delicate balancing act -- one many developing countries continue to grapple with. Alleviating poverty remains a primary focus whatever the means. Some of South Africa's major employers are also among the country's top polluters. They've warned that without alternative energy sources, the government's ambitious carbon reduction targets will negatively impact on plans to grow the economy and create jobs. Peters says her department hopes to ultimately be able to provide big industries with reliable clean energy to meet their minimum demands. ""We want to build 5,000 megawatts of solar power so that we can, in the next 10 years, prove to ourselves and to the world that solar and wind can be a base load,"" she added. These are ambitious targets and promises that may go up in smoke if the world fails to reach consensus in Durban.","South Africa is host of the United Nations Climate Change Conference or COP17 .

"(CNN) -- At first Alon Meyer thought it was a bad joke. When Kreshnik Berisha, the first suspected member of ISIS to stand trial in Germany, was arrested upon his arrival back in Frankfurt in December after spending six months in Syria, youth team football coach Meyer was left shell-shocked. The coach thought for a while and then it slowly sank in -- this was the same boy who had once stood by his side and taken the field in the shirt of Makkabi Frankfurt, Germany's largest Jewish sports club. Meyer's phone began to buzz with journalists trying to ask him whether he remembered Berisha, a 20-year-old born in Frankfurt to Kosovan parents. ""I didn't think it was serious -- I remember when the journalist told me, I didn't believe it,"" said Meyer, who is also the president of the 40 different Makkabi clubs in Germany, which he says has some 4,500 members. ""This was a guy who used to play with Jewish players every week, he was comfortable there and he seemed so happy. ""He was a normal player, never shouting too much and was fighting on the field with his friends. ""We are a Jewish club with a Jewish heart -- and everybody who has been involved with us knows that. ""Now, within three years, he's back in Germany facing prison having left us and been radicalized. ""It's very, very abnormal."" Berisha is expected to receive a sentence of between three to four-and-a-half years for allegedly being a member of a foreign terrorist organization. Judge Thomas Sagebiel is offering a more lenient sentence than usual in exchange for a confession and information about ISIS. ""We don't want to destroy his future with all our power,"" said Sagebiel during the trial last month. A sentence is expected to be handed down in the coming weeks. In a written statement read out by his lawyer during the court case, Berisha explained his motivation for traveling to Syria via Turkey in July 2013. ""The inconceivable violence used by the Alawite Assad regime against the Sunni majority was enraging and bewildering. No-one wanted to help the people there,"" it said. ""I saw it as my duty to fight against the suppression and tyranny."" Statistics provided to national newspaper Die Welt by the German intelligence agency, Bundesamt fÃ¼r Verfassungsschutz, states that around 450 Germans have traveled to fight in Syria. According to German media, Berisha was radicalized while studying construction engineering at college. In his statement, Berisha told the court how he was hoping to lead a normal life after serving out his sentence. While he awaits his fate, those who used to share the same football field as him are still reeling. ""His old teammates were very shocked -- they didn't know how to react,"" Meyer said. ""They couldn't believe it, nobody has contact with him. ""He was moving out of the area and people lost contact with him."" Makkabi Frankfurt has 1,300 members and gives opportunities to the wider community to take part in an array of activities. With 30 sports on offer and 23 different football teams for ages as young as four all the way through to 55, it is a club at the very center of the Frankfurt community. It has opened its doors to everyone in the past decade, with Meyer insisting Makkabi Frankfurt ""does not talk about integration, it lives integration."" ""A few people in the community were shocked and called me to discuss what we should do,"" he said. ""They asked whether we should go back to just looking after our own but I said we cannot do that because of one person. ""This is a club for everybody and we want everybody to come and play together. ""We have opened ourselves up to everybody and that is how we live.""","Kreshnik Berisha arrested in Germany for links with ISIS .

"(CNN)It's long been known that dogs and cats, with their highly developed sense of smell, can be trained to identify the volatile chemicals released by human illnesses. In some cases, researchers have even trained household pets to detect cancer or predict epileptic seizures. But what if we could fine tune that sense and put it into a microchip, allowing us to create a breathalyzer for diseases? For Dr. Andrew Koehl, the inventor of the microchip spectrometer technology at the heart of this ""digital nose"", the technology that will allow us to do just that is already here. ""We can detect down to parts per billion levels,"" Koehl says. ""To give you an analogy that's equivalent to one drop in an Olympic size swimming pool."" The sensor, which is no bigger than a dime, works by creating a spectrum of what chemicals are in the air. It then identifies each chemical's unique make-up. If the sensor is set and calibrated to a certain level, it will trigger an alarm. Work continues to shrink it even further in a bid to enter the healthcare market. Within several years, the company hopes to develop it as a diagnostic tool. ""What's amazing is that there really are compounds on your breath that indicate illness, that's been shown through a number of studies and we can detect those,"" he said. ""There have already been a number of research papers published suggesting we can detect cancer, detect tuberculosis, detect asthma."" Initially, the technology had been developed for defense purposes. He said the threat posed by the events of September 11 had got him thinking about the security applications of this type of sensor. ""Originally it was aimed at detecting things like explosives, toxic chemicals and other threats that might occur,"" Dr Koehl told CNN. Developed at a research lab at the University of Cambridge in the UK and now in commercial production at a company called Owlstone with close links to the university, Dr Koehl says the sensor is already in use by oil industry giants like BP and Shell and in the food industry by Coca Cola and Nestle. Eventually the sensor could become a part of many everyday appliances, alerting consumers to which foods are going bad in the fridge or even the optimum moment to take the roast out of the oven. You could even, one day, have a digital nose that you could carry in your hip pocket. ""More recently we've been looking at consumer spaces so we're talking to a number of manufacturers of mobile phones and mobile phone components,"" he said. ""We want to develop a module small enough to put into mobile devices like phones.""","Researches know that dogs and cats can sometimes detect diseases with their keen sense of smell .

"Myitkyina, Myanmar  (CNN)On the surface, this riverfront town looks prosperous, peaceful and green; a trading hub that profits from lucrative gemstone mines located in the hinterland of Myanmar's northern Kachin State. Dig deeper, though, and a dark undercurrent exists -- what community leaders say is a major heroin epidemic. Even on the campus of Myitkyina University, used syringes spill out of metal garbage bins marked with signs urging users to properly dispose of drug paraphernalia to avoid the spread of infections like HIV. More needles litter the rocky banks of the Irrawaddy River, near the terminal where boatmen ship fuel, vegetables and the occasional foreign tourist up and down the waterway. Community leaders offer shockingly high estimates for drug use among young people in this part of Myanmar. ""Every family has this drug problem... I think 65% or 70% of young people use drugs,"" says Reverend Samson Hkalam, the head of the Kachin Baptist Convention, the largest group of churches in the state. ""The drug is the first enemy of the Kachin people,"" he adds. How heroin kills you . Conflict zone . The Kachin are an ethnic and predominantly Christian religious minority in Myanmar, which is a majority Buddhist country.  For much of the last half century, Kachin State has also been a battleground in a conflict between Myanmar's military and an insurgency led by militants from the Kachin Independence Army. Some Kachin community leaders argue drug abuse now claims more lives than the decades-long conflict, which is estimated to have forced more than 100,000 people to flee their homes in the last three years. But this claim is challenged by the top counter narcotics police commander in Myitkyina. In a phone conversation with CNN, Sai Thein Zaw downplays the sight of used heroin syringes on the town's streets. ""Drug problems are not unique to Kachin state or Myanmar for that matter,"" he says, before claiming that government efforts to combat the region's drug problem have been successful. But a recent United Nations report suggests otherwise. The United Nations' Office on Drugs and Crime says poppy production in Myanmar more than doubled between 2006 and 2013, while opium production jumped 26% from 2012 to 2013.  Myanmar ranks as the world's second largest producer of opium after Afghanistan. Desperate measures . In Myitkyina, desperate times call for desperate measures. Community leaders send out volunteers to clean used needles off the streets, while church groups organize raids against suspected drug dealers, sharing photos and videos of what they say are confiscated narcotics that they subsequently burn. In one unusual video filmed and released by the group Ram Hkye (or ""Save Youth""), a pastor wearing a motorcycle helmet preaches through a megaphone at more than a dozen men squatted on a dirt road with syringes bulging from their biceps and hands. The pastor, backed up by a man playing guitar, distributes religious pamphlets to the heroin users, one of whom claps listlessly along with a hymn as a needle protrudes from one of his veins. Community groups have also gotten into the business of addiction treatment.  At least a half dozen faith-based rehabilitation centers have sprung up in areas around Myitkyina in the last two years. One of them, the Light of the World camp, is a compound on the banks of the Irrawaddy surrounded by 10-foot high aluminum walls as well as a guard tower. The main gate to the compound locks from the outside. There is no handle on the inside of the gate. ""We need to have the walls,"" says Zau Tu, a pastor leading the team who was treating at least 18 patients at the camp. ""If they (the patients) can't see anything around them, it calms them down."" For those patients who can't control their urges, there are more drastic measures available, including a cage next to the camp's bamboo chapel. ""If they commit crimes, if they fight each other, they go in the penalty box,"" says Zau Tu. 'Jesus not methadone' At faith-based rehabilitation camps like Light of the World, counselors don't administer methadone -- the synthetic opioid often used to treat heroin addicts. ""We use the words of Jesus instead of methadone,"" explains Nding Ahga, a recovered heroin addict and former rock star who runs the Youth for Christ Center, about a mile up the river from Light of the World. Ahga's camp is not walled. But patients spend their first week in rehabilitation overcoming drug withdrawal symptoms while locked in a prison-like room that Ahga called the ""prayer room."" All 12 of Ahga's patients are laborers who said they had come from the jade mines of Hpakant, located several hours' drive northwest of Myitkyina. No San, 29, showed the track marks and scars left in his arms and veins after years of heroin abuse. ""I was hot, I was burning,"" he recalls, describing his first agonizing week of heroin withdrawal. He and the other patients say heroin and other drugs are bought and sold in the open in an outdoor market near the jade mines. ""We can get drugs easily everywhere in Hpakant,"" No San adds. ""All of the miners take drugs. It's not strange for us. You can buy drugs at the store easily."" Nding Ahga shares footage he filmed secretly during a recent visit to one of the heroin bazaars in Hpakant.  The video shows a row of crude shops and stalls that also served as a ""shooting gallery,"" an area where drug users could inject heroin in the open without fear from law enforcement officers. Asked why counter narcotics officers do not intervene in Hpakant, Sai Thein Zaw of the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control in Myitkyina blames the Kachin insurgency. ""It is difficult to work in places like Hpakant because peace has not been achieved between the government and Kachin State,"" he says.  ""So it is hard to implement programs that work toward eliminating drugs in the region."" Worst yet to come . Despite state and community-led efforts to battle the drug trade, many community leaders predicted the worst was yet to come in Kachin. Due in part to high unemployment in the region, Reverend Hkalam says many recovering addicts quickly relapse after rehabilitation treatment. ""We see that the main problem is follow-up and vocational training,"" he says. ""Because if they go back home, jobless, it's very easy to return to the drugs again."" The scene at an overgrown cemetery near a camp for families displaced by the conflict underscores the scale of the heroin epidemic. Hundreds -- if not thousands -- of empty syringe wrappers litter the ground around crypts and tombs that had been nearly swallowed by vegetation. Used syringes and glass vials lay amid the graves. Against this macabre backdrop of death and drug abuse, our team encounters a couple of men injecting heroin at sunset. Surprised by foreign visitors, the men hastily hide their needles. One of the men, who identifies himself only as a 30-year-old farmer, uses leaves from a bush to wipe away blood dripping down his arm as he speaks. He says he can buy a dose of heroin for as little as 4,000 kyat, which is roughly equivalent to four U.S. dollars. ""If I have more money, I will use more [heroin],"" the man says. ""There are no limits if I have money."" After a 10-minute conversation, both drug users climb onto a motorcycle and ride away along the syringe-strewn path between the tombstones. Their used needles lie discarded in the grass.","CNN team encounters problem with heroin addiction in Myanmar's northern Kachin State .

"Protesters seeking the ouster of Romanian President Traian Basescu and early elections gathered for a fourth straight day Sunday in a main square of Bucharest, the capital, and 18 other cities in the Eastern European nation. The demonstrations, which included clashes between police and protesters Saturday in University Square that injured 17 people, are the most serious since Basescu's election in 2004. See images from the protests . Some of the hundreds who showed up at the square on Sunday demanded justice and blamed the government and austerity measures for their poor living standards. ""We have no financial security. My husband and I are retired but we are sharing our modest income with our children because they are jobless,"" said Rodica Ganea, who described being asked during hospital visits to pay for ""medicines, syringes, bandages, everything."" ""I can't afford it,"" Ganea said. Another woman, 64-year-old Marilena Salan, described similar circumstances. ""My kids are university graduates but they are jobless,"" Salan said. ""They are forced to break up their families, leave their kids home and go abroad to work. My nephews are growing up without their parents. This is unacceptable."" On Saturday, police fired tear gas to disperse thousands of protesters gathered in University Square to demonstrate against government austerity cuts. The protesters blocked traffic, waving flags with the centers ripped out to symbolize the 1989 communist revolution. Others carried signs reading ""Liberty"" and ""Down with President Basescu."" Police fired tear gas in an attempt to calm the crowd, and 17 people were hospitalized in the ensuing chaos with 50 fined for disturbing public peace. The injured included a local journalist and five police officers, one severely injured when demonstrators stoned him. The protests broke out Thursday after the resignation of Deputy Health Minister Raed Arafat, an opponent of health care reforms proposed by the government. Facing public pressure, Basescu decided to scrap the reforms Friday, saying he made the decision after realizing that a majority of those in the medical system opposed the change. ""The hospitals don't want the change, the (doctors) don't want the change and neither does the emergency health care system,"" Basescu said. Critics had argued that the proposal favored the private health care system by allowing access to government funds while the state-funded system lacks financial aid. The protests follow several unpopular measures taken by the government over the past two years. After receiving a loan of 20 billion euros from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union in 2009, the government cut salaries in the public sector by 25% a year later to enforce austerity measures recommended by the IMF. Prime Minister Emil Boc said on Sunday that a new series of debates on the health care issue will start Monday, with the intention of creating a new health care law. Over the past three days, protesters also held demonstrations in other cities including Cluj, Timisoara, Iasi and Targu Mures.","Protesters gather in Bucharest and 18 other Romanian cities .

"Just when it looked like Ukraine was settling down after toppling pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych over the weekend, tension flared again in Crimea, the southern part of the country where support for Russia is strong. Armed men seized regional government buildings in Crimea and hoisted the Russian flag. Rival demonstrators chanted ""Crimea is Russia"" and ""Crimea is not Russia"" back and forth at each other. With the peninsula turning into a flashpoint, here are five things you need to know about Crimea. 1. Crimea isn't legally part of Russia now, but it has been in the past. Moscow has had an interest in Crimea for hundreds of years, with its rich farmland and its access to the Black Sea. Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine in 1954, when both Russia and Ukraine were part of the Soviet Union. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, there was some local desire for Crimea to leave Ukraine and become part of Russia again, but lawmakers in Ukraine and Crimea voted for it to stay part of Ukraine. Gunmen seize government buildings in Crimea, raise Russian flag . 2. A lot of Russians still live in Crimea. There are actually three main groups in Crimea: ethnic Ukrainians in the north, Russians in the south, and a third group called Tatars in the middle. The Tatars represent 15 to 20% of the population and suffered badly under Stalin in the Soviet era. They're ""deadest against annexation by Russia,"" Alexander Motyl of Rutgers University told a Council on Foreign Relations audience last week. 3. Part of the Russian Navy is based in Crimea. Any talk about the importance of Crimea to Russia quickly turns to the Black Sea Fleet. The Russian Navy has had a base at the Crimean city of Sevastopol, on the Black Sea, for 230 years. Ships and subs based there are just north of Turkey and can reach the Mediterranean to influence the Middle East and the Balkans. An expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies has been arguing that the importance of the Black Sea Fleet can be overstated. It is the smallest of the Russian Navy's four fleets, and Russia has a Black Sea coast of its own. In fact, Russia is expanding its Black Sea port of Novorossiysk and moving military vessels there, Christian Le Miere argues. And yet Sevastopol clearly remains significant for Russia. In 2010, Moscow gave Ukraine a good deal on natural gas, partly in exchange for Kiev extending the Russian Navy lease on the base in Ukraine. 4. Crimea has played a vital role in world history before. Even if you don't know anything else about the Crimean War, you've heard of Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing. It was in the Crimean War in the 1850s that she became known as the Lady with the Lamp, caring for soldiers wounded in the war that Britain, France and Ottoman Turkey fought against Russia. Generations of British schoolchildren have memorized a poem dating from the war: ""The Charge of the Light Brigade,"" by Alfred Lord Tennyson. The poem commemorates a blunder when British troops attacked the wrong Russian position and were slaughtered, memorialized by Tennyson in the lines: ""Theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die."" That same battle added a word to the English language: It was called the Battle of Balaclava. 5. And don't forget Yalta, of course. When World War II was grinding to an end in 1945, the Allied leaders -- U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin -- met to divide up Europe. That meeting, which laid the groundwork for the Cold War, took place in the Crimean resort of Yalta. Opinion: Will Crimea be Europe's next 'frozen' conflict?","Tensions are running high in Ukraine's Crimea peninsula .
The region has historically been part of Russia, but it's Ukrainian now .

"(CNN) -- Former U.S. senator and Democratic presidential hopeful John Edwards admitted Friday to an extramarital affair. He denied being the father of the woman's child, as had been alleged in tabloid reports. Former Sen. John Edwards told ABC News that he had an affair with Rielle Hunter, seen above. In an interview on ABC News ""Nightline,"" Edwards acknowledged the affair with 42-year-old Rielle Hunter, which began after she was hired to make documentary videos for his campaign, ABC said. ""I am responsible for it. I alone am responsible for it,"" Edwards said on ABC News ""Nightline."" Edwards told the network that his rise from ""a small town boy in North Carolina"" who ""came from nothing"" to a successful lawyer, U.S. senator and national public figure ""fed a self-focus, an egotism, a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want."" Edwards, in the ABC interview, acknowledged meeting with Hunter at the Beverly Hills hotel at the request of a friend of hers. ""I was there from a very simple reason, because I was trying to keep this mistake that I had made from becoming public,"" Edwards said. In a written statement Friday, Edwards said, ""In 2006, I made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs. I recognized my mistake and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman, and I asked for her forgiveness."" ""You cannot beat me up more than I have already beaten up myself. I have been stripped bare and will now work with everything I have to help my family and others who need my help."" Read the full statement . Edwards said a blurry photograph published by the National Enquirer that purportedly showed him holding Hunter's child inside the hotel room could not be authentic, since the baby was not there at their meeting. ""I don't know if the picture has been altered, manufactured, if it's a picture of me taken some other time, holding another baby. I have no idea,"" he said. ""I was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken, I can tell you that."" Edwards said he has not taken a paternity test but that the timing of the affair rules out the possibility that he could be the father of Hunter's 5-month-old child. Edwards said Friday night he is ""truly hopeful"" that a paternity test will be done to squelch the rumors. Andrew Young, a former Edwards campaign aide who is married, has publicly said he fathered the child. The Washington Post reported Friday that Hunter acknowledged Young as the father. When the National Enquirer first reported the affair in October, Edwards flatly denied it, calling the claims ""false"" and ""ridiculous.""  Watch an interview with the National Enquirer's editor » . Contacted through a former aide by CNN on Thursday, Edwards had refused to comment on the reports. He also dodged reporters at a recent event in Washington. In a July 24 appearance in New Orleans, Louisiana, he would not answer a reporter's question about whether he had provided financial support to Hunter or Young.  Watch Edwards says ""I sin every single day"" » . ""I have no idea what you're asking about,"" Edwards said. ""I have responded to, consistently, to these tabloid allegations by saying I don't respond to these lies."" Edwards, 55, of North Carolina, told ABC that his wife, Elizabeth, and other family members have known about the affair since 2006. Elizabeth Edwards, in a posting on the Daily Kos Web site, said: . ""The fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done. But he did tell me. And we began a long and painful process in 2006, a process oddly made somewhat easier with my [cancer] diagnosis in March of 2007. This was our private matter, and I frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was I did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well."" Edwards, the vice presidential candidate during Sen. John Kerry's 2004 presidential bid, told ABC that he never expected to be chosen as Sen. Barack Obama's running mate, but that his public career has not ended. He said he would not worry about any possible positions in an Obama administration. ""I don't know what's possible and what's gone,"" he said. Don Fowler, a former Democratic Party chairman, said this week that Edwards might be forfeiting a major role at the party's upcoming convention in Denver -- or in a future Democratic administration -- unless he cleared the air. ""I think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to, the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot,"" Fowler said. iReport: What's your reaction to Edwards' affair? Fowler, of South Carolina, served as Democratic chairman from 1995 to 1997 and will be a party superdelegate at the Denver convention in late August. He said he had no input into whether Edwards addresses the convention, ""but I would expect that he would not speak or have any role at the convention unless this is cleared up.""  Watch more on the Edwards controversy » . Obama, in Hawaii for a weeklong vacation, told reporters he understands that Edwards does not plan to attend the convention. ""This is a difficult and painful time for them, and I think they need to work through that process of healing,"" he said. ""My sense is that that's going to be their top priority. ""John Edwards was a great champion of working people during the first of this campaign. Many of his themes are ones that Democrats as a whole share; those will be amplified at the convention,"" Obama added. Presumptive Republican nominee Sen. John McCain declined to comment on a similar question. Speaking in support of Obama in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Friday, Edwards' former rival, Sen. Hillary Clinton, responded briefly to a reporter's question about what, if any, impact the revelation of the affair would have on Democrats. ""My thoughts and prayers are with the Edwards family today,"" she said. ""That's all I have to say."" The Enquirer's claims about the affair were revived July 22 when the tabloid reported it had confronted Edwards at a Beverly Hills, California, hotel after receiving a tip he was meeting Hunter and her child there. On Friday, he said he was ashamed of the affair and hoped it would never become public. He said he used the fact that the Enquirer story ""contained many falsities"" to deny it. ""But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough,"" he said in the statement. Edwards told ABC that his wife's widely reported cancer was in remission when the affair began. ""She was mad; she was angry,"" Edwards said, describing when he admitted the affair to his wife. ""I think furious would be a good way to describe it.""  Watch Edwards describe his wife's reaction » . According to federal election records, the Edwards campaign paid Hunter's production company roughly $114,000 in 2006 and 2007 for ""Website/Internet services."" The former North Carolina senator announced in January that he was dropping out of the 2008 Democratic presidential race. ""It is time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path,"" he said in New Orleans. With his wife and children at his side, Edwards said he couldn't predict ""who will take the final steps to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,"" but he said it would be a Democrat. Edwards endorsed Sen. Barack Obama on May 14 during a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He trailed Clinton and Obama in the early contests. He came in third in key races in New Hampshire and South Carolina. Edwards had campaigned on the message that he was standing up for the little guy, the people who are not traditionally given a voice in Washington, and that he would do more to fight special interests. After dropping out of the race, Edwards asked Clinton and Obama to make poverty a central issue in the general election and a future Democratic administration, something both agreed to do. Edwards is a South Carolina native with an undergraduate degree from North Carolina State University and law degree from the University of North Carolina. Before entering politics, winning a Senate seat from North Carolina in 1998, Edwards was a lawyer representing families ""being victimized by powerful interests"" and gaining ""a national reputation as a forceful and tireless champion for regular, hard-working people,"" according to his campaign Web site. CNN's Ed Hornick, Scott Bronstein, Drew Griffin, Matt Smith and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.","Edwards: ""I made a serious error in judgment""

"Passing laws is one thing; enforcing them is another. Enter New York City's idling rule, meant to improve the city's air quality by prohibiting drivers from running their engines when they're not moving. Toxic tailpipe fumes have been shown to increase rates of asthma and put children at risk of developmental delays, environmental studies show. When cars and buses line up outside of schools, all those idling engines can worsen the quality of air both inside and outside the school, as children and parents come and go. By putting air-quality monitors in backpacks on pregnant mothers in New York, researchers at the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health have shown that fetuses exposed to greater pollution in the womb are more likely to experience developmental delays as children. For years, New York drivers have had three minutes to turn off idling engines, and in 2009 the city passed more stringent laws: Drivers now have one minute to turn off their engines if they're adjacent to a school. But environmental advocates complain the laws do little to improve air quality because the legislation in place is only minimally enforced. The city issues about 10 million parking tickets each year but only a few thousand idling tickets. If the traffic enforcement agents were properly citing drivers who violated the rule, the number of idling tickets would be significantly higher, say advocates, because violation of the rule is so widespread. A 2008 New York City Council oversight committee report said as much, too, stating: ""Although idling restrictions have been in place in New York City since 1971, many drivers persist in idling their engines, leading to questions about the effectiveness of our idling law."" On display a year later, at a press conference announcing the tougher idling rules around schools, were environmental and health advocates on the one hand celebrating a legislative win, but on the other hand still concerned about a lack of enforcement follow-through. ""We are therefore urging you, Mayor Bloomberg, to direct NYPD's traffic enforcement agents to finally enforce the anti-idling laws,"" said Isabelle Silverman, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund, at the 2009 press conference with Mayor Michael Bloomberg. ""Consistent enforcement is the only way that New Yorkers will finally get the message that unnecessary curbside idling is no longer tolerated in our city."" The mayor, while reiterating environmental values, pointed to the difficulties of marshaling systemic enforcement during a recession. ""The real challenge here is that in the good times everybody is in favor of environmental stuff, and when the times get tougher, it's probably the first thing to be jettisoned,"" Bloomberg said. ""It's just incumbent on those of us that want to leave a good life for our children, and want to have clean air for us to breathe, and clean water to drink, and this is not just for the future, it's for the present as well, it's incumbent on us to really carry the fight."" CNN's full coverage: Toxic America . But little has changed in three years, advocates say. The issue of enforcement arose again at a December press conference with Bloomberg. ""Well, I will take a look at it and see. We'd like to enforce it more,"" Bloomberg said. ""Keep in mind, enforcement costs money; the people that enforce have plenty of other things to do. (The) police department's first job is going to be worrying about more serious things."" But it would be easy to enforce the law properly, advocates said, because agents enforcing parking rules could also crack down on idling. ""The traffic enforcement agents are ideally suited to give the idling tickets because they are already walking up and down the street looking for parking violations. In addition, the TEAs' health is negatively impacted by illegal idling,"" said the Environmental Defense Fund's Silverman. ""The TEAs have had authority to give idling tickets since September 2009, and yet they have only given, on average, one ticket per agent per year. Consistent and rigorous idling enforcement is the only way to let drivers know that illegal idling is no longer tolerated for health reasons in NYC."" The mayor's office issued no comment to CNN regarding enforcement but confirmed that 2,989 tickets were issued for idling in fiscal year 2011. After passing tougher idling rules, the city initiated a public awareness campaign through GreeNYC to inform drivers and parents of the health dangers, and economic waste, of engine idling. ""Children's asthma symptoms increase as a result of vehicle exhaust,"" says one New York City Department of Environmental Protection flier. ""Idling for longer than 10 seconds wastes more fuel than restarting your engine.""

"""Mommy, where do allergies come from?"" The question, from a boy sitting at a table near mine, caught my attention. Obviously a pro at handling the random curiosities of a young child, his mom said: ""From flowers and grass and foods like peanuts."" The boy went back to his meal, seemingly satisfied with her answer. I was not. Scientists know what causes allergies. When particles of pollen, pet dander or certain types of food enter our bodies, they're called antigens. If your body has a sensitivity to that particle, it mistakes the harmless element for a dangerous invader, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. The particle then becomes what we call an allergen, although a sensitivity to a substance alone doesn't guarantee you will develop an allergy. Allergens cause your body to produce Immunoglobulin E, or IgE, antibodies. Antibodies are used to identify and destroy dangerous invaders. Unfortunately, IgE antibodies also release histamine and other chemicals that can create an allergic reaction. But what causes one person to become sensitive to these indiscriminate antigens floating through the air, while another sails through life with dry eyes and clear sinuses? Scientists aren't exactly sure, but they have a few ideas. Dr. Christine Cole Johnson has been studying allergies since the early 1980s. Her research team at Henry Ford Hospital was the first to show that having a pet in the house during your child's first year of life may protect him or her from developing allergies -- a finding that's since been duplicated in other studies. Her latest research suggests allergy development starts even before that. Johnson analyzed data from a group of more than 1,200 newborns who were born in Michigan between 2003 and 2007, and have been evaluated by researchers at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years old. Acupuncture may be antidote for allergies . She found that babies born by cesarean section are six times more likely to be sensitive to dust mite allergens than babies born naturally. The researcher found similar results for exposure to cat- and dog-hair allergens. Babies who are born via C-section have a different microbiome in their gastrointestinal tract, Johnson said. A microbiome is what scientists use to describe the bacteria communities that reside in humans, whether it's in our mouths, on our skin or in our digestive system. ""It's pretty astonishing. In human beings, bacterial cells outnumber human cells 10 to 1,"" Johnson said. ""These bacteria are important -- we couldn't exist without them."" In the womb, babies are sterile, Johnson explained. When they go through the birth canal, they get exposed to the entire bacteria population of their mother's vaginal and GI microbiomes. Through this exposure, their own immune systems learn the difference between good and bad bacteria -- i.e. what to fight off and what to use. Babies born through C-section have bacteria in their gut that more closely resembles their mother's skin microbiome, Johnson said. Eventually their digestive bacteria normalize, but that delay could give allergen exposure time to develop into a sensitivity. Of course, that's just one possible cause of allergies -- or just one possible cause of many possible causes. Johnson's colleague Dr. Haejin Kim, an allergist at Henry Ford, is looking into how genetics may play a role. Kim's latest study found African-American children are sensitized to food allergens three times more often than Caucasian children. It also concluded that an African-American kid with an allergic parent is twice as likely to be sensitized to an environmental allergen than an African-American kid without an allergic parent. Kim said her results didn't change with the child's birth order -- another possible allergy risk factor -- or if the child was male or female. Race alone put them at a higher risk. ""This suggests that (allergies) might be genetic,"" Kim said, something scientists have long suspected. But it's not like a genetic disease that's 100% inherited. ""There's no one gene for allergies or asthma. It's probably a combination of multiple genes interacting somehow with the environment."" Up to 50 million Americans have some kind of allergy, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Jonathan Silverberg, a dermatologist at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York, recently analyzed data from more than 91,000 children to determine whether children born outside the United States were as likely as American children to develop allergies. He found that foreign-born children residing in the United States had half the risk of developing allergies than those who were born here. That was true for all types of allergies, including food allergies, although the association was strongest for asthma. When food allergies are a weapon for bullies . Silverberg and his colleagues started the study after realizing they were seeing foreign-born children at their practice developing allergies much later in life. They found that the foreign-born kids who lived in the United States for more than 10 years had a higher prevalence of allergies than the children who had only been in the country for a couple of years. Scientists know that environmental exposures play a role in allergic disease; you can't be sensitized to something you've never been exposed to. But in the past researchers have focused on allergens in the air, Silverberg said, such as pollen or ragweed, instead of other environmental exposures. These other factors could be related to a child's climate, diet or geography-specific infections. ""What (this study shows) is that there's something about what we're experiencing in the U.S. compared to many other countries that seems to really lead people to, or unmask, allergic disease,"" he said. Which factor -- if any -- plays the dominant role is so far unclear. It's hard to make any practical conclusions from these kinds of studies, Silverberg said. But eventually knowing where allergies come from could help us figure out a way to prevent them, or at least treat them more effectively. Then allergy sufferers will be able to frolic in the flowers and roll in the grass and eat peanuts just like everyone else.

"It's no secret that a battle has boiled over in the Republican Party. The fight has played out in the policy arena but also on the campaign trail. And since the inception of the tea party in 2009, it seemed like that wing had the upper hand. It slowly made effective inroads into a party many members of the vocal new group thought had lost its way. They elected a new breed of Republican into office, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who surprised the political world by defeating establishment-backed candidates in their respective primaries. But those two successes haven't been the norm, especially in the Senate, as many inexperienced but ideologically more pure candidates have been unable to seal the deal. In 2010, Sharron Angle won the Senate primary in Nevada and Christine O'Donnell won in Delaware. Two years later, Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin won in Indiana and Missouri respectively. All four went on to lose against the Democrat. In a year in which Republicans have their best shot in several elections of regaining control of the Senate, party leaders are hoping to avoid general election stumbles. The Republican establishment is off to a good start this primary season, but it had an easy opener. Texas Sen. John Cornyn easily won his primary against tea party backed challenger Rep. Steve Stockman, who was largely persona-non-grata during his campaign. Still he spent $2.6 million in the final weeks leading up to the early March primary. Brian Walsh, a former Cornyn spokesman and former communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), which works to get Republicans elected to the Senate, said Cornyn did the work necessary to beat a challenger, including researching possible opponents and raising money. ""It's not a coincidence that John Cornyn won,"" he said. Republican incumbents fight back . Senate Republicans want to make sure that what happened in Texas happens elsewhere. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who is facing a primary challenge from Matt Bevin, has taken the unusual step of publicly criticizing at least one group working to defeat some GOP incumbents, including McConnell - the Senate Conservative Fund. ""I think we are going to crush them everywhere,"" referring to SCF-backed candidates. ""I don't think they are going to have a single nominee anywhere in the country,"" he said in a recent interview with The New York Times. And in an interview with The Weekly Standard, McConnell said the organization is giving conservatism ""a bad name."" ""We know their business model is only to criticize Republicans,"" he said. SCF Executive Director Matt Hoskins said in a statement to CNN that its members know that beating McConnell ""won't be easy."" But they're working to elect Matt Bevin ""because they know things won't change in Washington unless we change the people we send there."" While McConnell's press office said he was talking specifically about the SCF, tea party groups took offense. ""He must not want the tea party vote in the general election and that is why he should be removed,"" Amy Kremer, the Tea Party Express chair, told CNN previously. And the local Louisville Tea Party group endorsed Bevin last week. McConnell is expected to win his primary, but he's not making many friends among groups aligned with the tea party. Evangelical Latinos say they could be force in midterm elections . Incumbents at risk . The SCF is not the only thorn in Republican incumbents' side. In addition to the local and national tea party groups, Washington-based operations like Club for Growth and FreedomWorks have vowed to make sure that Republicans in name only (RINOs) -- those viewed as not committed to their description of a limited government -- have to empty out their Washington offices after November. Other Senate incumbents facing primaries include Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts and Mississippi's Thad Cochran. In Cochran's race, the conservative Club for Growth published an op-ed this week in SunHerald.com in Mississippi calling him a ""liberal"" because, among other things, he voted to create the Department of Education in the 1970s. ""Why would his seventh term be any different from the last six?"" Club for Growth President Chris Chocola, a former member of Congress who voted for the budget-busting expansion of Medicare Part D in 2003, wrote in the opinion piece. Republican strategist John Feehery said that claim is ridiculous. ""These guys are desperate and they are losing, so they are going to be using more and more language that is less and less rational,"" he said. But Stuart Rothernberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, said Cochran could have problems against State Sen. Chris McDaniel, who will benefit from money and resources of the Club for Growth and the SCF. ""If there's going to be an incumbent whose defeated, Cochran is the first name on the list,"" Rothenberg said. Perhaps because Cochran, who has served in the Senate for 42 years and won his last election with 61% of the vote, doesn't yet understand the strength of his opponent. ""The tea party is something I don't really know a lot about,"" he said on local station WLOX. But the Republican establishment isn't sitting on its hands and is even active in states like Mississippi and Kansas where any Republican would most likely to win. ""In the past, if it's a red state, we'd say 'we don't need to pay attention to that,'"" said Walsh, adding that incumbents are prepared this year. Primary involvement . And in primaries where there is no incumbent, the establishment is taking the calculated and unorthodox step of coalescing around favored candidates. While individual senators often endorse candidates, Walsh said the organization took ""a hands off"" approach during the last two election cycles. This year, the organization is more engaged. What's unclear, however, is exactly what resources the NRSC is providing to preferred candidates. In North Carolina, candidate Thom Tillis is the establishment favorite against tea party and FreedomWorks-backed candidates. He held a fundraiser at NRSC headquarters in Washington on Monday. McConnell attended as did a number of the 17 GOP senators who have endorsed him. Tillis spokesman Jordan Shaw said he can't speak about the role the NRSC is playing in the race. ""I don't work for them and can't speak for"" the NRSC, Shaw said. ""Until we clear the primary, we've got to be respectful of the process."" Asked if the NRSC was getting involved in any primaries this year and if it could identify specific ways the group was helping, spokeswoman Brook Hougesen said, ""As we have said time and again, any Republican candidate running for Senate is free to use our building as a location for their fundraiser,"" Hougesen wrote in an email. ""This is all information that has been repeatedly reported."" If Tillis' doesn't beat his opponents, OB-GYN Greg Brannon and pastor Mark Harris, in the May 6 primary, Democrat Kay Hagan's path to reelection is thought to get a lot easier. A similar scenario is playing out in Louisiana where Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu is in danger of losing her seat in the state that President Barack Obama lost by 12 points in 2012. Conservative groups, including the SCF, endorsed Rob Maness, a candidate who announced that he would not support McConnell as Republican leader, over well-funded, establishment-preferred Republican Bill Cassidy. What changed . Republican strategist John Feehery said Republican incumbents have learned their lesson from difficult losses in the past two election cycles. ""I think Republicans have recruited better candidates and incumbents are taking this seriously,"" he said. The government shutdown over Obamacare funding was also a pivotal moment for the Republican Party as many in the GOP thought it was a pointless endeavor. After the shutdown ended, House Speaker John Boehner said conservative groups like FreedomWorks, which advocated the shutdown strategy, have ""lost all credibility."" And he said in January the shutdown strategy was a ""predictable disaster."" The shutdown ""hurt their standing and degraded some of the leverage they had,"" Republican strategist and former Boehner spokesman Kevin Madden said. ""That leverage has now swung back toward McConnell and Boehner."" Lessons from Florida's special election . Some establishment candidates are receiving an added boost. The Chamber of Commerce, which usually does not get involved in primaries, decided that this year would be different. ""Our goal for 2014 is to protect and expand a pro-business majority in the House and advance our position in the Senate. How do we accomplish that? We're going early, often, and local,"" the chamber wrote on its website. The chamber has backed McConnell and a series of other races that are seeing opposition from conservative groups. Feehery said McConnell has nothing to lose by going after groups like the SCF who, he said, make their money by being ""professionally unhappy."" ""These people have no desire to find common ground. Nothing that Mitch McConnell will do will make these groups happy,"" Feehery said.","Republicans are taking an aggressive stance against intra-party opposition .

"Almost everyone, from educators to government officials to industry experts, laments the lackluster abilities and performance of our nations' students in science, technology, engineering and math (know as STEM education). Two indicators are particularly worrisome, especially as this country experiences greater global competition and high unemployment. American students score 23rd in math and 31st in science when compared with 65 other top industrial countries.  In math, we are beaten by countries from Lichtenstein and Slovakia to the Netherlands and Singapore.  In science, we are beaten by countries from New Zealand and Estonia to Finland and Hungary. For the United States, which led the way in space after Sputnik and showed the way in technological development and economic growth for the last 40 years, this is more than an embarrassment.  And, for the future of our own GDP, economic well-being, and employer and employment needs, this is a disaster in the making. If the United States wishes to remain the most competitive and innovative country in the world -- never mind just another competitive and innovative country in the constellation of industrial nations -- this cannot stand. As a report released this week from the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology found, ""economic forecasts point to a need for producing, over the next decade, approximately 1 million more college graduates in STEM fields than expected under current assumptions."" Already, for many, the answer is to import the technological know-how that we need.  There is nothing wrong with importing high-skilled labor and expanding visas and citizenship quotas for those needs we can't meet ourselves, but should we not be able to do a better job in growing and training our own citizens and students first? President Barack Obama brought attention to the problem this week while hosting the second annual White House Science Fair. Featuring more than 100 middle school and high school students with their various inventions, the president talked not just about the economic reasons important to our success in STEM education but also our historic — indeed, founding — commitment to it: . ""[T]he belief that we belong on the cutting edge of innovation, that's an idea as old as America itself. ... You think about our Founding Fathers -- they were all out there doing experiments -- and folks like Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, they were constantly curious about the world around them and trying to figure out how can we help shape that environment so that people's lives are better. ""It's in our DNA."" To tell students already engaged in experimentation, innovation and invention that scientific knowledge is in our DNA is more than appropriate.  But for too many students, it simply is not true today. Indeed, when it comes to math and science, we don't just fail compared to other industrialized nations, we fail ourselves.  Only 26% of our nation's high school seniors perform at proficient levels or above in mathematics and only 21% of our nation's high school seniors perform at proficient levels or above in science.  And, when these students do enter college on a pathway toward a degree in science or engineering, nearly 40% of them switch majors in what one expert has called ""the math-science death march."" To improve these numbers, and to become a nation strong in innovation again, will require a lot of work, but it is work that is doable. Here's how: . I.                   Front-load STEM-related teaching.  Tap into children's natural curiosity and teach it earlier in school, and recognize subjects like math and science are as important as English. One recent story out of Chicago showed the benefit to students in learning math as early as preschool, where the lessons are integrated into ""story time, puzzle time, just about any time of the day."" II.                Recognize that teachers, especially in the early grades, need training in math so  they can integrate it as much as possible into children's school life and curriculum. III.             Do not segregate math and science classes from the rest of the school building or coursework. Turn away from the notion of specialized elementary and secondary schools whose focus is on math and science. These areas of study should be in all schools and deemed a critical part of each and every school's broad curriculum.  Students who excel in these areas should not be seen as ""different"" or libeled as ""special"" or worse. IV.             Each and every class taught, where possible and relevant, should adopt forms of mathematical and scientific methods in its pedagogy, engage in practices of ""building models, arguing from evidence and communicating findings"" so as to ""increase the likelihood that students will learns the ideas of science or engineering and mathematics at a deeper, more enduring level,"" as two STEM scholars recently suggested. V.                School districts and principals should avail themselves of nonprofit organizations that are dedicated to supplemental training of teachers in STEM areas.  Most good teachers want additional training. And most adults cheer when students light up in these areas after they are inspired by a great teacher. Many of us have seen the Chevron commercial that shows an eighth grade student, Kaisaiah, building a robot and calling science ""cool,"" with the help of Project Lead the Way (to which I'm a senior adviser).  Enterprising organizations such as Project Lead the Way host additional training for teachers.  Students who take courses from these teachers are more interested and dedicated to their coursework than those who are not. With teachers who can show the relevance and fun of STEM education, we can nurture more students to build the kind of experiments and models one sees at events such as the White House Science Fair. We now know from study after study the value of great teachers.  Quite simply, the effect of a quality teacher on a child's life is monumental. Corporations should further endow nonprofits dedicated to enhancing teachers' abilities, and school districts and principals should further utilize these auxiliary institutions. In the end, the test of whether we should do better at teaching STEM education does not require an analysis of what our leaders of industries say they are looking for or what international tests show as our failings. It is simply this:  Ask any adult not employed in a STEM area of work: ""Don't you wish you studied and appreciated math and science courses earlier in school?""  The answer almost always is going to be: ""yes.""  And so, too, should it be for students now ... not adults later. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter .

"Edward Herrmann, the versatile, honey-voiced actor whose roles included patricians and politicians such as ""Gilmore Girls"" father Richard Gilmore, ""The Practice"" law professor Anderson Pearson and President Franklin D. Roosevelt, has died. He was 71. Herrmann passed away Wednesday at a hospital in New York. The cause of death was a brain tumor, according to his manager, Robbie Kass. ""Besides being an accomplished actor, was also a true gentleman and a scholar, as well as being an incredibly kind and decent man. He will be sorely missed,"" Kass told CNN. ""My friend Ed Herrmann was the kindest, classiest, most talented man. It was an honor and a joy to know him, a devastating blow to lose him,"" tweeted Lauren Graham, who starred as Lorelai Gilmore in ""Gilmore Girls."" Over a career that stretched over more than four decades, Herrmann was rarely the star but always a standout. In a 1980 episode of ""M*A*S*H,"" he played a visiting surgeon who starts out confident and polished but can't keep up with the pace. In ""St. Elsewhere,"" he had a recurring role as Father Joseph McCabe, the sturdy founder of St. Eligius, the show's hospital, who offered guidance to a future doctor. The latter role earned him two Emmy nominations. And then there was Richard Gilmore, the blue-blooded father of Lorelai Gilmore, whose snappy dialogue -- often with his daughter or his wife (Kelly Bishop) -- couldn't hide his big heart, especially when it came to his granddaughter Rory, played by Alexis Bledel. That relationship was reflected in real life, he told the A.V. Club in 2012. ""I was sort of delegated from time to time to look after her, and I was very, very fond of her,"" he said, noting that Bledel had a number of challenges her first years on the show. ""One summer, I thought, 'She's not going to make it. She's going to burn out.' But then she went to Italy with a friend to learn cooking, and I thought, ""She's going to be fine.' "" Herrmann had his star turns as well. He was nominated twice for Emmys for his portrayal of FDR, first in the TV movie ""Eleanor and Franklin"" (1976) and then in the next year's ""Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years."" (He also played Roosevelt in the 1982 movie version of ""Annie."") He won a Tony for his performance in a 1976 revival of George Bernard Shaw's ""Mrs. Warren's Profession."" His performance in ""The Practice"" led to his only Emmy win. Even people who didn't recognize him probably knew his mellifluous voice from audiobooks and History Channel documentaries. But, in general, he was content to be a supporting performer, one of the esteemed and distinctive cadre of performers thought of as ""character actors."" He went easily from role to role -- his Internet Movie Database page includes 130 credits, including small spots in ""American Dad,"" ""30 Rock"" and ""Drop Dead Diva"" -- and he reveled in the work. In the A.V. Club interview, he expresses enthusiasm for almost everything he appeared in. His co-stars are often ""great"" or ""wonderful,"" and he has kind words for forgotten films such as ""Harry's War"" and his appearance in the maligned 2011 comedy ""Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star."" ""Sometimes I'm stuck in a straitjacket with suits, playing Alger Hiss and Roosevelt and so on, and I said, 'These guys are really wonky, and they're where the kids are these days, so do it!

"A senior Palestinian Authority official died Wednesday after a confrontation with Israeli troops, prompting President Mahmoud Abbas to halt security coordination with Israel, according to Palestinian officials. Ziyad Abu Ein died after clashes with Israeli soldiers midday Wednesday in the Palestinian village of Turmusaya, which is northeast of the West Bank city of Ramallah, longtime chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said in a statement. Abu Ein -- a minister in Abbas' Fatah party and head of the Committee to Resist the Wall and Settlements -- was there participating in nonviolent demonstrations to mark international Human Rights Day, according to Erakat's statement. There were varying reports of exactly how Abu Ein died, including what role -- if any -- Israeli authorities played in it. Pictures from various news agencies depict an Israeli soldier with his hands to Abu Ein's neck, followed by another showing him on the ground. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA, meanwhile, reported that the Palestinian official lost consciousness after he inhaled tear gas and an Israeli soldier hit him in the chest. ""The Israeli soldiers called Abu Ein by name and seemed to be focused on him,"" witness Kamal Abu Safaka told CNN. ""There was a lot of pushing, kicking and punching by the soldiers. ... When Abu Ein tried to intercede, they hit him on the chest with a rifle butt and grabbed him by the throat and pushed him back and then threw a large amount of tear gas and stun grenades."" Dr. Ahmed Bitawi, the director of the Ramallah hospital that inspected Abu Ein's body, said he died from asphyxiation after choking on vomit brought on by tear gas inhalation. But a preliminary autopsy report released by the Israeli government indicated that Abu Ein's death was caused by a blockage of the coronary artery due to hemorrhaging. The bleeding could have been caused by stress, the report said, suggesting the poor condition of Abu Ein's heart caused him to be more sensitive to stress. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a message -- via his special envoy Yitzhak Molcho -- to Palestinian Authority officials telling them that Israel will investigate the death, according to a government statement. ""The Prime Minister, who has been holding security consultations throughout the day, pointed to the need to calm the situation and act responsibly,"" the statement said. The Israeli military said in a statement that the incident happened after its ""forces halted the progress of (about 200) rioters into the civilian community of Abed-Ad using riot dispersal means."" ""The IDF is reviewing the circumstances of the participation of Ziyad Abu Ein and his later death,"" the Israeli military said, noting an Israeli pathologist will join a group of pathologists from Jordan for an examination. ""... Additionally, a proposal has been made to the Palestinians to establish a joint investigation team to review the incident."" Jordanian Minister of Information Mohammed Al-Momani said that two forensic doctors were sent to the West Bank ""to help in determining the cause of (Abu Ein's) death"" in response ""to a Palestinian request."" Declaring three days of mourning, Abbas slammed Abu Ein's death as an ""intolerable barbaric act,"" according to WAFA. ""What happened is a crime by all means, we cannot sit idle and silent (after) this crime,"" he said later on Palestinian television. ""For that, this leadership is meeting now to decide what it wants, and I say honestly all options are open for discussion and for implementation. ... We don't have any other solutions."" Hanan Ashrawi, an executive member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said Abbas also froze security coordination with Israel. Jibril Rajoub, a member of Fatah's central committee, confirmed this development. A meeting of PLO representatives Wednesday night about the day's development's was ""heated,"" Ashrawi said. One of the options discussed at the session was taking the Palestinian case to the U.N. Security Council. There will be another meeting Friday. Ashrawi is among the Palestinians outraged by the minister's death, demanding ""an international and impartial investigation."" ""This is a deliberate and willful act of murder and criminality,"" she said.","Autopsy report released by Israel says Ziyad Abu Ein died from blocked artery .

"There have now been nearly 9,000 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) across seven affected countries. At least 4,400 people have died so far in this, the worst outbreak of EVD since it emerged in 1976. The World Health Organization (WHO) is warning that weekly cases could reach 10,000 by the start of December -- it is clear that the peak of this epidemic hasn't yet been reached. Understandably, countries around the world -- particularly those affected (Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States of America) -- have been examining their defenses against importing cases. These have become ever more emergent since Thomas Eric Duncan -- who contracted Ebola -- traveled to Texas from Africa, leading to the subsequent secondary transmission of the infection of two people who treated him, Nina Pham and Amber Vinson. Public concerns about the infection haven't been allayed by public health officials, despite many of us stressing that we are well-prepared for detecting and responding to imported cases. Our preparations in Asia hark back to 2003 when the world was faced with its first modern-day pandemic, in the form of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, caused by the SARS-coronavirus. This virus first appeared in November 2002, with the first WHO outbreak alert being made in March 2003. At the time SARS caused a huge amount of public and professional anxiety, principally due to its apparent ease of transmission (via respiratory droplets and fomites) and its very early global spread from China to Canada, Hong Kong and Vietnam. However, looking back this was a far less severe infection than Ebola, with estimates of 10,000 cases in total and around 1,000 deaths. However, two significant aspects make us remember and learn from SARS. One is the fact that 30 countries had cases within a few weeks of the outbreak, and the second is the estimated $30-$100 billion cost to the world economy. Most of these economic costs were in travel and tourism with public anxiety about the disease leading to airports becoming ghost towns, schools closing, shopping malls deserted and healthcare workers shunned. Emerging infections were no longer viewed as a healthcare problem but as a whole-of-government problem with strong coordination required between transportation, immigration, communications, finance, water and sanitation, defense, housing, and education. The decision-making processes in response to an epidemic are complex and highly challenging, and require a clear chain of command with timely, accurate, appropriate and feasible plans put forward. Global action . In recognition of the interconnected world that we live in and the need to expand the scope of notifiable diseases, the International Health Regulations (IHR) -- a legally-binding agreement that provides a framework for the coordination of the management of global public health events -- underwent a revision in 2005. Here the notion of ""public health emergencies of international concern"" was introduced, as was the need for countries to establish a minimum core of public health capacities. In response to the IHR and the clear need for multi-agency and ministry planning to be in place, most countries developed pandemic plans. In order for these to cater for worst-case scenarios (i.e. transmissible infections with high attack rates), influenza became the focus -- the influenza pandemic plans for Asia can be found here. Many of these are modeled on the generic WHO plan but tailored for specific countries. These plans were implemented during the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza, or ""swine flu"" pandemic. Some countries in Asia also used them during recent outbreaks of A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) ""avian flu."" But influenza is much more transmissible than the Ebola virus, so the recent focus by many countries' public health ministries has been to adjust their plans along the lines of current WHO guidelines. Lessons have also been learned regarding what doesn't work. The screening of incoming passengers into airports was practiced widely during the 2009 influenza pandemic. However many countries note that they did not detect a single case through the use of these measures. Thermal scanners at airports to detect fever have been shown to be of limited use. The WHO has continued to stress these facts, but political considerations have led some countries, notably the U.S. and UK, to implement incoming passenger screening anyway. Travel restrictions . Finally the question of travel restrictions has been raised by a number of commentators. These were used to good effect during SARS but were of limited use during the 2009 influenza pandemic. It is widely acknowledged that the damage caused by travel restrictions to the economies of the West African countries would compound the very significant economic costs already experienced. Travel restrictions would only make it more difficult for the international community to provide the healthcare workers and supplies needed to get the outbreak under control. While thinking about our own infection control processes and planning for imported cases, we need to remember that the sure-fire way to prevent domestic EVD cases is by pitching into the global effort in West Africa. While the outbreak continues to grow exponentially, the risk of spillover into other countries increases. While ensuring that we have domestic plans in place is good, all of us need to recognize our role as good global citizens and give aid and help to those countries worst affected.","WHO is warning that weekly cases could reach 10,000 by the start of December .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Indians live with noise. Funnel-shaped loudspeakers mounted atop houses of worship blare before dawn. Painting a big ""Horn Please"" sign on the rear bumpers of trucks, buses and vans muscling their way down the country's clogged roadways is common now. Giant generators roar in neighborhoods during power outages. Residents bear the crackle of machines from factories that might be operating clandestinely in officially non-commercial areas. Rarely is a celebration -- religious or social -- held without loud music. But Indian policy-makers have prepared what they call a road map aimed at controlling pervasive noise. And one of the latest steps they have taken is to give comfort to citizens at bedtime. They have defined night in legal terms. ""The nighttime has been defined (10 p.m. to 6 a.m.) and restrictions have been imposed on the use of horns, sound-emitting construction equipments and bursting of firecrackers during nighttime,"" the federal environment ministry said. It also outlined what constitutes a public place and limits sound amplification from such locations. Residents will have to keep their music below new limits, as set by amendments to the nation's noise rules, the ministry said. Indian officials also announced noise-monitoring stations in major cities, including New Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, by September. Eighteen more cities will join the system by 2011, the ministry said. ""With the new system in place, a systematic national level monitoring and reporting network in the country will be available, as in case of air and water pollution."" Environmentalists welcome the moves. Nevertheless, they see enforcement as a big challenge -- and awareness even bigger. Anumita Roychowdhury, an expert at the nonprofit Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi, said noise violations occur despite existing laws and court orders. ""People have to develop self-discipline and authorities the capacity to monitor noise and enforce the laws to contain its high levels across the country,"" Roychowdhury said. So far, both are limited, she added.","Indian policy-makers have defined nighttime to control pervasive noise .

"At least eight mortar rounds rained down on the Somali capital of Mogadishu late Wednesday, security officials and witnesses said. The mortar attacks, the second barrage to rattle the capital in the past week, were scattered across several parts of Mogadishu, including the presidential palace and the national theater, the officials and witnesses said. Reports of casualties and damage were not immediately available, security officials said. Mohamud Shiekh, a witness near the national theater, said that at least one mortar landed near presidential palace. ""It was really scary. It's reminiscent of the 2010 chaos,"" he said. A barrage of mortar fire from Islamic extremists pummeled parts of the Somali capital for two nights last week, near the presidential palace and other government buildings. Some civilian homes were struck. At least 13 civilians were injured in last week's attacks. Al-Shabaab, the Somali-based group with ties to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for last week's attacks. In recent years, U.S. officials had considered Al-Shabaab to be diminished in strength, but after the attack at the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya last year, officials have worried that the group has demonstrated a renewed capability. Somali national army and African Union peacekeepers are in final preparations for major offensive against Al-Shabaab, according to President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. The radical Islamist group, which controls parts of Somalia, has said it aims to turn the country into a fundamentalist Islamist state.","For the second week in a row, mortar fire strikes Somali capital .

"Farmers' frequent use of antibiotics to help their livestock grow is contributing to the rise of dangerous antibiotic-resistant bacteria, according to the Food and Drug Administration. On Wednesday, the government agency announced a new plan to phase out the use of certain antibiotics in the food production industry. ""It is important to use these drugs only when medically necessary,"" the FDA said on its website. ""Governments around the world consider antimicrobial-resistant bacteria a major threat to public health."" Many of the antibiotics used in animals are also used to treat humans when they get sick. Illnesses caused by bacteria are more likely to be fatal if overuse has made the germs resistant to medication, the FDA says. An FDA report released in April showed that 81% of all the raw ground turkey the agency tested was contaminated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. And turkey wasn't the only problem -- antibiotic-resistant bacteria were found in about 69% of pork chops, 55% of ground beef and 39% of chicken. Antibiotics are used in livestock to prevent disease, but they are also used as a protectant and to aid growth. About 29.9 million pounds of antibiotics were sold in 2011 for meat and poultry production, compared with the 7.7 million pounds sold for human use, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. ""Antibiotic use in animals is out of hand,"" said Dr. Gail Hansen, a veterinarian and senior officer for the Pew Campaign on Human Health and Industrial Farming, a project aimed at phasing out overuse of antibiotics in food production. ""We feed antibiotics to sick animals, which is completely appropriate, but we also put antibiotics in their feed and in their water to help them grow faster and to compensate for unhygienic conditions. If you have to keep the animals healthy with drugs, I would argue you need to re-examine the system. You don't take antibiotics preventively when you go out into the world."" What government tests found in your meat . The FDA will now begin working to address how farmers are using these drugs to enhance animals' growth or reduce the amount of feed they have to use. Its plan also explains how animal pharmaceutical companies can voluntarily revise their drug labels to remove animal production as an approved use, effectively making it illegal to use the drugs for growth enhancement. Under the plan, therapeutic uses of animal antibiotics would require veterinary oversight, meaning antibiotics could be used in food-producing animals only under a veterinarian's orders to treat, prevent or control disease. ""With these changes, there will be fewer approved uses, and the remaining uses will be under tighter control,"" said Michael Taylor, deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine at the FDA. Companies have 90 days to let the FDA know if they intend to participate and three years to make the changes. In a statement, the Animal Health Institute said it and its member companies support the policy and will continue to work with the FDA to implement it. ""We are in favor of maintaining the important therapeutic uses of disease treatment, disease control and disease prevention, and believe that phasing out sub-therapeutic uses will increase consumer confidence that antibiotics are being used wisely to protect animal health and thereby human health,"" the organization said. The American Meat Institute also said it welcomed the move. What's in your holiday poultry? ""AMI strongly supports the prudent and judicious use of antibiotics in food animal production under the care of a veterinarian, as defined by the American Veterinary Medical Association, which is consistent with protecting both animal and public health, ensuring the ability to medically treat animals, and maintaining the highest standard of animal welfare practices,"" the group said, adding the FDA proposal ""adheres to these principles."" But the Natural Resources Defense Council, a non-profit environmental advocacy group, bashed the FDA's plan, saying it fails to require any change in the use of antibiotics. ""FDA's policy is an early holiday gift to industry,"" NRDC health attorney Avinash Kar said in a statement. ""It is a hollow gesture that does little to tackle a widely recognized threat to human health. FDA has essentially followed a voluntary approach for more than 35 years, but use of these drugs to raise animals has increased."" The Center for Science in the Public Interest noted in a statement the proposal ""requires the drug companies who profit from sales of their drugs to initiate the process. The good news is the agency has pledged to evaluate levels of compliance and inform the public after 90 days if the drug industry is cooperating with the relabeling effort."" ""No one is advocating that sick animals should not be treated,"" the CSPI said. ""But just as our kids see a doctor to get antibiotics, farmers should call a veterinarian, who can assess whether and when treatment with an antibiotic is appropriate. This simple step could save antibiotics as treatment options for future generations of consumers and farmers."" Currently, federal law tracks only how many antibiotics are sold; it does not mandate data collection on how many animals are given the drugs or how much. Without that information, it is hard to know where antibiotics are used. Taylor said the FDA still has the ability to take regulatory action against specific products if it's needed to protect the public's health. This plan is the FDA's latest move targeting food production and quality. Last month, the agency took a step toward potentially eliminating most trans fats from the food supply.

"Bond is set at $1 million for a  Louisiana man accused of shooting and killing a church pastor as he preached in Lake Charles, Louisiana, on Friday night. Calcasieu Parish sheriff's deputies arrested 53-year-old Woodrow Karey, a church deacon, and charged him with second-degree murder after he called 911 and told the dispatcher what he had done, sheriff's spokeswoman Kim Myers said. Witnesses told police that Karey walked into the Tabernacle of Praise Worship Center around 8:20 p.m. and shot Pastor Ronald Harris twice -- the first time as Karey entered the church and then again at close range after Harris had fallen to the floor, Myers said. ""It was just kind of chaotic. It was like everybody was everywhere,"" Talisha Harris, the pastor's daughter, told CNN affiliate KPLC. Karey fled the scene on foot but later called the sheriff's office and surrendered without incident, Myers said. During his arrest, Karey directed the deputies to two guns he had discarded in a wooded area. One of the firearms was a shotgun and the other was a pistol, police said. Police have not said which weapon was used to kill the pastor. Karey has no known criminal history, and the motive for the killing is unknown, police said. Calcasieu Parish Chief Deputy Stitch Guillory told CNN on Sunday morning there were 50 to 60 witnesses at the church. Harris, who was inside the church when shots were fired, recalled the type of man her father was. ""He was a strong person, and whatever came his way, he still stood on the word of God. He stood. He never wavered,"" she told KPLC, struggling to hold back tears. ""My dad was a great father. He was an awesome grandfather. He was an awesome preacher-teacher. He had a big heart. He loved everybody, wanted to always help,"" she said. In 2009: Pastor fatally shot by police in drug sting .

"The U.S. military went into Somalia with one goal in mind: Kill Ahmed Abdi Godane, the leader of Al-Shabaab. One day later, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said flatly, ""We certainly believe that we hit what we were aiming at."" What he did not say is whether Godane is dead. The United States is ""assessing the effectiveness right now"" of the attack launched hours earlier, Kirby said Tuesday, including who, if anyone, was killed. He did acknowledge that U.S. Special Operations forces flew aircraft that, along with unmanned aircraft, ""destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided missiles."" No American troops were on the ground. The attack was directed at Al-Shabaab and, specifically, its leader Godane. He has headed the network as it has terrorized East Africa, killing Somali officials, aid workers and others in a spate of suicide bombings. Godane allegedly was behind 2013's brazen, ghastly siege of  a Nairobi, Kenya, shopping mall. It's not just what Godane, who has pledged his group's allegiance to al Qaeda, has done that made him a target. It's what Al-Shabaab was planning to bring through more bloodshed, chaos and terror to the region. The U.S. government can't say yet whether Godane survived the attack in south-central Somalia. But if he did not, Kirby surmised, East Africa is now a safer, better place. ""If he was killed, this is a very significant blow to their network, to their organization,"" the Pentagon spokesman said, ""and we believe their ability to continue to conduct terror attacks."" An Al-Shababb Twitter account said one person was killed in the attack, but it wasn't Godane. ""'Ahmed Abdi Godane' is alive and doing fine,"" the tweet from HSM Press Office said, calling itself an ""official mujahedin account"" in the Islamic land of Somalia. CNN was unable to verify the authenticity of the report. Somali official: 'Never heard such a huge ... blast' Tipped off by what Kirby called ""actionable intelligence ...  strong enough"" to suggest Godane's whereabouts, U.S. commandos flew -- aided by drones overhead -- into an area south of the African nation's capital Mogadishu around 6:20 p.m. (11:20 a.m. ET) Monday. Lower Shabelle Gov. Abdikadir Mohamed Nur Sidii characterized the attack near the port city of Barawe as so ferocious. ""It jolted the entire region."" ""I never heard such a huge and deafening blast as the result of the airstrike,"" Sidii said. Kirby didn't elaborate on exactly how much firepower was used, beyond that there were multiple Hellfire and laser-guided missiles. Somali intelligence officials counted at least four such missiles. The targets were what the Pentagon spokesman described as ""an encampment"" and a vehicle inside it, not to mention Al-Shabaab leaders believed to be there. Kirby said that he expects the attack -- like others U.S. forces have conducted against terror groups -- sends a message. ""The operation that we've conducted, we believe, is an example of the U.S. government and our allies and partners' commitment to the people and the government of Somalia,"" he said, ""to detect, deter, disrupt and defeat violent extremists who threaten progress in the region, as well as threaten to conduct terrorist attacks against innocent people around the world."" To figure out if the operation achieved its goals, the U.S. military will need help. That's because, Kirby explained, no American forces were on the ground before or after the mission. He didn't specify who would get to the bottom of what happened, saying simply, ""We continue to work with partners in the region."" U.S. has gone after Al-Shabaab before . The United States has previously gone after Al-Shabaab in Somalia. That includes at least two strikes this past year ordered by President Barack Obama's administration. That's part of a long-running, multinational effort targeting the group, including an operation launched last week to cut off the group's supply lines along the Somali coast. Al-Shabaab has been on the defensive of late. Its militants have started to withdraw from the port city of Barawe in recent days. On Monday, the African Union Mission in Somalia announced that military forces had retaken several important towns in the Middle Shabelle and Hiiran regions. But no one is counting Al-Shabaab out quite yet. The group has shown its audacity and violent ways before. It has been blamed, and taken responsibility, for attacks on city streets, at markets, at prisons and a United Nations compound in Mogadishu. It's most high-profile attack came last year at Nairobi's upscale Westgate mall, when terrorists casually walked into the mall, pulled out weapons and began gunning down shoppers. The gunmen were accused of torturing some hostages before killing them. As many as 67 people died in the siege, and parts of the mall were destroyed. That and many of these other attacks occurred under Godane's watch. If he's now gone, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said, it would be a serious blow to Al-Shabaab. ""Ahmed Godane is a very ruthless figure in the group, he dominates the group,"" Cruickshank said. ""You could see a kind of leadership struggle emerge if, indeed, he was killed."" But it wouldn't necessarily be a fatal one. Godane rose to power in 2008, after all, when a U.S. airstrike killed then-leader Aden Hashi Ayrow. ""It's a network, and we understand that,"" Kirby said Tuesday. ""We are mindful that there remain other leaders of the organization, at large."" What is Al-Shabaab?","Pentagon spokesman: U.S. used manned, unmanned aircraft in Somalia attack .

"(CNN) -- It was supposed to be her birthday getaway, but it ended up being a miserable trip. Sarah Evans took two weeks off for her 30th birthday in September 2012 to visit Las Vegas with her best friends. Yet she couldn't enjoy herself because of constant thigh chafing -- ""I went through an entire bottle of Gold Bond powder"" -- and she hated how she looked in every photo. ""All these girls were enjoying themselves in bikinis poolside, and there I was, trying to cover up and hide,"" she remembers. Evans decided then and there that she was going to enjoy her future birthdays. The 5-foot-4 Shreveport, Louisiana, resident weighed 248 pounds at the time, which she attributes to a lifetime of bad eating habits. ""Growing up in the South, eating large portions at every meal was a must,"" she said. ""Breakfast included bacon, eggs, sausage, pancakes and biscuits. Lunch was some sort of fast food, and dinner included a three-course meal of fritters for appetizers, fried chicken, collard greens, macaroni and cheese, and corn bread."" Then, of course, there was creamy banana pudding or homemade apple pie for dessert. Evans downloaded the ""Couch to 5K"" app and set two goals: run a 5K without stopping and lose 30 to 40 pounds. ""When I started the program, I couldn't run more than 30 seconds,"" she wrote in her iReport. ""Now I'm running two or three 5Ks a week. Somewhere along the way I fell in love with running."" She soon added CrossFit classes and other forms of cardio into the mix, meeting her original goal and steadily setting new ones, like getting below 200 pounds and improving her 5K time. Slowly but surely, she was taking back her life. ""Trying to stick to this routine has taught me the importance of encouraging myself, because I didn't have a support system in the beginning,"" Evans said. She also switched to a low-carb diet. Now, she typically eats yogurt, hard boiled eggs and turkey bacon for breakfast; chicken salad or tuna for lunch; steak, fish with kale or baked chicken with green vegetables for dinner; and cheese slices, nuts or Jell-O for a snack. She will take the occasional weekend off from her diet, though. ""It's what you do consistently that matters,"" she said. By May of this year, Evans was down to 128 pounds, more than a 120-pound transformation. Despite being at it for almost two years and surpassing her goals, Evans said she still has good days and bad days. ""I still have my demons internally that I'm still working through, and even though I have lost weight, I look in the mirror and see flaws,"" she said. Running, she believes, has been key to her weight loss success. Her routine often has her in bed at 9 p.m. and waking up at 3:30 a.m. to start on cardio and weight training at the gym. She then runs or takes fitness classes five nights a week. ""We all have things we secretly want to try, but we either don't have the courage, don't have anybody to do it with, or we can't physically do it,"" she said. ""I always wanted to run a 5K but couldn't walk a mile without dying. Now I love running! I don't have to worry about breathing heavy after 30 seconds."" The main thing that keeps her going? Getting stopped by people who tell her that she has inspired them to get fit. She recently started her own program called S.T.I.R., which stands for ""Stand Think Initiate Run."" She says it's all about ""learning to live life with and on purpose."" She will often contact her S.T.I.R. group to let them know when and where she will be running, to encourage them to come along. ""I've been overweight my whole life. Never in a million years would I think I would be this active, let alone inspiring people to get active."" One of those people is Couch-to-5K running pal Casey Toups, who stayed with Evans at the back of the pack on runs early on to motivate her to keep going. Now, after seeing Evans' progress in races, Toups says the roles have reversed. ""She has become a person I look to for continued motivation to keep myself on track,"" she said. ""Her story and progress have inspired me, and I know it will inspire others as well."" Evans has gotten a huge boost of confidence from losing the extra pounds. ""I want to go any and everywhere. Any reason to buy a new outfit and shop,"" she said. ""When you feel good on the outside, you feel good on the inside."" She has big plans for her 32nd birthday in September. She wants to recreate some of those pictures from her miserable 30th -- this time with her new and improved self. Want to #getfit?

"Nina Osegueda was 19 years old, 5 feet tall and around 180 pounds when she remembers her boyfriend saying the thing no boyfriend is supposed to say: . ""You know, you'd look better if you lost weight."" ""No duh,"" she thought. Like many teenage girls, it was nothing she hadn't thought to herself, every hour of every day. In Osegueda's case, she said she knew she was overweight and just figured she'd always be that way. ""He was the tall, blonde, skinny type of guy who had no idea what it was like to be a short, Latina, chubby teenage girl,"" Osegueda wrote on CNN iReport. ""I shopped in the 'missus' section of Macy's and felt like an old lady at 19, trying to fit into 'mom jeans,' thinking that crying in the dressing room was totally normal and how I was supposed to live."" It was the summer of 2003. It wasn't that Osegueda, who wore a size 16 in most clothes, ate so much -- she just ate all the wrong things. Convenience store junk food, meals at McDonald's, big family dinners heavy on pasta, rice and bread, and doughnuts on Saturdays before soccer games or swim meets. It was how all her friends ate too, and half of them were skinny. ""I'm just made to be bigger,"" she would tell herself. ""I'm just built this way."" She didn't think it would work, but when that tall, skinny boyfriend of hers suggested she lose weight, she felt obligated to try. ""But how?"" she asked. He told her his mom had lost a bunch of weight on the high-protein, low-carbohydrate Atkins Diet. It seemed easy enough. She cut out carbs and switched to meals consisting of mostly meat and vegetables; cut all soda and juice, and drank only water and unsweetened tea. Upwave: Try it now! Fill half your plate with fruit and vegetables . ""Though it was difficult to explain to my family that I couldn't eat tortillas or plantains for a while, they were supportive of my goals,"" she wrote. Each night in her room, she exercised to belly-dancing workout tapes she picked up at the mall. A year later, she had lost 60 pounds. She sported a 27-inch waist, an hour-glass figure and a new aura of self confidence. ""I might never be the skinny Barbie-doll figure I had in mind, but neither would I allow myself to fall into bad habits that would make me think less of myself. I finally could shop in the 'normal' sections of the stores, though it never became any less surprising to find myself looking for clothes marked Medium,"" Osegueda wrote. ""Here I was, in college, feeling healthier and happier than I ever had in my entire life, with the realization that I had the power to do whatever I put my mind to."" And the guy? ""It probably won't surprise anyone that I broke up with the boyfriend."" She reached an all-time low of 125 pounds by the time she finished college in 2005; she currently weighs 130 pounds and wears a 6 or 8 dress size. Osegueda, 30, now lives in Gaithersburg, Maryland. She got married, became a graphic designer and tours as a heavy metal vocalist with the band A Sound of Thunder. Her legal name is Balvina Austin, but she kept Nina Osegueda, the name she grew up with, as her stage name. The low-carbohydrate diet is her way of life.

"When Garrett Peterson was born, nurses couldn't rotate his head from side to side. Doing so made him turn blue instantly. ""I will never forget seeing him for the first time like that,"" his mom, Natalie Peterson, said in a YouTube video posted by University of Michigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital. ""That was hard."" Garrett was born with tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary valve -- a fancy way of saying he had a hole between the lower chambers of his heart, which put extreme pressure on his lungs. The pressure caused his airways to collapse; in essence, he was trying to breathe through tiny slits. This condition is called severe tracheobronchomalacia. ""In some ways the heart defect is relatively straightforward to fix,"" Dr. Richard Ohye, head of pediatric cardiovascular surgery at C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, said in the video. ""It's the lung issues and the airway issues that are the bigger problem."" The Petersons spent months watching their son turn blue four or five times a day as hospital staff struggled to revive him, according to a university press release. Garrett was put on a ventilator and heavy medication to prevent him from fighting the breathing tube. Then in May 2013, Garrett's father, Jake Peterson, read an article about another baby with a similar breathing problem. Kaiba Gionfriddo had a rare obstruction in his lungs called bronchial malacia. Using an experimental technique never before tried on a human, Peterson read, doctors created a splint made out of biological material that effectively carved a path through Kaiba's blocked airway. The splint was created on a three-dimensional printer. ""It's magical to me,"" Dr. Glenn Green, an associate professor of pediatric otolaryngology at the University of Michigan, told CNN at the time. Green implanted the splint in Kaiba. ""We're talking about taking dust and using it to build body parts."" Kaiba is now 2 years old and free of symptoms related to his bronchial malacia. Read more about Kaiba's story . The Petersons decided to reach out to see if Green would be interested in helping Garrett. Devices created with 3-D printers have not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in humans. Green and his colleague, biomedical engineer Scott Hollister, had gotten emergency clearance from the FDA to try the treatment on Kaiba. But by December, Garrett was in critical condition. His parents took him to the Michigan hospital, and Green obtained another emergency clearance from the FDA. After doing a CT scan of Garrett's trachea and bronchi, Hollister used a 3-D printer to create a splint out of a biopolymer called polycaprolactone. On January 31, Ohye sewed the splint around Garrett's right and left bronchi to expand his airway. The doctors say the splint will be absorbed by Garrett's body during the next three years as his airways grow stronger. In the meantime, Garrett is breathing easier and needs less help from the ventilator. ""It is a tremendous feeling to know that this device has saved another child,"" Hollister said in the press release. ""We believe there are many other applications for these techniques, but to see the impact living and breathing in front of you is overwhelming."" ""Severe tracheobronchomalacia has been a condition that has frustrated me for years,"" added Green. ""I've seen children die from it. To see this device work, for a second time, it's a major accomplishment and offers hope for these children."" Green and Hollister will be participating in a Reddit ""Ask Me Anything"" Tuesday at noon ET. Three weeks after the surgery, Garrett was smiling at his parents . ""We haven't seen smiles for awhile, so getting smiles is very exciting,"" Natalie Peterson said in the video. Doctors believe Garrett will be able to come off the ventilator fully within a matter of months. The couple plan to take their 18-month-old boy home for the first time then. 3-D printed hearts and lungs: The shape of medicine to come .","Toddler with severe tracheobronchomalacia saved by 3-D printed device .

"(CNN) -- Paul Revere hasn't stirred up this much anticipation in Boston since his midnight ride from Charlestown to Lexington. More than two centuries later, a recently unearthed time capsule he buried with fellow revolutionary Samuel Adams -- the man whom Revere was riding to see that night to warn that the British were coming -- has got his former city, state and most of the Internet abuzz. The artifact was unearthed Thursday thanks to a water leak near its resting place inside a cornerstone at the Massachusetts State House in Boston. When workers investigating the leak stumbled upon it, Secretary of State William Galvin, who heads the state historical commission, called Pamela Hatchfield, the head of object conservation at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. ""There was a big discussion about whether or not it should be removed,"" Hatchfield told Brooke Baldwin on ""CNN Newsroom"" on Friday. ""(But) because there was water infiltration in that area of the building, it was decided that we'd try to see if we could find it, investigate and see whether the box was still intact."" Hatchfield spent seven hours Thursday delicately and painstakingly chipping away at the stone to extricate it. ""The contents are of concern, but the plaster that held the box in place is in good condition,"" Galvin said. According to Galvin, the box-shaped capsule was placed by the Revolutionary-era duo in 1795, a year when Adams was governor and when construction began on the State House and its iconic dome, which would eventually be overlaid with copper by Revere. Both he and Hatchfield said that based on historical records, the box is believed to contain coins, a plate and a Revere-inscribed plaque -- but no one knows for sure. ""It may contain other stuff, too,"" said Galvin. ""We don't know that yet."" But we might soon: Galvin, whose office is inside the State House, said the capsule's contents are expected to be revealed sometime next week. For now, it's getting some TLC and a thorough exam -- including X-rays over the weekend -- by the museum's staff. This is not the first time this capsule was unearthed. In 1855 it was dug up during emergency repairs to the State House and put back in place, something that has Hatchfield ""a little worried."" ""We're a little worried because in 1855, they cleaned the contents with acid,"" she said. ""So we're a little concerned that things maybe deteriorated inside."" Galvin sounded more optimistic. ""There were some coins that were tossed in the 1855 ceremony in the mix of the mortar. They are in good condition, so we are optimistic that the box itself has withstood the test of time and that it will therefore be holding the contents securely,"" he said. Galvin told CNN affiliate WBZ the capsule will probably be returned to the State House, and that he's mulling both a new container for the capsule and new items from the current era. 113-year-old time capsule found in Boston . CNN's Todd Leopold, Carma Hassan and Brooke Baldwin contributed to this story.","Time capsule will be X-rayed on Sunday before next steps are decided .

"The audience at Pop! Tech's annual conference rose to its feet as Dr. Jim Olson wrapped up his talk on Tumor Paint. ""In this world where stadiums are named after rich corporations, where buildings are named after wealthy donors, I wanted to name the most exciting science that I've ever participated in after her,"" he said, referring to Violet, a patient of his who donated her brain to science shortly before dying. It's unclear if the audience's standing ovation last month was aimed more at Olson's innovations or his passion. Perhaps it was for the children he has treated -- the ones whose faces flashed across the screen as he spoke about losing the fight against cancer. Or maybe their applause was for those kids' parents, who have raised $9 million to fund Olson's research. They believe in him. It's hard not to after listening to the unassuming way he plans to change medicine. A pediatric neuro-oncologist, Olson says he has spent too many years explaining why a surgeon may not remove all of a patient's cancer or, instead, accidentally take part of a child's healthy brain. That's why he and his team created Tumor Paint, a product designed to illuminate cancer cells in the body, helping surgeons distinguish them from healthy tissue. ""The key to brain surgery is to remove the bad stuff and leave the good stuff inside,"" says Dr. Rich Ellenbogen, a neurosurgeon who worked to develop Tumor Paint with Olson. ""However, it's not that easy."" While cancerous cells may glow on an MRI, they look remarkably similar to healthy cells during an operation. Only experience -- and luck -- guide surgeons as they try to remove the deadly areas. ""Take a few grams of tissue that belong safely in the brain, then the patients wake up not as perfect as they went into the surgery,"" Ellenbogen says. Ellenbogen and Olson knew they had to find a way to light tumors up during an operation. Digging through existing research, Olson found a scientist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who was using venom from an Israeli Deathstalker scorpion to target brain tumors. The venom seemed to bind to the cancerous cells without affecting the healthy tissue. Olson hypothesized that attaching a molecular flashlight of sorts to the venom would make it easier for surgeons to distinguish good cells from bad. 10 medical advances in the last 10 years . The first six grant applications Olson submitted to the National Institutes of Health to test his theory were denied for being too over-speculative, or overambitious, he says. Then a hospital administrator introduced him to Rhoda Altom. Altom's daughter Stewart, then 7, had been diagnosed with a ganglioglioma, a rare type of brain tumor, in her left temporal lobe. Doctors told Altom they would have to take out a large portion of Stewart's brain to make sure they got all the cancer cells. ""They kept saying, 'Brain tumors aren't color-coded, so we have to take our best guess,' "" she remembers. Altom asked what was being done to find a better way to treat this cancer, but no one had a satisfactory answer. So she went to Seattle Children's Hospital and offered to raise $5 million to get the research going. Pharmaceutical development is often a dog-eat-dog world, Olson says. Scientists clamor to be the first to identify new medications that can be sold to lots of patients to gain recognition and recoup the money their company has put into the discovery. ""It has to be a huge seller to make it worth it,"" he says. ""No company would make a drug that only affects rare diseases."" Gangliogliomas represent just 4% of all pediatric brain tumors. Altom reached out to Olson's patients, past and present, and other parents who had lost children to brain tumors. They held golf tournaments and sold greeting cards, hosting hundreds of fund-raisers to pay for the preclinical work on Tumor Paint in Olson's lab. Olson and his team were able to identify a small protein, or peptide, in the scorpion's venom and use it to produce Tumor Paint. They grew a brain tumor on a mouse's back and injected the ""paint"" into a tail vein; within an hour, the cancer was lighting up. Tumor Paint was 500 times more sensitive than an MRI, and it didn't just work for brain cancer but breast, skin, prostate and colon cancers. Olson founded Blaze Bioscience in 2010 to run human clinical trials and commercialize Tumor Paint. The biotech company is on track to start enrollment for trials in Australia in December, CEO Heather Franklin said. ""In a matter of 10 years, surgeons will look back and say, 'I can't believe we used to remove (tumors) by using our eyes and our fingers and our thumbs,' "" Olson says. Sex is doctor's life's work . Olson is continuing his work with optides, or optimized peptides. Six months ago he launched Project Violet at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Scientists there are using the drugs created by nature -- such as scorpion venom -- to find ways to fight disease. Olson uses a potato to explain how evolution has helped plants and animals create some of the best drug candidates around. A potato is just a ball of starch underground, right? So is a pile of noodles. But while the potato can emerge after weeks unscathed, a pile of noodles underground would be eaten by bugs in hours. Potatoes, Olson said, have created a ""drug"" to protect themselves. If he can harness the potato's DNA to create medicine, it could potentially protect humans from disease. Project Violet will use crowdsourcing to fund its research. Citizens can ""adopt"" drug candidates for $100 and name them as they go through the discovery process. Each candidate is a variation of a protein made from a plant or animal. ""First and foremost, I'm a parent,"" Olson says in a video about Project Violet that was a finalist in the Sundance Film Festival's Focus Forward competition this year. ""And when I know a child is going to die, and the prescriptions I'm writing might make them live a couple weeks longer but aren't going to save their lives -- there's nothing harder than that. And that drives my research."" His lab has an open policy -- researchers share everything they learn in hopes of inspiring others. Altom, with other patient families, recently presented Olson with a check for $180,000 to create a library of information from Project Violet that will be available to scientists around the globe. ""We're creating drug candidates ... that could fundamentally change the world,"" he says. ""We're throwing motives of profit or biotech building to the wind. Let's do what's right for the greatest number of people."" Watson: 'DNA was my only gold rush' When her daughter had her tumor removed some 16 years ago, Altom waited anxiously in the hospital room for her to wake up. When the child opened her eyes and began complaining about the tubes in her arm, Altom burst into tears. ""I thought it was the most beautiful thing I had ever heard."" Stewart Carlson, now 24, attends George Washington University. She occasionally has trouble remembering verbal information but is otherwise a healthy, happy young woman. They got lucky, Altom says. That's why she continues to raise money for research. ""I always tell Jim Olson that I want to be able to look him in the eye when someone has a brain tumor and say, 'At least they didn't break their leg,' because we'll be able to diagnose and treat tumors so effectively.'

"(CNN)U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had strong words Saturday for Russia over what he called its unacceptable actions in Ukraine -- and threatened additional sanctions against Russian interests. Speaking in London alongside UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, Kerry said Russia was ""continuing to do land-grabbing in Ukraine"" even as it professed to support peace efforts. Russia's actions are ""just simply unacceptable, so we are talking about additional sanctions, additional efforts,"" Kerry said. ""We are confident that over the next few days we are going to make it clear that we are not going to play this game, not going to sit here and be part of this extraordinarily craven behavior at the expense of the sovereignty and integrity of a nation. ""This is behavior that is completely counter to everything that the global community has worked to achieve and put in place ever since World War II, and I'm confident that the United Kingdom, the United States and others are prepared to stand up to it."" He blasted Moscow's repeated denials that it is involved in arming the separatists and sending its own troops over the border. In this age of technology and satellites, Kerry said, ""there is no secret"" over what is taking place. ""We know to a certainty what Russia has been providing to the separatists, how Russia is involved with the separatists,"" he said. Kiev and a number of Western leaders have steadfastly accused Russia of failing to rein in separatists and of continuing to arm, supply and train them. European nations, the United States and others have imposed financial sanctions on Russian interests in hopes of pressuring President Vladimir Putin to help end the hostilities. Russia, which seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in March, denies any direct involvement in Ukraine and says any Russian soldiers in Ukraine are volunteers fighting during their vacation time . Kerry's remarks come as a ceasefire which came into effect last Sunday remains in serious doubt. A fierce separatist offensive to take the key strategic town of Debaltseve ended only Wednesday, when Ukrainian soldiers were forced to retreat. Yuriy Biryukov, a presidential adviser and assistant to Ukraine's defense minister, said Saturday that 179 soldiers had died in the Debaltseve area between January 18 and February 18. An additional 110 soldiers were captured and 81 are missing, Biryukov posted on Facebook. Some of the missing are still on their way out of Debaltseve, he said, while others have died. Late Saturday, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said 139 Ukrainian soldiers had been released from captivity. The release was part of a prisoner swap between Ukrainian and rebel forces in the eastern Donbass region; 52 pro-Russian separatists were also freed, according to Russian state news agency Itar Tass. The toll makes the siege of Debaltseve -- a town now shattered by heavy shelling -- the Ukrainian military's deadliest single incident over the past 10 turbulent months. Shelling has also picked up this week in Donetsk city and clashes are reported around the southern port city of Mariupol. Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council said Friday there had been 300 instances in which this latest truce has been violated. The ceasefire agreement -- signed February 12 in Minsk, Belarus, among the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany -- aimed to curb this violence. It is supposed to be followed by the withdrawal of heavy weaponry to create a buffer zone, the release of prisoners and steps toward new elections. Months of devastating fighting has left nearly 5,700 people dead as of February 18, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reported Friday. More than 1 million people have been displaced. On Friday, Ukraine marked one year since the bloodiest day of protests in Kiev's Maidan, or Independence Square, against the country's then Russian-leaning leader and in favor of closer ties to Europe. Some 49 people died on February 20, 2014, and close to 100 more suffered gunshot wounds when, according to protesters, government snipers opened fire on them. Two days later, President Viktor Yanukovych fled the country, prompting Ukrainian activists to declare ""victory in the Maidan"" and promise a new day for a country long torn between its neighbors, Europe to the west and Russia to the east. How things have changed. Today, the country is a powder keg driving spiraling tensions between the West and Moscow. In Moscow, thousands of Kremlin supporters gathered Saturday for a demonstration to counter the Ukrainian commemorations. Many waved flags and banners as they marched near Moscow's Red Square, while others chanted slogans including, ""We won't give our country to the enemy"" and ""No Maidan in Russia."" In remarks Friday, Poroshenko claimed Russia had been working toward the breakup of Ukraine since before Yanukovych was ousted. ""Moscow was preparing to the liquidation and tearing Ukraine apart long before the victory of Maidan. They were expecting the fall of Yanukovych and accelerated the course of events,"" Poroshenko said to the families of protesters who died a year ago. According to Ukrainian prosecutors, 77 people died in total during the 2014 protests, which were sparked by Yanukovych's decision to scrap a trade deal with the European Union and instead turn toward Russia. The ensuing ouster of Yanukovych triggered more turbulence and violence. By March, Russia had annexed Crimea. Weeks later, in April, pro-Russian separatist forces launched their bid to carve off the more Russian-leaning eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions from the rest of Ukraine. In a speech to a London-based defense think-tank, the Royal United Services Institute, Britain's senior officer in NATO warned that Russia's expansionist ambitions could pose an ""existential threat"" to the world. Russia is currently employing a ""hybrid combination"" of ""coercion through rapidly generated conventional forces and subversion, through a number of means, both military and non-military,"" said Gen. Adrian Bradshaw, NATO's Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe. This hybrid strategy can be used to set the scene for a ""subversive takeover of territory,"" as seen in its takeover of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula last year shortly after large-scale military exercises by Russia on its side of the border, he said. ""We are today seeing conventional forces employed, albeit subject to continued brazen denials by the Kremlin, in eastern Ukraine,"" he added. Russia's new strategy holds particular dangers for NATO, he said. Firstly, the use of subversive tactics initially makes it difficult to identify clearly ""the hand of a hostile state government"" in destabilization of a country, making collective decisions harder. Secondly, its ability rapidly to generate large scale forces ""could in future be used not only for intimidation and coercion but potentially to seize NATO territory, after which the threat of escalation might be used to prevent reestablishment of territorial integrity,"" he said. And, Bradshaw pointed out,  Russia is not the only threat to NATO states, citing also the danger posed by terror groups such as ISIS, also known as ISIL. ""Whilst the threat from Russia, together with the risk it brings of a miscalculation resulting in a slide into strategic conflict, however unlikely we see that as being right now, represents an obvious existential threat to our whole being, we of course face threats from ISIL and other instabilities to our way of life and the security of our loved ones."" CNN's Nick Paton Walsh in Donetsk, Frederik Pleitgen in Kiev and Erin McLaughlin in Moscow contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- In the fall of 2011, Jen Corn was the heaviest she had ever been. At 5 feet 6 inches, Corn weighed more than 300 pounds. Her mother and aunt had just offered to pay for her to have weight-loss surgery. But Corn knew the price tag was hefty: around $15,000. ""I told them no,"" said Corn, then 39, recalling the exact moment. ""I felt like I was not worth that."" Her mom, Jean Corn, said the two older women knew something had to be done since diabetes runs in the family. ""We were just desperate,"" Jean Corn said. ""We (also) knew her heart wasn't going to be able to carry this weight forever."" Corn's rejection of the offer devastated her family. But Corn had made up her mind to take matters into her own hands to lose the weight. ""If I was going to do this, I (was) going to do it the right way. I (was) going to do it the healthy way, and I (was) not going to rely on somebody else,"" she said. In denial . Corn's weight problem had begun in high school in Woodstock, Georgia. She played sports, which helped her feel like she hid some of the weight, but she said she ate everything in sight. ""There were a lot of self-esteem issues growing up, which of course only added fuel to the fire to make it worse,"" she said. She wouldn't address her weight with anybody. She got into fights with her mom about it; at one point, she told her mom never to mention it again. She avoided shopping, scales and mirrors. ""As long as I didn't see it, it wasn't true,"" she said. In 2011, she realized she couldn't walk from her front door to her mailbox, a distance of 30 feet. ""I'd get to the mailbox sounding like I smoked 12 packs a day,"" she said, recalling how she complained about pain in her knees, back and feet. ""It was ridiculous."" She thought about joining Weight Watchers again. In 2008, Corn had tried the program, an attempt that lasted six months. She had also failed at other diets -- Nutrisystem, the South Beach Diet and Sugar Busters among them. But this time, her resolve to get healthy was strong. 'A snowball effect' Corn joined Weight Watchers shortly after the talk with her mom and aunt. This time around, her mind-set was different. She had made a commitment to herself to go to the meetings, pay attention and adhere to the plan. She had heard the plan would work if she followed it precisely. Shortly after joining the program, Corn saw something at the doctor's office that would end up changing her life. She went to see the doctor about her foot hurting. A note written on her chart classified her as morbidly obese. Corn was not even sure what the term meant. ""He told me it was because I was heavy and offered me tips on what to do for my foot but not about how to lose weight,"" she said. Corn persevered. She attended her weekly Saturday morning meetings without the dread she had in her 2008 attempt. Instead of focusing on her goal of losing 150 pounds, the Bradenton, Florida, resident attempted to achieve smaller goals like 5, 10 and 25 pounds. The first six months of her weight-loss journey, Corn focused strictly on her diet. After she had lost about 40 pounds, she started walking the neighborhood in addition to using her treadmill at home. ""It was kind of like a snowball effect,"" she said. ""I was losing more weight, which caused me to exercise more."" Corn also slowly overhauled her diet. ""Before I knew it, I was not eating as much food as I used to,"" she said. ""It was a slow process, so my body had time to adjust to less food."" Her daily diet before had been filled with fast food, fried chicken and little vegetables. Now it's all about high-protein and high-fiber foods, salads and healthy snacks. And, of course, lots of water throughout the day. ""I do allow myself a piece of chocolate here and there, some ice cream here and there, as long as I pre-arrange for it in my mind,"" she said. ""I would feel deprived if I couldn't have those, and then that's usually when I go completely off the rails."" One step at a time . Corn hit her goal weight of 163 pounds in March. Now, almost three years after the start of her journey, Corn weighs 161 pounds. She struggles every day, keeping healthy snacks around her at all times. She blogged about her weight-loss journey, which she refers to as her ""road trip."" ""To me, it's not about being skinny, it's about being healthy,"" she said. Corn has a message for others facing their own weight problems. ""First, you don't have to have a movie-star budget to do this,"" she said. ""It won't be easy, but it's your life you're dealing with, and there's nothing more precious on this earth than your own life."" An avid power walker, Corn walks five miles a day. Her goal is to walk a half-marathon in Sarasota, Florida, in March. Her self-confidence has also increased as a result of the ""new"" her. ""I'm still kind of shy, but I'm not afraid to walk up to somebody and talk to them, as opposed to standing back and waiting for them to come talk to me,"" she said. And her mother couldn't be prouder. ""This was a person (who), if I would have paid her $1,000 to step on a treadmill, she wouldn't have done it,"" Jean Corn said. ""This is a person (who) doesn't have a personal trainer, (who) doesn't have a chef, (who) doesn't have makeup artists. She is living proof that there is no gimmick, no magic pill; it's absolutely take one step at a time.""","Jen Corn weighed more than 300 pounds in the fall of 2011 .

"Upon his release from prison, he was described by President Barack Obama as ""one of the most important intelligence agents that the United States has ever had in Cuba."" Yet very little is known about the man. U.S. officials have refused to release the spy's name, but sources inside the government and out tell CNN his name is Rolando Sarraff Trujillo. Sarraff, a Cuban national, was part of a historic deal reached this week between the United States and Cuba. He spent two decades in prison. He was released along with Alan Gross, an American subcontractor held for five years, in exchange for three convicted Cuban spies. ""This man -- whose sacrifice has been known to only a few -- provided America with the information that led us to arrest the network of Cuban agents that included the men transferred to Cuba today as well as other spies in the United States,"" Obama said Wednesday. Who was released? Sarraff, now in his early 50s, was discovered and convicted of espionage in Cuba in 1995. According to the office of the director of national intelligence, he provided the U.S. government with information that ""was instrumental in the identification and disruption of several Cuban intelligence operatives in the United States and ultimately led to ... successful federal espionage prosecutions."" Specifically, the U.S. intelligence office tied Sarraff to the conviction of one-time Defense Intelligence Agency senior analyst Ana Belen Montes, who was sentenced to 25 years after pleading guilty of spying for the Cuban government in 2002. Why the Cuba deal happened now . He's also tied to the case of ex-State Department official Walter Kendall Myers and his wife, Gwendolyn, who pleaded guilty in 2009 for illegally aiding the Cuban government for decades. Sarraff played a role in helping federal authorities go after the Florida-based Wasp Network, including members of the Cuban Five. Three of those five were released this week as part of the deal. ""Securing his release from prison after 20 years -- in a swap for three of the Cuban spies he helped put behind bars -- is fitting closure to this Cold World chapter of U.S.-Cuban relations,"" the DNI office said.

"The sad fact behind the building collapse in Bangladesh in which hundreds died is that it isn't an isolated problem. The story will leave the headlines at the end of this week but on Monday hundreds of thousands of workers will return to factories that are frankly further tragedies waiting to happen, and will keep producing clothes for high street brands. Seven hundred workers have died in factory collapses and fires in this very small region outside Dhaka alone in the last decade. Savar, where the building collapse took place, is a swampland (yes, swampland...) north of the Bangladeshi capital which has seen mass growth in recent years. This same region was the site of a horrific factory fire in November last year, when 112 workers burned alive in a building with no fire exits. Hundreds of factories are being thrown up in a short space of time, with limited building regulations, to meet the growing demand from western brands for cheap export clothing. And it is cheap. Wages for Bangladeshi workers are the lowest in Asia, aside from the recently opened Myanmar industry, at $37 a month. Read more: At least 250 killed in fire at Bangladeshi clothing factory . As the demand for cheap clothing grows in the west, brands continue to look for ways to race to the bottom on prices, and sadly this involves cutting corners on health and safety. Brands will by no means admit to this. The prices that they pay, they assure us, are enough to pay workers enough to live on and keep factories in tip top condition. But, faced with constantly decreasing incomes, factory owners inevitably let things slide, like replacing faulty machinery or fixing worrying building subsidence... When garment factories were still mainly based in retail countries, consumers knew people who held jobs in factories, and had a personal connection with those who had been injured or put at risk in the workplace. But with globalization has come consumer apathy. Who cares about people who make clothing? As long as it is cheap we will buy it. Especially in a recession, cheap clothing is a welcome industry for many. People in western countries living on the poverty line need to buy clothes for their children. Jobs in Bangladesh are also vital for a country where hundreds of thousands of people live below the poverty line. It isn't the responsibility of the consumer to feel guilty about buying what is readily available in shops. Business must stop just holding up its hands to say: ""It is not our fault -- they bought it."" The responsibility for ensuring that a product was made with human rights in mind has to fall somewhere, and the United Nations guiding principles on business and human rights says that it falls jointly to states and mass corporate businesses to ""protect, respect and remedy"" human rights. In short, the brands, not the consumer, are the ones who must take responsibility for the endemic problems that this industry faces. Read more: Is your old -shirt making Africa poor? So what can be done? Many western brands rely on audits and in-house checks to monitor whether conditions in their factories are up to scratch. In a country where a little hand shake and a small exchange of money gets the job done, this process often fails to give an accurate picture of factory conditions, building and fire safety. It is common for fire extinguishers to be borrowed for inspection day, for workers to be schooled in what answers they have to give when asked questions. The Clean Clothes Campaign together with local and global unions and labor rights organizations, has developed a program that hopes to solve this. The Bangladesh Building and Fire Safety Agreement is a proposal for a sector-wide initiative that includes independent building inspections, worker rights training, public disclosure and a long-overdue review of safety standards. The crucial element of this is that unions and worker led committees take a central role in monitoring and reporting back on improvements that need to be made, in a public way. This transparent and practical agreement is unique in that it is supported by all key labor stakeholders in Bangladesh and internationally. So far, U.S. company PVH, owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and German retailer Tchibo have signed up to the program, but it needs a critical mass of brand support to be implemented. Joint memorandam of understanding on fire and building safety: . Labour Behind the Label and others are calling on all brands sourcing from Bangladesh to publicly sign up to take part in the building and fire safety scheme to make transparent, worker-led improvements to the industry. Read more: Retailers and suppliers hit by fallout from deadly Bangladesh factory fire . In the wake of tragedies such as yesterday's building collapse, the Tazreen fire in November, and the nearby Spectrum factory collapse some years ago, something must be done to make a change. This proposal is the best on the table by far. How many more deaths will it take to move brands from making CSR statements of regret, to investing in a sustainable and safe industry? We hope none.","Scores killed in Bangladesh clothing factory collapse; many still missing .

"A crisis so dire that families are fleeing to Syria. A militant threat so strong that  U.S. forces are striking from the sky. And political strife so tense that it could derail hopes for government stability. As Iraq's political and humanitarian crises escalate at the same time, foreign countries are getting more deeply involved. Here's where things stand: . Tension in Baghdad . Iraqi forces and tanks surged into some Baghdad neighborhoods Sunday as a wave of troops swarmed Baghdad's Green Zone -- the secure area where many government buildings, the military headquarters and the U.S. Embassy are located, two Iraqi police officials said. Exactly what led to the surge remains unclear. But some believe the beefed up military presence is part of a power struggle between second-term Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and newly elected President Fuad Masum. ""You've got Nuri al-Maliki refusing to step down. Now he's mobilized not just security troops loyal to him, but now he's mobilized army units to put tanks in the streets,""said retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona, a  CNN military analyst. ""Some of the bridges have been closed. It looks like he's trying to lock down the city in some sort of confrontation with the President, so this does not portend well."" Choosing a prime minister is a key next step for Iraq's leaders. Critics of al-Maliki have called for him to pull his name out of the running, but he's repeatedly refused. Al-Maliki has accused Masum of violating the country's constitution by extending the deadline for Iraq's biggest political coalitions to nominate a candidate for prime minister. But there could be another reason for more troops in the capital. Retired U.S. Marine Gen. James Williams said the stepped up security could be a response to advances by militants from ISIS, the Sunni Muslim extremist group that has now declared itself the Islamic State. ""It could be a show of force. If you're talking about protecting government buildings, there may be a sense that ISIS forces may be closer than everybody thinks at this point,"" Williams said. ""That could be a great sign for concern. But it may also be a concern that there's a coup afoot."" Airstrikes against ISIS . The threat of ISIS has been so strong that the U.S. military carried out a new wave of airstrikes Sunday against militant targets in Iraq. American aircraft struck five targets within five hours Sunday, including armed vehicles and a mortar position, U.S. Central Command said. Iraqi officials said U.S. airstrikes Saturday killed 16 ISIS fighters, and an Iraqi airstrike in Sinjar killed an additional 45 ISIS fighters, Iraq state media reported. Last week, U.S. President Barack Obama authorized targeted attacks not only to protect Iraqi minorities from ISIS' killing rampage, but also Americans stationed in the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil. Humanitarian nightmare . In their effort to create a caliphate across parts of Iraq and Syria, ISIS fighters have slaughtered civilians as they take over cities in both countries. In Syria, the group put some of its victims' severed heads on poles. In another instance caught on camera, a man appears to be forced to his knees, surrounded by masked militants who identify themselves on video as ISIS members. They force the man at gunpoint to ""convert"" to Islam, then behead him. In Iraq, one of the most dire humanitarian nightmares is unfolding on Mount Sinjar, where tens of thousands of Yazidis have been trapped. Yazidis are part of one the world's oldest monotheistic religious minorities and have been targeted by ISIS. Their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and the ancient monotheistic religion of Zoroastrianism. Dozens of people including 60 children, have died on the mountain, where the Yazidis are battling extreme temperatures, hunger and thirst. On Sunday, Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights spokesman Kamil Amin said it was possible that as many as 500 Yazidis had been killed. The ministry had also heard reports -- but had not confirmed -- that some had been buried alive. Who are the Yazidis? Why does ISIS want to kill them? ""It's difficult to be accurate about these numbers, but initially we have reported 500 Iraqi Yazidis have died from either ISIS direct killings or from starvation and dehydration,"" Amin told CNN. ""We have heard some reports from activists and local journalists that some families were buried alive."" CNN is unable to authenticate reports regarding the Yazidi death toll or the allegation that some were buried alive. Amin said Kurdish forces were able to break the siege by ISIS and help thousands of stranded Yazidis board trucks, which drove them to the Syrian border town of Hasaka near Iraq. They were then driven north along the Syrian-Iraqi border to Dohuk, a region in northern Iraq's Kurdish region. On Sunday night, the U.S. military made a fourth airdrop of food and water to Iraqis stranded on Mount Sinjar, according to U.S. Central Command. In total, U.S. military aircraft have delivered more than 74,000 meals and more than 15,000 gallons of fresh drinking water, Centcom said. Britain and France have said they will join the United States in the airdrops. A British C-130 cargo plane delivered aid to Iraq on Sunday, a Ministry of Defense spokesman said. Iraqi security forces have been able to airlift about 100 to 150 people a day off Sinjar Mountain, said Marzio Babille of UNICEF, the United Nations' children's agency. But time is running out for many who cannot reach airdropped supplies.","Iraqi forces and tanks enter Baghdad neighborhoods .

"Nick Wilkins was diagnosed with leukemia when he was 4 years old, and when the cancer kept bouncing back, impervious to all the different treatments the doctors tried, his father sat him down for a talk. John Wilkins explained to Nick, who was by then 14, that doctors had tried chemotherapy, radiation, even a bone marrow transplant from his sister. ""I explained to him that we're running out of options,"" Wilkins remembers telling his son. There was one possible treatment they could try: an experimental therapy at the University of Pennsylvania. He asked his son if he understood what it would mean if this treatment didn't work. ""He understood he could die,"" Wilkins says. ""He was very stoic."" A few months later, Nick traveled from his home in Virginia to Philadelphia to become a part of the experiment. This new therapy was decidedly different from the treatments he'd received before: Instead of attacking his cancer with poisons like chemotherapy and radiation, the Philadelphia doctors taught Nick's own immune cells to become more adept at killing the cancer. Two months later, he emerged cancer-free. It's been six months since Nick, now 15, received the personalized cell therapy, and doctors still can find no trace of leukemia in his system. Trusting her intuition led to two cancer diagnoses . Twenty-one other young people received the same treatment at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and 18 of them, like Nick, went into complete remission -- one of them has been disease-free for 20 months. The Penn doctors released their findings this weekend at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology. ""It gives us hope that this is a cure,"" Nick's father says. ""They're really close. I think they're really onto something."" 'A whole new realm of medicine ' At the conference, two other cancer centers -- Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New York and the National Cancer Institute -- will be announcing results with immunotherapies like the one Nick received. The results are promising, especially considering that the patients had no success with practically every other therapy. ""This is absolutely one of the more exciting advances I've seen in cancer therapy in the last 20 years,"" said Dr. David Porter, a hematologist and oncologist at Penn. ""We've entered into a whole new realm of medicine."" In the therapy, doctors first remove the patient's T-cells, which play a crucial role in the immune system. They then reprogram the cells by transferring in new genes. Once infused back into the body, each modified cell multiplies to 10,000 cells. These ""hunter"" cells then track down and kill the cancer in a patient's body. Essentially, researchers are trying to train Nick's body to fight off cancer in much the same way our bodies fight off the common cold. Tumor Paint: Changing the way surgeons fight cancer . In addition to the pediatric patients, Penn scientists tried the therapy out in 37 adults with leukemia, and 12 went into complete remission. Eight more patients went into partial remission and saw some improvements in their disease. The treatment does make patients have flulike symptoms for a short period of time -- Nick got so sick he ended up in the intensive care unit for a day -- but patients are spared some of the more severe and long-lasting side effects of extensive chemotherapy. Penn will now work with other medical centers to test the therapy in more patients, and they plan to try the therapy out in other types of blood cancers and later in solid tumors. A university press release says it has a licensing relationship with the pharmaceutical company Novartis and ""received significant financial benefit"" from the trial, and Porter and other inventors of the technology ""have benefited financially and/or may benefit financially in the future."" Searching for one-in-a-million cancer cells . The big question is whether Nick's leukemia will come back. Doctors are cautiously optimistic. The studies have only been going on since 2010, but so far relapse rates have been relatively low: of the 18 other pediatric patients who went into complete remission, only five have relapsed and of the 12 adults who went into complete remission, only one relapsed. Some of the adult patients have been cancer-free and without a relapse for more than three years and counting. Relapses after this personalized cell therapy may be more promising than relapses after chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant, Porter explained. First, doctors have been delighted to find the reengineered T-cells -- the ones that know how to hunt down and attack cancer -- are still alive in the patients' bodies after more than three years. Stigma lingers for deadliest cancer . ""The genetically modified T-cells have survived,"" Porter said. ""They're still present and functional and have the ability to protect against recurrence."" Second, before declaring patients in remission, Penn doctors scoured especially hard for errant leukemia cells. Traditionally, for the kind of leukemia Nick has, doctors can find one in 1,000 to one in 10,000 cancer cells. But Penn's technology could find one in 100,000 to one in a million cancer cells, and didn't find any in Nick or any of the patients who went into complete remission. 'It's not a fluke' One of the best aspects of this new treatment is that it won't be terribly difficult to reproduce at other medical centers, Porter said, and one day, instead of being used only experimentally, it could be available to anyone who needed it. ""Our hope is that this can progress really quite quickly,"" he said. ""It won't be available to everyone next year, but I don't think it would take a decade, either."" Right now patients can only get this therapy if they're in a study, but Dr. Renier Brentjens, director for cellular therapeutics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, says he thinks it could become available to all patients in just three to five years. ""When you have three centers all with a substantial number of patients seeing the same thing -- that these cells work in this disease - you know it's not a fluke,"" he said. Two days ago, Brentjens became the co-founder of Juno Therapeutics, a for-profit biotech start-up company that's working on immunotherapies. ""Fifteen years ago I was in the lab looking at these cells kill tumor cells in a petri dish and then I saw them kill tumor cells in mice, and then finally in humans,"" Brentjens said. He says he'll never forget the first patient he treated, who initially had an enormous amount of cancer cells in his bone marrow. Then after the therapy, Brentjens looked under the microscope and, in awe, realized he couldn't find a single cancer cell. ""I can't describe what that's like,"" he said. ""It's fantastic.""","Nick Wilkins was out of options for battling leukemia .
He is now cancer free after an experimental treatment .

"Suspected Boko Haram militants kidnapped at least 20 young women over the weekend in northeastern Nigeria, 8 kilometers from a town where more than 200 schoolgirls were taken nearly two months ago, local officials said Monday. The incident in the village of Garkin Fulani is the latest in a series of abductions for ransom in the area, according to an official with the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, the umbrella union of all nomadic Fulani in the country. The MACBAN official, who is in Garkin Fulani, put the number of women kidnapped at as many as 40. The suspected militants came into the village in broad daylight on Saturday, heavily armed and wearing military uniforms. ""(They) took away 40 women, all of them young mothers,"" said the official, who asked not to be named for safety reasons. A Borno state official confirmed the abduction but said only 20 women were abducted. ""We are working to establish the circumstances surrounding the abduction,"" the government official said on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak about the incident. Alhaji Tar, a member of the Vigilante Group of Nigeria, a loosely formed civilian force tasked with providing security, also put the number at 20, along with three young men who were left to look after the village while the other men took their cattle to graze in the bush. The location of the women is still unknown and the kidnappers have not made contact with their families, Tar said. ""This is not the first time women are being kidnapped in this area. It has happened several times,"" said the MACBAN official. ""They come and herd young women into their vehicles and will only release them when 30 to 40 herds of cattle are paid as ransom."" The fear of deadly reprisals prevents the nomads from seeking military assistance, he said. The terror group Boko Haram abducted an estimated 276 girls on April 14 from a boarding school in Chibok. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 girls are still missing. The kidnapping drew widespread international condemnation. Nigerians and others have accused the government of not acting swiftly or efficiently enough to protect the girls seized in the dead of night. Mike Omeri, the coordinator of the National Information Centre in charge of counterterrorism, was unaware of the latest reported kidnapping. ""We have not received any information on the kidnap of any Fulani women,"" Omeri said. Omeri did, however, note a Nigerian military operation over the weekend that killed 50 suspected Boko Haram militants in Bita village, near Garkin Fulani. The soldiers recovered 30 Kalashnikovs, 36 grenades, 11 rocket-propelled grenades and seven automatic rifles, Omeri said. The Ministry of Defense also confirmed the operation. Boko Haram translates as ""Western education is a sin"" in the Hausa language. The militant group says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Last week, hundreds of people were killed in raids by suspected Boko Haram militants in Borno state. Local officials estimated between 400 and 500 villagers killed. If the death toll is confirmed, it will be the worst attack by Boko Haram in its five-year insurgency that has killed thousands, mostly in the northeast.","One official puts the number of women kidnapped at 40 .

"The New York Times' website and mobile apps went down for more than three hours Wednesday, the apparent result of an ""internal issue,"" according to the company. ""The outage occurred within seconds of a scheduled maintenance update, which we believe was the cause,"" Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said Wednesday afternoon. ""We are in the process of fully restoring access to the site."" The site went down sometime after 10 a.m. ET. The outage appeared to be lifting shortly after 1 p.m., when the site became accessible again to many users. ""We believe the outage is the result of an internal issue, which we expect to be resolved soon,"" Murphy, vice president of communications for the newspaper, tweeted at 12:47 p.m. ET. ""The New York Times Web site is experiencing technical difficulties,"" the paper wrote earlier on its main Twitter feed. ""We expect to be back up shortly."" On Twitter and other social media, people were reacting to the outage, sometimes with humor. ""NYTimes.com is down,"" tweeted Renda Morton, a designer at the paper. ""Luckily we printed it out for you last night. $2."" ""The NYTimes Website right now has taken the need for ""more white space"" a little too literally,"" tweeted Nick Bilton, a New York Times technology columnist. It was not immediately clear Wednesday what caused the problem. During the outage, the Times was posting text versions of its top stories, including coverage of violence in Egypt, on its Facebook page. The Times has been targeted by hackers in the past. The newspaper announced in January that Chinese hackers had carried out sustained attacks on its computer systems.","New York Times website, apps were down Wednesday .

"The United States deployed 80 members of its armed forces to Chad to help in the search for the kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls, the White House said Wednesday. ""These personnel will support the operation of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft for missions over northern Nigeria and the surrounding area,"" it said in a letter. ""The force will remain in Chad until its support in resolving the kidnapping situation is no longer required."" President Barack Obama informed the House speaker and the president of the Senate of the move. The forces will be involved in maintaining aircraft and analyzing data, but because they are armed, the President is required by law to inform the speaker of the House, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. ""These are not combat infantry troops that we put into Chad,"" Kirby told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" on Wednesday. ""These are folks that are there to support the reconnaissance mission."" Boko Haram abducted more than 200 girls last month from a school in northern Nigeria. Officials have speculated that the militants may have transported them to neighboring Chad or Cameroon, but it's not clear where the girls are or whether they've left Nigeria. So why are troops deploying to Chad? ""Just geographically, Chad's a great location to do this from,"" Kirby said, adding that the United States has a good relationship with its government. Reconnaissance flights will be searching an area roughly the size of West Virginia, he said, that includes parts of Nigeria and other countries. The deployment is not based on any new intelligence leads, a senior administration official said. ""The truth is, we don't know exactly where they are,"" Kirby said. ""We still believe that they've broken up into small groups and dispersed."" A U.S. Predator drone will now be aiding in the search for the girls, a Pentagon official told CNN. Half of the new group of U.S. troops will be operating the launch and recovery of the unarmed drone on its missions, and half of them will be providing security on the ground in Chad. Nigeria asks U.N. to designate Boko Haram as terrorist group . Also Wednesday, Nigeria asked the United Nations to designate Boko Haram as a terrorist organization as its escalating attacks spread alarm nationwide. If approved, it will enable countries to impose arms embargoes, travel bans and asset freezes. A United Nations al Qaeda committee is expected to decide when it meets Thursday. Nigeria's request lists the terror group as an affiliate of al Qaeda. This is a ""significant step"" in the fight against terror, said Joy Ogwu, the Nigerian ambassador to the United Nations. The United States branded Boko Haram a terrorist group last year,  providing greater access to its finances and more ability to limit its movements. U.S. officials have said Boko Haram does not have financing in the United States. The insurgent group has escalated its attacks in Africa's most populous nation as its bloodletting extends far beyond its hotbed in the rural northeast. In attacks that appear to be getting more frequent, twin blasts killed at least 118 people Tuesday at a market in the central city of Jos. The explosions went off 20 to 30 minutes apart, sparking an inferno that sent crowds running and screaming, covered in blood. Nigerian authorities described the blasts as  ""terrorist activities"" but declined to speculate on who might be responsible. In separate attacks in Borno state this week, at least 30 people were killed by members of the terror group, according to local residents. Boko Haram attackers swooped in on motorcycles Monday and killed 10 people in one village, residents said. A day later, gunmen stormed a nearby village and killed 20 others, residents said. During the attacks, Boko Haram set fire to homes and food stores, residents said, and fired machine guns. The group has not claimed responsibility for those attacks. Both villages are close to where the more than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped. Boko Haram claimed responsibility in a chilling video and said he was willing to free the girls in exchange for imprisoned militants. ""These vicious attacks on defenseless Nigerian civilians and Boko Haram's abduction last month of more than 200 girls in Chibok are unconscionable, terrorist acts demanding accountability and justice,"" the U.S. State Department said in a statement. Officials condemn attacks, vow to stamp out terrorism . The sudden escalation of attacks, together with the failure to find the missing schoolgirls, has spread concern about the government's inability to quash the insurgency. Protesters have gathered daily nationwide  to express frustration over the lack of progress in rescuing the schoolgirls. ""Last weekend in Paris the international community and regional leaders made clear their collective determination to support Nigeria and defeat the scourge of terrorism,"" the UK Foreign Office said in a statement. ""The Jos attack has only strengthened our resolve."" Nigeria and four neighboring countries -- including Chad -- will share intelligence and border surveillance in the search for the missing girls while Western nations will provide technical expertise and training in a new effort against the extremists. The plan was announced over the weekend during a security summit hosted by French President Francois Hollande to address the growing  threats from the group. Boko Haram translates to ""Western education is a sin"" in the Hausa language. It says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.

"Seth Penalver and Herman Lindsey are no longer on Florida's death row, but they are fighting for those who still are. Penalver and Lindsey, two of Florida's death row exonerees, held a press conference on Wednesday asking Florida Gov. Rick Scott to veto a death penalty bill recently passed by the state legislature. If the bill is signed into law, 13 people could be executed in Florida this year. The bill, referred to as the ""Timely Justice Act,"" limits the appeals process and speeds up state executions. ""If the bill would have been in effect at the time of me being sentenced, I wouldn't be here talking to you today,"" said Penalver, who five months ago was acquitted on charges related to a triple murder. New evidence was uncovered years after he exhausted his original appeals, winning Penalver his freedom after 18 years behind bars. ""There's no ifs, ands or buts about it. You're going to put innocent men to death,"" warned Lindsey, who was exonerated after three years on death row. One of the bill's sponsors, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, said the ""Timely Justice Act"" will not kill innocent people. ""We have more sophisticated juries today, a higher demand for forensic evidence,"" said Gaetz, ""so I don't believe that keeping people around who have confessed to the crime, who weren't claiming their innocence, really serves the state that well."" The ""Timely Justice Act"" would mandate the governor sign death warrants in capital cases within 30 days after the Florida Supreme Court has completed its review. This is after the federal courts rule and the governor completes clemency proceedings, Gaetz said. The bill states that executions are to take place within 180 days of a death warrant being signed. If the bill becomes law, the appeals process in death penalty cases will be shortened and limited. ""Too often we have appeals that drag on regarding paperwork and production of records and effectiveness of one's lawyer, and those types of appeals are brought by people who have confessed,"" Gaetz said. Gaetz said the bill will ""enhance the deterrent factor of the death penalty,"" it will be a ""tremendous help to victim's families"" and it will cut down stays on death row to ""below 10 years."" This bill has nothing to do with justice but more to do with politics, said Howard Simon, executive director of the Florida American Civil Liberties Union. ""The premise of the bill is wrong. We don't have people sitting on death row for years,"" Simon said. ""The average number of years is a year less than the national average."" The national average for inmates on death row is 14 years. Florida leads the nation in people sentenced to death and then exonerated, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Penalver, the state's most recent exoneree, is number 24. Penalver is asking for a meeting with Scott so he can show him his case files. Penalver said after showing him the evidence, he would ask the governor, ""Would you kill me after reviewing this evidence? Would you sign this bill into law?"" Scott's office wouldn't say if he would be willing to meet with Penalver but it issued this statement, ""We want to hear from Floridians about the merits of this legislation, which our General Counsel's office is currently reviewing."" The bill will be presented to Scott in June and he will have 15 days to decide whether to make the ""Timely Justice Act"" law in Florida.","""Timely Justice Act"" limits the appeals process and speeds up state executions .

"Hundreds took to streets in Iraq on Thursday, castigating an inflammatory anti-Islamic video and the nation where it was produced, the United States. Angry protesters in the Sadr City district of northeast Baghdad carried banners, Iraqi flags and images of radical Shiite and anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr as they railed against what they see as an insult to their faith. ""America is the enemy of the people,"" the demonstrators shouted Thursday morning. They also yelled out, ""Yes, yes to Islam. Yes, yes to Iraq. Yes, yes to Quran"" -- the latter referring to the Muslim holy book. Arrest made in connection with deadly assault on U.S. consulate in Libya . Some protesters burned an American flag, while another put a U.S. flag on the ground and stepped on it to express his anger. Sabbar al-Saeidi, a member of Baghdad's provincial council, condemned the ""Innocence of Muslims"" film and called for the closing of U.S. embassies in all Arab and predominantly Muslim countries. ""Since (Americans) did not respect more than 1 billion Muslims all over the world, I call on all Muslim and Arab countries to launch an economic and diplomatic boycott of America and its agents,"" said one protester, Abbass Qahtan. A growing number of Muslims have demonstrated around the world in recent days over the obscure 14-minute film trailer that mocks Islam's prophet. The film -- which was posted in July on YouTube, but got more notice recently after Egyptian television aired segments and anti-Islam activists promoted it online -- includes cartoonish scenes of Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and ruthless killer. The filmmaker was identified in a July 2011 casting call as Sam Bassiel and on the call sheet as Sam Bassil; the name was reported at first by news outlets as Sam Bacile. YouTube restricts video access over Libyan violence . By Thursday, as new details emerged, it was becoming apparent that Bacile was probably not the producer's real name. And two members of the film's production staff who spoke to CNN denied initial media reports that the filmmaker was an Israeli Jew. While the film was made in the United States, its origins are unclear. It was not sanctioned by the U.S. government. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called the film ""disgusting and reprehensible,"" saying its aim appears to be ""to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage."" In addition to Sadr City, hundreds of Iraqis protested against the film and the United States in the provinces of Najaf and Karbala, according to witnesses and local police officials. These demonstrators were also supporters of al-Sadr. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has strongly condemned the ""Innocence of Muslims"" film, while also calling on Muslims not to resort to violence. ""The repetition of insulting (a religion) by some suspicious people and groups deserves the strongest condemnation and denunciation, especially the last film ... abusing Muslims' noble values,"" al-Maliki said in a statement released Thursday, . He called on ""the followers of all divine religions"" to go after the ""racists and stop them from spreading their dangerous thoughts.""

"Clashes between rival militias. Allegations of detainee torture. Assaults on the headquarters of the National Transitional Council, which governs Libya. These are among the signs that Libya faces challenges on several fronts as it struggles to craft a new nation from the ashes of tyranny. Almost a year after the Libyan uprising erupted in the eastern city of Benghazi, the nation ruled by Moammar Gadhafi for four long decades is discovering -- the hard way -- the thorny side of nation building. Prime Minister Abdurrahim el-Keib acknowledged Libya's difficult journey in a national address Wednesday, calling on people to help the government deal with an inheritance from one of the ""strangest and most complicated regimes in history."" That -- coupled with months of violence and bloodshed -- has added to the fledgling state's disarray. Libyans are fed up. They want trust, transparency. And they want to see immediate progress. Their frustration has surfaced in protests in several Libyan cities over the last few days, most notably in Benghazi, the seat of the revolution, where Libyans stormed the National Transitional Council building. There has also been a recent flare-up in violence. Clashes between pro- and anti-Gadhafi forces have turned lethal. And the nation is still struggling to establish rule of law. Human rights monitors sounded alarms again this week after several detainees died of abuse. Libya's problems far outweigh the capacity of the new leadership to deal with them, said longtime Libya observer Dirk Vandewalle, author of ""A History of Modern Libya."" ""There are no easy solutions here,"" he said. A key issue at hand is the legitimacy and authority of the transitional council. The governing body does not have physical control over a nation fragmented along regional and tribal lines. And it was mainly self-appointed, not elected to power by a popular vote. ""There is no full trust in the government,"" former rebel fighter Adel AbdElmajid Zoubi told the United Nations' humanitarian news agency IRIN. Libyan detainees died after torture, rights group says . He, like many other Libyans who are fearful that their revolution will be compromised, said he would not surrender his weapon until elections, set for June. El-Keib said he understood the impatience of Libyans in wanting to see the aims of the revolution implemented quickly. But he tempered his remarks with a good dose of caution. ""The revolution happened for freedom, the freedom of expression and peaceful protest and that is a guaranteed right for all citizens,"" he said. ""But it is important that these demonstrations happen in a civilized manner and after all other means and efforts have been used. We are in a battle to rebuild and every day of work that is wasted is a delay and an obstacle to our march."" El-Keib said security and stability remained a priority for the National Transitional Council. Chief among the concerns is how best to rein in the former fighters with disparate loyalties and agendas. In the months since Gadhafi's capture and death, Libya has been mired in fighting between rival militias and tribes. In Bani Walid this week, the powerful Warfallah tribe drove out pro-NTC forces, regaining control of the former Gadhafi stronghold. University of North Carolina political scientist Andrew Reynolds traveled to Libya last fall to advise the NTC. He said he had been optimistic about Libya's prospects but is less so now, given what he perceived as the interim council's decision-making inertia. ""The genie is out of the bottle and that means the armed groups are the dominant political players,"" he said. ""The people making decisions are the ones with guns."" El-Keib said the government plans to integrate 75,000 former fighters into security services and other jobs and the rest would go through rehabilitation and vocational training. He also announced a monthly monetary allowance for the former rebels to sign up for training. Such rewards, Reynolds said, are imperative to bring under control a nation where doctors, lawyers and businessmen all picked up weapons to fight Gadhafi. ""A lot of the paramilitaries are civilians who became that,"" Reynolds said. ""So it's possible to reintegrate them but they need to be given an incentive."" In that climate, issues of national reconciliation and justice have become grave concerns for human rights monitors. Several detainees have died amid widespread torture and ill-treatment of suspected pro-Gadhafi fighters and loyalists, Amnesty International said Thursday. ""After all the promises to get detention centers under control, it is horrifying to find that there has been no progress to stop the use of torture,"" said Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International's senior crisis adviser in Libya. The monitoring group said the torture was carried out by ""officially recognized military and security entities as well by a multitude of armed militias operating outside any legal framework."" The Amnesty allegations came as the medical charity Doctors Without Borders said Thursday it was halting work in detention centers in Misrata because detainees are ""tortured and denied urgent medical care."" The agency, known by its French acronym MSF, said it has treated 115 people with torture-related wounds from interrogation sessions. The United Nations Security Council, meanwhile, heard about Libya's woes this week from the global body's top official in that country. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said it was ""urgent that all detention centers are brought under the control of the Ministry of Justice and the General Prosecutor's Office."" ""Moreover, a structure and process for judicial screening of detainees should be in place immediately,"" she said. The top U.N. envoy in Libya told the council that the nation was going through a difficult transition. ""The former regime may have been toppled, but the harsh reality is that the Libyan people continue to have to live with its deep-rooted legacy; weak, at times absent, state institutions, coupled with the long absence of political parties and civil society organizations, which render the country's transition more difficult,"" said Ian Martin, head of the U.N. Support Mission in Libya. Scholars who have been watching Libya for many years give the NTC an ""A"" for effort but agree that Libya's new leaders have a tough road ahead. ""They are in a terribly difficult situation,"" Vandewalle said. ""They are starting from ground zero.""","A medical charity complained Thursday of torture in Libyan jails .

"Health officials have been warning us about antibiotic overuse and drug-resistant ""superbugs"" for a long time. But today the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is sounding the alarm in a new way. For the first time, the CDC is categorizing drug-resistant superbugs by threat level. That's because, in their conservative estimates, more than 2 million people get antibiotic-resistant infections each year, and at least 23,000 die because current drugs no longer stop their infections. Antibiotics are designed to kill bacteria that cause infection. However, in the process they can also kill so-called good bacteria (the human body hosts about 100 trillion). The Missouri Department of Health explains it this way: ""Every time a person takes antibiotics, sensitive bacteria are killed, but resistant germs may be left to grow and multiply. Repeated and improper uses of antibiotics are primary causes of the increase in drug-resistant bacteria."" Some bad bacteria are naturally resistant to certain types of antibiotics, according to Tufts University. Others can become resistant by spontaneous genetic mutation or by swapping genes with other bugs. So the CDC is ranking the worst drug-resistant bacteria according to how many people get sick, the number of hospitalizations and the number of deaths caused by each. They also took into account how many, if any, existing antibiotics still work on the bacteria. Instead of red, orange or yellow -- the levels once used to describe terrorism threats -- the CDC is using ""urgent,"" ""serious"" and ""concerning."" Fatal brain disease may have infected 13 . Knowing the specific names of the deadly bacteria may not be essential for the average person, but CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said Monday that the CDC is warning the public about these health threats before they get out of control. ""For the first time,"" said Frieden, "" we have a snapshot of antimicrobial threats that have the most impact on human health."" According to the CDC, the following bacteria are the most ""Urgent Threats"": . CRE bacteria -- a family of germs called carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, which includes E. Coli. Some CRE bacteria are resistant to all existing antibiotics. The CDC reports more than 9,000 infections are contracted in hospitals and other health care settings from these bacteria.  As many as 50% of the patients who are infected with CRE end up dying because there is nothing to help them fight the infections. Clostridium Difficile (C-Diff for short) -- a bacteria that can cause life-threatening diarrhea. It kills up to 14,000 people and causes a quarter million hospitalizations each year. Most patients who get this potentially deadly infection are on antibiotics for other infections. The problem is that while antibiotics kill bad bugs, they also kill good bacteria in your gastrointestinal system that help fight off bad bacteria, C-Diff included. Fecal transplant cures woman's bacterial infection . Neisseria gonorrhoeae -- the drug-resistant form of this bacteria causes gonorrhea, the second most commonly reported infection in the United States. Gonorrhea can cause a variety of illnesses in men and women, including infertility. The CDC estimates there are 820,000 infections each year. In nearly a third of the cases, treatment of the sexually-transmitted disease, is hampered by growing antibiotic resistance. Sexually-transmitted superbug could be major crisis . Frieden said if the current trends continue, ""the medicine cabinet may be empty for patients who need them in the coming months and years."" To avoid what Frieden calls a ""post-antibiotic"" era, where none of the existing drugs work anymore and new ones haven't been approved, the CDC has created a four-step plan to stem the tide of antibiotic resistance. The government agency hopes to better track infections in the future to know when a bacteria is becoming drug-resistant. By spotting the trend earlier, scientists may be able to develop new antibiotics quicker. You can also do your part, the CDC said, by preventing infections in the first place. Preventing infection starts with practicing good hand hygiene and safe food-handling, so you don't get sick in the first place. Since many antibiotic-resistant infections are spread in hospital settings, patients and their families should feel empowered to ask doctors and other health care personnel coming into their rooms if they have washed their hands. Patients should also only take antibiotics when they are really necessary. Changing the way antibiotics are used is perhaps ""the single most important action needed to greatly slow the development and spread of antibiotic-resistant infections,"" Frieden said. Patients need to demand fewer antibiotics and doctors have to resist patients requests for them when they know they won't work.  Also, lowering the use of antibiotics in animals to only when it's absolutely necessary can contribute to stretching the life and usefulness of available drugs, Frieden said. Disinfectants could give rise to superbugs .","More than 2 million people get antibiotic-resistant infections each year .

Drug-resistant 'superbugs' include CRE bacteria, C-Diff and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ."
"Disabled people, elderly people, adults made vulnerable by terminal and other illnesses, and now children are being told that their lives are not worth living. This view was forcefully expressed by Professor Etienne Vermeersch in a recent public debate on euthanasia in Brussels. One of the authors of Belgium's controversial euthanasia law, Vermeersch said it had been specifically designed to include disabled people. For Vermeersch it seemed obvious that ""a man with no arms or legs"" would want to die. Without conscience or insight into the discrimination of choosing only disabled people as examples, he shouted at a member of the audience ""Just wait until you are paralysed."" A paraplegic wheelchair-user for forty years, I was sitting directly in front of him, and had spoken before the debate. His chilling and very final solution to suffering is to remove the sufferer. His zealous delivery caused a frisson in the room amongst most (though sadly not all) of the audience. With its clear echoes, this discourse from a government adviser was shocking. Earlier in the same debate, Alex Schadenberg of the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition had pointed out that the law in Belgium is just not safe: . - Nearly half (47%) of euthanasia deaths are not reported (according to a study carried out in Flanders in 2007): This is illegal. - Euthanasia deaths should be carried out by doctors, but according to a 2007 study, nurses are doing them: This is illegal. - Some euthanasia deaths are carried out without consent (according to a 2007 study in Flanders): This is illegal. The opposite view: Pray you never need euthanasia, but be glad of option . Dr. Jan Bernheim, a leading promoter of euthanasia, admitted that there are problems with Belgium's euthanasia law. But despite its ""imperfections"" he still believes it should be extended to children. Bernheim argued euthanasia was necessary to remove suffering: yet pain is hardly ever the reason for seeking euthanasia. In fact, any palliative care specialist will say no-one should ever be in intolerable pain. Bernheim claims Dr. Wim Distelmans as his protege: Distelmans recently ended the life of Nancy/Nathan Verhelst, in front of TV cameras. After a series of botched sex-change operations, in the absence of other support, Verhelst sought refuge in death by euthanasia. The Belgian commission to regulate the practice of euthanasia has never referred a case of euthanasia to prosecutors (and remember only half of those are reported). It is co-chaired by Distelmans. It is fundamentally unsafe that the most high-profile doctor in Belgium to carry out euthanasia is also the regulator. Distelmans also carried out the euthanasia of Mark and Eddy Verbessem, 45-year-old identical twins, who were deaf and decided they wanted to die after their eyesight began to fail. Anorexic Ann G. also opted to have her life ended after being sexually abused by the Belgian psychiatrist who was supposed to be treating her for her life-threatening condition. The core of good clinical governance is patient safety but under Belgium's euthanasia laws that is sacrificed in the name of individual choice. Verhelst, the Verbessems and Ann G. -- bereft of support -- felt they had no choice but death. The European Social Rights Committee has condemned Belgium for violation of the European Social Charter because of its lack of social care. It is little wonder that disabled Belgian people fall into terminal despair, but that does not validate euthanasia becoming a ""treatment"" for depression as it has in Belgium. Killing someone by lethal injection is not an act of medicine: it comes when medicine apparently has nothing left to offer. With a 500% increase in euthanasia in Belgium in ten years, it is crystal clear that the law in Belgium is not safe; we cannot stand by as they try to extend that law to children.

"A series of videos appeared online Saturday purporting to show Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, the highest-ranking member of Saddam Hussein's regime to evade capture, deriding Iraq's current leadership. Al-Douri, who the U.S. military says helped finance the Sunni insurgency in Iraq, was the ""king of clubs"" in a deck of playing cards used by American troops following the 2003 invasion to identify the most-wanted regime officials. There have been several claims that al-Douri was either killed or captured, though a man claiming to be al-Douri has released a number of audio messages over the years taunting Iraqi and U.S. officials. Al-Douri, who served as a military commander and vice president in Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime, was last seen on video shortly after the invasion of Iraq. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the videos posted on YouTube or the identity of the man, though he bears a striking resemblance to al-Douri. In the clips, the man who claims to be al-Douri wears an olive military uniform and sits behind a desk with an Iraqi flag in the background. He derides Iraq's Shiite-dominated government, led by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, as well as what he describes as meddling by neighboring Iran. Al-Maliki's Dawa party, says al-Douri, ""has announced Iraq as the Shiite capital."" He said nine years have passed since the invasion and Iraq is still in peril. ""Everyone can hear the sounds of danger echoing daily and threatening the country,"" he said. The videos were posted on what is the 65th anniversary of the Arab Socialist Baath Party, a political party founded in Syria that later provided the political basis for Iraq's now outlawed Baath Party. The U.S. military has said al-Douri helped finance the Sunni insurgency with money he transferred to Syria before the government collapsed shortly after the U.S.-led invasion. Al-Douri was the deputy chairman of Hussein's Revolutionary Command Council, and U.S. officials have said he played a key role in the 1988 chemical attack on the Kurdish city of Halabja that left thousands dead and thousands more wounded. He also is accused of playing a role in the brutal crackdowns on Kurdish and Shiite revolts in Iraq that followed the 1991 Persian Gulf War.","Al-Douri was the ""king of clubs"" in a deck of playing cards used to identity wanted officials .

"The Arab world's relationship with media is -- like the region itself -- complicated and often contradictory and one that has been changing rapidly since the Arab Spring. While social media as emerged as a powerful new means of communication and news, two new surveys on media in the region have revealed its rise has not necessarily led to the demise of older, more established media. TV is the most popular (but not most trusted) news source . Last month, ASDA'A Burson-Marsteller published their fifth annual Arab Youth Survey. The survey was the result of 3,000 face-to-face interviews with men and women aged 18-24 across 15 different countries in the Middle East and North Africa. While 72% of those polled listed TV as their main source of news, only 40% listed it as a trusted source of information -- down from 60% in 2011. ""There's a big family market in the Middle East. You sit in a living room with your parents or peers and watch TV. During Ramadan, it's the biggest activity. But that doesn't mean you trust it,"" notes Sunil John, the CEO of ASDA'A Burson-Marsteller. According to John, TV is continuing to lose credibility, particularly as the region's two biggest broadcasters -- Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya -- have each taken notably strong stances on Egypt's political climate; Al-Jazeera allegedly pro the ousted Muslim Brotherhood-president Mohamed Morsy and Al-Arabiya in the anti camp. Read more: Iran's political cartoonists push boundaries . ""Most Arabic TV has been questioned in terms of its editorial stance. That two of the region's most prominent stations are taking a pro- and anti- stance in countries such as Egypt is one of the most discussed issues on the 'Arab street,'"" he says. Matt Duffy, a former journalism professor at the UAE's Zayed University, said he wasn't surprised by the findings. ""I think more youths are noticing that information is different depending on what media outlet you're turned into,"" he says. ""Also, the students were far more connected to social media. They were checking their BlackBerry devices far more than turning on the TV."" Social media has changed the landscape considerably. In 2011, nobody polled listed social media as a trusted source of news and only 11% rated online media. This year, 26% said they trust websites, and 22% social media. For Duffy the increased trust in these outlets isn't necessarily a good thing. ""I found many of my students had trust in anything: Twitter, blogs, newspapers, Tumblr, TV. Many would see a tweet and just assume it must be true."" Internet freedom is valued, but so is regulation . Northwestern University in Qatar also published a survey last month, focusing primarily on media usage in the region. The survey polled 10,000 individuals across eight countries on their media views, and found that, for the most part, Arabs believe in freedom of expression online; 61% of those polled in the region agreed with the statement ""It is okay for people to express their ideas on the internet, even if they are unpopular."" Saudi Arabian citizens voiced this view most strongly, with 76% agreeing with the statement. Conversely, Saudis were also the biggest proponents of curbing internet freedom; 62% agreed that the internet should be more tightly regulated in their country. Across the region, half of those polled agreed. ""There's an enormous inconsistency there,"" says Everette Dennis, the Dean and CEO of Northwestern University in Qatar, and one of the survey's authors. Dennis attributes the discrepancy to the region's acceptance of constraints on freedom of speech. Read more: Arab youth find comic relief with stand-up . ""Whether people see it that way or not, the idea of blasphemy is alive and well in the Middle East. It's blasphemous to have anti-Islam material online, and there's a general acceptance in monarchies that one does not criticize the leader. You can criticize the head of state, but not the emir. I gather there's this acceptance that it's the way it is."" A free media does not equal a trusted media . Some countries Dennis surveyed were predictably cautious of their media. In Egypt and Tunisia, only around one quarter of those polled agreed that news media in their country was credible. Other countries, however showed less predictable results. In Saudi Arabia, for example, where media is tightly controlled, 74% believed their news was trustworthy. In Lebanon, which has more freedom of press, only 25% agreed. ""It's counter-intuitive,"" admits Dennis. He believes that, in fact, increased access to media, coupled with diversity, have a hand in shaping the results. ""There's limited access to media in Saudi; there's almost a sense of gratitude for having web access at all. That could be one factor. Lebanon is also much more diverse, so you get more viewpoints, and with it, more controversy.""","Two separate surveys highlight the Middle East's complicated relationship with its media.
One poll finds that while most Arabs rely on TV for their news, few find it reliable.
The two top broadcasters in the region may have damaged their credibility with their strong political leanings.
Many living  without press freedoms still find their media trustworthy."

"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- After decades of a military junta rule, the south-east Asian country of Myanmar is opening up, and the government is working hard to welcome a plane loads of visitors from around the world. Myanmar's turnaround from pariah state to becoming this year's must-see destination has been remarkable. Much of the country is untouched and rich in both historic and architectural heritage. There is plenty to discover for the tourist who wants to go off the beaten track. Below CNN takes a look at some of Myanmar's most magnificent treasures. Shwedagon Pagoda . The golden stupa of Yangon's 2,500-year-old Shwedagon Pagoda shines over the city. The pagoda is covered in hundreds of golden plates and there are thousands of encrusted diamonds on the stupa, glittering in all different colors, reflecting the rays of the sun. It's a majestic site and impossible not to notice when visiting the former capital of Myanmar. ""In Myanmar, it is very important for our religion,"" says Kyaw, a guide at Shwedagon. ""Because most people from here, mostly Buddhist people, have to come here at least one time in their life."" Myanmar is one of the world's most devout Buddhist nations -- the majority of Burmese are Buddhists and the 100-meter-tall Shwedagon is their most sacred temple. Legend says it enshrines eight of Buddha's hair, that were given to two merchant brothers by Buddha himself. At times the pagoda has also served as a rallying point and a source of strength against the former military regime, or as in the 1920s and 1930s resistance to British Colonial rule. Read more: 11 things to know before visiting Myanmar . Colonial architecture in Yangon . The architectural heritage of Yangon is rich and evidence of the former British Empire is almost at every corner. Buildings from the colonial era stretch out across the city, telling stories of a time long gone. Yangon has one of the highest number of colonial period buildings in all of south-east Asia, built during the British rule in Burma, which lasted from 1824 to 1948. Buildings like the City Hall, the former High Court and Strand Hotel attract many visitors. But these iconic buildings are under threat, since renovating and preserving their crumbling facades is costly. The Yangon Heritage Trust is trying to ensure these buildings don't meet a bulldozer, so the country's past can be maintained. One building in particular could be seen as the monument to Myanmar's political rebirth. The Secretariat, the Minister's building during the British rule, has been standing empty for years, but played an important role in the history of Myanmar. This is where the leaders of the independence movement in the late 1940s were assassinated -- among them General Aung San, the father of Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar's Nobel laureate, and a former political prisoner. That her father lost his life in the assassination room is one of the reasons why the Secretariat could now be preserved. ""I think just a couple of years ago this was not on the agenda at all and I think we were in real danger,"" says chairman of the Yangon Heritage Trust, Thant Myint-U.

"As Sony Pictures struggles to recover from one blow after another related to the devastating cyber attack, one may overlook the fact that its parent company in Japan has been a popular target of hackers for years. Three years ago, in April 2011, Sony's PlayStation network was shut down for nearly a month when hackers stole the personal information of an estimated 77 million people. That same year, in June, hackers released 150,000 Sony Pictures records including usernames and passwords and claimed to have compromised the private information of more than one million people. In October 2012, hacker group ""The Three Musketeers"" released a security key that allowed PS3 users to run pirated games. Despite those incidents, a group with suspected ties to North Korea calling itself ""Guardians of Peace"" was able to infiltrate Sony's computer system, steal an incredible amount of data, and use it to launch the most vicious cyber-attack in history on an American corporation. Former Sony employees are suing the company for failing to protect their privacy. Many are asking what lessons -- if any -- Sony learned from those previous hacks. Asia Strategist Keith Henry says Sony was taken by complete surprise last month when the cyber-terrorists successfully stole massive amounts of data and used it to devastate the company. ""They can inflict damage. Immense amount of damage to corporate America,"" Henry says. They posted personal information like addresses and social security numbers, private emails that contained embarrassing revelations about top executives and Hollywood stars, insider information about the studio's tactics, and they even posted five Sony movies on file-sharing websites. Tokyo-based cyber security firm LAC is the only line of defense for about 850 clients. It has a confidential list of private companies and government agencies. ""The hackers are always getting more advanced,"" says LAC Chief Technology Officer Itsuro Nishimoto. And they are sometimes too far ahead of those trying to keep up. Nishimoto says a devastating hack like the one on Sony Pictures can penetrate even the best cyber-defense. He says the Sony network may be more vulnerable because of the large amount of users with varying degrees of access. Sony appears to be trying to avoid further provoking North Korea, the prime hacking suspect, telling CNN simply ""the investigation is ongoing."" The Japanese government is also distancing itself. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs tells CNN the hack is a ""United States issue."" Henry says the world is coming to terms with the new reality of cyber-terrorism. ""One of the reasons nobody is willing to make a statement is because they don't know what to say,"" Henry says. Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian Studies at Temple University in Tokyo says the attack reveals lax cyber-security among Sony's ranks. But he suspects it is a more widespread problem in Japan. ""I think this is a wake-up call for Japan that this is a problem. This is a huge vulnerability. And they're not really managing this risk very well or very aggressively,"" Kingston said. ""It does suggest a certain level of corporate complacency.""

"(CNN) -- The Shanghai skyline is a telltale (and tall) sign about where the Chinese city is going -- and where it's been. With the 128-floor Shanghai Tower, set for completion this year, and the 1,500-foot-tall Oriental Pearl Tower, the city clearly has one foot firmly planted in economic boom. In the alleys beneath, where street vendors hawk sweet, savory, sour and umami-rich treats, the city is firmly entrenched in centuries-old traditions. See more food news, culture and downright deliciousness on Eatocracy . Shanghai is the most populous city in China, and the fastest growing. According to the Hurun Wealth Report 2014, it also boasts 159,000 millionaires with a new taste for global influence and luxury. Shanghai is one of the country's largest markets for imported wines, and China recently surpassed the French in red wine consumption, according to the International Wine and Spirit Research company. The cuisine in Shanghai is hard to pinpoint, as its location as a port city on a tributary of the Yangtze River has made it a city of immigrants with the Jiangsu province to the north and the Zhejiang province to the south. Shanghai's most famous dish is perhaps xiao long bao, or soup dumplings. Often filled with a combination of pork and shrimp, the concealed pork-laden broth can warm you through-and-through, or burn the first layer of skin from your esophagus if consumed too hastily. Lee Anne Wong, a second generation Chinese-American chef, has a knack for finding and recreating street food favorites like these, as demonstrated in her recent Cooking Channel special ""Food Crawl.""

Dice the pork belly and ham into large chunks. Combine with the water, scallion, ginger and garlic in a large stockpot. Bring the water to a boil and then reduce to a rolling simmer. Skim the foam and impurities that rise to the surface of the stock for a clearer broth. Cook the broth for 2Â½ hours. Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve or colander lined with a lint-free towel into a clean pot. Discard the solids (or pull the braised meat from the wing bones and chop and use for dumpling filling, stir-fry, salad, stew or sandwiches). Place the strained broth back on the burner. Add the wine and soy sauce. Bring the broth to a rolling simmer and reduce until you only have 2 cups (475 ml) of liquid remaining. Pour the soup into a shallow baking dish. Allow the soup stock to cool enough to stop steaming, then cover and place in your refrigerator. Chill the stock for several hours, until it is completely cold and set, like Jell-O. Using a fork, scrape up the gelatin and gently mash it to break it up into small pieces. To make the filling: . Combine the ingredients in a bowl. Mix well. Stir in the soup gelatin until it is well distributed. Cover and refrigerate the filling. For the dough: . 2 cups (200 g) packed all-purpose flour . 1 cup (235 ml) boiling water . 1 Tbsp (15 ml) sesame oil . To make the dough: . Place the flour in a bowl and make a well in the center. Pour the boiling water and sesame oil into the center of the well and stir with a fork or pair of chopsticks until the dough begins to come together. You may need to add more water if it is dry, or if the dough is sticky, a touch more flour. Once the dough comes together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead lightly for 3 to 4 minutes, until it can be kneaded into a smooth ball. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Working on a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 2-inch (5-cm)-thick rope and divide the dough into 10 even pieces. Roll each piece into a 1-inch (2.5-cm)-thick rope and cut into 4 pieces, for a total of 40 pieces. Keep the dough covered in plastic wrap or with a damp towel. Using a small rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into a 4-inch (10-cm) circle about 1â .","Anthony Bourdain travels to Shanghai, China, in the season premiere of ""Parts Unknown""

"(CNN) -- Sponsors of the California ballot measure that banned same-sex marriage are seeking to nullify thousands of marriages between gay and lesbian couples performed after the state Supreme Court ruled them constitutional. The passge of Proposition 8 left the future of thousands of marriages between same-sex couples unclear. The sponsors Friday filed responses to three anti-Proposition 8 lawsuits with the state Supreme Court. The briefs also defend Proposition 8 against opponents' legal challenges, including an argument that the amendment needed a constitutional convention to be added to the state's constitution. ""We are confident that the will of the voters and Proposition 8 will ultimately be upheld,"" said Andrew Pugno, General Counsel for ProtectMarriage.com and the Proposition 8 Legal Defense Fund. California Attorney General Edmund ""Jerry"" Brown called on the court to reject the initiative. ""Proposition 8 must be invalidated because the amendment process cannot be used to extinguish fundamental constitutional rights without compelling justification,"" Brown said in a written statement. Rick Jacobs, founder and chair of the anti-Proposition 8 Courage Campaign, said he was ""appalled"" that the initiative's supporters wanted to nullify the same-sex marriages that are already on the books. ""The motivation behind this mean-spirited and heart-breaking action should not be allowed to be buried in legal brief,"" he said. ""If Proposition 8's sponsors plan to destroy lives, they should at least have the courage to admit it publicly."" Opponents filed suit quickly after the November 4 election in which Proposition 8 passed 52 percent to 48 percent, effectively reversing a California Supreme Court decision that it was unconstitutional to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The vote also prompted a series of protests, some aimed at supporters of the proposition. The proposition, which added an amendment to the state constitution, defined marriage as between one man and one woman. Opponents argue that the amendment cannot be applied retroactively, but proponents say the amendment is clear on that issue. ""Proposition 8's brevity is matched by its clarity,"" one of the briefs read. ""There are no conditional clauses, exceptions, exemptions, or exclusions: 'Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.' "" ... Its plain language encompasses both pre-existing and later-created same-sex (and polygamous) marriages, whether performed in California or elsewhere. With crystal clarity, it declares that they are not valid or recognized in California."" Opponents are also seeking to have the amendment nullified, arguing that it alters the state's constitution -- meaning the state Supreme Court's May ruling -- and therefore, according to state law, is a revision that requires a constitutional convention. Proponents of the amendment disagree. ""Petitioners' challenge depends on characterizing Proposition 8 as a radical departure from the fundamental principles of the California Constitution,"" their briefs said. "" ... But that portrayal is wildly wrong. Proposition 8 is limited in nature and effect. It does nothing more than restore the definition of marriage to what it was and always had been under California law before June 16, 2008 -- and to what the people had repeatedly willed that it be throughout California's history."" California voters passed a ballot initiative in 2000 that changed the state's Family Code to formally define marriage in the state between a man and a woman. After San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom performed same-sex marriages in 2004, which were promptly annulled, Newsom and others sought to have the ballot initiative struck down. The California Supreme Court did so in May, and same-sex marriages were performed legally in California a month later. The court's ruling said the right to marry is among a set of basic human rights ""so integral to an individual's liberty and personal autonomy that they may not be eliminated or abrogated by the legislature or by the electorate through the statutory initiative process."" But opponents had already been at work on Proposition 8, seeking to enshrine the marriage definition in the constitution, and the initiative was approved for the November 4 vote. Proposition 8 supporters also announced the addition of Kenneth Starr to their legal team. Starr will serve as lead counsel and argue their case to the Supreme Court. Starr, the dean of Pepperdine Law School, investigated the suicide of Clinton deputy White House counsel Vince Foster and the Whitewater affair. The $70 million investigation turned up evidence of President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky and led to Clinton's impeachment by the House of Representatives. He was acquitted by the Senate.","Ballot initiative's sponsors have filed three lawsuits with state Supreme Court .

"(CNN) -- The liberal environmentalist Green Party nominated former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney as its presidential candidate Saturday. Cynthia McKinney represented a suburban Atlanta, Georgia, district for six terms as a Democrat. McKinney, 53, held off three rivals to win the party's nomination during its convention in Chicago, Illinois. She picked journalist and activist Rosa Clemente as her running mate. Green Party spokeswoman Scott McLarty acknowledged McKinney was a ""long shot"" for the White House, but said, ""Every vote that she gets helps the Green Party."" ""The United States needs an alternative party,"" McLarty said. ""The narrow two-party system we have right now has not served us very well."" McKinney represented a suburban district of Atlanta, Georgia, as a Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives for six terms -- five consecutively. First elected in 1992, she lost a primary challenge in 2002 after suggesting in a radio interview that members of the Bush administration stood to profit from the war that followed the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. In 2004 she ran again and won with a low-key campaign in which she largely avoided controversy. But voters ousted her again in 2006 after she was accused of a physical altercation with a U.S. Capitol Police officer who questioned her after failing to recognize her at a security checkpoint. The most successful Green Party presidential candidate was consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who drew nearly 3 percent of the vote in 2000. Nader is running again this year, this time as an independent. Earlier this year, the Libertarian Party nominated McKinney's onetime House colleague, ex-Republican congressman Bob Barr, as its presidential nominee. Barr also represented a district in the Atlanta suburbs during his four terms in Congress. CNN's Brendan Gage contributed to this report.","Cynthia McKinney, ex-Georgia congresswoman, defeats three for nomination .

"Hours before 22 U.S. embassies and consulates were to close for a day, top U.S. security officials reviewed the situation that led to the unprecedented move. A U.S. global travel alert remained in place amid fears that al Qaeda may launch attacks in the Middle East, North Africa and beyond in coming weeks. The threat prompted the United States to announce that 22 facilities would be closed on Sunday, including in Yemen, which was a focus of concern. A Saturday afternoon meeting included the White House chief of staff, Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, as well as the heads of Homeland Security, the National Security Agency, the FBI and CIA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. President Barack Obama was briefed after the meeting, according to the White House. On Saturday, the security around the U.S. embassy in Yemen was even tighter than last year when the embassy was raided by protesters. At least 12 tanks were stationed within 500 meters of the building. Hundreds of additional security forces were deployed, and roads leading to the embassy were closed. Checkpoints were set up at a distance from the embassy, and trucks weren't allowed to pass anywhere near the main embassy road. Yemen's special forces, the most elite, were seen in small numbers near the embassy, as well. Meanwhile, Britain, France and Germany have said they, too, will close their embassies in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, on Sunday and Monday for security reasons. No other embassies are affected, they said. Neither Italy nor Spain -- which has no embassy in Yemen -- planned to close any of their embassies. The U.S. embassies closed on Sunday -- a day they would normally be open -- stretch across a swath of North Africa and the Middle East, from Mauritania to Oman. Bangladesh and Afghanistan, both majority Muslim nations, also are affected. The U.S. government's actions are in response to growing intelligence that shows a potential for attacks in Yemen and elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa, said U.S. officials who spoke to CNN on condition of not being identified. Official: Security tightened in Yemen . ""The threat appears to be much worse than it has (been) in a long time,"" said a senior national security official in Yemen, where the government is ""on high alert against possible attacks in the days to come."" Various Western targets -- not just those tied to the United States -- are under threat, two U.S. officials said. Three sources said the United States has information that members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack. One of the sources said such preparations appeared to have increased in recent days with the approaching end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Sunday is Laylet al-Qadr, or the Night of Power, one of the holiest moments on the Muslim calendar. Said one U.S. official: ""It all leads us to believe something could happen in the near future."" What's behind timing of terror threat . Christopher Hill, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, told CNN he had never seen embassy closures ordered across such a broad area. ""There have been incidents where they've closed down a number of embassies in the Middle East because the information is not specific enough to say that 'embassy X' got to be closed as opposed to other embassies,"" said Hill, who joined the U.S. Foreign Service in 1977. ""But I think this, closing all of these embassies in the Middle East to North Africa, is in fact unprecedented. At least, I didn't see this during my career."" 'Leave Yemen now' U.S. officials said that, based on intelligence, they were particularly concerned about the U.S. Embassy in Yemen between Saturday and Tuesday.  President Barack Obama, amid regular updates on the situation, has directed officials to take all appropriate steps to protect Americans. A White House official said the president was updated Saturday morning by Lisa Monaco, his assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism. Obama, who departed for Joint Base Andrews to play golf, is being updated through the weekend, the official said. He praised Yemeni President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi for his country's efforts following a meeting Thursday at the White House. The UK Foreign Office has also warned its citizens against travel to Yemen, and urged British nationals to leave as soon as possible. ""If you don't leave the country now while commercial carriers are still flying it is extremely unlikely that the British government will be able to evacuate you or provide consular assistance,"" it said. Photos: Attacks on U.S. diplomatic sites . It was unclear whether the apparent plot targets that Arabian nation or one elsewhere -- which is why the travel alert applies so broadly, and why embassies from Bangladesh to Libya are being closed. Nor is the expected time of an attack known, which explains why the U.S. travel alert extends through August. ""Terrorists may elect to use a variety of means and weapons and target both official and private interests,"" the alert states. ""U.S. citizens are reminded of the potential for terrorists to attack public transportation systems and other tourist infrastructure."" New York Rep. Peter King, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, called the information ""the most specific I've seen."" While the principal attention is on the Arabian Peninsula, he stressed  to CNN's Wolf Blitzer that ""we can't rule anything out."" ""We are focused on the Middle East, but it's a potential series of attacks that really could be almost anyplace,"" King said. 22 embassies, consulates ordered closed . The State Department listed the 22 embassies and consulates that are closed Sunday, which is normally the start of the work week in the countries affected. The 17 affected U.S. embassies are in Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Mauritania, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Sudan and Yemen. The U.S. Embassy in Israel will be closed as normal Sunday. See the whole list . Consulates in Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also being shut for the day. Embassies and consulates in the region typically close or operate with minimal staff on Fridays and Saturdays. The shutdowns could extend beyond Sunday, a senior State Department official said. Retired Gen. James Mattis -- who until earlier this year was head of U.S. Central Command, responsible for a 20-country area that includes the Middle East -- said the decision to close the embassies underscores the reality of the threat and the wisdom of U.S. policymakers. U.S. embassies have been targeted before in places such as Yemen, Turkey and Tanzania, he pointed out. Moreover, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is one of the terrorist network's most active and most destructive branches. ""We have to remember that we're up against an enemy who kills indiscriminately -- whether it be women, children, diplomats -- and our embassies ... have been one of the targets,"" Mattis told CNN on Friday. Referring to the move by U.S. officials, he said, ""They are showing some proactive discretion here, making certain that we don't give the enemy an opportunity that we can deny them."" Meanwhile, Canada shuttered for one day its diplomatic mission in Bangladesh on Saturday. Questions, concerns after Benghazi . House leaders have been briefed, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters, adding that the travel alert and embassy closings provided ""some understanding of the seriousness of the threat."" King, who has also heard such briefings, applauded the government's decision to close its diplomatic missions. ""I give them credit,"" the Republican said of the Obama administration. ""I think the government is doing exactly the right thing here."" Such bipartisan agreement in Washington comes at a time when politicians are still scrutinizing the September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. consular compound in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Since then, Republicans have been pressing Obama's administration for answers, with some accusing officials of covering up what happened in Benghazi and not doing enough to track down the attackers. Eight GOP lawmakers are asking that incoming FBI Director James Comey brief Congress within 30 days about the investigation. They say the administration's inquiry to date has been ""simply unacceptable,"" according to a draft letter obtained by CNN. Earlier this week, Vice President Joe Biden and senior State Department officials went to Congress to discuss embassy security. Biden also briefed congressional leadership, key committee chairmen and ranking members about the latest threat concerns, a source who attended the meeting said. Another official said the recent intelligence might not have warranted such a response before the Benghazi attack, which created a political firestorm for the administration. On Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the agency was taking the steps out of an abundance of caution. CNN found embassy attack suspect before FBI .","The 22 U.S. embassies, consulates are closing .

"It sounds like an episode from a 1980s TV police drama: A wealthy businessman claims he was framed for two Miami murders allegedly ordered by Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar. Nearly 30 years ago, international food importer and newspaper owner Krishna ""Kris"" Maharaj, a British citizen, was living the good life in South Florida. He had owned luxury cars and horses that raced against thoroughbreds held by Queen Elizabeth II. Then, in October 1986, police arrested Maharaj in the shooting deaths of his business partners Derrick Moo Young and his 23-year-old son Duane. Despite having an alibi, Maharaj was charged with murdering the Moo Youngs because they allegedly had cheated him out of more than $400,000. He was found guilty and sentenced to death -- a penalty that was later reduced to life in prison. And there Maharaj has remained for 27 years. Then, in April this year, a Florida judge granted Maharaj a chance that could open the door to freedom. Florida 11th Judicial Circuit Judge William Thomas held a hearing in November to determine if new evidence from Maharaj's lawyers ""undermines confidence in the verdict,"" according to court documents. Defense attorneys also must establish that the new ""evidence would probably produce an acquittal or less severe sentence on retrial."" Maharaj's lawyers said evidence suggests that the murders were committed by former members of Escobar's infamous drug cartel. In the late 1970s and early '80s, Escobar cashed in on the exploding popularity of cocaine in the United States, according to reporter Mark Bowden, author of ""Killing Pablo."" Leading the Medellin Cartel, Escobar was responsible at one point for almost 80% of Colombia's cocaine exports, making him the seventh richest man in the world, Bowden told CNN. Escobar was killed in a rooftop shootout with authorities in 1993. According to a motion filed in January by Maharaj's attorneys, a ""Colombian drug cartel member confirmed that the Moo Young murders were committed at the behest of Pablo Escobar."" ""The Moo Youngs were laundering money for the Colombian cartels,"" the defense motion said. ""This is what precipitated their murders."" An ex-cartel member confirmed that ""Maharaj was not involved in the murders of the Moo Youngs, and that they had to be eliminated because they had lost Colombian drug money,"" according to the defense motion. ""We've got several Colombian cartel people to say, 'We did the murders,'"" Maharaj defense attorney Clive Stafford Smith told CNN on the phone in June. Read the full defense motion document . The defense team also alleges Florida prosecutors covered up evidence in the 1987 trial that could have proved Maharaj's innocence. Although prosecutors said they stand by the decades-old case, in a June e-mail to CNN, a state attorney spokesman wrote, ""Now that we are re-engaged in litigation on this matter, it would be inappropriate for us to be commenting at this time."" Prior to the hearing, strongly worded arguments flew back and forth via filed court documents. In January Assistant State Attorneys Penny Brill and Sally Weintraub wrote that a defense motion for the new hearing was based on ""hearsay and inadmissible evidence."" ""None of [the potential witnesses named in the defense motion] have any first hand knowledge, provide no admissible testimony or evidence and only attempt to further the nonsensical and wholly speculative theories of the defense,"" the prosecution document said. ""The only thing that is obvious to anyone who really looks at these fantastical allegations by the defendant is that they are empty and have no substance,"" wrote the prosecutors. Read the full prosecution document . Now aged 75, Maharaj has been in poor health, Smith said, although he seems to have improved. ""When we got this hearing, and when we started learning about these Colombian witnesses who were corroborating his innocence, Kris really cheered up,"" said Smith. ""I think he's now trying to walk more and not use his wheel chair and so forth."" Local TV news video at the November hearing showed Maharaj in the courtroom appearing upbeat. He offered a thumbs-up to family members and other supporters. Defense attorney Ben Kuehne said the ""circumstances of this crime were not as presented to the jury by the prosecution,"" reported Miami TV station WTVJ. Prosecutor Brill reportedly countered, ""I haven't heard one thing from the defense that indicates that this is admissible evidence."" In the wake of the hearing, Judge Thomas is expected to set a court date when he could issue a ruling. But the odds are stacked against Maharaj. The burden of proof is high. Florida's Supreme Court has already upheld his conviction. Derrick Moo Young's daughter was asked in 2007 about continued efforts to exonerate Maharaj. ""It's all been hashed out before,"" she told the Miami Herald. ""It's a waste of tax dollars."" Prosecutors' evidence against Maharaj is significant. Police found Maharaj's fingerprints in the guest room at Miami's Dupont Plaza hotel where the shootings occurred. Maharaj says he was there for a meeting, but he departed before the Moo Youngs were killed. Nineteen fingerprints found at the crime scene have never been identified, according to the defense motion. Maharaj told CNN's ""Death Row Stories"" that he left the hotel and drove 25 miles to Fort Lauderdale to have lunch with one of his newspaper employees. The employee signed an affidavit as an alibi witness. The restaurant manager, Ron Kisch, told ""Death Row Stories,"" he remembered seeing Maharaj having lunch that day. ""It doesn't seem like there's any way possible that he could have killed people at 12 o'clock  and then been in for lunch sometime between 12 and 2,"" Kisch said. Five other witnesses came forward saying Maharaj was with them on the day of the murders, ""Death Row Stories"" reported. Across the hall from the murder scene at the time of the killings, said the defense team, was a Colombian hotel guest named Vallejo Mejia. Police briefly questioned Mejia at the time, according to defense documents. He was a ""longtime money launderer who was frequently in Miami,"" the documents said. More recently, defense lawyers said in the documents, they had been ""able to establish that [Mejia] was a senior cartel operative."" During his entire imprisonment, Maharaj's wife Marita has been working to keep her husband's confidence high, said Smith. It's important to her that Maharaj believes he will eventually be exonerated. ""She is his rock,"" Smith said. ""They talk every day on the phone ... and she goes to see him every Sunday."" Earlier this year, Marita wrote in the New Statesman, ""I pretend to myself that Kris is traveling. When I have five minutes on the phone with him in the evening, I pretend to myself that he is talking to me from a trip, not from a cell."" Smith sees Maharaj quite often lately at a medium security correctional facility outside Miami. Authorities allow them to sit together at a table in a largely empty room with a guard watching nearby. ""I don't think there's a case that's quite as absolute as Kris',"" said Smith. ""I mean we've got an alibi  — we've got everything. It's just really shocking."" Smith admits he's become ""obsessed"" with freeing his client -- partially because of guilt. ""I've represented the guy for 20 years and I failed him. And it really makes you think, 'How on Earth could you lose a case like this?'"" Virtually penniless, Maharaj faces financial challenges as well as health issues. ""If he gets out, he'll probably go back to Britain and set up another business,"" said Smith. ""Kris is fairly unstoppable.""","After 27 years in prison, lawyers claim new evidence could free ex-millionaire .

"Surabaya, Indonesia (CNN)The man who captained AirAsia Flight QZ8501 lived in a picturesque neighborhood in the suburbs of Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city. We headed there to see if family members or friends wanted to talk to us about him. These types of assignments are never easy. We are well aware that the last thing many people in mourning want to do is to talk to a journalist. I've done this long enough to know that the smart thing is to have the decency to offer condolences and leave if mourners say they don't want to talk. But this family didn't feel that way. They were gracious and warm to us, and invited us to join other mourners who were with them. Experienced pilot . The captain of the ill-fated airliner, known only as Irianto -- many Indonesians go by one name -- had been with AirAsia for six years. He had worked for another airline in Indonesia for 13 years before that, and was an Indonesian Air Force pilot for a decade prior. When we arrived at his home, his wife, Widya Sukatri Putri, answered the door.  She and Irianto have two children; a daughter named Angela who is about to turn 25, and a 7-year-old son named Arya. We told her we wanted to do a story about Irianto, that we hoped to find out what kind of husband and father he was; what kind of man and pilot he was. She invited us inside where we offered our condolences and asked if she would to talk to us on camera. She told us she wasn't sure if she wanted to talk, but invited us to come back later in the morning. We came back two hours later and the house was full of family and friends offering support to Widya, her children, and Irianto's elderly mother and father. What was taking place in the house was an Indonesian tradition known as a layat, a visitation by people when there is death in a family.  There were dozens of people, old and young, sitting on the floor of Irianto's home. The house was so crowded that other mourners sat out in the front of the house, and some sat at tables that had been put in the middle of the closed off street. 'Kind and loving' father and husband . Widya and Angela, her daughter, invited us to sit down with them, and it was there that they decided they did want to say a few words to us about Irianto. The portrait they painted about this man made it clear that he was kind and loving, fun and even-tempered, hard working and dedicated. I marveled at how kind Irianto's wife and children were to us, how kind his parents were to us. They were suffering so much, yet they wanted to make us feel at home. I told his daughter not to worry about us. She told me her father had taught her to be hospitable. Angela is not ready to give up hope that someway, somehow he and other people on the plane might still be alive. But she knows that is unlikely and told us she is prepared to accept reality. This family made it very evident they were lucky to have Irianto in their lives. We said our goodbyes to this gracious family, realizing that the fated plane's pilot was also very lucky to have them.","CNN crew speaks to the family of the captain of AirAsia Flight QZ8501 .

"Tea, that most ordinary of beverages, was once so highly prized that traders, travelers and seafarers risked their lives to bring the precious cargo from China to the rest of the world. Now, a small but growing band of tea aficionados is traveling across the country in pursuit of tea at its source, fueled by an appreciation of China's ancient tea culture and traditions and a more modern interest in green methods of cultivation and artisanal production. Tea tourism within China is still a relatively new phenomenon, gaining traction in the last few years and generally associated with an educated and upwardly mobile Chinese middle class. For Chinese people, traveling for tea brings with it a certain cachet. ""In most public schools, there is no formal education about tea, so one's knowledge of the subject proves you have traveled, and studied about tea on your own,"" says tea guide Michael Wang. ""In others' eyes, you are not only educated but cultivated."" 'Understanding begins with a single cup' Tea expert and guide Tracy Lesh specializes in bringing Chinese tea culture to foreign travelers and expats within China -- a small portion of her clientele are Chinese people who appreciate her depth of knowledge. Lesh began arranging tea tours more than five years ago when she realized there was a growing interest in learning not just about the tea itself, but the culture surrounding it. ""Americans are overwhelmed and undereducated about Chinese tea culture,"" she says. ""Many aren't aware of the benefits of loose-leaf teas and are mainly drinking teas blended with fruits and flowers. It takes a lifetime to appreciate tea, but understanding begins with just a single cup."" Chinese tea tourists tend to have a different focus than Westerners when it comes to visiting a tea area. Wang says non-Chinese look for a sense of adventure and don't mind hiking into the tea terraces. They have a strong interest in seeing production methods firsthand and picking tea for themselves, but don't yet understand the culture of tea. ""Foreigners have difficulty understanding the delicate taste of xian (savory) and huigan (sweetness) in tea,"" Wang says. Chinese visitors, on the other hand, place an emphasis on relaxing and drinking tea without the need to hike into the tea plantation or pick leaves. They often use artisanal teas as gifts for building good business relationships and are interested in learning gongfu tea -- a refined way of serving tea involving proper vessels, brewing techniques and atmosphere that takes patience and skill to master. Like good wine, tea's final flavor is influenced heavily by terroir -- the microclimate in which it's grown. For those interested in taking a tea tour, below are three starting points, corresponding to three of China's most well known teas, each different in climate, geography and taste. Longjing (Dragon Well) green tea . Located just south of Hangzhou province's beautiful West Lake, Longjing is home to China's most celebrated green tea, which is the color of jade and has the fresh aroma of chestnuts and cut grass. The best time to visit the area is during China's Qing Ming Festival (usually April) when most picking and roasting take place. Longjing's tea villages and plantations -- many are open to the public -- are connected by a cycle pathway and bus route. Longjing is home to the China National Tea Museum. Among the temples, pagodas and gardens lining the shores of nearby West Lake sit many small tea houses where longjing tea can be enjoyed in a relaxed atmosphere. Hangzhou is reached by high-speed train from Shanghai's Hongqiao Railway Station. Trains run every 30 minutes and take one hour. Tracy Lesh and Michael Wang arrange small group tea tours to the Longjing tea terraces year round (shanghaiandbeyond.com; +86 159 009 03998). China National Tea Museum, 88 Longjing Road, West Lake, Hangzhou; +86 571 8796 4221; open 9 a.m.-5 p.m., May-October 7; 8:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m., October 8-April 30; . closed Mondays; free admission . Wuyi Mountain oolong tea . Oolong tea, a fragrant partially oxidized tea midway between green teas like longjing and black teas like pu'er, has its origins in southern China's Fujian province. The most famous of Fujian's oolongs, da hong pao or ""big red robe"" tea comes from Wuyi Mountain, a UNESCO-protected natural heritage site rich with rare and animal life, centered around the pristine Nine Twists River. Genuine da hong pao is picked from just a few ancient tea trees high on Wuyi Mountain and is unobtainable to all but the wealthiest and most influential, but oolong plantations in the surrounding hills produce wonderful teas too. Like wine, the terroir of these teas is demonstrated by oolong's floral notes, which are subtly different according to the orientation, altitude and soil mineral content of the hillside on which the tea is grown.

Pu'er, a fermented and aged black tea with a complex, earthy taste, is considered the pinnacle of all Chinese teas. Usually pressed into cakes, it's allowed to age so that its complexity and depth of flavor increase over time (as does the price), again drawing comparisons to wine. Pu'er has a fascinating trade history. Tea was carried, often on foot, overland on the ancient Tea Horse Road linking Yunnan and Tibet in exchange for the Tibetan mountain ponies sought by the Chinese for their hardiness. The area of southern Yunnan where pu'er is produced lies adjacent to Myanmar, Laos and the Mekong River. The region features an enormous protected native jungle and wild elephant reserve, a tropical and medicinal botanic garden, hills terraced with tea plantations and areas filled with wild tea trees that are hundreds of years old. There are daily flights to the regional capital, Jinghong, from all major Chinese cities, or you can fly directly into the smaller Pu'er airport (known as Pu'er Simao). Pu'er tea tours can be arranged through Jinghong's Mekong Café.

"Can complaining too much get you booted from a frequent flier program? It's one of the questions at the heart of a lawsuit filed against Northwest -- now owned by Delta Air Lines -- by S. Binyomin Ginsberg, a rabbi who lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and frequently travels to lecture and teach. Ginsberg joined Northwest's WorldPerks frequent flier program in 1999 and reached Platinum Elite status in 2005. But in June of 2008, Ginsberg said a Northwest representative called him and told him his status was being revoked ""on the ground that he had 'abused' the program,"" according to court papers. Ginsberg said the airline also took away the hundreds of thousands of miles accumulated in his account. ""It didn't make sense. Initially, when they contacted me on the phone I thought it was a prank call,"" Ginsberg said. ""When I pushed for a reason and clarification, they told me it was because I was complaining too much."" In July 2008, Northwest sent the rabbi a letter noting that he had made 24 complaints in the past eight months, including nine incidents of his bag arriving late at the luggage carousel, according to court papers. ""You have continually asked for compensation over and above our guidelines. We have awarded you $1,925.00 in travel credit vouchers, 78,500 WorldPerks bonus miles, a voucher extension for your son, and $491.00 in cash reimbursements,"" the letter states, according to court papers. ""Due to our past generosity, we must respectfully advise that we will no longer be awarding you compensation each time you contact us."" Ginsberg's lawyers countered that the rabbi and his wife had been averaging about 75 flights on Northwest each year, and that Ginsberg estimated that only about 10% of the trips had resulted in a call to Northwest's customer care. ""I don't think I was a frequent complainer,"" Ginsberg said. ""They should have taken their time and analyzed: Were my complaints legitimate? Should they be doing something to improve their service and quality of product? Instead of worrying, we've got to shut up somebody who is complaining too much."" In November of 2008, Northwest sent Ginsberg an e-mail, in which the airline quoted a paragraph from the fine print of the WorldPerks Program. It stated that Northwest could determine ""in its sole judgment"" whether a passenger has abused the program, and that abuse ""may result in cancellation of the member's account and future disqualification from program participation, forfeiture of all mileage accrued and cancellation of previously issued but unused awards."" Ginsberg sued for breach of contract in January of 2009, but a California district court dismissed the class action suit, agreeing with Northwest that the Airline Deregulation Act preempted his claim. The act prohibits parties from bringing state law claims against airlines that relate to a ""price, route, or service"" of the carrier, according to court documents. The airline's lawyers also argued that the WorldPerks general terms and conditions did not require Northwest to provide frequent fliers with lengthy explanations or reasons for its decision to terminate or demote a member's status in the program. But last month, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision and ordered it to reconsider Ginsberg's claims. It said that when Congress passed the Airline Deregulation Act, it did not intend to ""immunize the airline industry from liability for common law contract claims."" Delta did not respond to a request for comment, but the airline has requested a re-hearing in the case. Ginsberg -- who is still a frequent flier, but is no longer loyal to any one airline -- said he is hoping to get his miles back, have his status reinstated and get fair compensation for what he's gone through. ""To me, it's outright fraud. You can't take somebody's mileage away when they've accumulated it,"" he said. ""We live in a country that was built on freedom and this to me is a tremendous abuse of freedom.""","S. Binyomin Ginsberg reached Platinum Elite status in Northwest's program .

"Every wine lover has a story of the first sip that drew them in. More often than not, it was not a glass a highly complex and expensive Bordeaux. It was likely an unsophisticated yet tantalizing bottle that rocked their world. My gateway drug to wine way back in the day -- Boone's Farm Strawberry Hill, a saccharine-sweet pink tipple best enjoyed ice cold. And for Beijing-based wine consultant and educator Fongyee Walker, it was that first bottle of grapey Black Tower. ""You look at the American market, and the English market -- they were originally beer and spirits markets just like China. What shifted America? White Zin. What shifted England? Black Tower,"" she tells me. ""Very grapey and simple, people can understand them and like them. In China, we haven't done that."" In the West, many wine enthusiasts look back fondly to that first fruit-bomb in a glass as our introduction to the world of wine. But in China -- the world's biggest market for red wine -- consumers have gone from zero to premium Lafite in less than two decades. Tasked with making the nation's first fine wines, China's pioneering winemakers have gone for the grandeur and not the ""gateway."" ""The state-owned companies created the wine industry in China. They wanted a Lafite. Not a pink wine,"" says Simon Zhou, a Shanghai-based wine distributor and founder of Ruby Red Fine Wine. ""Many wine companies, especially those state-owned companies, are run by people not in the wine business or have little knowledge of winemaking and grape growing,"" adds Zhou. ""What they are after is to create something they can be proud and to leave some kind of a legacy."" WATCH: Inside China's wine country . Gifting . Zhou says China's ""legacy"" wines were usually dark red with heavy oak and equally heavy packaging.  At a cost of $80 to $245 a bottle, they were sold through state-owned channels for internal use by local governments. Gifting the bottles is a tradition that extends to today, even in the era of austerity amidst Beijing's crackdown on corruption. ""There's the market that buys the wine and won't be consuming the wine, and the other market which is people who buy the wine and are actual consumers. Both markets are in China,"" says Judy Chan, CEO of China's Grace Vineyard. Grace Vineyard produces some 2 million bottles a year, with retail prices going up to around $90 each. Its Chairman's Reserve and Deep Blue scored impressive ratings from wine guru Robert Parker. ""We planted in 1998, and now after 17 years of experiments, I think we can make a very decent wine,"" Chan tells me. 'Party wine' Private winemakers like Grace Vineyard are experimenting not to replicate a Lafite, but to craft its own signature style. At her vineyard in Shanxi province, I tasted one of Chan's experiments -- a flight of pre-filtered sparkling wines all crafted in China. One particular year nabbed the attention of visiting wine industry folk who hailed it the ""party wine"" of the tasting. The effervescent and friendly bubbly may very well find its way into the flutes of China's increasingly curious and open-minded wine consumers. ""I'm very lucky because I educate and work with people who are getting engaged in wine,"" says the Beijing-based Walker. ""Many moons ago... they talked about Bordeaux and some talked about Burgundy. Now I have students arrive in class and say, 'Well I've heard about Prosecco and I love drinking it!'"" Entry-level wines . After fast-forwarding from zero to Lafite in less than two decades, China's wine market is finally doing what it should have done at the beginning. It's easing back into user-friendly, entry-level wines. Wine distributor Simon Zhou is starting to see even ""big wine"" buyers going for more reasonable wines as more Chinese consumers take to wine, and actually drink what they buy. And Walker hopes they will go for the cheap stuff. ""There's a reason why McDonalds is the most popular restaurant in the world,"" she says emphatically. ""I just want to see more people drinking more wine. I don't care what wine they drink. Just as long as they're happy."" Here's to boxed wine making it big in China. Bottoms up.","This month's ""On China"" show examines the country's love affair with wine .

"Imagine being so desperate that you decide to entrust your child to a paid smuggler to help him or her cross the border into the United States. You can't know if your child will survive the dangerous journey through the desert, mountains or across the river. And you don't know if he or she will be abused or deprived of air, food or water by handlers along the way. So what would make a parent take the enormous and terrifying risks anyway, and pay huge sums of money in the process? One look at the appalling and unsafe environments these children hail from makes it clear why parents will risk so much for a better life for their children. And it is not just about the poverty. Many children, for example, haven't been able to go to school because they have been threatened by the ""mara,"" or gangs. A child will be told that if he doesn't cooperate, he or she will be killed.  The threats are not hypothetical: They are very real, and will have been underscored by the death of friends or family members in their town. These are the horrifying dynamics that make up the plight of some of these vulnerable children, some as young as 4, who have been crossing the border into the United States without a parent or guardian. When I joined the board of Kids In Need of Defense, or KIND, a nonprofit organization that seeks to provide pro-bono lawyers to represent unaccompanied minors navigating our immigration system, I didn't know that we were on the verge of a massive humanitarian crisis.  There were no front-page articles about the thousands of children crossing the border.  It wasn't the lead story on cable news. They weren't trending on Twitter. So, I had questions about how we should respond, including the moral hazard risk of encouraging ever growing numbers of children to attempt the perilous journey if we said all were welcome. But I also knew we could not treat these vulnerable children as criminals undeserving of compassion.  Which is why I decided to learn more about their plight and our nation's legal and social response. As part of this determination to find out more, I recently spent two afternoons at a local shelter in New York doing art projects with a group of boys from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Art is a universal language and a great nonverbal way to express emotions and experiences. The boys all introduced themselves, some with a shy smile and eye contact, others more warily. The caseworkers told me how grateful and polite the boys had been once they realized they were going to be treated with kindness. After arriving at Newark airport in shackles and with only the shirts on their backs, the boys received showers, food, a bed, bandages for leg and foot wounds and a change of clothes.  They still didn't know where they would be going or what would happen to them, but for the moment they were safe and appreciative.  One boy had been making paper flowers with hidden messages of gratitude in the petals.  ""God bless you for having such big hearts,"" one petal said. On my second visit, I heard about some of the family reunifications that had occurred in the interim, with boys either being picked up by or delivered to a parent whom some had not seen in years.  They described a mix of excitement, anxiety and joy, with many tears shed by the caseworkers who witnessed the reunions.  But half that group of boys was still there, and more were due to arrive the next day. The boys made collages depicting their journeys through the desert: the snakes, the coyotes, the dirty river, the truck, and the train commonly referred to as ""La Bestia"" (The Beast) because of its many dangers. They worked in silence and with intense focus.  After finishing, one boy decided to add a layer of ribbons over the journey picture and explained that they were now ""Feliz,"" which, even with my limited Spanish, I knew meant ""happy"" or ""fortunate."" The Spanish-speaking caseworker later explained that while one of the boys had fled his town because he had been constantly attacked with rocks and was sexually abused because he was gay, most had left to escape deadly gang violence in their towns. There are many aspects of this problem that may divide us, including all kinds of fears, funding limitations and the debate about the demand for illegal drugs that gives oxygen to gangs. But it is the human piece to the puzzle that might be the one best able to unite us. The fact is that if we look at our family trees, most Americans are the sons and daughters, the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of immigrants.  Each of our forebears had their own compelling reasons to make their dangerous journey to America. The cornerstone of the Statue of Liberty reminds us, in poet Emma Lazarus' words:  ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."" Even though the surge has abated somewhat, there are still tens of thousands of children in need of a safe place to call home.  Each of these vulnerable children would benefit from having a volunteer lawyer present their case so our immigration court judges can assess whether they need refugee status, asylum, or if they can be safely returned home. These children deserve our compassion and a chance at a safe future, not our kicks and turned backs. ""Our need for compassion is profound and basic,"" psychologist Martha Straus once said. ""From the beginning of time, this is what's made us human."" The boys I met in the shelter are no exception.","Carole Geithner looks at why parents smuggle children to United States .
She says pressure on children to join gangs is one reason .
Children need fair immigration hearings to decide their fate, she says ."
"(CNN) -- Ingrid Betancourt says death was her ""everyday companion"" during the six years she was a hostage of a leftist rebel group in Colombia. Recently freed FARC hostage Ingrid Betancourt tells Larry King that her captivity was ""hell."" ""I really couldn't even imagine that I was taking the road for seven years,"" she told CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""For me, I thought perhaps it could last for three months at the most. I couldn't imagine what was going to come."" Betancourt, who has French and Colombian citizenship, was campaigning for the Colombian presidency when the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia abducted her in 2002. She was rescued July 2 in an elaborately planned ruse that hoodwinked FARC captors into giving up Betancourt and 14 other hostages including three American contractors. She spoke to King Tuesday from Paris, France. ""In a way, I thought that [the rebels] knew what my struggle was,"" she said. ""I thought they were wanting perhaps something like the things I was fighting for. I was fighting for social justice. I was fighting against corruption.""  Watch Betancourt describe life in the jungle » . During the interview, Betancourt talked very slowly and appeared weary. She explained that it had been a long and arduous week. Her kidnapping was swift and it was hard for her at first to comprehend going from a free person to a prisoner, she said. Have a question for Betancourt? Ask it here . ""You are a free woman and then you become a prisoner and you receive all kinds of orders. Sit here, stand there. That's it,"" she said. ""You just, you don't have the possibility of even moving to take your bag without asking for permission."" Betancourt's campaign for Colombia's presidency was built on her promise to curb drug trafficking and FARC's methods of kidnapping innocent people. She met with FARC leaders, imploring them, ""No more kidnapping."" ""I thought that perhaps we had that common ground. I was mistaken. I didn't understand that they think completely different. ""If you don't work with them, if you're not one of the members of that club, you are an enemy,"" she added. ""I didn't know I was their enemy, but I was.""  Background: A closer look at FARC » . Betancourt said she knew her captors had orders to kill her if a rescue operation was launched. ""I lived for nearly seven years with the awareness that death was my everyday companion,"" she said. Medical care was nonexistent, she said, and even day-to-day activities were difficult. ""I was the only woman in a camp with other men,"" she said. ""Everything for me was difficult. Bathing, changing myself, I was always late for everything."" The rebels' response to her lateness: ""They scream. That was every day life."" She said after being freed she immediately noticed one thing about her life was drastically different -- she was no longer constantly scratching herself, bombarded by bugs and insects. ""You know, it was hell. It was hell for the body, it was hell for the soul, it was hell for the mind...everything was so horrible,"" she said. ""We had all kinds of pains."" ""In a week, the difference of going from this life to that life..."" Betancourt answered nearly all questions, but she would not discuss Emmanuel, the child born in captivity to her running mate, Clara Rojas -- who was captured along with her -- or whether she was sexually abused. ""I think that many things that happened in the jungle we have to leave in the jungle,"" she said. Rojas was released earlier this year. Rebels took Emmanuel from his mother about a year after his birth in 2004, delivering him to a farmer who posed as an uncle and had the boy placed in foster care in Bogota, where he remained until being reunited with his mother after her release. Betancourt also would not detail the punishment she endured after a failed escape attempt. ""Oh, that was horrible,"" she said before telling King that she was ""not ready for that."" ""I don't want to fill myself with those memories,"" she said. But the worst thing that happened to her, she said, was ""realizing that mankind, that human beings can be so horrible to other human beings."" Despite her nightmare, Betancourt said she harbors no hatred for FARC rebels. ""It's like a kind of position I took many years ago that when I was released I wouldn't take out of the jungle any kind of bitterness or any kind of eagerness to seek for revenge, anything of that,"" she said. ""And now that I'm out, I feel that I am like in another land. It seems so far and people seem so alien to me. ""I don't want to forget but I want to forgive."" Betancourt's release was greeted with an outpouring of joy in France, with politicians and media praising the woman who had become a cause celebre in the country where she grew up. She was given a clean bill of health last week despite reports that she had suffered chronic liver problems for years while in captivity. She walked on her own from a plane the day of her rescue and she remained standing for more than an hour as she recounted her rescue and answered questions from reporters. On the day of her rescue, Betancourt said, the hostages were awakened at 4 a.m. and told they had to be ready to move. An international commission, they were told, was coming by helicopter, and they were to be moved to another place in that helicopter. But when it arrived, one of the men aboard the helicopter appeared to know the rebel commanders, and the hostages lost hope. ""There was this camera and they were filming us and I was thinking, they just want to tape us so that the world sees that we are alive ... and this is going to go on and on and on for four more years, five, six more years,"" she said. In truth, the Colombian military had tricked the rebels into believing the transfer was ordered by a FARC commander. And once the hostages were taken aboard the helicopter and it took off, the soldiers overcame the rebel commander who boarded with them, Betancourt said. ""I saw the commander of the FARC, he was on the floor, he was neutralized and I heard the voice of the leader saying 'This is Colombian Army, you are free,' "" she said. ""I couldn't talk. I screamed. It was like a yell from, it was a scream that went from the bottom of my stomach,"" she said. ""And then I hugged everyone I could hug. I would have hugged anyone at that second. I hugged the one that was beside me, front -- I would kiss everybody. It was crazy. It was very intense. We were crying.""  Watch the entire remarkable interview » . Now that she is in France and has been reunited with her children and her mother, Betancourt said she is still concerned with the fate of other hostages held in the FARC-controlled jungles. ""We could be over there, we could be the ones left in the jungle,"" she said. ""We had this incredible luck to be here, so for me it's very, very important, very important to ask all the people that can help us to fight for the release of the ones who are still in the jungle."" As for her future, Betancourt said she would likely run for office again, but added that it wasn't a priority at the moment. ""I'm the same woman, but I know that deep in my heart, I've changed in many ways,"" she said. ""I have changed in the way I relate to people and the way I react to many things. I changed also my goals in life. I think that the only thing that remains, perhaps, is my desire to be there for others and to help.""","FARC kidnapped Ingrid Betancourt in 2002 as she ran for Colombian presidency .

""I started dropping prices really low just to get some cash for my bills and to eat."" At the start of March, he found himself broke and unable to pay the rent. ""The person I am renting from told me it was nothing personal, just business,"" he said. Now he is homeless, and many of his possessions have been sold. ""The only things I have left are some clothes, my laptop, which I may sell, and my cell phone,"" he said. ""The last item I sold was my 2004 class ring.

She had no car and was forced to rent one to drive to work, leaving her with little money to pay the rent at the start of March. She had to pawn her year-old $1,500 wedding ring for only $100. She said she was ""disgusted"" that she could only receive that much money for it. ""I plan to buy back my wedding ring at an exorbitant interest rate and put it on eBay to help offset my mounting legal expenses,"" she said. ""If I do well enough, I may put some additional items up for sale to make ends meet as a single woman with limited means.""

He secretly hoped it wouldn't sell, but it did -- for what he felt was a measly $250. ""I don't think any amount could satisfy me,"" he said. To this day, he deeply regrets selling the photo. ""With baseball in such turmoil these days, that autograph always reminded me of my younger days, when baseball seemed a whole lot more pure and accessible,"" he said. ""The $250 I received in return won't really help much in the big picture."" iReport.com: ""No matter how bad things may get, I still should have kept it"" Joe Renzetti of Columbus, Ohio, feels differently about selling his prized item: a full-scale replica of a stormtrooper costume from ""Star Wars"" that he made. ""The last time I wore it was in the Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena, when I marched with George Lucas,"" he said. He sold it once he got married to pay the bills. Despite the fond memories he has of his costume, he has no regrets. It sold for $700 on eBay, and combined with three other costumes that went up for sale, he made thousands of dollars.

"(CNN) -- As a kid growing up in the mid-1960s, Scott Brusaw would spend hours setting up miniature speedways on the living room carpet so that he could race his favorite slot cars up and down the electric tracks. ""I thought that if they made real roads electric, then us kids could drive,"" recalls Brusaw, who grew to become an electrical engineer. ""That thought stuck with me my entire life."" Fast forward to mid-2000s, with the debate over global warming in full swing, Brusaw's wife Julie asked him whether he could build the electric roads he'd concocted as a child out of solar panels. Brusaw initially laughed off the idea -- but not for long. With an airplane's black box in mind, the couple started mulling over the possibility of creating a solar powered super-strong case that could house sensitive electronics. They explored the idea of embedding solar cells to store energy inside the case, LEDs to illuminate the road lines and heating elements to resist ice and snow -- soon after, the concept of Solar Roadways was born. The couple's proposal calls for the traditional petroleum-based asphalt highways to be replaced with a system of structurally-engineered solar panels. These would act as a massive energy generator that could feed the grid during daytime. They would also recharge electric vehicles while moving, thus helping to reduce greenhouse emissions drastically. ""Our original intent was to help solve the climate crisis,"" says Brusaw. ""We learned that the U.S. had over 72,000 square kilometers of asphalt and concrete surfaces exposed to the sun. If we could cover them with our solar road panels, then we could produce over three times the amount of energy that we use as a nation -- that's using clean, renewable energy instead of coal."" The Idaho-based couple received their first government contract to work on the project in 2009, and have been working to perfect it ever since. Initially, they joined forces with researchers to develop a super-strong textured glass that would offer cars the traction they require. Then, they fitted LEDs road markers to avoid destroying the cells by painting highway lines over them and heating to warm the surface and keep the system working. Now, the pair is hoping to raise enough funds on crowdfunding site Indiegogo to gear up production following the successful test of its latest prototype: a Solar Roadways parking lot laid next to their electronics lab. ""They [solar panels] prevented snow and ice accumulation this past winter and are producing the expected amount of power -- the parking lot is equivalent to a 3600W solar array,"" says Brusaw, who's hoping to be ready for production later this year or early 2014. ""The panels have passed load testing for vehicles weighing up to 125 tons without breakage,"" he adds. ""Our textured surface has been traction tested and can stop a vehicle traveling 128kph on a wet surface in the required amount of distance."" Brusaw says solar road panels could theoretically be laid anywhere -- from motorways and parking lots to pavements and playgrounds. He believes that such a prospect could transform the existing motorway infrastructure, prevent accidents and ultimately help save the planet from an environmental disaster. ""In the U.S., roughly half of greenhouse gases are generated by burning fossil fuels to create electricity,"" he says. ""Another 25% comes out of our tailpipes,"" adds Brusaw. ""By replacing coal with solar and making electric vehicles practical -- which could lead to the end of internal combustion engines -- we could theoretically cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 75%.

"The foursome of chirpy college students warmed up in the River Ridge course tee box, focusing on loosening their legs before taking their first shot on a par-four hole. Cody Seybold ran toward his ball, almost ""Happy Gilmore"" style. Then there was that unmistakable ""thump"" and a well-struck soccer ball arced toward the first green and its 21-inch diameter hole. Welcome to the wonderful world of FootGolf, a soccer-golf hybrid played on more than 257 courses in the United States, according to the FootGolf League. How FootGolf got started . ""It's the same structure as golf, except you are playing with your feet,"" said player Connor Bush, wearing  soccer cleats and baggy shorts. ""You still have to include strategy.  What kind of green are you playing on? Are you going to drive? Are you going to chip?"" he said. Because soccer balls don't travel as far as golf balls, the FootGolf holes are shorter, averaging 157 yards on the Oxnard, California, course. While the weekday, 18-hole green fee for traditional golf at River Ridge is $38, the fee for its ball-booting cousin is much less. The FootGolf green fee at River Ridge is $10 for adults and $5 for children. A soccer ball runs between $15 and $30, and no tees or gloves are needed. ""It's really not expensive -- great when you are on the college budget,"" FootGolfer Lloyd Mueller said while juggling his soccer ball between shots. ""It's a great way to spend 2½ hours with your friends."" At River Ridge, the FootGolf holes run perpendicular to and weave between regular golf holes, so both traditional and FootGolfers play at the same time. Frank Victor, a traditional golfer in pants and collared shirt, said the FootGolfers can be a bit of a problem when unsupervised. ""Some are rolling around the sand traps, doing cartwheels, whatever they want,"" Victor said. Footgolfer Alex Ondrejko jumped up and clicked his heels like a merry leprechaun after kicking in a shot from the sand trap to make birdie. ""Chipping out (of sand) you are not allowed a walk-up approach,"" Ondrejko explained. ""You just take one step and knock it out."" When word came that FootGolf might soon invade the River Ridge golf course, Susan Sipes, the head professional, was uncomfortable. ""I thought it was a really crazy idea,"" Sipes said.  ""Traditional golfers have had a hard time accepting this new course on their golf course. But it's kind of like when the skiers had to take on the snowboarders."" The FootGolfers represent a toehold on a new revenue opportunity in the shrinking golf business. There has been a net reduction of 643 golf courses in the United States since 2006 because of closures, according to the National Golf Foundation. Three reasons golf is on the decline . River Ridge said that in peak summer playing months, traditional golfers accounted for an average of almost 10,000 rounds of golf and FootGolfers averaged almost 900 rounds. ""At first, a lot of other golf courses, I'd hear them kind of teasing me about having FootGolf,"" Sipes said.  ""Now they are all asking me about it.  How do they get it?  It's growing like wildfire."" It's an inferno with its own rules and regulations, laws and language. As Seybold's crushed first-tee shot landed and headed toward what he called the ""sidewalk,"" he held his head and grunted. ""You mean cart path,"" his fellow players corrected. The soccer ball rolled on the pavement hopelessly away from the hole, dooming Seybold to a double bogie. That's two over par, an agonizing score to both the club swingers and the new era kickers at River Ridge.","FootGolf, a soccer-golf hybrid, is being played on hundreds of courses across the U.S.
It is like golf, except you use your feet and a soccer ball .
FootGolf could bring new revenue to courses as the golf business declines ."
"(CNN) -- Kay Hagan erupted in anger Thursday over a television ad from Sen. Elizabeth Dole suggesting Hagan is ""godless."" ""I think Elizabeth Dole has just gone to the lowest of the lows,"" Hagan said of the ad during an appearance on a talk show on WPTF-AM in Raleigh, North Carolina. ""This is an attack on my Christian faith."" Hagan, who described herself as a Sunday school teacher and an elder at a Presbyterian church in Greensboro, North Carolina, urged Dole to ""pull this kind of despicable ad."" Hagan, who is challenging Dole's re-election bid, filed an application in a Wake County, North Carolina, court Thursday, seeking permission to file a complaint within 20 days, after the election is over. ""The advertisement purposely misstates facts about the plaintiff,"" said the three-page application, which was filed in District Superior Court. In the 30-second ad, a narrator says that a leader of the Godless Americans Political Action Committee recently held a ""secret fundraiser"" for Hagan. The ad then shows members of the group, which promotes rights for atheists and the separation of church and state, declaring that neither God nor Jesus exists. ""Godless Americans and Kay Hagan,"" the ad continues. ""She hid from cameras. Took 'Godless' money. What did Kay Hagan promise in return?"" The ad ends with a picture of Hagan and a voice that sounds like hers declaring, ""There is no God."" But the application said Hagan never made that statement or accepted money from the group. Lawyers representing Dole and her campaign defended the ad Thursday as ""100 percent factually accurate and truthful."" The campaign for the GOP incumbent said it based its claims on Hagan's attendance at a fundraiser in the home of a GAPAC adviser. ""Kay Hagan attended a fundraiser event in Massachusetts in September held in the home of two anti-religion activists, Wendy Kaminer and her lawyer husband, Woody Kaplan,"" Dole's attorneys said in a letter to Hagan's lawyer. They described Kaplan as a founder and advisory board member of the GAPAC. The letter said Kaplan and Kaminer were advisory board members of The Secular Coalition for America, which it described as ""the national lobby for atheists, humanists, freethinkers and other nontheistic Americans with the unique mission of protecting their civil rights."" The lawyers also said Kaplan gave $2,300 to Hagan's campaign. ""This is politics of the worst kind, and I know it has been rejected by North Carolinians at every level,"" said Hagan. Polls suggest Hagan -- a Democratic state senator from Greensboro who began the race at a major financial disadvantage to Dole -- is slightly ahead of the incumbent.","Hagan calls ad suggesting she is ""godless"" an ""attack on my Christian faith""

"Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas signed a bid on Wednesday to join the International Criminal Court. The move comes one day after the U.N. Security Council rejected a resolution calling for Palestinian statehood by 2017, and for Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and East Jerusalem. It sets the stage for the Palestinian Authority to possibly pursue war crime complaints against Israel. ""This is another step forward. Legally, it gives anyone the opportunity to raise claims to the ICC and for the ICC to do work here. We are opening a door,"" said Xavier Abu Eid, spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organization. ""It is not, necessarily, that the state of Palestine will raise a claim against Israel, but that basically now, anyone can. If any events take place here, then they can do work here, and likewise anyone -- from individuals, NGOs, churches, etc. -- can raise claims. It's important to remember that settlements are on occupied Palestinian lands and are illegal,"" he said. The U.S. State Department said it was ""deeply troubled"" by the development, calling it an ""escalatory step."" ""Today's action is entirely counterproductive and does nothing to further the aspirations of the Palestinian people for a sovereign and independent state. It badly damages the atmosphere with the very people with whom they ultimately need to make peace,"" the State Department said. ""While we are under no illusions regarding the difficult road of negotiations, direct negotiations are ultimately the only realistic path for achieving the aspirations of both peoples.

"The rat-a-tat of a hundred green sewing machines.  The hypnotic hum of spools spinning brightly colored threads. The hiss of a thousand clothing irons. Set aside for a moment what you think you know about the garment factories in Bangladesh: grimy, sweaty, children sitting in dimly lit, sweltering rooms sewing shirts you buy at your box store for $12. Here at Lakhsmi Sweaters, the only children are in its in-house day care. At this factory in Gazipur, on the outskirts of the capital Dhaka, workers sit in long, orderly rows, under bright neon lights, with fans blasting full speed. They get hourlong lunch breaks and free medicine. Medical checkups are mandatory, and the factory employs a full-time doctor. New mothers receive maternity leave -- and pay. ""The atmosphere should always be healthy, friendly and livable. We don't need buyers to tell us that,"" said Safina Rahman, director of Lakhsmi and one of just a handful of female owners in what is predominantly a male-run industry. ""This is my duty. This is how I'd want my children to grow."" But in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster when Bangladesh's extremely lucrative garment business has come under increased international scrutiny, Rahman and her workers worry about the effect the backlash will have on them. Retailers in the West are rethinking their partnerships as customers threaten to shop elsewhere. United Students Against Sweatshops, a labor rights group, is planning protests against clothiers it believes aren't committed to strict standards in Bangladesh. And the Obama administration may take away the tax breaks Bangladesh get for goods that the United States imports. The seamstress in the rubble . All of which would have devastating consequences for Bangladesh. The garment industry has been a boon for this South Asian nation of 160 million. It pumps $20 billion a year into the economy. In a country where 31% of the population lives below the poverty line, the industry has been a salvation for 4 million people working in more than 4,500 factories. ""More than 2 million people are working in this trade; maybe more,"" Rahman said. ""If one (worker) has four people to look after in the family, that's almost 8 million people who are living off this trade."" ""If we are bloodsuckers, who is contributing to this economy?"" she added. ""It's become a big-time challenge for us. People like us."" Contented workers . Poppy Begum is a stitcher here, one of 2,000 workers spread across four floors.  She works nine-hour days, six days a week, helping create sweaters and other knitwear bound for Europe, Canada and Australia. In an industry where the turnover is extremely high, many of the workers such as Begum have been here for almost a decade. It's easy to see why: The starting wage is $51 a month -- higher than the industry average of $35. They are trained in first aid. And they appoint a representative who airs their grievances to management. In other words, the accusations that bedevil the industry now -- safety issues, workers rights, low pay -- are addressed here. ""We get paid on time. If Friday is a holiday, we get paid a day earlier,"" Begum said. We spoke to several workers at Lakhsmi and asked them to speak freely about their conditions. They seemed content. It turns out that medium-sized factories such as this aren't the ones creating the headlines. They are tailored for the task, they meet safety standards and they pass inspections. The problem children are the many, many factories that have mushroomed in and around Dhaka that rent space in facilities where they have no business being: shopping malls or office buildings that aren't equipped to handle the heavy machinery the trade requires. Opinion: Stop cashing in on Bangladeshi workers . Fly-by-night operations . Until now, the government has turned a blind eye to the problem. After all, the factories were boosting employment -- even if they were doing so in spaces crammed to the hilt with workers with zero safety regulations. Since 2005, almost 2,000 garment workers have been killed in factory fires and structure collapse. And all of them have been at such small, unregulated factories. These facilities don't directly deal with Western clothiers. When a company in the United States places an order, it does so with a large or a medium-sized factory that most likely lives up to the company's standards for a decent wage and working conditions. But, just like a contractor working on your home will farm out parts of the job to others, these factories sometimes do the same -- to smaller, fly-by-night operations. And with business booming, with a greater demand for goods and with the need to keep costs down so the consumers in the West can continue to purchase cheap shirts, such passing-of-the-buck has become more commonplace. Changes afoot? But the Rana Plaza disaster may change all that. The shopping mall in the Dhaka suburb of Savar was built on swampland, with the owner adding four more floors to what was once a five-story structure, officials said. It housed five garment factories and generators on the fourth floor to keep them buzzing. It collapsed April 24, killing more than 1,100 and ranking as the deadliest industrial disaster in the country. The outrage over the disaster reached such a fever pitch that the government said it will form a committee to raise the minimum wage of garment workers. The Cabinet also approved the draft of a law that will allow workers to unionize and force factories to offer life insurance. For its part, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturing and Export Association said it too is taking additional steps. Until now, it had standards for workplace safety but not for the structural safety of a building. ""Before this Rana Plaza incident, BGMEA did not have the technical know-how people to check the structural design. We didn't have any civil engineers,"" said Reza Bin Mahmood, vice president with the association. Those inspections have now begun. But with more than 4,500 factories, the task is daunting. ""It's not an easy job. And we cannot finish it by overnight,"" he said, urging that the factories be improved and updated with money from retailers. Bangladesh vs. U.S.: How much does it cost to make a denim shirt? Spurred to action . Some international retailers are doing just that. More than a dozen European clothiers signed on to a plan to help prevent fire and building collapses in Bangladesh. The five-year plan calls for independent safety inspections and for companies to publicly report the findings. It also requires retailers to help finance fire safety and building improvements in factories with which they work. Companies who sign on will have to terminate business with any factory that refuses to make necessary safety upgrades. But many U.S. retailers, including Wal-Mart, have not signed on. Wal-Mart said it will perform its own inspections and provide every worker with fire safety. Over at Lakhsmi, the changes for the industry are welcome ones. Here, workers are assigned as fire wardens and extinguishers hang on the walls on each floor. ""At times, I feel ashamed to be in this trade,"" Rahman, the factory owner, said. ""Not for me but (because) somebody from this trade has done this irresponsible thing and took so many lives. ""This is just not done. It should not be repeated again.""

"Rival Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah announced Wednesday they've agreed to reconcile -- a development that could see the Palestinian territories under a unified leadership for the first time in years. The sides, wrapping up two days of talks in Hamas-run Gaza, announced they will begin discussions to form a unity government. An interim government could be finalized in the next five weeks, with elections possible by early 2015, Fatah spokesman Fayez Abu Eitta said. Wednesday's announcement comes amid a deterioration of U.S.-brokered peace talks between the Palestinian Authority and Israel -- talks that Hamas, a militant Islamic group that hasn't recognized Israel, opposed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted strongly to the announcement. Israel and several other countries consider Hamas to be a terrorist organization. ""(Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas) needs to choose between peace with Israel and an agreement with Hamas,"" Netanyahu said in a statement released Wednesday by his media adviser. ""... Whoever chooses Hamas does not not want peace."" After the reconciliation was announced, Netanyahu's office said Israel canceled peace negotiations that were scheduled to take place Wednesday night. Israel and the Palestinian Authority face an April 29 deadline to agree on a framework for a comprehensive peace treaty, but the sides appear far apart. The Hamas-Fatah deal also came on an afternoon that an Israeli airstrike in the northern Gaza strip injured 12 people, including children and teenagers, according to Ashraf Al Qidra, a spokesman for the health ministry in Gaza. Al Qidra said it was a drone strike. The Israeli military said it conducted an airstrike in a counter-terror operation, but provided no other details. Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian lawmaker involved in the Hamas-Fatah talks, hailed what he called the ""end to the division between the Palestinian people."" ""Palestinians are in a unified camp, and Israel cannot claim that Palestinians cannot negotiate on behalf of all Palestinians,"" Barghouti told CNN on Wednesday. The Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank have been run separately for seven years. The split began taking shape in 2006 when Hamas, participating in Palestinian polls for the first time, won a majority in the Palestinian parliament. The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority formed a coalition government with Hamas that year, with Abbas retaining the presidency and Hamas member Ismail Haniya becoming prime minister. But when Abbas dissolved the government in 2007, Hamas seized control of Gaza, and Haniya became Gaza's de facto political leader. The West for years has shown support to Fatah and warned it not to join hands with militant Hamas, which several countries have deemed a terrorist organization. Reconciliation talks started Tuesday evening, after Abbas sent a Fatah delegation to meet with Hamas representatives in Gaza. It wasn't immediately clear who would lead, though Abbas, whose Fatah group runs the West Bank, is a possibility for premier, Abu Eitta said.","Israeli airstrike injured 12 in northern Gaza strip, Gaza health ministry says .

"Another flight, another woman goes into labor. Delta Air Lines Flight 2566 from San Francisco to Minneapolis diverted to Salt Lake City on Wednesday when a pregnant passenger went into labor during the flight. A pediatrician on board helped the passenger until the flight landed at about 9:45 a.m., according to CNN affiliate KUTV. The passenger was taken by the local fire department to the University of Utah Hospital, where she gave birth to a baby boy. Both the mother and baby are in good condition, the hospital said. ""I was getting contractions about every minute almost immediately, which was really scary ...""  mother Allison Peery told CNN affiliate KTVX on Thursday. The pediatrician was a big help, she said, as were the flight attendants. ""They were great, like helping me breathe.  Because we hadn't done our classes yet, so we were really kind of out of our element,"" Peery said of her and her husband, Zach. ""There were about four (other people) there all breathing with me."" The 4-pound, 6-ounce child, named Karl William Peery, is fine. ""He's doing so well and he's so cute,"" said Allison Peery, whose family lives in Wisconsin. It's not the first time this month that a pregnant passenger has diverted a flight. On December 9, a baby was born on Southwest Airlines Flight 623 shortly after its 6:24 a.m. takeoff. The aircraft departed from San Francisco bound for Phoenix, but diverted to Los Angeles International Airport at about 7:30 a.m. A nurse and doctor on board assisted with the delivery. ""It was amazing,"" a flight attendant said in a video posted on the airline's website. ""All the passengers were awesome. Everybody was clapping."" The plane was met by a Los Angeles Fire Department emergency response team upon landing, according to LAX spokeswoman Katherine Alvarado. After a two-and-a-half hour delay, the 111 other passengers aboard Flight 623 were able to continue their journey to Phoenix aboard a new aircraft. Airline restrictions for pregnant passengers vary. Delta doesn't restrict the travel of pregnant passengers, but the airline does offer guidance about change fees on its website. ""Ticket change fees and penalties cannot be waived for pregnancy."" For any passenger traveling after her eighth month, ""it's a good idea to check with your doctor to be sure travel is not restricted."" Southwest advises that pregnant women consult with their doctors before traveling by air, and the airline recommends not traveling after the 38th week of pregnancy. Barring medical complications, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says that pregnant women can fly safely just like the general population. However, ""air travel is not recommended at any time during pregnancy for women who have medical or obstetric conditions that may be exacerbated by flight or that could require emergency care.""

"Italian authorities responded late Thursday to a ship without any crew that was carrying 450 migrants, that country's coast guard said. It's the second time this week Italy's coast guard has rescued such a vessel. ""Because of the difficult weather conditions, the ship can only be reached by air. From what we know, the ship, which flies the flag of Sierra Leone, would have hundreds of migrants on board,"" the Italian air force said in a statement. It said the cargo ship Ezadeen was in at a standstill because of a blackout. The migrants launched an SOS, said Floriana Segreto, a spokeswoman for the Italian coast guard. Women and children are thought to be on the ship. By early Friday morning, the vessel remained at a standstill 58 miles (93 kilometers) off the coast of the city of Crotone in the Ionian Sea, the coast guard said, where rescuers were trying to restart the boat's engines. On Wednesday, a freighter carrying 768 people, most believed to be migrants from war-torn Syria, docked safely in the southern port of Gallipoli after the coast guard seized control. The Italian coast guard told CNN a ""real disaster"" was avoided when authorities boarded the Blue Sky M after the crew apparently jumped ship. Italian coast guard commander Filippo Marini said the vessel was cruising on autopilot toward the rocky Italian coast at 6 nautical miles per hour. The course of the vessel was reversed to avoid a collision with the rocks. The coast guard said a collision would not only have led to the deaths of passengers but would also have created an environmental disaster.","Rescuers are trying to restart the boat's engines, the coast guard says .

"Nigeria and four neighboring countries will share intelligence and border surveillance in the hunt for more than 200 Nigerian girls still held by Boko Haram, and Western nations will provide technical expertise and training to the new regional African effort against the extreme Islamists. The plan was announced Saturday at the conclusion of a security summit in Paris hosted by French President François Hollande. Hollande described Boko Haram as now a bigger terror threat than first portrayed -- beyond Nigeria and even Africa. ""Boko Haram is an organization that is linked to terrorism in Africa and whose will is to destabilize the north of Nigeria, certainly, and all the neighboring countries of Nigeria and beyond that region,"" he said. Cameroon President Paul Biya was more forceful in describing how partnering countries will ""take stronger measures to eradicate"" the extremist Islamist group. ""We're here to declare war on Boko Haram,"" Biya said. As the summit took place Saturday, reports emerged about the latest apparent Boko Haram attack, this one in Cameroon. Hollande said one Cameroonian soldier was killed in the Friday night attack against Chinese nationals in northern Cameroon, which is known as a stronghold for the Islamic extremists. Ten Chinese nationals are missing after the attack, a Chinese official said Saturday. One injured person was being treated by a Chinese medical team in the Chadian capital of N'Djamena, said Lu Quinjiang, first counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Yaounde, Cameroon's capital. Nigerian military . France ""will not intervene"" militarily in Nigeria because Nigeria ""has military forces that are available and efficient,"" Hollande said during an interview with France 24 that aired late Saturday. The Nigerian military suffered an embarrassing setback in April when it retracted a report that nearly all the kidnapped girls were released. In fact, the girls, taken from a boarding school in Chibok, were still missing. Nigeria now has 20,000 troops, plus aircraft and intelligence sources, in parts of its nation where Boko Haram is active, said President Goodluck Jonathan. ""Boko Haram is no longer a local terror group,"" Jonathan said. ""It is clearly operating as an al Qaeda operation"" in central Africa, he said. ""The major challenge that we have faced in our search and rescue operation so far has been the deluge of misinformation about the whereabouts of the girls and the circumstances of their disappearance,"" the President added. Boko Haram's guerrilla campaign has claimed 12,000 lives, with 8,000 people injured or maimed since 2009, Jonathan said. Nigeria will coordinate patrols, pool intelligence and exchange weapons and human trafficking information with Benin, Cameroon, Chad and Niger, according to the agreement reached at the summit. France, the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union ""will coordinate their support for this regional cooperation"" through technical expertise, training programs and support for border-area management programs, a summit statement said. The participants agreed that the United Kingdom will host a follow-up meeting next month to review the action plan. In the meantime, participants committed to accelerating international sanctions against Boko Haram and its leaders through the United Nations. Boko Haram translates as ""Western education is a sin"" in the Hausa language. The militant group says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Boko Haram's attacks have intensified in recent years. The summit . The Nigerian President joined Saturday's summit of African presidents and U.S., UK and EU representatives on the growing threat from Boko Haram as American officials expressed concerns about his military's ability to rescue hundreds of schoolgirls abducted last month. The terror group abducted an estimated 276 girls on April 14 from a boarding school in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 girls are still missing. Nigerians have accused their government of not acting swiftly or efficiently enough to protect the girls seized in the dead of night. And the criticism shows no signs of abating, even from allies who've pledged to help in the rescue mission. The United States, China and Britain are among a handful of nations providing advice. The United States is using drones and manned surveillance aircraft in the search, but has said Nigeria is reluctant to use the information provided. ""The division in the north that mainly is engaging with Boko Haram, the 7th Division, has recently shown signs of real fear,"" said Alice Friend, African Affairs director for the Department of Defense. ""They do not have the capabilities, the training or the equipment that Boko Haram does, and Boko Haram is exceptionally brutal and indiscriminate in their attacks."" ""I would say an even greater concern is the incapacity of the Nigerian military and the Nigerian government's failure to provide leadership to the military,"" Friend said Thursday at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. For now, the United States is not sharing raw intelligence from its surveillance aircraft with Nigeria's armed forces because the countries have not established the intelligence-sharing protocols and safeguards needed for such an agreement, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said Wednesday. There's also concern about how the information will be used by a military that's been accused of human rights violations itself. ""We have sought assurances from them... that they will use any information that we pass to them from this (intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance) support in a manner consistent with international humanitarian and human rights law,"" Friend explained. Nigeria has been accused of not doing enough to protect the girls abducted from a militant hotbed that was already under a state of emergency. But a spokesman for the military defended the nation's response. ""Borno State is under a state of emergency, over 90,000 square kilometers,"" said Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade. ""Are you saying we should deploy ... soldiers in over 90,000 kilometers -- one soldier per kilometer? You can imagine that expense for one of the states under a state of emergency.""","France will not intervene militarily in Nigeria, president says .

But presidential election cycles are ""almost unique,"" said David Oman, a former Iowa GOP co-chairman and the chief of staff to two of the state's Republican governors. The 2016 cycle, Oman said, ""is well underway. It's almost all under the radar."" Many contenders visited Iowa to campaign for Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst in 2014 -- and did some outreach and organizing while they were there, he said. ""There are a lot of phone calls that are being made among Iowa activists, and certainly into the state -- some from the candidates or would-be candidates, and others from people who are helping them,"" he said. ""We've been in the somewhat invisible primary -- the activist organizing stage, etc., for some time now,"" said Terry Shumaker, a New Hampshire Democrat who co-chaired Bill Clinton's campaigns and is backing Hillary Clinton in 2016. Here's a look at some of the key events and dates on 2015's calendar: . Jan. 15: An unofficial Clinton decision. That's the date pro-Clinton aides and confidants have long said that if she's not running, she'll make that clear -- at least privately. Otherwise, Democrats could be in a tough position, with the field effectively frozen and no clear alternative emerging in the early polls. Outside infrastructure like the group Ready for Hillary are also making plans into 2015, but no other candidate has any comparable backing. Jan. 23-24: The Rubio confab. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio will host his fourth annual ""Team Marco"" gathering at the Delano Hotel on Miami's South Beach -- this time, with a huge decision to make: Is he running for president? The meeting will give Rubio a chance to take stock of how deeply former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's own steps into the race will cut into the senator's home-state donor base -- including right-leaning Cuban-Americans who could have been angered by President Barack Obama's move to ease tensions with the communist country. It's also crucial in putting together the infrastructure Rubio would need for a national campaign. Jan. 24: Iowa Freedom Summit. The inaugural event organized by Rep. Steve King and the conservative group Citizens United will feature at least eight prospective GOP presidential candidates who will speak with grassroots activists from across the state. On the guest list so far: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, businessman Ben Carson and businesswoman Carly Fiorina, and Donald Trump. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has said he might attend, as well. Feb. 25-28: CPAC. GOP presidential hopefuls will flock to the annual Conservative Political Action Conference -- known as just ""CPAC"" -- to court their party's ideological grassroots. The conference has also offered a window into the debates riling conservatives. In 2011, the participation of the pro-gay rights group GOProud and the invitation of then-Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, who had called for a ""truce"" on social issues, sparked boycotts from conservatives who are focused on just those policies. The conference has also been criticized for taking a libertarian turn, with Texas Rep. Ron Paul winning its 2010 and 2011 straw polls. It could be a particularly important barometer for Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who won the 2014 CPAC straw poll and has since sought to increase Republicans' outreach to minority voters and smooth over his divisions with the GOP establishment. March 9-13: Selma march's 50th anniversary. Commemorating the Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march, and the police beatings of protesters it included, has long drawn presidents and White House hopefuls to Alabama. This year's 50th anniversary will be no different. March 19: Clinton's last scheduled paid speech. The lone heavyweight in the Democratic presidential field is scheduled to deliver a paid speech to the American Camp Association on March 19 -- the last one currently on her calendar. The date itself isn't all that meaningful: Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign plans are unlikely to be stalled by the American Camp Association. She could call off the event, or send Bill Clinton instead. Or, she could still schedule more paid speeches, especially if she doesn't want to enter the race until the spring. Still, those looking for signs of Clinton's plans will watch to see whether the current timing of her last paid speech moves in either direction. Early August: Iowa State Fair. It's a must-visit for presidential candidates looking to mix and mingle with a broad swath of voters. The Des Moines Register, Iowa's most important newspaper, will have what Oman called a ""massive presence"" at the state fair -- including the Register Political Soapbox, where candidates will make appearances, deliver stump speeches and take questions. The 11-day fair will see visits from a candidate a day, and sometimes more. August: Ames Straw Poll. For a non-binding gut check of conservatives, this summer-before-the-caucuses tradition gets a lot of attention. Thousands of Iowans -- as well as candidates, political operatives and journalists -- have historically descended on the Iowa State University campus, where they're courted by campaigns that see the event as an early test of their organizational strength in the state that kicks off the nominating process. However, the straw poll hasn't predicted much in recent years. In 2011, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann won, with Texas Rep. Ron Paul landing a close second -- though both had faded by the time the elections rolled around. In 2007, Mitt Romney won the straw poll, but former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee won the actual Iowa caucuses. There's also the question of whether the straw poll will continue in its previous form. Some conservative groups have pushed to eliminate it, or at least make major changes. Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad commented in 2012 that the straw poll has ""outlived its usefulness."" Still, Iowa GOP operatives say it'll likely take place in some form in 2015. The straw poll was held in early August 2011. The date hasn't yet been set for 2015, but it'd likely come shortly after the state fair. Fall: State party dinners. Most campaigns' top donors will come from out of the early-voting states, but they'll need as much of the local party infrastructure in their corners as possible. In Iowa, for example, Republicans will flock to the state GOP's fall dinner. ""That's where the activists and donors show up all at one time. By that time you better have your campaign rolling and your organization well underway,"" Oman said. In New Hampshire, the state Democratic Party's annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner and its 100 Club dinner would be big opportunities for candidates not named Hillary Clinton. ""If you're less well known than Hillary Clinton, scoring a speaking engagement at one of those two big dinners, which are populated by activists, would be a big deal for anybody,"" Shumaker said. Iowa's 99 counties and New Hampshire's 10 counties will also offer candidates lower-profile speaking opportunities. Late 2015: The debates. National Republicans have tried to winnow what during the 2012 election cycle seemed like an unending string of debates. But the debates will still happen, they'll be televised nationally, and they'll present candidates with opportunities to grab media attention -- for better or, as Texas Gov. Rick Perry learned when he forgot the name of the third federal agency he wanted to abolish during one debate, for worse. All year: Politics & Eggs. The New England Council and the New Hampshire Institute of Politics & Political Library at Saint Anselm College co-host these regular Granite State events. Candidates typically speak for about 15 minutes, and then take questions. Dates for 2015 appearances haven't yet been announced -- but a spate of presidential contenders are all but certain to be added to the schedule in the coming months. ""That is a real tradition. Virtually everybody that has run for president has spoken at one or more of those over the years,"" Shumaker said. ""My guess is that will really heat up after the new year, and that's a great way to meet a crowd that's not a typical political crowd -- it's bipartisan, heavy on business people and education and non-profit types and students.""","The coming year will be jam-packed with can't-miss events for 2016 presidential hopefuls .
The key events include activists' conventions, state party dinners and even state fairs .

"(CNN) -- Comic Tracy Morgan returned to Nashville on Tuesday, and vowed to change his stand up comedy act to ""heal people, not hurt."" Morgan, who went on an onstage anti-gay rant there three weeks earlier, delivered a personal apology to ""the people at the show for bumming them out."" ""I didn't know. I didn't mean it,"" Morgan said. Morgan is a star of the hit NBC sitcom ""30 Rock"" and is a ""Saturday Night Live"" veteran. Details of his anti-gay remarks emerged after an audience member Kevin Rogers, who is gay, posted them on a Facebook blog. Rogers' blog was picked up by Jezebel magazine, triggering a controversy that led to Morgan's contrition. Morgan agreed to fly back to Nashville this week to meet with members of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) to deliver a face-to-face apology to people who were in the Ryman Auditorium and to work with the Tennessee Equality Project, GLAAD said. ""I don't have a hateful bone in my body,"" Morgan said. ""I don't believe anyone should be bullied or made to feel bad about who they are."" Roger wrote in his blog post that Morgan ""mentioned that gay was something kids learn from the media and programming, and that bullied kids should just bust some ass and beat those other little f**kers that bully them, not whine about it."" Morgan said that if his own son told him he was gay, he would ""pull out a knife and stab"" him, Rogers wrote. ""The sad thing is that none of this rant was a joke,"" Rogers wrote. ""His entire demeanor changed during that portion of the night. He was truly filled with some hate towards us."" Rogers sat next to Morgan Tuesday morning as he publicly apologized. ""He shared his genuine concern with his words and has promised me that his actions going forward are going to be positive and supportive of my community,"" Rogers said. ""I greatly appreciate what he said and really appreciate him taking time out to come back and try and right what I believe to be just a huge mistake."" Morgan said the controversy has given him the ""opportunity to change my message onstage."" ""In my heart, I really don't care who you love, same sex or not, as long as you have the ability to love, that's the important thing here,"" he said. Stand up comedy should ""heal people, not hurt,"" he said. ""I hurt people with this, so from the bottom of my heart I apologize to everybody who I offended with my words on stage,"" he said. Morgan has also agreed to record a public service announcement for GLAAD's upcoming ""Amplify Your Voice"" campaign, the group said.

"Inspiration can come from unlikely places. Brian Flemming found the will to change his life in a drawing game. Flemming was addicted to alcohol, severely morbidly obese and full of self-pity when he met Jackie Eastham through a random match on Draw Something, the Pictionary-like mobile game. It was the spring of 2012. Most nights Flemming drank around a fifth of vodka mixed with a liter of soda while he zoned out in front of the TV. The last time he had been weighed, on a special scale at the hospital, he was 625 pounds. Eastham lived in England and was 20 years Flemming's senior. At first, the players shared casual banter between rounds. Their friendship eventually moved to Facebook, where they began to confide in each other. Flemming was at a low point. Besides being an alcoholic and morbidly obese, he was pre-diabetic and had a recurring cellulitis infection. Eastham was the first person he was totally honest with -- no one in his life knew about the drinking. He expected sympathy. But she wasn't having it. ""She said there were people struggling for their lives and then there's you -- you have all these opportunities and you're throwing it all away,"" said Flemming, 32, now a business relations representative and part-time music teacher in Canton, Michigan. It was personal for Eastham, who lives with myotonic dystrophy, an inherited type of muscular dystrophy that causes progressive muscle weakness and can affect various systems and organs. Her symptoms have been relatively mild so far, but she never takes her health for granted. ""I just thought bloody hell, you're a guy who's 30 ... and you're wasting your life,"" she said, remembering how she felt as the recipient of his drunken, maudlin messages. ""My future is a lot gloomier. I'm trying to make the brightest future I can, and ... you're dragging yourself down."" It was the wake-up call Flemming needed. He'd show her he could change. That day -- October 13, 2012 -- he vowed to quit drinking cold turkey. That was the first step toward what would become a remarkable transformation. Less than two years later, Flemming has lost more than 380 pounds from his 6 foot 2 frame. He went from a size 60 waist to a size 38. The days after he gave up alcohol were grueling, he said. He had cold sweats, shaky hands and couldn't sleep. He kept busy to distract himself and found comfort in daily chats with Eastham. They progressed from Facebook to Skype video chats, where Eastham said she was initially shocked by his size. The weight began to fall off. Without the extra calories from alcohol, Flemming lost 100 pounds in a couple months. That was motivation enough to make other changes. He had been consuming upwards of 7,000 calories a day, according to an app he used to record his meals. He stopped eating fast food and cut out sugar and red meat. Now, a typical day for Flemming starts with a few ounces of low or no-sodium turkey breast, a serving of dry cereal, a bowl of non-fat Greek yogurt with artificial sweetener and a glass of low-sodium vegetable juice. For lunch and dinner, he often eats chicken and vegetables with rice. And every Friday night, he treats himself to a scoop of ice cream. Now that he's doing more exercise, he's not as strict about his diet. Adding in physical activity was a gradual process. Flemming says he began by walking in place in his parents' basement for five minutes a day every morning, adding minutes as he felt ready. When he was finally comfortable to exercise outside, he only went when it was dark and the neighbors couldn't see him. Eastham kept him company on Skype sometimes while he walked. ""She was a huge motivation. She'd try to push me to walk a little further each time,"" he said. In July 2013, he walked his first half-marathon. Shortly after that he took up cycling, and then running, completing his third 5-kilometer run on his birthday a few weeks ago. He used running and calorie tracker apps to stay accountable and started seeing a psychotherapist to manage his depression and make sure he was approaching his weight loss in a healthy way. upwave: Try it now! Track your progress with TrackIt . Eastham said she encouraged it, not wanting him to be dependent on their friendship to stay sober and motivated. Flemming is now down to 234 pounds, with about 30 pounds of excess skin around his waist. He's trying to save the money for surgery to have it removed. This past December, he went to Europe and finally met Eastham in person, where he was able to climb the Eiffel Tower after barely being able to walk up a flight of stairs less than two years earlier. They continue to talk every day -- and are still playing Draw Something. Flemming now hopes to go back to school to become a therapist specializing in weight loss, depression and anxiety. ""Jackie is the best thing that's ever happened to me. I feel that she saved my life, even though she would never take credit,"" Flemming wrote in a blog post. ""Brian is so inspiring,"" Eastham said. ""I hope he gets what he wants out of life."" Visit Brian Flemming's Facebook group to follow his journey. He invites readers to share their own stories about weight loss, addiction and eating disorders there.","Brian Flemming weighed 625 pounds .

"As the former director of communications at the White House, crisis management guru Olivia Pope whips her clients into shape. And she looks good while doing it. So good, in fact, that there are countless blogs dedicated to the ""Scandal"" character's chic, business casual attire. Using dainty jewelry, a pastel color palette and perfectly tailored separates, costume designer Lyn Paolo said her plan for Olivia, played by actress Kerry Washington, was to ""create a vision of femininity, but still show strength."" Olivia's wardrobe will look more or less the same when the ABC series' second season premieres on September 27, Paolo said. But possibly not for long. ""What we're doing with (Olivia) works, and it's a theme that we'll stay with; however, because of things I can't tell you, we may change slightly,"" she teased. ""There are certain tonal things that I'm doing at the moment to express the differences in (the characters') lives. Specifically with the Quinn (Katie Lowes) character and Huck (Guillermo Díaz) character."" Whether Quinn's secret identity will influence her wardrobe remains to be seen. And who knows what's in store for Huck, a former CIA operative with a dark past. Fall TV fashion: Outfitting 'Pretty Little Liars' Either way, this won't be the first time Paolo has played with color and texture to evoke a certain tone. She said Olivia dons cashmere and silk when she's at home because she's more vulnerable, and she often wears darker colors during flashbacks to show that she was a different person back then. As a costume designer, Paolo says her job is to ""create another human. If you're really doing your job, you're making it easy for an actor to inhabit that person's skin. ... They can walk into their trailer in the morning, don the costume and all of a sudden, they become that other person."" In her more than 20 years as a costume designer, Paolo has worked on ""ER"" and ""Southland,"" as well as ""The West Wing,"" which might explain her knack for picking out a good power suit. Fall TV fashion: Outfitting 'Revenge' It's all about knowing what works on an actor's body, Paolo said, adding, ""If you look at (Olivia) you'll see her silhouettes are fairly consistent. ... It's a classic business look,"" with a feminine twist, of course. ""This woman is working in a very complicated, lets face it, male-oriented world in D.C.,"" the costume designer said of the series, which is filmed in Los Angeles. ""When you talk about Washington D.C., you think of dark gray and navy blue. Look at a picture of Congress. Everyone pretty much looks the same. ... My idea was, we should always have Olivia Pope standout in some way."" But while Olivia is standing out, her accessories are blending in. ""We always want to find something that embellishes the costume, but also disappears,"" Paolo said. ""It shouldn't be jarring. We tend to do a lot of tone-on-tone -- neutrals or pinks."" And that goes for her shoes, as well. ""I don't want them to draw attention,"" Paolo said, adding, they almost look like paint chips lined up in her closet -- ""one tone of gray after another."" Olivia will continue sporting ""the long necklaces that are in vogue right now,"" Paolo said, adding, she'll also have a new Prada purse and two new Movado watches, one in rose gold and one in silver, in addition to the gold timepiece she wore during season one. Washington's character only wears Movado watches for the same reason she typically carries one of four classic Prada purses. ""We wanted her to have a watch that was functional and spoke to who she is, but wasn't a distraction. ... Elegant and understated,"" Paolo said. ""Olivia is always focused on the job ahead."" She'll don her standard Armani, Escada and Valentino threads -- on loan from the designers -- mixed with pieces Paolo finds at stores such as Nordstrom Rack, Bloomingdales and Loehmann's. ""We get top of the line stuff, but the thing that makes our show so good is the tailoring,"" Paolo said. ""We have an army of tailors who take everything in and make it fit properly."" Washington is so petite that Paolo's team sometimes spends up to 40 minutes pinning a jacket before even cutting it, which can take an additional three to four hours. But that's not the case for every actor, Paolo said. Columbus Short, who plays Harrison Wright on the series, fits into a suit right off the rack. ""You don't want more than one set of hands on a piece of beautiful clothing,"" Paolo said. ""It's like drawing or sketching. You can't hand it off to someone else."" To achieve Olivia's business casual look, Paolo suggests women look toward stores such as Zara and Ann Taylor ""where you can get the feeling."" Sometimes just shortening a sleeve makes a huge difference, she says.","Costume designer Lyn Paolo puts 'Scandal's' Olivia in pastels to show she's feminine, strong .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, a stalwart foe of government spending, won a blowout victory Saturday in the annual Conservative Political Action Conference presidential straw poll. With participants naming ""reducing the size of federal government"" as their top issue, the 74-year old libertarian hero captured 31 percent of the 2,400 votes cast in the annual contest, usually seen as a barometer of how the GOP's conservative wing regards their potential presidential candidates. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney finished second with 22 percent of the vote, ending a three-year winning streak at CPAC. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin finished third with 7 percent of the vote, followed by Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty at 6 percent and Indiana Rep. Mike Pence at 5 percent. They were followed by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who tied at 4 percent. Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, South Dakota Sen. John Thune and Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour rounded out the results. Five percent of participants voted for ""Other"" and 6 percent was undecided. The announcement of Paul's win, a surprise victory unlikely to have a major impact on the 2012 presidential contest, drew a volley of loud boos from the CPAC audience. That discontent could be seen in the poll results: A majority of participants said they wished the Republican Party had a better field of candidates to choose from. But Paul's victory might be seen, in part, as a result of his support among anti-establishment Tea Party activists -- who turned out in force at this year's conference and expressed some frustration with the Republican Party. Reflecting the college atmosphere of the annual event, young people dominated the voting: 54 percent of participants were between the ages of 18 and 25. The poll also contained a bit of bad news for Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele, who made an under-the-radar appearance at CPAC late Friday. Follow on Twitter: http://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/cpac . Participants were asked to rate their opinions of several top political figures, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader John Boehner, both of whom received a majority favorable rating. But Steele was the only Republican to garner an upside-down rating, with 44 percent giving him an unfavorable rating and 42 percent rating him favorably. The three-day meeting Saturday that has featured speeches by Republican leaders, training sessions for local political activists and a renewed purpose to stand firm behind their principles heading into the midterm elections.","U.S. Rep.

"Residents of three villages in northeastern Nigeria took security into their own hands this week, repelling attacks by Boko Haram insurgents and killing more than 200 of them, residents and officials said. Hundreds of Boko Haram fighters stormed the villages of Menari, Tsangayari and Garawa in the ethnic Shuwa-dominated Kalabalge District on Tuesday. Boko Haram -- the group responsible for the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls from the same region -- was met with stiff resistance as locals put up a fierce fight, witnesses said. A month has passed since the girls were kidnapped, and the Nigerian government has been accused of not acting swiftly or efficiently enough to protect villages in the region threatened by Boko Haram. In the three villages attacked Tuesday, gunmen arrived in dozens of all-terrain vans, armored tanks and motorcycles, but villagers quickly mobilized and engaged the attackers in a prolonged battle. ""They attacked Menari and killed around 60 people and burned some homes before proceeding to Tsangayari and Garawa villages,"" resident Algoni Ahunna said. When news of the attack filtered out, people trooped out from nearby villages carrying arms. Locals seized an armored tank, three all-terrain vans and 90 motorcycles from the attackers, residents said. ""At Tsangayari and Garawa, they met a big surprise as residents engaged them in a fierce battle in which over 200 of the Boko Haram fighters were killed. More than 150 were killed in Tsangayari,"" Ahunna said. A lawmaker in Borno state's Parliament confirmed the incident. ""I received information on the gallant action taken by the people in Kalabalge District in which at least 200 Boko Haram gunmen were killed,"" said the lawmaker, who asked not to be named for security reasons. A relief worker in the area said he counted more than 100 bodies in Tsangayari alone. ""I believe the number of the gunmen killed is up to 250,"" said the worker, who also asked not to be named for fear of reprisals from Boko Haram. It was the second defeat Boko Haram has suffered from locals in the area in over a month. Scores of Boko Haram gunmen were killed by villagers in early April in a foiled raid, residents said. 20 soldiers killed in ambushes . The director general of the National Orientation Agency, which acts as a communications arm of the government, commended the villagers' actions, but defended the military. ""The vigilante is a common phenomenon in Nigeria -- it is not a new development,"" Mike Omeri said. ""They were able to do what they did because they had prior information that these people were coming to attack them at a particular time in the night and particular time of the day."" Omeri said he did not know how the villagers would have received that key information. ""The military cannot be in every village at the same time -- like I said for emphasis, if the military had not been on the ground sufficiently, perhaps the entire northeast would have been overrun by now. Or the entire country would have been overrun,"" he said. Meanwhile, the military was having problems among its ranks after 20 soldiers were killed in two separate ambushes on Wednesday. One of those ambushes happened after troops left Chibok, the village from which the girls were kidnapped. According to military sources, Nigerian soldiers upset over the deaths of their colleagues opened fire on a convoy carrying a military commander. The commander escaped unhurt, the military sources said. ""Soldiers have been angry with the poor treatment they receive from their superiors in terms of inadequate arms and poor allowances in their combat against Boko Haram,"" a military source said. ""The death of their colleagues was too much for them to bear."" The Nigerian defense spokesman, Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade, downplayed the incident as ""an internal issue that has been sorted out."" Families, friends identify girls in video . Chibok is located in a remote part of northern Nigeria. Many people there do not have access to television. Those who do have held viewing sessions at their homes to watch a Boko Haram video, released Monday by Agence France-Presse, a French news agency. Parents crowded around the screens, searching for any sign of their missing daughters. The governor of Borno state, Kashim Shettima, also arranged special viewings for some families and girls who escaped the clutches of Boko Haram. A spokesman for the Borno governor said parents, students and teachers have so far identified 77 of the girls in the video, which shows about 100 girls, not the full 276 abducted from Chibok. Some relatives interviewed by CNN -- an uncle of one of the girls who escaped and the parents of two missing girls -- said they believe the video also shows some girls abducted as long as two years ago. The confusion is significant because the video had been hailed as proof that at least some girls in the Chibok abduction -- the object of international search efforts -- were alive and well. Such proof would be a crucial part of any possible negotiations that could lead to the release of the girls. ""I think we've got to be realistic,"" CNN analyst Frances Townsend told CNN's ""New Day"" this week. ""Even in a negotiation, because of the large number of captives, you are unlikely to return all approximately 300 girls to their families and reunite them healthy, safe and well.""","Parents and students work to identify girls in video .

"(CNN)Move over ""House of Cards!"" And ""Better Call Saul"" can wait. If you need a new obsession to binge-watch online, we've got a hot list of African TV and web series for you. From painstakingly awkward mockumentaries to gritty city dramas to entertaining profiles of quirky creatives, there's a whole host of popular shows captivating audiences in Africa and beyond . CNN picks out eight must-see TV or web series from across the continent and the diaspora that you should tune into. 1. ""I of Africa"" From Aina Fadina, a Nigerian born/American raised fashion model comes ""I of Africa"" -- a web series celebrating all things African from a global perspective. So far, she's produced two seasons of one-on-one interviews with entrepreneurial creatives. She says the series celebrates trailblazing individuals by focusing on inspirational, global African stories. ""I cover topics that influence the image of what African is, 'African beauty,' what African cultures are, influences the continent has on the world from a global perspective, and the evolution of these things."" Fadina -- who has worked with luxury labels including Oscar De La Renta and Alexander McQueen, as well as fashion changemakers Duro Olowu and Mimi Plange -- is a force du jour for this storytelling outlet. Juggling the many hats of financier, host and producer, she says the ultimate goal is to one day be picked up for TV. She is currently in the process of securing partners and sponsorship to begin filming Season Three. Watch it here . 2. ""The Pearl of Africa"" In a country where being gay has been outlawed by the state, ""The Pearl of Africa"" follows the emotional journey of Cleopatra Kambugu, a 27-year-old transgender girl. Born biologically male, the series follows her journey as she openly transitions into a woman. Swedish filmmaker Jonny von Wallström traveled to Kampala living with Cleo and her boyfriend, filming them for 18 months as the young trans woman raised important questions about identity, gender and homophobic attitudes in the country. Beautifully produced, the seven-part series showcases a brave story told in powerful yet softly intimate light. Watch it here . 3. ""An African City"" No list of popular African shows would be complete without ""An African City."" Often described as the continent's answer to HBO's popular ""Sex and the City"" television series, the show follows five fabulous women as they return to their native Ghana following several years living abroad. The series immediately generated a buzz when the first season was released last year. Show creator Nicole Amarteifio told CNN last year:  ""I wanted something for African women, something for us and by us. I was tired of the sole narrative of the African woman being about poverty and disease. I wanted to see another narrative -- one of beauty, glamor and intelligence. I knew I had to do something about it. I couldn't keep complaining about the problem."" Producers tell CNN they hope to start shooting Season Two sometime in the spring for public release scheduled for later in the year, subject to financing. Watch it here . 4. ""The Samaritans"" ""The Samaritans"" is a refreshingly smart and hilarious mockumentary based on the development sector. A witty and well-written scripted comedy from Kenyan producer Hussein Kurji, the show follows the daily goings-on at a local field office for fictitious NGO ""Aid for Aid."" Complete with painfully awkward monologues from the NGO's new country director, Scott -- who clearly hasn't got a clue what he's doing -- the show has an air of ""The Office"" about it and will have you laughing out loud at some of the ridiculous decisions made by this inept gang. Kurji began development on the series thanks to a successful Kickstarter campaign and ironically with additional financing from a NGO. Two episodes are available to rent online and he is currently focusing on developing a full first season for international distribution. Rent it here . 5. The White Folks . Think South Africa's answer to ""Modern Family,"" this quirky comedy follows the seemingly boring lives of two families living in suburban Cape Town.  From the minds of writers and co-directors, Mia Cilliers and Lisa Lane Drennan, the tongue-in-cheek comedy takes aim at the upwardly mobile middle class families in the capital's suburbs. Drennan adds: ""We originally came up with the concept after joking around about the typical habits of white people close to us: family, neighbors, friends and co-workers. We thought that the time was right for a show that parodies suburban behavior, it was never meant to be mean-spirited but rather an attempt to laugh at ourselves and look critically at white culture, especially in the suburbs. ""As the script developed, we realized the show is not about white people and their lives as such, but actually more about middle class people as a whole and the ""problems"" that they deal with."" The team have released two seasons on Youtube and currently on hiatus planning their next season which they hope to start shooting imminently. Watch it here . 6. African Time . A talking head web series showcasing what it's like for Africans in the diaspora. The show might of started out life in 2011 as a documentary but soon transformed into the web series format it is known for today. The idea came from chief writer Mawuena Akyea who wanted to explore the acclimation experiences of first and second generation Africans in anecdotal form. Along with producers Ayman Gasmelseed and Algernon Felice Jr, the project finally got off the ground through the art collective, WAAVE+DADA . Tackling stereotypes, discipline, parenting and other issues with humor, class and intelligence, it's well worth spending a few minutes to watch a different perspective from the diaspora. Felice Jr says: ""Our intention is to start production within the 2015 calendar year, focusing on expanding both the scope and scale of the series in a format that allows us to delve into various cultural & social issues from a fresh and engaging perspective."" Watch it here . 7. ""The Nairobians"" Celebrated Kenyan director David ""Tosh"" Gitonga  created a mini social media storm last month when he shared the trailer for his new TV show ""The Nairobians."" Gitonga previously directed the multi award-winning gangster flick ""Nairobi Half-Life,"" the country's first-ever film to be considered for an Academy Award. Gitonga tells CNN it was during filming the intense crime film that the idea for The Nairobians hit him. ""When we filmed Nairobi Half-Life we got immersed into a world that was not understood,"" he explains. ""A fascinating world that had lots of stories to be told. That's when the idea of making a series came about."" While little is known about the details of the series, the dark and dramatic trailer reveals Gitonga has turned his attention to the country's capital and a gang of highly skilled criminals committing heists across the city. The show features Brenda Wairimu (of MTV's soapie ""Shuga"" fame), Daniel Weke, while Antony Ndung'u returns to work with Gitonga again (the duo previously collaborated on set of Nairobi Half-Life"" among others). As Gitonga himself describes it, ""The Nairobians is an Pan African show that tells our own stories of struggles and dreams in their african context."" Gitonga has spent the past few months working with Tanzanian writer, film producer and director Abdu Simba to nail down a strong outline for the show's direction and script. The production time are in the final stages of development before production on season one begins. 8. ""Ogas At The Top"" ""Ogas At The Top "" is a quirky political satire web series from Nigeria with puppets. Created by the same team who launched the popular THE XYZ SHOW in Kenya, the web series turns the country's leaders into comical punching bags. Some of the puppet personas of Nigerian society to make appearances on the show so far include President Goodluck Jonathan and his wife, former leaders Olusegun Obasanjo and Sani Abacha, Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, comedian Basketmouth and Nollywood actress Patience ""Mama G"" Ozokwor. Season two, which has a strong focus on the upcoming elections, kicked off at the beginning of February with new episodes -- each running around five minutes long -- releasing each Friday. And producers are hoping to see the same success season one brought -- the show went viral (with many episodes reaching over 100,000 views) and has been nominated for Best Online Video at this year's Africa Magic Viewer's Choice awards in March.

"(CNN)More than once accused of being culture-free, Australia's third largest metropolis has a culture all its own, shaped by a palm-swaying climate. Cultural survival in the river-looped city relies on respecting some vital local lore. In the words of one local paper, ""You're not from Brisbane until you ..."" Get undressed . This is the first lesson foreigners learn on visiting Brisbane, wedged along an eastern coastline lined with impressive beaches. Getting rid of unnecessary clothes is a question of survival. Too hot to bother with full and formal attire, dress code boils down to beachwear, skimpy dresses, shorts and thongs. Short-sleeved shirts will generally be more than accepted for business folk. Friendly reminder: In all of the country the 'thong' isn't a sexy strip of underwear, but the cherished Aussie term for flip-flops. Only Brisbanites, jibes the local Courier Mail newspaper, will reach for a cardy (a cardigan) if the thermometer falls below 22C (72 F) -- which it rarely does. The dream climate has sucked in sun worshipers from all over the world -- one quarter of the population are foreigners. Start using ""Brissie"" and ""togs"" Brisbane has its own lingo. A swimming costume is no longer a ""cozzy,"" as for other Aussies. Or swimmers or bathers. Those in Brissie call them ""togs."" Oh, and in this sport-worshiping state, ""The King"" isn't Elvis but former homegrown sporting star Wally Lewis. Informalities come away like layers of clothes. ""Mate,"" ""hey,"" ""ay"" and ""but"" punctuate conversation. People here call Queensland Premier Campbell Newman ""Can Do"" -- to his face! They also debate the relative merits of the ""Goldie"" (Gold Coast) to the south, and ""Sunny"" (Sunshine Coast) Coast to the north. Like all Queenslanders, Brisbanites cop often unnecessary flak for speaking slowly, perhaps on account of the heat. Be ready for the storm . Subtropical climes mean rain -- buckets of it. And hailstones the size of golf balls -- they're declared ""natural enemy"" number one by Brisbanites. Lighting and thunder are also familiar villains. The storms are regularly spectacular and also very damaging. Severe flooding has hit the city and state in recent years. Living in the city means always carrying a lightweight waterproof -- and being ready to take cover from the storm. Live the River . The Brisbane River is the city's lifeblood.  (And it's not uncommon for sharks to be caught in sections of the river). Unfurling 16 kilometers (10 miles) inland from the Pacific Ocean, it Big Dippers through the city around a series of beak-shaped headlands. The river is a ticket to ride through one of Australia's greenest urban settings. In forward-thinking Brissie, thickets of skyscrapers and urban bush land meet. You have to cruise the river to experience the city's most iconic public transport -- the ferries. Free CityFerries and faster CityCats zip round a network of 24 terminals, allowing passengers to hop on and off to lap up Brisbane's watery character. Ferries run from 6 a.m. to midnight, daily. Go walkabout . Outdoor activities are Brisbane's chief modus operandi. City overseers are prioritizing pedestrian and bike friendliness. Brisbanites wake up before dawn to dart about along verdant harborside paths or on the 24-hour CityCycle biking sharing plan. A circuit-walking trail links the foreshore Botanic Gardens, Parliament House and Old Government House. Pedestrians can follow it across the river, via the car-free Goodwill Bridge, and walk through South Bank's museums and restaurants. The stunning LED-lit Kurilpa footbridge will take you back to the central business district. Nicknamed ""sticks bridge"" (due to its spiky appearance), it was the world's largest solar-powered bridge until London's Blackfriars stole its thunder last January. The ""tensegrity"" construction relies on tension in the cables between the pillars to stay upright. Go suburban . Australian suburbia is the spread that doesn't fit in a Vegemite jar. Being a few miles upstream from the city center in Brisbane is no crime. In fact it's seen as a lifestyle plus. Hot to trot neighborhoods dot the riverbanks -- Fortitude Valley (or just the Valley) and Paddington have vibrant restaurant and bar scenes. Further along from trendy Teneriffe in New Farm is Bulimba. Proliferating swimming pools and architect-designed homes have seen median house prices here outstrip $1 million. But there's a breezy village feel among Oxford Street's bookshops, cafes and cinemas. Ferrying here, you'll get a sense of leaving the city behind, as bushy reserves surge. Picnic in a park . The picnic is the crux of Brisbane's public bonding culture. Locals head en masse to riverside parks for picnicking, barbies and mingling. With 1,820 parks and gardens, this is supposedly Australia's most bio-diverse capital. It aims to be its greenest by 2016 -- carbon neutral and crammed with trees. Sprawling greens, multipurpose pathways and barbecue areas flank riverbanks north (city side) and south. The Brunswick Street ferry stop will land you in New Farm Park. Some 18,000 people flood here every week according to management, ""to picnic, play, eat, dance, ponder, gaze and wonder."" You can also awe at the willowy Queenslander houses, perched high on flood-defying stilts. Get cultural . If you don't cross the Brisbane River, you risk missing all the culture concentrated on the southside. Comedian Barry Humphries -- aka Dame Edna Everage -- helped spark the great Brisbane cultural debate with the disparaging quip: ""Australia is the Brisbane of the world."" These days, cries of intellectual destitution are difficult to sustain among the billowing art and science institutions of South Bank. The capital for culture is Stanley Place. The white-stone-swathed ""Cultural Precinct"" is home to the Queensland Art Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art. Collectively they're known as ""QAGOMA."" Entry is free, barring special exhibitions. Love thy mall . Brisbane's ""big country town"" reputation of the past lives on in pockets of the beloved Queen Street Mall. The downtown strip is a mishmash of Seventies shops, ultra-mod glassy office tower-hotels and steel clad sunshades. The 26-point City Centre Heritage Trail shows you the colonial anachronisms among the flourishing skyscrapers. Church spires and Edwardian-Baroque facades from the 1800s mingle with neon casino lights and bar upon bar. Brisbane's love of blingy buildings and nightlife spawned its endearing tag, BrisVegas. Down a lager . Brisbane pub culture is perched somewhere between traditional drinking holes and sleek modern emporiums. Once grabbing a pint of XXXX (pronounced ""four-ex"") beer while singing along with locals as they croon ""Love you Brisbane"" is a good way to get involved. Nowadays the drinking scene -- like the city -- is a lot more sophisticated, with a wide range of Australian brews (large and micro-breweries) available pretty much everywhere. Not to mention the rising crop of cocktail and wine-focused bars. Know your wildlife . Australians love their nature and wild beasts. Be warned -- in Brisbane ""local wildlife"" may refer to two-meter-long pythons, dwelling in people's backyards. Not to a raucous night out on the town. Tasmanian-born Tamara Thiessen is a freelance writer who has written guidebooks to Australia, France, Italy and Malaysia, and cultural histories of Sydney and Rome.","Australia's third-largest city, Brisbane has a local culture all its own .

"(CNN)Photographer Maxine Helfman didn't foresee the current outcry around civil rights in America back in 2012, when she began shooting portraits in the style of the old Flemish master painters -- using only black models. Placing people of color within a portrait style that historically was the domain of the European elite is a political statement on inequality couched in a beautiful tableaux. Helfman's subjects in the ""Historical Correction"" series wear the same aloof expressions of 17th-century noblemen and women in portraits commissioned from artists like Frans Hals. Light plays across their faces, white collars and billowing black vestments in a manner familiar to followers of the Dutch and Flemish masters. The difference is that their faces are varying shades of brown. Helfman, 61, wanted to create historical documentation of a population that never was. The images subvert the obvious storyline -- that social strata often break down along racial lines. Her photos are a ""contradiction,"" she said, to the stories of inequality that are being told in protests across the United States. ""When I shot them I had the same inspirations, but we didn't have issues that were so highly charged as we're dealing with now racially,"" Helfman said. ""In my lifetime I've seen them come up over and over and then something inflames them again, and it just shows you we haven't gotten there."" ""There,"" meaning equality. Helfman stages the subjects of her photos to command respect. She doesn't place other objects in the frame (to avoid distractions), and she shoots from a slightly lower plane to place the model on high. ""When you get just a little bit of a lower angle, you're giving that person power."" Also a commercial photographer, Helfman often plays with notions of power and what should be in her fine artwork. She draws inspiration for her art photography from painters like the Flemish masters and contemporary photographers like Carrie Mae Weems and Seydou Keita. Flemish portraits of heroes, villains . Helfman enjoys provoking the audience by placing her subjects in unexpected situations -- many of them involving clothing and culture. One series put young boys in dresses and invited viewers to interpret what and who they were seeing. Images from another series depict black women in black face paint dressed as geishas. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. ""The longer my series have been out, the more even I understand the layers -- and especially when I hear other people's reaction and other people's comments,"" Helfman said. ""They just kind of take on a life of their own."" Using gender and race as provocation is fraught with potential pitfalls for Helfman, a white woman. She takes great care to be respectful, often consulting other artists or experts for another cultural point of view. ""I never want to create something that's tongue-in-cheek because that defeats the purpose,"" she said. ""It's disrespectful to the (statement) I'm trying to make."" What she aims to do, she said, is make viewers think and rethink. ""At face value when people look at them, it's a beautiful image. You're so easily brought into these, and by the time you are, you give it some thought and ask some questions."" Maxine Helfman is a photographer based in Dallas.

"(CNN) -- The computers haven't proven to be our trivia overlords just yet. Give them at least until Wednesday. An IBM supercomputer named Watson finished one round of the TV show ""Jeopardy!"" on Monday night tied with one of his human competitors and $3,000 ahead of the other. The man vs. computer face-off won't be complete, however, until the final rounds of the extended trivia game show are aired on Tuesday and Wednesday. IBM trumpets Watson, which has been in development for years and has the processing power of 2,800 ""powerful computers,"" as a major advancement in machines' efforts to understand human language. The computer receives clues through digital texts and then buzzes in against the two other ""Jeopardy!"" contestants like any other player would. It juggles dozens of lines of reasoning at once and tries to arrive at a smart answer. After getting off to a scary-good start, Watson did have a few stumbles. In one instance, it repeated an answer that another contestant, Ken Jennings, who won 74 ""Jeopardy!"" episodes in a row, had already tried. ""What is 1920s?"" Watson said, sounding like a digitized Matthew Broderick. ""No,"" game-show host Alex Trebek replied. ""Ken said that."" On many other clues, however, Watson was spot-on. After losing the first clue to Brad Rutter, another ""Jeopardy!"" champion, Watson jumped in on the second question. Clue: ""Iron fitting on the hoof of a horse or a card-dealing box in a casino."" Watson: ""What is shoe?"" Correct. At the start of the show, Trebek went to some lengths to explain the origins of Watson -- IBM approached the show about the idea three years ago -- and how the computer actually works. That's partly because what you see on the ""Jeopardy!"" stage is somewhat misleading. It looks as if two humans are bookending a simple computer monitor, which appears to be just about as smart as they are. In reality, as Trebek explained, the bulk of Watson's computer power was stored in another building at an IBM lab in New York, where the show is being held for this special three-day competition. CNNMoney: Will IBM's Watson put your job in jeopardy? After introducing Watson, to studio applause, this is how Trebek explained it: . ""Just as I expected,"" he said. ""That was a very warm reception and I'm sure Watson would have appreciated the applause. Except for one thing: Watson can neither hear nor see. It will be receiving all of its information electronically. ""And as a matter of fact what you're looking at right now is not the real Watson. This is an avatar. This is a representation of Watson. Watson, or course, is a sophisticated computer system too big and too heavy to fit behind that lectern on our stage."" As for the stage version of Watson, his brain-face was represented by a digital Earth that swirled with ribbons of various colors while he thought about questions. As Trebek read the clues, a bar graph appeared at the bottom of the screen, showing the top three answers Watson was considering at that moment and how confident he was in those choices. Sometimes the computer managed to be confident but still incorrect. Here's the clue to the first question Watson got wrong: . ""From the Latin for end, this is where trains can also originate."" Watson: ""What is finis."" Confidence level: 97%. Trebek: ""No. Ken?"" ""What is terminus,"" Jennings answered correctly. Before ending the evening tied with Rutter at $5,000 each, Watson had jumped out to an early lead at the first commercial break. At that point, Watson had $5,200 and his closest noncomputer counterpart had only $1,000. Several Twitter users were awed by the computer's smarts. ""Watson kinda feakin' me out. Big time,"" Michael Gartenberg, a tech analyst, wrote on his Twitter feed. Another person wrote: ""Watson is almost scary. This is willld! These humans are no match for Watson's algorithms."" Trebek summed up the computer's mixed performance this way: . ""So, what have we learned so far: Watson's very bright, very fast, but he had some weird little moments once in a while."" Then he teased the upcoming shows: . ""And how many of those will we encounter tomorrow when we play double and final 'Jeopardy!'?""","IBM computer Watson finishes first round tied with 1 contestant, ahead of 2nd .

"Brave or reckless? A group of thrill-seeking surfers plunged into raging waters during one of the biggest storms to hit Europe in recent times -- one of them thinks he might have broken the record for riding the biggest wave, while another is recovering in hospital after taking ""the hardest beating by man or woman anywhere in the ocean."" Praia do Norte, at the Portuguese town of Nazare, is renowned for its huge swells -- and Monday brought more with the weather that caused havoc across the continent, killing at least 13 people. Carlos Burle caught one of these, estimated to be around 100 feet high, not long after helping to haul his fellow Brazilian Maya Gabeira out of the pummeling surf after she was knocked unconscious. Gabeira, one of the world's leading female big-wave surfers, was taken to hospital and escaped with just a broken ankle, while Burle is hoping to have his feat ratified as a Guinness World Record. The daredevil who surfs glacier waves . ""It was luck. We never know when we will be catching the wave,"" the 45-year-old Burle told Surfer Today. ""I still hadn't surfed any wave and everyone had already had their rides. Maya almost died. For me, it was a big adrenaline moment to get back there after what happened."" Burle is hoping to surpass the 2011 record set by American Garrett McNamara, whose 78-foot  wave ride was ratified by Guinness the following year. McNamara, who also managed an unconfirmed effort estimated to be around 100 foot  at Praia do Norte in January this year, was in the water Monday as part of the support crew for Burle, Gabeira and compatriots Pedro Scooby and Felipe Cesarano. World's 50 best surf spots . ""It was definitely huge with the waves breaking right in front of the rocks,"" McNamara wrote on his Facebook page Tuesday. ""Maya Gabeira is the toughest water woman I have ever witnessed. She also caught one of the biggest waves of the day. She took the hardest beating I have ever seen by man or woman anywhere in the ocean and made it close to the shore all on her own. ""What happened after was terrible. It just shows how strong she is and how hard she trained by how well she is doing after going through what happened to her!! Thankfully she will be home from the hospital today."" 'Beauty is a woman riding a wave' McNamara said they had taken all possible safety precautions. ""On big days we have back up for the back up. 2 safety drivers in place. A team on the cliff with walkie talkies, a team on the beach with quads and life guard,"" he wrote. ""What happen to Maya yesterday was extremely unfortunate and thanks to God and everyone on the beach, especially the Nazare lifeguard Nuno for bringing her back.

"In 2011, I was on a panel, organized by the security company RSA, with two retired National Security Agency directors, Michael Hayden and Kenneth Minihan. During the course of our debate, I raised concerns, as the only non-American on the panel, that their plans and preferences for having the NSA secure cyberspace for the rest of us were not exactly reassuring. To this, Minihan replied that I should not describe myself as ""Canadian"" but rather ""North American."" As jarring as his response was, the fact of the matter is when it comes to communications, he's right.  Practically speaking, there is no border separating Canadian from U.S. telecommunications -- though that's not true the other way around. Primarily, this one-way dependence is a product of history and economics. Canadians' communications are inextricably connected to networks south of the border and subject to the laws and practices of the U.S. over which we, as foreigners, have no say or control. For American citizens, the recent NSA scandal has touched off soul-searching discussions about the legality of mass surveillance programs, whether they violate the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, and whether proper oversight and accountability exist to protect American citizens' rights. Opinion: Massive spying on Americans is outrageous . Indeed, with respect to the case of PRISM, NSA's secret set of tools used to collect data about overseas Internet communications, some argue the program actually enhances those safeguards for Americans -- because it appears that collection of company data was segregated in such a way to limit the collection to ""foreign citizens.""  As reassuring as this may be for Americans, for the rest of us non-Americans who enjoy our Gmail, Google Docs, and Facebook accounts, it's definitely unsettling: We're all fair game. While cyberspace may be global, its infrastructure most definitely is not. For example, a huge proportion of global Internet traffic flows through networks controlled by the United States, simply because eight of 15 global tier 1 telecommunications companies are American -- companies like AT&T, CenturyLink, XO Communications and, significantly, Verizon. The social media services that many of us take for granted are also mostly provided by giants headquartered in the United States, like Google, Facebook, Yahoo! and Twitter.  All of these companies are subject to U.S. law, including the provisions of the U.S. Patriot Act, no matter where their services are offered or their servers located. Having the world's Internet traffic routed through the U.S. and having those companies under its jurisdiction give U.S. national security agencies an enormous home-field advantage that few other countries enjoy. But there are unintended consequences of the NSA scandal that will undermine U.S. foreign policy interests -- in particular, the ""Internet Freedom"" agenda espoused by the U.S. State Department and its allies. Opinion: Your biggest secrets are up for grabs . The revelations that have emerged will undoubtedly trigger a reaction abroad as policymakers and ordinary users realize the huge disadvantages of their dependence on U.S.-controlled networks in social media, cloud computing, and telecommunications, and of the formidable resources that are deployed by U.S. national security agencies to mine and monitor those networks. For example, in 2012, Norwegian lawmakers debated a ban on the use by public officials of Google's and Microsoft's cloud computing services.  Although shelved temporarily, this type of debate will almost certainly be resurrected and spread throughout Europe and other regions as the full scope of U.S.-based ""foreign directed"" wiretapping and metadata collection sinks in. Already we can see regional traffic to the United States from Asia, Africa and even Latin America gradually declining, a trend that is almost certainly going to accelerate as those regions ramp up regional network exchange points and local services to minimize dependence on networks under U.S. control. Many of the countries in the Southern Hemisphere are failed or fragile states; many of them are authoritarian or autocratic regimes. No doubt the elites in those regimes will use the excuse of security to adopt more stringent state controls over the Internet in their jurisdictions and support local versions of popular social media companies over which they can exact their own nationalized controls -- a trend that began prior to the NSA revelations but which now has additional rhetorical support. In the age of Big Data, the revelations about NSA's intelligence-gathering programs touched many nerves. The issue of surveillance won't go away, and Americans will need to figure out the appropriate safeguards for liberty in their democracy. It's an important debate, but one that doesn't include us ""foreigners"" that now make up the vast majority of the Internet users. Americans would do well to consider the international implications of their domestic policies before they come home to bite them.","Ronald Deibert: For non-Americans, NSA's massive surveillance is unsettling .

"This holiday season, I am heading to the only Cuba I've ever known. To Nochebuena dinner with my cousin's roast pork, her mother-in-law's flan, platanos maduros, yucca and a salad. Nochebuena is a Latino celebration of Christmas Eve, and it's a big night for us. There will be quick-fire Spanish, varying degrees of English and jokes in the way I've only ever heard my Cuban relatives parry back and forth. Many presents will be opened, and everyone will act like we all got each other the perfect gift. I'm flying not to Havana but to Miami, where my grandparents and other relatives came years after Fidel Castro took over Cuba, when it became clear there would be no free speech for anyone but him. The stadiums were filling with ""trials"" against the enemies of the state, friends were disappearing and my mother, despite her government job, knew her unwillingness to stay quiet while people suffered would get her in trouble. So she went into exile in 1961, and she's never been back. Years later my grandparents followed their grown children -- my mother and uncle -- to the United States. When they applied to leave the country, Cuban government officials did an inventory of the contents of their home. Both their home and all of their things would be confiscated by the government on the day they departed. The morning she left, my abuelita was washing the dishes in their apartment before she and my grandfather left for the airport. Suddenly she stopped. ""Let Fidel do the dishes,"" she said. I have never seen that apartment. Family traditions . When we land Tuesday in Miami, my mother and uncle will meet us at the airport and rush us to Havana Harry's or some coffee stand where I can get a real Cuban coffee -- none of this Starbucks silliness. There's a hint of Cuba in the taste. And Cuban and U.S. flags will be everywhere. I don't care about South Beach or Art Basel or Coconut Grove. Every bit of Cuba I get is gleaned from pictures, music, stories people tell me and these trips to see Miami family, where I get hints of my ancestry in the food and jokes and presents. I soak it up on every visit. I've never seen the sleepy, agricultural town of Pinar del Rio where my mother was born and lived until her teenage years. I've never seen where she went to high school after they moved to Havana or the beaches where she swam in the summertime and where one friend dangling his foot over a pier lost it to a shark. I don't know where she had her first piano recital. When she plays my favorite Cuban music on the piano, all too rarely, for some reason the notes make me cry. Maybe it's the hints of her life before me. The Christmas heat in Miami must be similar to what they feel in Cuba, only a short flight to the south. I will pack my summer clothes and a bathing suit for my daughter. Around midday on Christmas Eve some of us will head to El Palacio de Los Jugos for lunch and Cuban sandwiches. I will get my favorite Materva soda, too sweet for me now but still worth the memory. My cousin, whose Nochebuena pork would make Martha Stewart cry, likes to tease us to not to fill up at lunch. But we will be fine. Dinner won't be until much later -- our family is always late -- and we all want her cooking. Filling in the gaps . My definition of beauty isn't blond hair or blue eyes or any classic American stereotype. It's my black-haired Cuban cousins, who look so refined and elegant. They hug me, the baby of my generation and the half-American with the brown hair, so hard. They remind me to come back. To Miami, not to Cuba. I've only seen pictures of the tobacco trucks. My mother was taught to drive by the drivers at the tobacco trucking company where my grandfather worked, and it's why she still drives a car like she means business. Another hint of Cuba on those long road trips. I welcome the news of thawing American relations with Cuba and easing of travel restrictions. But I am tired of the ads for religious charity trips to Cuba and all-inclusive beach resorts where tourists get pampered while my people, once removed, depend on charity for the most basic medical supplies. I am tired of the reasons for the sadness in my older relatives' eyes. I don't want to hear any more stereotypes about who my people are or tourists talking about going to visit Cuba ""before it changes."" As Miriam Zoila Perez has written, I don't want to hear about your Cuban vacation. I simply want to buy a plane ticket and go there myself. I want to go to my mother's hometown and see where she was born without crying the entire trip. I want to put those hints together, fill in the gaps and see for the first time, where I am from.","CNN's Katia Hetter has Cuban ancestry but has never visited Cuba .

You drive up an 18-kilometer dirt road to reach the farm, set high on a mountain plateau. Surrounded by vast skies and near the Atlantic, winemaker JC Martin aims to make elegant wines. His syrah, grenache and pinot noir are particularly good and best appreciated in the restaurant with its floor to ceiling windows. A food and wine matching menu with canapés costs R125 ($12) and you can even try wine with chocolate (R90/$8). Creation Wines, Hemel-en-Aarde Road (R320) Hermanus; +27 28 212 1107 . For the food . La Colombe restaurant at Constantia Uitsig winery is both classy and laid back. Request a table outside in the courtyard and you can spend an idyllic afternoon eating French/Asian fusion and trying wines from the well selected list. The tasting menu (with wine R950/$90 or without R650/$61) features dishes like rhubarb-dusted foie gras ballotine and Karoo lamb with braised neck spring roll. Constantia Uitsig winery, Spaanschemat River Road Constantia; + 27 21 794 2390 . For the hippie vibe . You'll need to be a confident driver to navigate the steep, rocky route down to Upland Estate. It lies in a hidden valley in the lesser known wine region of Wellington. There's a hippie feel to the estate, which is farmed organically by Edmund Oettle. There's an artist's studio, a shower room made from recycled wine bottles, hens and dogs running around. The estate makes some of the most elegant, long-lived cabernet sauvignon you'll find in SA. Upland Estate, Blouvlei Road outside Wellington; +27 82 731 4774; visits by arrangement only . For the views . Waterkloof is set like an amphitheater high on a hill and has incredible views of False Bay in one direction and the Hottentots Holland and Helderberg mountains in another. The building looks like a space age concrete and glass box perched on a slope. The restaurant has huge, daydream-inducing windows. The wines, which are made using biodynamic methods including horse power in the vineyard, are pretty good -- particularly the Circle of Life blends. A guided tour, tasting and two-course meal costs R430 ($40); tastings start at R30 ($3). Waterkloof, Sir Lowry's Pass Road, Somerset West; +27 21 858 1292 . For the Cape Dutch heritage . For insight into the lives of the early European settlers who started the wine industry, there's Groote Post on the West Coast. It's an area of wild and windy beaches and sleepy villages. Time seems to have stood still at this 18th-century farmhouse, listed as a national monument. It's an almost perfectly preserved example of Cape Dutch architecture, down to the original ceilings and fireplaces installed by a former Cape Governor who used it as a shooting lodge. Hilda's Kitchen on the farm serves good comfort food -- coq au vin or steak roll and the Old Man's Blend wines are good values. Groote Post, Darling Hills Road, Darling; +27 22 4922 825 . For the kids . Wine touring can seem like an adult activity, but it doesn't have to be, as demonstrated by Blaauwklippen Vineyards. Kids can run around the wide grassy areas or play in a jungle gym. There are also pony and carriage rides and a Sunday family market with live music, crafts and food. A kiddie picnic features toffee apples, while the adult version has a sophisticated platter with smoked snoek (a local fish), paté and local cheeses. Blaauwklippen Vineyards, R44 Stellenbosch; +27 21 880 0133 . For the accommodations . There's a friendly vibe at Weltevrede, in the unpretentious Robertson wine valley. There are four rustic cottages sleeping two to four people which are a terrific value at R460-690 ($43-65) a night. The Breede River is nearby -- you can go for hikes or try the excellent chardonnay. For a more upmarket experience, Asara (Polkadraai Road, Stellenbosch) has luxurious accommodations with views over the vineyards and mountains. Prices start at around R1800 ($170) for a basic room and double that for a suite -- if you turn up after 4 p.m. you can get a room and breakfast the same night for R1,000 ($95) if available. Weltevrede, Main Road, Bonnievale; +27 23 616 2141 . For the innovation . Brothers Peter-Allan and Andrew Finlayson of Crystallum Wines are part of a new wave of young guns making an impact in SA wine. Sons of pinot noir guru Peter Finlayson, of Bouchard Finlayson, Peter-Allan first studied philosophy and then acted before being lured into wine making. With no formal training apart from stints with Swartland pioneer Eben Sadie and in Burgundy, he released the first Crystallum vintage in 2007. Using only chardonnay and pinot noir from the best vineyards, the aim is to make handcrafted wines that express their provenance. Crystallum Wines, Walker Bay; email peter@crystallumwines.com for tastings . For the extras . It's no longer enough to just plonk a few glasses in front of people and expect them to be happy -- that's the philosophy at Fairview. You can combine a wine, olive oil and cheese tasting with artisan cheeses made on the farm in well designed tasting ""pods."" Kids can get hands-on in cheese-making workshops and there's a deli, shop and Mediterranean-style restaurant. The farm's innovative Goats do Roam range (a take on Côtes du Rhône) are inspired by the farm's goat tower, a kind of hotel for the farm's four-legged inhabitants. Fairview, Suid-Agter Paarl Road, Suider-Paarl; +27 21 863 2450 . For the unusual tasting experience . Across a bridge in a pagoda-style tasting hut on an island in the middle of a lake you'll find Stark-Condé Wines. The views of the vineyards in the dramatic Jonkershoek valley 300 meters above sea level will inspire you as you taste. American owner José Conde was inspired by the landscape to create small-volume, boutique wines -- the cabernet sauvignon is particularly good.

"(CNN)It's a restaurant so exclusive and so extravagant that even the scofflaws who broke in and robbed it have discerning, sophisticated palates. The French Laundry, the oh-so chichi Napa Valley landmark with its three Michelin stars and wine list that reads like porn for oenophiles, is suffering from bottle shock after its wine cellar was raided on Christmas Day. ""Specific wines of specific value were stolen,"" tweeted French Laundry's owner, the culinary demigod Thomas Keller. Seventy-six bottles, with a total worth of about $300,000, were stolen from the Yountville restaurant, according to CNN affiliate KPIX. Keller singled out two wines in particular: Screaming Eagle, a local Cabernet Sauvignon that can run as much as $6,500 a bottle, and Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, a French wine he sells between $6,000 and $8,000 per bottle, depending on the vintage. ""We are confident that if/when any stolen bottles appear in public they will immediately raise red flags,"" he said.","Napa Valley's famed French Laundry broken into Christmas Day .

"Most Americans will never serve in the military or fight for their country. Yet there are countless ways that everyone can help these veterans, who often return home from war to face their most difficult battles. Those severely injured may need to learn how to live with the loss of a limb or limited mobility. For others, brain injuries or post-traumatic stress disorder can make the return to civilian life a struggle. Here are nine simple things you can do to make a difference on  Memorial Day-- or any day -- for the more than 23 million American veterans: . 1. Give a veteran a ride . Medical care may be needed for some veterans for the rest of their lives. Disabled American Veterans provides free transportation to men and women who can't travel to Veterans Affairs medical facilities on their own. You can volunteer to drive a van for those who need a lift. 2. Donate frequent flier miles . The Fisher House Foundation has a network of homes on the grounds of military and VA hospitals around the country. These homes help family members be close during the hospitalization of a loved one for a combat injury, illness or disease. Fisher House operates the Hero Miles Program, using donated frequent flier miles to bring family members to the bedside of injured service members. You can also volunteer or donate household items. 3. Buy veteran-friendly holiday cards . More than a third of all Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have or will experience post-traumatic stress disorder. And veterans of past wars are still dealing with the ghosts of their time in the service. Coping with PTSD can put stress on not just veterans but also their families and friends. Your holiday card purchase this year can help veterans dealing with PTSD and other similar issues. Puppies Behind Bars is a program in which prisoners train companion dogs for veterans with PTSD, and these canines are featured in holiday cards sold to support the program. (If you know a veteran dealing with PTSD, the VA offers the PTSD Coach Online to help veterans learn to manage symptoms, come up with ways to cope and find professional help.) 4. Help build a home for severely injured vets . Severely injured veterans often come home needing a place to live that better accommodates their physical disabilities. Homes for our Troops builds specially modified homes for veterans that help them live independently. These homes are provided by Homes for Our Troops at no cost to the veterans. The group is able to do so through fund-raisers and donations. 5. Keep veterans off the streets . In times of war, exhausted combat units were removed from the battlefield to ""stand down"" in a place of relative security to rest. The Department of Veterans Affairs' Stand Down program is designed to help homeless veterans ""combat"" life on the streets. Stand Downs are usually one- to three-day events to provide food, shelter, clothing and health screenings to homeless and unemployed veterans. To find a Stand Down program in your community, contact your local VA hospital in the VA Medical Center Directory. A phone call can also make difference in the life of a veteran who is homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. Call 877-4AID-VET, or 877-424-3838, to be connected 24 hours a day, seven days a week with help at the VA. The VA has set a goal of eliminating homelessness among veterans by 2015. 6. Send a care package or a letter . Operation Gratitude is about to send its 1 millionth individually addressed care package to the military community.  The packages are sent to current military members as well as veterans, wounded warriors and their caregivers. As more American troops return to civilian life, the Operation Gratitude veterans program has been growing. It also has a letter writing campaign encouraging everyone to write handwritten letters of gratitude to veterans. Over the next two years, Operation Gratitude hopes to provide a care package to every Vietnam veteran ahead of the 40th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. 7. Help them take flight . According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, an estimated 640 World War II veterans die every day. The Honor Flight Network helps veterans of the ""greatest generation"" make a free pilgrimage to the World War II Memorial on the National Mall in Washington.  You can volunteer to escort these men and women on the flight to see this memorial. Honor Flight also plans to help Korean and Vietnam War veterans visit memorials to those wars in Washington as well. 8. Share their stories . So many veterans' stories have been left untold, but the Library of Congress is collecting the tales of veterans of every war with the Veterans History Project. If you are related to a veteran or know one who has a story to tell, the Library of Congress wants to hear it. Help veterans share their stories before it's too late. For directions on how to get involved, check out the Veterans History Project. 9. Say thank you . It's simple, but it can make an impact. And so many veterans have never heard the words ""thank you."" If you know a veteran or see someone in a military uniform, say something. It may make his or her day and yours.","Simple things can make a difference for the more than 23 million American veterans .
Donate frequent flier miles, give a veteran a ride, write a letter or send a care package .

"Kim Jong Un is not officially on speaking terms with South Korean President Park Geun-hye. But on Thursday, in his New Year's address, he said that could change. Last week, North Korea's government news agency branded Park's election as fraudulent and her father -- himself a former President -- a dictator. But in his televised speech, for the first time ever, the communist leader said he'd talk with Park, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. ""Depending on the mood and circumstances to be created, we have no reason not to hold the highest-level talks,"" Kim said. North Korea's state news agency did not publish those remarks in the official transcript of Kim's speech. His words may represent a small glacial budge, but that doesn't mean things will keep moving, Yonhap cautioned. Still, Kim spoke in detail about the need to improve North-South relations. Moments of thaw . In between bellicose bantering -- particularly against the South's military partnership with the United States -- there have been momentary thaws. Three months ago, some of the North's highest officials paid a snap friendly visit to the South that sparked excited live television coverage. And this past Monday, Seoul's unification minister, Ryoo Kihl-jae, sent a fax to Pyongyang suggesting Cabinet ministers on both sides to meet in January, Yonhap reported. ""The South and the North will have to meet each other and discuss ways toward peaceful reunification,"" Ryoo later told journalists. Both want reunification . Reunification is what both sides are pushing for. ""We should make fresh headway in the national reunification movement for this year,"" Kim said in Thursday's address, according to the official transcript published by the North's Korean Central News Agency. But they have pursued it on starkly different terms. President Park last year announced a 2015 road map to reunification, which she laid out in a speech in April in Dresden, Germany, Yonhap has reported. Dresden was part of East Germany, back when Germany was divided between the democratic West and Soviet Communist East, and South Koreans have drawn hope from that country's reunification for the possible realization of their own. Park's talk has been called the Dresden Declaration. Free market support . Since then, the South has sought support from its international allies for Park's reunification plan, selling a single Korea as an economic boon to a global free market, Yonhap has reported. The North has railed against this, fearing the economically muscular South, aided by other capitalist countries, would, in a reunification, effectively digest the North. Kim does not want Seoul's allies involved and criticized the South's diplomatic efforts again on Thursday. ""To go on a tour around foreign countries touting for 'international cooperation' in resolving the inter-Korean relations issue, the one related with our nation, is a humiliating treachery of leaving its destiny in the hands of outside forces,"" he said. But Kim's conciliatory words following after the South's offer to talk again, and his hints of moving talks up to the highest level could be significant. Ryoo, who extended that invitation, is also Park's right hand in her reunification effort, Yonhap reported. He said his offer to talk was in line with the 2015 road map. Fragile situation . But Kim's speech was not all conciliatory. Some of it was bellicose. He commended his forces' ""showdown with the imperialists,"" possibly a reference to caustic reactions to South Korean-U.S. military exercises. The dictator also praised political killings in his own ranks. ""Our Party detected and purged the anti-Party, counterrevolutionary factionalists at an opportune time and with a correct decision,"" the KCNA speech transcript said. South Korean intelligence officials said that members of the North's ruling party were shot by firing squad for viewing a South Korean soap opera. And there are additional pressure points that have derailed Seoul-Pyongyang agreements in the past, such as the floating of messages via balloon by activists in the South into the North. North Korean soldiers opening fire on these balloons last year struck South Korean territory. There were no reported injuries or damage. The North sees the balloons as a violation of its borders. The South sees them as an exercise of free speech. The South imposed an economic sanctions package on the North in 2010 over the attack on a South Korean navy ship that killed 46 sailors. Seoul demands that Pyongyang take responsibility for torpedoing the vessel before it lifts the sanctions.","Report: Kim Jong Un said, ""We have no reason not to hold the highest-level talks""

"CAMP VICTORY, Iraq -- Stephen Colbert left no doubt about his solidarity with American troops when he taped the first of four Comedy Central shows he'll produce in Iraq this week. Stephen Colbert high-fives a serviceman after submitting to a military-style haircut in Iraq on Sunday. Colbert, wearing a business suit made of the same camouflaged material used for soldiers' desert uniforms, submitted to a regulation military haircut as hundreds of U.S. troops cheered wildly Sunday. The comedian, who satirizes conservative TV pundits on his ""Colbert Report,"" began his ""Operation Iraqi Stephen: Going Commando"" USO tour Sunday in the Baghdad headquarters of the U.S.-led military coalition in Iraq. ""It must be nice in Iraq, because some of you keep coming back again and again,"" Colbert said, joking about the multiple tours many troops have had in Iraq since the 2003 invasion. Some troops had accumulated enough frequent flyer miles to earn them a free ticket to Afghanistan, he joked. Colbert told his guest, Gen. Ray Odierno, he felt ""a little intimidated"" by him, not because he was he top U.S. commander in Iraq, but because it felt like he was ""interviewing Shrek."" Odierno is an imposing bald figure at 6-feet, 5-inches tall. Odierno said the military is ""not yet ready to declare victory"" in Iraq and that there was a little more work to be done for long-term stability. ""I, Stephen Colbert, by the power invested in me by basic cable, officially declare we won the Iraq war,"" Colbert said, as his audience broke out into applause. The interview was interrupted when President Obama appeared on large television screens. The commander-in-chief told his general it was time to ""cut that man's hair."" With white electric hair clippers in his hand, Odierno stood up and began shaving Colbert's trademark thick dark hair. The troops stood and cheered as a female member of Colbert's staff finished the job. After the haircut, Colbert ran through the audience, high-fiving the troops as he showed off his new military look. One Army major said that ""shaving of the hair is an amazing show of support"" that was ""very touching."" Former Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain also made a pre-taped appearance on the show, jokingly reminding the troops to ""take time to clean your muskets."" Lt. Col. Debra Shoemaker, a native of Colbert's hometown of Charleston, South Carolina, said the show was a ""nice break"" from the monotony of service in Iraq. USO Senior Vice President John Hanson said the shows are an important diversion for the troops. Colbert's USO tour is unusual because it's the first time a show taped in a combat zone has been edited and aired so quickly. The Sunday show will be televised on the Comedy Central network Monday night.","Stephen Colbert tapes first of four shows he'll produce in Iraq this week .

"Washington (CNN)As Democrats close to Hillary Clinton recover from their New Year's Eve celebrations and flip their calendar to 2015, many will notice a seemingly unimportant date is fast approaching. For months, pro-Clinton Democrats have pointed to early January -- particularly Jan. 15 -- as a symbolic date for Clinton's presidential aspirations. In conversations with one another and at strategy sessions about a possible 2016 run, former aides and confidants have quietly said that if Clinton doesn't say ""no"" to running by the start of 2015, she is a go for 2016. ""If she hasn't said 'no' by January, it will be a sign she is running,"" said one longtime Clinton friend at last month's Ready for Hillary strategy session in New York. The early January time frame is regularly used by Clinton supporters as a way to put off directly answering the will she/won't she questions posed by reporters. While the date itself is not totally significant, it has become a shorthand for early January. With that time frame now approaching, some in Clinton's orbit are admitting that time is running out for Clinton to say ""no."" RELATED: The Clinton 'announcement' you weren't waiting for . ""If she is not going to do it, she can't let it drag on after January 15,"" said a Democratic strategist close to Clinton. ""If she hasn't said something after that date, people should assume she is running."" The strategist, who said this was the general sense among people close to Clinton, added, ""She has two weeks to say she isn't running."" The reason is simple: Clinton has, so far, sucked up all the oxygen in the Democrats' 2016 conversation. If she lets that continue well into 2015 and then decides to back out, she puts her party -- which already has a thin bench of second tier candidates -- in a tough position. While chatter about former Sen. Jim Webb, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vice President Joe Biden have bubbled up throughout late 2014, neither have caught fire in the polls. The latest CNN/ORC poll finds Webb at a paltry 1%, Warren in second place with 9% support and Biden in third at 8%. Hillary Clinton, by comparison, is at 66% support. Because of the uncertainty around her announcement date, groups urging Clinton to run intend to continue their work well into 2015. Ready for Hillary, the grassroots super PAC organizing on Clinton's behalf, has events planned well into March but plans to close shop once Clinton announces. Groups like Correct the Record, a communications and research shop, and Priorities USA, a fundraising and ad buying outfit, have both pledged to ramp up in early 2015. RELATED: Poll: Hillary Clinton most admired woman, Obama most admired man . Although Clinton's candidacy has long been a forgone conclusion to many of her close confidants, there are still some who hold out that she might decide not to run and has yet to make up her mind. Clinton has tried to play coy with her presidential ambitions, but began to more forcefully acknowledge her thoughts near the end of 2014. She has met with potential campaign staffers, according to her spokesman, and people close to her have begun to carefully line up a potential political operation. Clinton herself even used January 1, 2015 as a time frame for her decision. ""I am going to be making a decision around -- probably after -- the first of the year,"" Clinton said during a September appearance in Mexico City.","Democrats have pointed to early January as a symbolic date for Clinton's presidential aspirations .

"U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan have killed far more people than the United States has acknowledged, have traumatized innocent residents and largely been ineffective, according to a new study released Tuesday. The study by Stanford Law School and New York University's School of Law calls for a re-evaluation of the practice, saying the number of ""high-level"" targets killed as a percentage of total casualties is extremely low -- about 2%. The report accuses Washington of misrepresenting drone strikes as ""a surgically precise and effective tool that makes the U.S. safer,"" saying that in reality, ""there is significant evidence that U.S. drone strikes have injured and killed civilians."" It also casts doubts on Washington's claims that drone strikes produce zero to few civilian casualties and alleges that the United States makes ""efforts to shield the drone program from democratic accountability."" The drone strike program has long been controversial, with conflicting reports on its impact from U.S. and Pakistani officials and independent organizations. President Barack Obama told CNN last month that a target must meet ""very tight and very strict standards,"" and John Brennan, the president's top counter-terrorism adviser, said in April that in ""exceedingly rare"" cases, civilians have been ""accidentally injured, or worse, killed in these strikes."" In contrast to more conservative U.S. statements, the Stanford/NYU report -- titled ""Living Under Drones"" -- offers starker figures published by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, an independent organization based at City University in London. ""TBIJ reports that from June 2004 through mid-September 2012, available data indicate that drone strikes killed 2,562 - 3,325 people in Pakistan, of whom 474 - 881 were civilians, including 176 children. TBIJ reports that these strikes also injured an additional 1,228 - 1,362 individuals,"" according to the Stanford/NYU study. Based on interviews with witnesses, victims and experts, the report accuses the CIA of ""double-striking"" a target, moments after the initial hit, thereby killing first responders. It also highlights harm ""beyond death and physical injury,"" publishing accounts of psychological trauma experienced by people living in Pakistan's tribal northwest region, who it says hear drones hover 24 hours a day. ""Before this we were all very happy,"" the report quotes an anonymous resident as saying. ""But after these drones attacks a lot of people are victims and have lost members of their family. A lot of them, they have mental illnesses."" People have to live with the fear that a strike could come down on them at any moment of the day or night, leaving behind dead whose ""bodies are shattered to pieces,"" and survivors who must be desperately sped to a hospital. The report concedes that ""real threats to U.S. security and to Pakistani civilians exist in the Pakistani border areas now targeted by drones."" And it acknowledges that drone strikes have ""killed alleged combatants and disrupted armed actor networks."" But it concludes that drone strikes, which are conducted by the CIA in a country not at war with the United States, are too harmful to civilians, too sloppy, legally questionable and do more harm to U.S. interests than good. ""A significant rethinking of current U.S. targeted killing and drone strike policies is long overdue,"" it says. ""U.S. policy-makers, and the American public, cannot continue to ignore evidence of the civilian harm and counter-productive impacts of U.S. targeted killings and drone strikes in Pakistan."" The study recommends that Washington undertake measures to rectify collateral damage -- including making public detailed legal justification for strikes, implementing mechanisms transparently to account for civilian casualties, ensuring independent investigations into drone strike deaths, prosecuting cases of civilian casualties and compensating civilians harmed by U.S. strikes in Pakistan. Nine months of research went into the report, according to its authors, which included ""two investigations in Pakistan, more than 130 interviews with victims, witnesses, and experts, and review of thousands of pages of documentation and media reporting."" U.S. authorities have largely kept quiet on the subject of drone strikes in Pakistan. However, the use of armed drones to target and kill suspected terrorists has increased dramatically during the Obama administration, according to Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst and a director at the New America Foundation, a Washington-based think tank that monitors drone strikes. Obama has already authorized 283 strikes in Pakistan, six times more than the number during President George W. Bush's eight years in office, Bergen wrote earlier this month. As a result, the number of estimated deaths from the Obama administration's drone strikes is more than four times what it was during the Bush administration -- somewhere between 1,494 and 2,618. However, an analysis by the New America Foundation says that the civilian casualty rate from drone strikes has been dropping sharply since 2008 despite the rising death toll. ""The number of civilians plus those individuals whose precise status could not be determined from media reports -- labeled 'unknowns' by NAF -- reported killed by drones in Pakistan during Obama's tenure in office were 11% of fatalities,"" said Bergen. ""So far in 2012 it is close to 2%. Under President Bush it was 33%."" The foundation's analysis relies on credible media outlets in Pakistan, which in turn rely on Pakistani officials and local villagers' accounts, Bergen said, rather than on U.S. figures. The drone program is deeply unpopular in Pakistan, where the national parliament voted in April to end any authorization for it. This, however, was ""a vote that the United States government has simply ignored,"" according to Bergen. Obama told CNN's Jessica Yellin this month that the use of armed drones was ""something that you have to struggle with."" ""If you don't, then it's very easy to slip into a situation in which you end up bending rules thinking that the ends always justify the means,"" he continued. ""That's not been our tradition. That's not who we are as a country."" Obama also addressed his criteria for lethal action in the interview, although he repeatedly declined to acknowledge any direct involvement in selecting targets. ""It has to be a target that is authorized by our laws. It has to be a threat that is serious and not speculative. It has to be a situation in which we can't capture the individual before they move forward on some sort of operational plot against the United States,"" Obama said. His security adviser, Brennan, gave the Obama administration's first public justification for drone strikes in his April speech at the Woodrow Wilson Center, a Washington think-tank. Such strikes are used when capture is not a feasible option and are conducted ""in full accordance with the law,"" Brennan said. ""We only authorize a strike if we have a high degree of confidence that innocent civilians will not be injured or killed, except in the rarest of circumstances,"" he said. Despite the ""extraordinary precautions"" taken by the United States, Brennan said, civilians ""have been accidentally injured, or worse, killed in these strikes. It is exceedingly rare, but it has happened. When it does, it pains us, and we regret it deeply, as we do any time innocents are killed in war."" Brennan also cited the ""the seriousness, the extraordinary care"" taken by Obama and his national security team in deciding whether to use lethal force. The London-based rights organization Reprieve, which with the help of a partner organization in Pakistan facilitated access to some of the people interviewed for the Stanford/NYU study, backed its finding that the drone program causes wider damage than is acknowledged by the U.S. government. ""This shows that drone strikes go much further than simply killing innocent civilians. An entire region is being terrorized by the constant threat of death from the skies,"" said Reprieve's director, Clive Stafford Smith. ""Their way of life is collapsing: kids are too terrified to go to school, adults are afraid to attend weddings, funerals, business meetings, or anything that involves gathering in groups. Yet there is no end in sight, and nowhere the ordinary men, women and children of North West Pakistan can go to feel safe.""","A study by Stanford and NYU claims only about 2% of killed targets are ""high-level""

"(CNN) -- At least 11 people were killed and more than 100 others injured after an explosion struck a subway station in Minsk, Belarus, on Monday evening, state media reported, citing President Alexander Lukashenko. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called the blast a ""terrorist attack"" and offered to help investigate who was behind the explosion, the Kremlin said in a statement. Medvedev made the remarks in a telephone call with Lukashenko, who later said at an emergency government meeting that he accepted the offer of assistance. ""I have just talked with the Russian president. Regretfully, they have much experience in this work. Get in touch with your colleagues from (Russian Federal Security Service) FSB, prosecutor's offices, the Interior Ministry, and tell them what assistance is needed,"" Lukashenko said, according to the Interfax news agency. About 50 people were taken to the hospital after the incident, and more were treated at the scene ""with various injuries,"" Belarus' state-run news agency Belta reported. The agency later cited Belarusian Health Minister Vasily Zharko as saying that 126 were hospitalized after the attack and that 22 of them were in critical condition. Lukashenko ordered officials to increase public transport security, according to Belta. He also instructed security officials to investigate whether this latest blast could have any connection with an explosion in downtown Minsk in July 2008, Belta reported. That bomb went off during an open-air concert, injuring some 55 people. ""Perhaps, they are linked. Establish who could benefit in disrupting the calm and stability in the country and find out who is behind the attack,"" Lukashenko said, according to Belta. The agency also reported that Lukashenko said a day of mourning would be declared in Belarus. Rescue workers in at least 12 emergency vehicles responded to the scene, carrying the wounded away in their arms or on stretchers, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. The blast occurred at 6 p.m., a metro police spokesman told Interfax. CNN could not immediately reach officials in Minsk for comment.

"Two obsessed Oregon Ducks football fans plunged into the end zone of holy matrimony in front of the Rose Bowl Thursday morning. Lisa DeFluri and Steve Twomey traded a bridal gown and tuxedo for Oregon jerseys adorned with ""8,"" the number worn by the Ducks' 2014 Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, Marcus Mariota. ""We're not traditional, we love football and love the Ducks,"" Lisa told CNN. ""And it's a Heisman year."" The couple had plans for a wedding on the beach at Santa Cruz, Steve said, ""but this randomly came up and sounded much better."" The ceremony took place in front of the looming Rose Bowl in Pasadena, where the 25-year-old Eugene residents' beloved Ducks would play the Florida State Seminoles that evening in one of two first-ever NCAA Division I semifinal championship football games. The giddy bride and groom stood next to a card table piled with tailgate treats while Steve's stepfather, Randy Miles, presided. ""There's no coincidence these (wedding) rings are shaped in 'O' for Oregon,"" quipped the minister, who got his ordination online. Tailgaters whooped when the couple, sweethearts since seventh grade, kissed. ""I feel like I will want a divorce if they lose, but I feel like we will win,"" Lisa deadpanned. ""She's the sarcastic one,"" said Steve. The couple are both school teachers and attended Western Washington University, but they bleed Oregon green and yellow. ""We grew up loving the Ducks,"" Steve explained. ""I just thought they had really cool helmets when I was in like fourth grade,"" Lisa confessed.

"Why was my son murdered? He was 24, and he had never tried drugs. He didn't even smoke. He had paid half his university costs with a sports scholarship and was working as administrative staff at a cardiac clinic in Morelos, Mexico. Why then was my son suffocated by hit men from the Gulf Cartel? Why did his six friends, just like him, die at his side? The answer, you may tell me, is obvious. ""Because drug traffickers are bad, and must be stopped."" The answer, however, is not that simple. If it were I would not be leading a caravan for peace across the United States. Let's pose the question differently. If Mexico's President Felipe Calderon had treated drug abuse as a question of public health rather than a matter of national security, might my son and his friends still be alive today? If instead of declaring war on drug trafficking, Calderón had pursued a bilateral agenda with the United States to decriminalize drugs and regulate their use, is it possible that they and tens of thousands of other young people killed in the last six years would be still be with us? Declaring a war obliges one's enemy to build up defensive armies. And if the principal tactic of that war is identifying and taking out crime syndicate leaders, it leaves their decapitated, but ever profitable, organizations adrift. President Calderon went on the offensive against cartel ""capos."" The result was a proliferation of criminal gangs. My son, Juan Francisco, and his friends were kidnapped, tortured and killed by one of those new splinter gangs, who did the hit for just $25,000 and two pickup trucks. Why? One of the young men killed with my son had complained about a theft in the valet parking of a bar that turned out to be managed by one of the criminal gangs untethered after drug lord Beltrán Leyva was killed and his lieutenants scattered. ""Comandante H,"" a former Beltrán Leyva confidante, was recently apprehended by authorities, telling his captors, ""I was quite outraged when they murdered Sicilia's son and his friends. Murdering innocent people is not our business. Our business is drugs. But I was fleeing, and I could not do anything."" The horrific story of my son and his friends is one of thousands like it in our country. More than 60,000 people have been killed and 20,000 have disappeared because of the myopic war strategy Felipe Calderon and the Mexican security forces have pursued since 2006. Some murder estimates are even higher. That is why I stopped writing poetry and took to the streets with thousands of other grieving Mexicans to make my son, and other victims like him, visible. Now, I'm traveling across the United States with members of dozens of families broken by violence to seek common cause with Americans whose communities, especially the African American and Latino communities who have so warmly hosted us, that have been battered by the violence and the criminalization that this same counterproductive war inflicts on the U.S. side of the border. Poet's pain over son's cartel slaying leads to movement for peace . The path of peace must be taken by both our nations in concert. We know that President Calderón would not have declared his war without U.S. sponsorship, money and military advice. Drug traffickers would not be able to fight this war without the high-powered assault weapons which, legalized in the United States, now flood over the Mexican border. Drug lords could not afford their wars without massive illegal drug profits and collusion by international banks to launder their money. Forty-plus years after U.S. President Nixon declared the drug war, it is time to concede it hasn't worked any more than alcohol Prohibition worked back in the 1920s. This is why, after traveling in two caravans across Mexico and, talking twice with President Calderon on live television, our movement of war victims called for a caravan across the United States. We started in San Diego on August 12th and we will end in Washington, D.C., on September 12th. With each mile traveled, we seek to raise awareness and spur the good conscience of the people of the United States, while reframing the issues of war and peace on the bilateral agenda of Mexico and the United States. We implore the governments of Mexico and of the United States to accept co-responsibility for ending the disastrous drug war. We've been encouraged by the warmth and breadth of support we've experienced on our journey, from thousands of Americans, including grieving moms who've lost their children to drug addiction and top cops who have decided to speak out against the destruction wrought by prohibition. Yet even as we are carried forward by the momentum of this fresh dialogue, another voice echoes. Every time I close my eyes I see my son's gaze moments before his death. He is afraid, very afraid, and behind his fear I hear a horrible question. ""If drugs were legalized, and there were no weapons, would I be here, just about to die? Go, dad, leave all your things behind and tell everyone that this war is destroying more people than the drugs themselves. Tell them that no prohibition is worth the death of any person. Go tell them that we need to find peace, so that no other father will have to see his son die like this, and no son will again suffer what I am suffering."" This is why we have come to the United States. If we do not make peace together, we will never find it.

"Fierce fighting raged on the outskirts of Tripoli on Sunday as militias continued to battle for control of the airport in what's being called the worst fighting in Libya since the 2011 revolution. Clashes were concentrated around the airport, the airport road and a number of residential areas where militias have fought over the past week, residents said. At least five people have been killed, one local official said. The latest assaults were launched by militias from the city of Misrata and an Islamist militia umbrella group in the capital known as the ""Libyan Revolutionaries Operations Room."" The airport has been under the control of militia from the Western Mountains city of Zintan for the past three years. According to residents in different parts of Tripoli, thick plumes of black smoke rose from the direction of the airport and large blasts and gunfire echoed across the city. Speaking by phone to Libyan television on Sunday, a spokesman for the municipal council of Qasr Bin Ghasheer, the area around the airport, said at least five people from the area had been killed in the fighting so far. 'Libya's future cannot be left to one renegade general' The spokesman, Mohammed Abdul Rahman, said it was hard to get an accurate casualty figure because of the intensity of fighting and limited movement in the area. ""Shells are falling on houses, children are terrified and most people have evacuated. ... Our area is suffering,"" he told the privately run al-Nabaa TV. There was no official overall casualty figure for the fighting in other areas impacted over the last seven days. At the airport, the Libyan government said 90% of planes parked there were damaged and images on social media showed various parts of the facility destroyed. The United Nations and other international organizations and businesses have temporarily evacuated staff from Libya. The U.S. Embassy in Tripoli said in a statement that some rounds from the fighting have hit near the compound, but all personnel ""are safe and accounted for."" It called for an end to the violence. Addressing the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, Tarek Mitri, head of its mission in Libya, issued a stark warning. ""As the number of military actors mobilizing and consolidating their presence within the capital continues to grow, there is a mounting sense of a probable imminent and significant escalation in the conflict. The stakes are high for all sides,"" Mitri said. ""We are in the middle of an all-out confrontation between two major rival groups in the Libyan capital. That confrontation, born out of the deep political polarization, is playing itself out at the country's international airport."" Mitri said. Libya's Foreign Minister Mohamed Abdulaziz also addressed the Security Council. He warned of Libya heading toward becoming a ""failed state."" Abdulaziz said Libya needed more international support and asked the United Nations to consider a ""stabilization and institution-building mission."" He insisted that his country was not requesting foreign military intervention. The Libyan Interim Government said earlier in the week it was discussing the possibility of requesting international forces. Three years after the revolution and NATO military intervention that overthrew the Gadhafi regime, a weak central government has been outgunned by increasingly powerful militias. The militia fighting for control of the airport from the city of Zintan and Misrata are among the most heavily armed in the country.","Fierce fighting in Libya worst since 2011 revolution .

"(CNN)There are only nine months left to get that flying car designed and in production. The Internet has reminded us of the very specific vision ""Back to the Future II"" had for October 21, 2015. Flying cars zipping through the air, auto-drying clothes that fit to your body, shoes that lace up on their own and time travel are all the norm when Marty McFly  and his girlfriend, Jennifer, played by Michael J. Fox and Elisabeth Shue, land in that year. And don't even get us started on the fact that we still don't have time travel. The 1989 film did highlight a few technologies that are currently in our present -- or at least similar items. Future Marty has a video call with his coworker and boss, people are able to answer the phone with glasses that are very much like Google glass, and of course hoverboards do exist, though they're not as cool or as high-flying as in the movie. There's also no ""Jaws 19,"" but we do have 3-D movies and holograms, as seen on the screen. As for flying cars, there is the  Terrafugia Transition and the AeroMobil, but don't count on coasting the friendly skies in those anytime soon, especially using banana peels and such for fuel. Futurist Michael Rogers told Newsweek the movie did get a few things right. ""Three definite hits: biometrics, large screen home displays, video telephone calls,"" Rogers said. ""Skype and FaceTime are part of everyday usage; by the end of the decade I think it will be totally natural for younger users to transition from text to audio to video in a single call, depending on the content at the moment."" You still have a wait, however, for things like hydrated pizza.","In the film, Marty McFly traveled to October 21, 2015 .

"(CNN) -- Alfred Kahn, an economist who became known as the ""architect of deregulation"" under the Carter administration, has died of cancer. He was 93. It is widely accepted that Kahn's efforts dismantled air travel as the domain of the elite and paved the way for low-cost airlines. He died at his home in Ithaca, New York, on Monday, according to a statement from Cornell University where he was a professor emeritus of political economy. Kahn spearheaded the U.S. Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 when he chaired the now-defunct Civil Aeronautics Board. At the time, a coast-to-coast ticket cost an exorbitant sum of money and no new airlines were taking flight. Airlines such as Pan Am, Eastern and Braniff ruled the skies, and the aeronautics board governed them, controlling routes and ticket prices, keeping fares high and eliminating competition. ""Nobody could fly an airplane commercially on any route without specific permission from the Civil Aeronautics Board, and price competition, cutting prices, was illegal,"" Kahn told CNN in 1998, recalling that period. He wanted change that would allow competition and let prices be set by the marketplace rather than the government. The result of his work was the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, signed into law by then-President Jimmy Carter, who predicted it would reduce airfares by up to 50 percent and open up air travel to millions of Americans who previously couldn't afford it. The Department of Transportation became the industry watchdog, and airlines took control of themselves. Deregulation gave birth to the concepts of airport hubs and frequent flyer miles and led to the creation of new airlines. ""His vision and actions resulted in a profound transformation of the U.S. airline industry and strongly influenced international air transportation,"" the publishers of Aviation Week and Space Technology said when they named him the winner of the 1997 Welch Pogue Award, which recognizes contributions to aviation. When he chaired the aviation board, Kahn was also remembered for his campaign to eliminate ""'bureaucratese' or gobbledygook"" at the agency, said colleague Robert Frank, a professor of management at Cornell's Johnson School. ""If you can't explain what you're doing in plain English, you're probably doing something wrong,"" Kahn once told the board's staff. After his term at the aeronautics board, Carter tapped him to serve as his advisor on inflation. When the administration admonished him for alarming the public that the country could face a ""deep, deep depression"" if Carter's anti-inflation policies failed, Kahn began using the euphemism ""banana"" for the word ""depression,"" Cornell university said in a statement. Kahn later switched ""banana"" to ""kumquat"" when a large banana company complained. He is survived by his wife, Mary; three children; a nephew for whom he and Mary were legal guardians; eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, the university said.","Kahn's efforts have paved the way for low-cost airlines .

"The Selfies at Funerals page on Tumblr is a collection of, you guessed it, cell phone self-portraits snapped before, during and post-memorial service by the young and seemingly clueless. The collection was built by Fast Company editor Jason Feifer from images uploaded to Twitter and Instagram and is growing into a Web phenomenon. There are other sites that collect funeral selfies, too. While stopping to gawk at the insensitivity of a few is fun, it's worth asking what we should do at funerals, in addition to what we should never do (hint: take selfies). For answers, CNN Living turned to the Emily Post Institute's Lizzie Post, 31, the great-great-granddaughter of the original doyenne of appropriate behavior herself and co-author of ""Emily Post's Etiquette 18th Edition."" We asked Lizzie how to dress, what to say, how to keep busy and what to do with that cell phone burning a hole in your pocket during a memorial service. An edited collection of her responses is below. CNN: When are photos appropriate at funerals, if ever? Are casket photos allowed? Post: I'm kind of grossed out by the fact that people are turning funerals into selfie photo shoots. I know some young people who have never been to a funeral. There are only a few of them we go to in our lifetime, and I think that's one reason why you see this type of behavior. I don't think taking a picture of yourself with the casket is a good idea. And I don't know many people who want to take a group photo at a funeral. People are usually not in the mood to have their photo taken that day. If you're the kind of person who photographs every outfit you wear, it's one thing if you're a fashion blogger who gives advice on this type of thing, but I don't find it appropriate that you're making the cute faces and duck lips and hashtagging it #funeral. ""'On-my-way-to-the-funeral-selfie' Here's what I wore, don't I look fantastic?"" You know it's not about you, it's about the deceased, so can you back down on the selfies for the moment? CNN: Are selfies at a funeral ever OK? Post: No! CNN: What basic fashion rules should funeral attendees follow? Are black and dark blue still de rigueur? Post: Darker colors are still the preferred colors for funerals. However, they aren't the only choice: You wouldn't be distasteful if you were in a camel-colored wool jacket. But you don't want to look like you're in party mode. So leave the sparkly hot pink tops at home, unless requested. Sometimes colorful clothing is an option. If the deceased has requested that everyone wear Hawaiian shirts, then go for it, but if it hasn't been requested, go for the darker colors. CNN: What basic phrase of comfort might a funeral guest say to those closest to the departed? Post: ""I'm so sorry for your loss."" Say a fond memory that you have. It shouldn't be a long story. Both my grandparents have passed away in the past few years, and it was comforting to hear someone say at my grandfather's memorial service, ""He was always so gracious."" Something simple, positive and quick. Things to stay away from: ""Boy, I hope he had life insurance."" ""It was time for him to go."" Or ""At the end, there was so much suffering."" Those are things people can find hurtful, and they often don't appreciate hearing them. You don't want to bring those things up to someone who has just lost a loved one. CNN: What's the best way to offer help to grieving people during a funeral? Post: Don't say, ""Call me if you need anything."" Rather than saying, ""You let me know if you need anything,"" offer something specific. Say, ""I'd love to cook dinner for you next week."" Or ""Would you like me to come and take care of the kids the day of the funeral?"" You want to make sure you're extending a specific offer of time and place rather than something vague. CNN: Is it still OK to bring food to a wake? Post: You want to get a feel for how the wake or memorial service is being set up. Some are catered, so you don't have to worry about that. The host should let people know. In some communities, the bringing of food is healing and comforting. Whether to serve the food or not is up to the host. CNN: Any special tips on phone etiquette during a funeral? Post: You turn that cell phone off! That way you're not taking selfies. Turn it off and put it away. If you're on call (for work), put it on vibrate and step away if you need to respond to a call. But this is the time when you need to focus on those who are grieving and you just don't want to be that person whose cell phone goes off in the middle of the service. CNN: In short, what should parents tell their kids as they head to a service? Post: Be quiet, be respectful and pay attention. What do you think of the ""funeral selfies"" phenomenon? Share your take in the comments section below.","Selfies at Funerals documents self-portraits people take at memorial services .

"(CNN) -- In her first interview since giving birth, the teenage daughter of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said having a child is not ""glamorous,"" and that telling young people to be abstinent is ""not realistic at all."" Bristol Palin says ""everyone should just wait 10 years"" to have a baby, rather than when you're young. ""It's just, like, I'm not living for myself anymore. It's, like, for another person, so it's different,"" Bristol Palin told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren. ""And just you're up all night. And it's not glamorous at all,"" she said. ""Like, your whole priorities change after having a baby."" The 18-year-old, who gave birth in late December, said she is being helped tremendously by her mother, grandmother, cousins and other family members. She is engaged to teen father Levi Johnston, who is now working for his father and trying to complete school, but said she wishes that she waited another 10 years to have a baby. It was ""harder than labor"" telling her parents she was pregnant. ""Well, we were sitting on the couch, my best friend and Levi, and we had my parents come and sit on the couch, too. And we had my sisters go upstairs,"" Bristol said. ""And we just sat them down, and I just -- I couldn't even say it. I was just sick to my stomach. ""And so finally, my best friend just, like, blurted it out. And it was just, like -- I don't even remember it because it was just, like, something I don't want to remember."" Todd and Sarah Palin were ""scared just because I have to -- I had to grow up a lot faster than they ever would have imagined,"" Bristol said. Her parents insisted that she and her boyfriend hash out a ""game plan"" immediately. And now her parents and relatives are all pitching in to help take care of the child, particularly when Bristol is at school during the day. Van Susteren was delicate with the teenager but pointedly asked if ""contraception is an issue here."" ""Is that something that you were just lazy about or not interested, or do you have philosophical or religious opposition to it,"" Van Susteren asked. Bristol quickly answered that she didn't want to get into specifics. The best option is abstinence, the teen said, but added that she didn't think that was ""realistic.""  Watch Bristol Palin say that abstinence is ""not realistic at all"" » . While her mother was running for vice president, the teenager said her treatment in the media was ""evil."" She said she read some of the tabloids that wrote about her. People didn't understand, she said, and some media reports perpetuated falsehoods about her experience. ""They thought that, like, my mom was going to make me have the baby, and it was my choice to have the baby,"" she said. ""And it's just -- that kind of stuff just bothered me."" Van Susteren asked, ""But this is your issue? This is your decision?"" Bristol answered yes. ""(It) doesn't matter what my mom's views are on it. It was my decision, and I wish people would realize that, too,"" she said. The network interview was Bristol's idea, the teen said. And she apparently sprung the news to her parents that she was going to speak publicly the day before the network taping. The teen said she wanted to tell her story so that other young people might think twice about having sex. ""I'd love to [be] an advocate to prevent teen pregnancy because it's not, like, a situation that you would want to strive for, I guess,"" Bristol said. Gov. Palin made an unexpected appearance during the interview in Alaska, and Van Susteren asked her about her daughter's pregnancy. ""Not the most ideal situation, certainly you make the most of it,"" the governor said. Bristol is a ""strong and bold woman, and she is an amazing mom,"" Palin said. ""And this little baby is very lucky to have her as a mama. He's going to be just fine.""","Bristol Palin said she wishes she had waited 10 years to have a baby .

"One of the most high-profile women accused of connections with Mexico's drug trade was extradited to the United States Thursday, officials said. Mexican police handed over Sandra Avila Beltran, known as ""The Queen of the Pacific,"" to U.S. marshals at an airport in central Mexico Thursday morning, Mexico's Attorney General's Office said in a statement. She will face cocaine trafficking charges in a federal court in Florida, prosecutors said. 14 bodies found in Mexico . Avila was once a key drug trafficking link between Colombia and Mexico, prosecutors have said. She was arrested in Mexico City on September 28, 2007, smiling before cameras as authorities trumpeted her detention. Since then, her life has been the subject of a best-selling book and a popular ballad. ""The more beautiful the rose, the sharper the thorns,"" says one line in ""The Queen of Queens,"" Los Tigres del Norte's song describing Avila. Her eye-catching nickname has regularly made headlines as Mexico's case against her made its way through the nation's courts. A judge convicted her on money laundering charges, but ruled that Mexican prosecutors didn't provide enough evidence to convict her of drug trafficking. In 2011, authorities in Mexico City said they were investigating a tip that prison medical personnel had allowed a doctor to give Avila a Botox injection. Avila denied that accusation, Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency reported. For more than two years, Avila has tried to block a U.S. extradition request. A Mexican judge ruled that she could be extradited in June. A 2008 U.S. Congressional Research Service report described Avila as ""a senior member of the Sinaloa cartel who was instrumental"" in building ties with Colombian traffickers. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Avila was suspected of conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the United States along with Juan Diego Espinosa, a Colombian national who was also known as ""The Tiger."" 4 Mexican military officials accused of organized crime ties . The DEA said that in November 2001, Espinosa, Avila and others ""allegedly arranged the shipment of cocaine from Colombia to the United States by ship."" The ship, loaded with 9,291 kilograms of cocaine, was boarded by U.S. agents near Manzanillo, on Mexico's Pacific coast. U.S. authorities extradited Espinosa from Mexico in 2008. A judge sentenced him to six years in prison after he pleaded guilty to a cocaine distribution conspiracy charge in 2009. A court document signed as part of the plea agreement said that he and Avila had taken part in a deal to distribute 100 kilograms of cocaine in Chicago. In the United States, Avila faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if she is convicted of charges of conspiracy to import and sell cocaine, according to a 2004 indictment filed in U.S. district court. In a 2009 interview with Anderson Cooper that aired on ""60 Minutes"" and CNN, Avila denied the charges against her, and blamed Mexico's government for allowing drug trafficking to flourish. ""In Mexico there's a lot of corruption, A lot. Large shipments of drugs can come into the Mexican ports or airports without the authorities knowing about it. It's obvious and logical. The government has to be involved in everything that is corrupt,"" she said.","The so-called ""Queen of the Pacific"" faces cocaine trafficking charges .

"(CNN) -- Troops in the southern Philippines early Sunday took advantage of martial law to hunt down those believed responsible for last week's killings there. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo declared martial law in the southern province of Maguindanao after 57 people were killed in politically motivated violence. Maj. Randolph Cabangbang, deputy of operations for the Eastern Mindanao command, told CNN on Saturday that searchers have made arrests and recovered firearms and vehicles from a clan implicated in the killings. He said local residents welcome the deployment of the troops. ""We need this because we do not want those who perpetrated the crime to slip out of the province. And we may be having a hard time catching them,"" he said. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner Jr. said martial law -- under which police can make arrests without a warrant -- went into effect at 9 p.m. Congress would have to approve any extension beyond 60 days. Brawner said the measure was invoked to impose peace on the region after the unrest, which led to troops being mobilized. ""Life is to resume normally and martial law is established to prevent new violence, with troops on the ground monitoring any possible violence breakout,"" he said. ""But the civilian government will be running the affairs of the province, not a military governor."" Military police have detained three brothers and their father on suspicion of involvement in the unrest: Akmad Ampatuan, the vice governor of Maguindanao; Anwar Ampatuan, the mayor of Sherif Auguak, Maguindanao's capital; and Zaldy Ampatuan, governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. Andal Ampatuan Sr., the patriarch, became ill and was hospitalized after he, too, was taken in. ""Local government will function, it will prevent armed groups from wreaking havoc ... and it will allow the officials search and find the guilty parties,"" Brawner said. Security forces on Friday searched the home of Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay and son of the provincial governor of Maguindanao, according to Brawner. Authorities say Andal Ampatuan Jr. directed the Nov. 23 politically motivated killings. Weapons were found in the house, Brawner said. On Tuesday, Philippine authorities charged Ampatuan and other suspects with 25 counts of murder in the killings. Still more suspects were taken into custody Friday. The Philippine military is investigating its own forces in connection with the case as well, Brawner said. The National Bureau of Investigation has moved a third witness to Manila for questioning, the Philippines News Agency reported Thursday. ""At the moment, we are interviewing the witness so that we would know what he knows about the incident in Maguindanao,"" NBI Director Nestor Mantaring said. The witness claimed to have been at the site during the massacre. ""He is very vital,"" Mantaring said. ""From what I know ... he knows a lot of information regarding the incident."" Among the victims in the massacre were the wife and sister of political candidate Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao. He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan, the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself. Witnesses and local officials have blamed the younger Ampatuan, a longtime ally of the Philippines president and a known warlord. They said the killings were an attempt to block Mangudadatu from challenging him in the May gubernatorial election. Also killed were a dozen journalists who had accompanied the women. Group: Philippines most dangerous country for journalists . Asked why martial law was imposed 12 days after the killings, Cabangbang said authorities ""were trying to build a case -- a tight case"" against suspects. ""But it is taking long to build a case, so I think the government gave us a free hand in arresting those who are suspects, and allowed us to search, even without warrant. So we really need this declaration of state of martial law."" Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the Philippines. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation. Suspicion fell on Ampatuan after a government construction vehicle was found at the hastily dug mass grave that held the bodies of the massacre victims.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- A woman blinded in an acid attack seven years ago said Sunday she stopped the ""eye for an eye"" punishment for her attacker because ""such revenge is not worth it."" A physician was to drop acid -- under legal supervision -- into the eyes of Majid Movahedi on Sunday, according to Fars News Agency, to punish him for throwing acid in Bahrami's face. The act disfigured her face and blinded her. ""I never intended to allow Majid to be blinded,"" Ameneh Bahrami told CNN. ""... Each of us, individually, must try and treat others with respect and kindness in order to have a better society."" Bahrami stopped the punishment minutes before it was carried out, she said, adding that Movahedi already had been given anesthetic. She said two men were instrumental in bringing about her change of heart: a doctor at a clinic in Spain and Amir Sabouri, an Iranian who helped her get medical attention. Sabouri told her to forgive Movahedi and prove to the world that Iranians are kind and forgiving, she said. However, she said Movahedi is unrepentant and has been rude to her, even after she halted his punishment. . This week marks the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan in the Islamic world, and pardons and commuted sentences commonly occur as a show of compassion leading into the holiday. An Iranian court convicted Movahedi in 2008 of pouring a bucket of acid on Bahrami, after she had rejected his unwanted advances for two years. Bahrami had demanded at the time that the court sentence the man to suffer the same fate he had inflicted upon her, and the court agreed, citing provisions in Islamic law. The sentence was to be carried out in May 2011, but a court postponed it after Amnesty International protested against it on the grounds of cruelty. Restitution in such cases is about $200,000, Bahrami said, but the law dictates she should only receive half of that because she is a woman. She argued the issue with the judge, she said, and he told her to speak with lawmakers and convince them to change the law. She said Sunday she has asked for a meeting with lawmakers and expects to talk with them in the future. She said she intends to collect and use the money for her medical treatment. She said Movahedi does not have the money, and she has asked authorities to keep him in jail until he pays her. Bahrami says she first met Movahedi in 2002 when they attended the same school. She was a 24-year-old electronics student. He was 19. She never noticed him until he sat next to her in class and brushed up against her. Bahrami says she knew it wasn't an accident. ""I moved away from him,"" she said, ""but he brushed up against me again."" Bahrami said that over the next two years, Movahedi harassed her and made threats, even asking her to marry him. ""He told me he would kill me. He said, 'You have to say yes.' "" On a November afternoon in 2004, his threats turned to violence when he followed her from the medical engineering company where she worked. As she walked to the bus stop, she sensed someone behind her. She turned around and was startled to see Movahedi, who threw something over her. What felt like fire on her face was acid searing through her skin. ""I was just yelling, 'I'm burning! I'm burning! For God's sake, somebody help me,' "" she said. The acid seeped into her eyes, and streamed down her face into her mouth. When she covered her face with her hands, streaks of acid ran down her fingers and onto her forearms. She said Sunday that she does not expect others to follow her example of forgiveness, but noted that if they do, ""it would prove that they are great human beings."" She has published a book in Germany, and said she is now trying to write a book in Persian about her ordeal and women in Iranian society. ""I will be personally responsible for naming names and will answer for it,"" she said. In 2009, Bahrami told CNN that she had undergone more than a dozen surgeries on her badly scarred face, but still imagined that in the future she would have a wedding day. ""I always see myself as someone who can see and sometimes see myself in a beautiful wedding gown, and why not?"" she said.

"The turmoil in Ukraine has swept aside its president, brought about the release a prominent opposition leader and raised fears the country could break apart. After the bloodshed in the streets of Kiev last week -- the deadliest violence Ukraine has suffered since its independence 22 years ago --  the political twists and turns came thick and fast over the weekend. As a new week begins, uncertainty has taken a hold in the divided nation as Ukraine tries to reshape its political landscape. An arrest warrant has been issued for ousted President Viktor Yanukovych over the killings of civilians, a government official said Monday. But officials don't know where he is. Here's what you need to know to get caught up: . Who's in charge? It depends whom you ask. The Parliament voted to oust Yanukovych, a key demand of protesters. It appointed seasoned lawmaker Oleksandr Turchinov as a new speaker who will take on Yanukovych's duties until new elections in May. Turchinov, a longtime ally of opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko, has promised a new interim government by Tuesday. ""We have a legitimate source of authority in Kiev, which is the democratically elected Parliament and a democratically, constitutionally elected speaker of parliament, who is acting president,"" Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, who helped broker a peace deal between the government and the opposition, said on CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS. But Yanukovych claims he's still in charge, saying he was forced to leave Kiev because of a ""coup."" ""I don't plan to leave the country. I don't plan to resign. I am the legitimate President,"" he said Saturday in a televised broadcast. But acting Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said Monday that arrest warrant has been issued for Yanukovych. ""As of this morning, a criminal case on mass killings of civilians has been opened. Yanukovych and several other officials have been placed on the wanted list,"" Avakov wrote Monday on his Facebook page. Where exactly is Yanukovych? Unclear. He made his TV broadcast from Kharkiv, a pro-Russian stronghold near the border. And he reportedly tried to board a charter plane Saturday night in the eastern city of Donetsk, but was turned away because he didn't have the right papers. On Sunday, he was staying at his private residence in Balaklava in the southern region of Crimea, Avakov said, adding that Yanukovych is believed to traveling in three vehicles with his chief of staff. But Avakov said he doesn't know where Yanukovych was Monday. He's definitely not in his lavish presidential compound near Kiev that thousands of Ukrainians have now been able to explore after he fled. People have been roaming around the mansion and its vast grounds, staring at the opulence in which Yanukovych lived, including peacocks, vintage cars and a huge galleon-style riverboat for parties. Does the former president have any support left? His political party appears to have turned against him, saying it blames him for the ""robbery and deception"" of the nation. It accused Yanukovych of making illegal orders that led to casualties, financial debt and shame in the eyes of the world. But it's notable that Yanukovych was recently in Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine. It's his traditional support base and a predominantly Russian-speaking region. People in the east, the country's industrial heartland, tend to look to Russia as Ukraine's key ally. Many of them are suspicious of the Europe-leaning views of those in western Ukraine, who were at the heart of the protests against Yanukovych that filled central Kiev for months. The demonstrations began after Yanukovych scrapped a European Union trade deal and turned toward Russia for financial support. Does this mean Ukraine is in danger of splitting? A lot of people with Russian heritage in eastern Ukraine feel that their cultural identity is under threat with the pro-European side in the ascendancy in Kiev. ""I think that divide goes very, very deep -- it's regional, it's linguistic, it's religious,"" New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, whose father grew up in Ukraine, told CNN's Zakaria. In many parts of Ukraine, people have toppled statues of former Russian communist leader Vladimir Lenin, a founder of the Soviet Union. The statues are symbols of Russian pride. In Kharkiv, a tense rift has opened up between those who want to tear down the city's Lenin statue, one of the biggest in the country, and those who want to keep it. Some analysts say they fear parts of eastern Ukraine could push to break away from a pro-Western government in Kiev in favor of Russia. The task for Yanukovych's opponents is to chart a course for Ukraine that keeps all sides on board. ""They need to be inclusive,"" said Poland's Sikorski. Acting President Turchinov said Sunday that Ukraine is ready to talk to Kremlin to try to improve relations, but made clear that Kiev's return to European integration would be a priority. How has Russia reacted to the political change? Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, condemned what he called Western attempts to influence the outcome of the turmoil in Ukraine. ""Either they don't understand the consequences of what they're doing, or they're engaged in a very provocative game of destabilizing Ukraine and therefore Eastern Europe,"" he said in a post on his official Twitter account. The Russian foreign ministry says it has recalled its ambassador from Ukraine to Moscow for consultations, citing ""the aggravation of the situation."" Everybody's waiting to see what Russian President Vladimir Putin, a key backer of Yanukovych, does next. ""If you look through Putin's eyes specifically, this is his area of interest,"" said David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker and a former foreign correspondent in Moscow. Putin, whose country just finished hosting the Winter Olympics in Sochi, won't quietly let Ukraine shift into a Western orbit, Remnick said. ""I think Putin is in a very tough, assertive mode and it has nothing to do with snowboarding, it has to do with his geostrategic, regional interests,"" he said. ""It has to do with differentiating himself from the West, morally as well as politically, and I think he's a very tough figure to deal with now."" What is the U.S. stance? National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that it ""would be a grave mistake"" if Putin intervened militarily in the crisis. ""The United States is on the side of the Ukrainian people,"" she said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" The people expressed themselves peacefully, she said, and Yanukovych ""turned on"" the people by using violence against them. But Washington has a delicate task getting involved in a crisis in an area that Russia sees as its backyard. ""This is really complicated for us,"" Remnick said. On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about Ukraine, expressing support for the results of the Parliament's decisions and asking Russia not to not use military force in the country, according to a senior State Department official. The State Department has warned U.S. citizens to defer all non-essential travel to Ukraine. Poland's Sikorski, meanwhile, urged Ukrainian leaders to keep dialogue open with Moscow. ""The new Ukrainian government needs to be in touch, needs to have a conversation with Russia, which is an important neighbor, just like Poland,"" he said. ""Because, apart from anything else, Ukraine needs the lower gas price and doesn't want Russia to play the separatist card."" Who's likely to lead Ukraine next? There are plenty of candidates but no clear favorite yet. Turchinov, who Parliament appointed acting leader, is at the helm until elections on May 25. The anti-Yanukovych coalition is fractious, full of different voices. ""The challenge for the opposition moving forward from here is going to be maintaining unity,"" said CNN correspondent Phil Black. Who's who in Ukraine . Former world champion heavyweight boxer Vitali Klitschko has been the most well-known opposition figure during the crisis. He heads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms party. There's also Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a former foreign minister. What about Tymoshenko? Former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, considered a hero of a 2004 revolution against Yanukovych, was released Saturday after 2½ years behind bars. She had lost to Yanukovych in elections in 2010. A year later, she was sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with Russia. After her release, she addressed cheering crowds in Kiev's Independence Square, calling Yanukovych a ""terrible dictator."" She then passed on a not-so-subtle message. ""There'll be no Ukraine but the Ukraine you want,"" she said. ""And I'm the guarantor of that Ukraine."" She said Sunday that she doesn't want to be considered for the nomination for prime minister, suggesting she may have her eye on the presidency. But some observers say the protests in Kiev have fed a desire for a new, untainted generation of leaders to step forward. ""A lot of people who made this revolution feel like this movement has created a lot of new leaders, a lot of young leaders -- that now it's their turn,"" Julia Ioffe, senior editor at The New Republic, told ""CNN Newsroom."" How did the changes come about? The unrest began November, when Yanukovych turned his back on trade talks with the European Union. Instead, Russia offered to lend money to Ukraine in a deal worth billions of dollars and lower the gas prices it charges. The Ukranian economy is struggling, plagued by corruption, inefficiency and heavy government debt. But the pact with Russia prompted protesters into the streets of Kiev. They stayed in the center of the city for months in a standoff with security forces that occasionally flared into the violence. The situation worsened dramatically last week as clashes between the two sides intensified and gunfire broke out, leaving 88 people dead. Amid the chaos on the streets, foreign diplomats stepped up efforts to find an agreement between Yanukovych and the opposition to end the fighting. On Friday, the intense negotiations resulted in a breakthrough deal to reduce the president's powers and roll back parts of the Constitution, which gave them to him. Yanukovich then left the capital and security forces withdrew from key protest areas --  setting in motion the changes that unfolded over the weekend.","Ousted President Viktor Yanukovych was in Crimea on Sunday, an official says .

"(CNN) -- On Monday, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced changes in the way police will deal with people caught with small amounts of marijuana. Now police officers will no longer arrest anyone caught with less than 25 grams of pot. Instead, they will issue a summons to appear in court. De Blasio hopes this policy will spare young people the burden of a criminal conviction. ""A summons will not affect their future. An arrest could,"" de Blasio said at a news conference. De Blasio's plan sounds like a significant step away from New York's controversial ""stop and frisk"" policies, the kind of policing de Blasio campaigned against when he ran as a progressive candidate for mayor. But upon closer examination, de Blasio's policy doesn't seem so progressive. At best, it is a well-meaning baby step toward more effective law enforcement. At worst, it is a policy that ignores the racial disparities in marijuana arrests -- and one that might have unintended consequences for the people it is trying to help. One troubling aspect of de Blasio's new policy is that it does not address the issue of who will be stopped for minor marijuana possession.  According to the Drug Policy Alliance, an advocacy group aimed at easing drug laws, in the first eight months of this year, 86% of those arrested for possessing small amounts of pot in New York were African-American and Latino (by comparison, the 2010 Census shows that slightly over half of the city's population is African-American and Latino). So while young people of color may avoid being taken to jail for pot possession, it is still overwhelmingly likely that it will be young people of color who find themselves with a summons for possession. De Blasio's plan also holds worrisome implications for due process. Previously, after a person was arrested, the prosecutor's office would review the case and decide whether to pursue it. Under the new policy, this crucial step is circumvented. A person who is given a ticket for minor pot possession must appear in a courtroom, even if their arrest was legally questionable. Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson told The New York Times that allowing police to write tickets without oversight raised ""a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without safeguards currently in place."" And if people miss their court dates, they could still face warrants for their arrest. What's more, NYPD officers will retain wide discretion under de Blasio's new policy. Police officers will be allowed to make a judgment call on whether to issue a summons or arrest a person. That seems awfully trusting of a police department that has not only been cited for unconstitutional racial profiling, but one that also has aggressively ramped up marijuana enforcement efforts. Consider that marijuana-related arrests under de Blasio are on par with those of his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg. De Blasio cannot remake the law on marijuana; that is up to the New York state legislature. Yet what if he were to take a bold stance in favor of marijuana decriminalization? This could spark the same types of discussions that ultimately led voters in Colorado and Washington to legalize pot. With the Pew Center reporting that public support for marijuana legalization is at an all-time high, the mayor of New York should be out in front of this debate. At the very least, de Blasio should make clear to his police commissioner that he expects the NYPD to move away from law enforcement techniques that led the New York City Civil Liberties Union to declare New York ""the nation's marijuana arrest capital."" De Blasio's new marijuana policy should be seen only as a down payment on long overdue NYPD reforms. As a national figure representing a new generation of progressive leadership, he owes all New Yorkers his full commitment to equal outcomes under the law.","Raul Reyes: NY Mayor de Blasio says cops won't arrest someone with small amount of pot .
They'll get summons instead. It's good step, but doesn't address racial aspects of stops, he says .
Reyes: New rule requires court appearance. Miss it, and there'll be arrest warrant. This a flaw .
Reyes: De Blasio, show your progressivism. Take bold stance in favor of pot decriminalization ."

"(CNN)  -- Postmaster General John E. Potter has come under criticism for his total 2008 compensation of nearly $800,000, but the agency's board of governors says the pay is less than what leaders of several other independent government agencies receive. Postmaster General John Potter isn't paid as much as leaders of some other independent government agencies. And the amount is far below that given to CEOs in the private sector, even though compensation and benefit packages for postal service officers are required by law to be comparable to those given to private-sector employees doing similar work, the board of governors says. ""That's a difficult standard to achieve given the compensation restraints within the federal sector,"" said Carolyn Lewis Gallagher, the chairman of the agency's board of governors. She added that the postal service, with $75 billion in revenues and nearly 700,000 employees, compares with Fortune 100 companies. Potter received a salary of $263,575 in 2008. His total compensation of nearly $800,000 included deferred earnings toward his retirement plan. Compensation and benefit packages for officers of the postal service are governed by Congress and not funded by taxpayers. Gallagher said effective compensation was necessary for effective managers. ""Even in these difficult times, the postmaster general continues to exhibit visionary leadership, effecting billions of dollars in cost reductions,"" she said. Critics have tried to paint Potter's compensation as excessive, given that he had recently appeared before Congress warning that, with a $2.8 billion loss in 2008, the postal service may need to reduce its congressionally mandated six-days-a-week delivery schedule. iReport.com: Mail five days a week? ""Apparently compensating executives well is still a possibility at the post office,"" Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union told CNN on Tuesday. ""And despite all the delivery problems they may have, despite the deficits they may have, executive compensation is still nice, fat and round."" Other independent government agencies pay their executives much more, however. Richard Syron, former Freddie Mac CEO, had a compensation package of $3.4 million and reportedly took home much more in cash, stocks and other compensation before he was fired in September, according to Forbes magazine. Daniel Mudd, former CEO of Fannie Mae, had a total compensation package of $8.79 million before he, too, was fired that month, according to Forbes. Frederick Smith, the long-time CEO of delivery giant FedEx, had a total compensation package of $32.21 million, Forbes said. Fannie Mae and FedEx are among Forbes' top 100 firms. A new postal law in 2006, Gallagher said, gave the postal service more flexibility to devise a compensation plan that didn't focus on salary. As a result, she said, the agency adjusted salaries and benefits packages, including performance-based initiatives, that became effective in 2008. Potter saw his civil service pension fund rise by $381,496 in 2008, and he received a $135,041 incentive pay that will be deferred to his retirement, according to a filing released December 10. Civil service pension rules are applied to all federal employees to calculate compensation, postal service spokesman Gerald McKiernan said. The calculation is based on salary and years of service, he said. Sepp compared Potter's earnings to ""Detroit auto executives flying to Washington in a fancy jet to ask for tax dollars"" and said he ""would not be surprised"" if the postal service asked for a Wall Street-like bailout. Automakers General Motors and Chrysler on Tuesday asked Congress for another $21.6 billion to keep them out of bankruptcy. They plan to cut 50,000 jobs between them by the end of the year. The price of a postage is increasing in May, going up from 42 cents to 44 cents.

"What really happened to Michael Brown? We know a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, fatally shot the 18-year-old, but police and witnesses have given different accounts of what happened in the moments before the shooting. The confusion has fueled protests in Ferguson and, strong police response in the streets of the St. Louis suburb. Here are five key questions about the incident: . How did it start? Brown and Dorian Johnson, 22, were walking in the middle of the street, en route to either Brown's grandmother's house (according to Brown's mother and grandmother) or to Johnson's house (according to Johnson), when a Ferguson police officer confronted them. The officer told the young men either ""Get the f*** on the sidewalk"" or ""Get the f*** out of the street,"" according to Johnson's accounts to CNN and other news outlets. The young men replied that they were ""not but a minute away from our destination, and we would shortly be out of the street,"" Johnson told CNN. The officer drove away but stopped and backed up, almost hitting the pair, Johnson said. He said he wasn't sure what prompted the officer to return. Johnson told MSNBC the officer said something to the effect of ""What'd you say?"" ""We were so close, almost inches away, that when he tried to open his door aggressively, the door ricocheted both off me and Big Mike's body and closed back on the officer,"" Johnson said. Was there a struggle? Yes. Everyone agrees on this point, and it's one of the few aspects of the shooting that police have attempted to detail, though the official explanation has spurred many questions they have yet to answer. The preliminary investigation showed that the officer tried to exit his vehicle, but Brown pushed him back into the car, ""where he physically assaulted the police officer"" and struggled over the officer's weapon, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said. A shot was fired inside the police car, Belmar said. After the incident, the officer was taken to an area hospital, where he was treated for a ""swollen face,"" according to Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson. The story doesn't jibe with at least three witness accounts. Johnson claims the officer grabbed Brown by his neck, and Brown tried to pull away, but the officer kept pulling Brown toward him, he said. The officer drew his weapon, and ""he said, 'I'll shoot you' or 'I'm going to shoot' "" and almost instantaneously fired his weapon, hitting Brown, Johnson said. Witness Tiffany Mitchell was picking up coworker Piaget Crenshaw for their jobs when she saw Brown and the officer ""tussling through the window."" Mitchell and Crenshaw said Brown appeared to be trying to pry himself from the officer's grasp. Brown had his hand on the police cruiser, trying to push himself away, Mitchell said. Was Brown armed? No. Again, this is undisputed. Every casing found at the scene came from the officer's gun, Belmar said, and witnesses say that after the officer initially fired, the two young men took off running. ""I saw the officer proceeding after my friend, Big Mike, with his gun drawn, and he fired a second shot, and that struck my friend, Big Mike,"" Johnson said. ""And at that time, he turned around with his hands up, beginning to tell the officer that he was unarmed and to tell him to stop shooting. But at that time, the officer was firing several more shots into my friend, and he hit the ground and died."" This matches Crenshaw's and Mitchell's story. Crenshaw told CNN that Brown got about 20 feet away from the police cruiser before the officer shot him again. ""The cop gets out of his vehicle shooting,"" Mitchell said. ""(Brown's) body jerked as if he was hit from behind, and he turned around, and he put his hands up. ... The cop continued to fire until he just dropped down to the ground, and his face just smacked the concrete."" All parties agree Brown was shot multiple times. Mitchell said it was ""more than about five or six"" times, while Johnson said it was more than three. Brown's mother said she was told he was shot eight times. Some witnesses said they heard as many as 10 shots. Belmar said only that it ""was more than just a couple."" What were Brown and Johnson doing before the incident? On Friday, six days after the shooting, Ferguson police revealed that Brown was the ""primary suspect"" in the strong-arm robbery of a convenience store moments before he encountered police and was killed. A store surveillance video shows a man pushing a clerk before walking out the front door with a box of Swisher Sweets cigars worth $48.99, according to information released by police. The Brown family lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said that the person in the video appears to be Michael Brown. Read the police reports . Johnson, who was with Brown when he was shot, will not face any criminal charges in connection with the store robbery because ""we have determined he committed no crime,"" Jackson said. Jackson said that the officer who shot Brown was responding to a call about the robbery. Later in the day, Jackson revised that comment, saying the officer approached Brown not because of the robbery, but because he was ""walking down the middle of the street, blocking traffic."" Has the officer been identified? Yes, but it took police six days. Police initially promised to release the officer's name but held off, saying they feared for his safety. On Friday, police revealed the officer as Darren Wilson, 28, who is white and a six-year veteran of the department without any history of disciplinary action. Wilson is on paid administrative leave, Belmar said, and will have to undergo two psychological evaluations before returning to duty. Though the officer was promptly released from the hospital, Jackson said he spoke to him, and he was ""very shaken about what happened that day and the aftermath. ... He's hurt."" No further details were immediately available Friday. Brown's family and their attorneys were infuriated at how police released Wilson's identity and allegations of Brown's role in the robbery on the same day. ""The prolonged release of the officer's name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies,"" the family and lawyer said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- This summer, a group of University of Kentucky students and staff has been patrolling campus grounds -- scouting out any student, employee or visitor lighting a cigarette. Unlike hall monitors who cite students for bad behavior, the Tobacco-free Take Action! volunteers approach smokers, respectfully ask them to dispose of the cigarette and provide information about quit-smoking resources available on campus. The University of Kentucky is one of more than 500 college campuses across the country that have enacted 100% smoke-free or tobacco-free policies as of July 1. Although policy enforcement varies from school to school, most prohibit smoking on all campus grounds, including athletic stadiums, restaurants and parking lots. An increasing number of colleges adopted smoke-free or tobacco-free policies in the past few years, according to American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation Project Manager Liz Williams. In the past year alone, 120 campuses were added to the smoke-free list. The most successful policies have been grass-roots efforts driven by students and campus employees. ""They typically come about because students and faculty are questioning the role of tobacco in an educational setting and deciding to discourage its use and exposure,"" Williams said. About 46 million Americans age 18 and older smoke cigarettes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A 2010 American College Health Association report found that out of 30,093 students surveyed at 39 colleges, 4.4% had smoked every day in the past 30 days. Since the first surgeon general report declaring the negative effects of smoking in 1964, smoking has become ""socially less acceptable"" among people of all ages, especially college students, says Laura Talbott-Forbes, chairwoman of the health association's Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs Coalition. ""There's a very health-conscious, socially aware student that we have on campus these days,"" she said. Should smoking be banned in public? The smoke-free spree . It wasn't until the early 2000s that 100% smoke-free campuses began popping up across the United States. Ty Patterson, the former vice president of Student Affairs at Ozarks Technical Community College in Springfield, Missouri, says he started the first smoke-free campus in 2003, but the idea was planted in 1999. ""The president came to me and said, 'Ty, we've got problems. You can't get in and out of doorways without going through a corridor of smoke,' "" Patterson recalled. Patterson, who had quit smoking two years prior, set out to find a higher education institution that had managed to eliminate tobacco on campus. To Patterson's dismay, there weren't any. ""When I explained to (schools) what we were thinking about doing, they said ... 'We'd love to be able to do that, but we don't know how,' "" he said. Over the next four years, Patterson developed a policy in which trained staff members held polite conversations with students and faculty who violated the smoking rules. The first violation is a warning. The second and third result in $15 fines or two hours spent picking up tobacco litter. For any further violations, the offender is placed on probation or asked to leave the school. Although some employees vehemently opposed the policy, Patterson says, no staff member ever reached the third violation, and only two students were placed on probation from the time the school enforced the policy in October 2004. Ozarks Technical spent more than 3½ years developing the initiative and educating students and staff about the forthcoming policy. However, Patterson -- who has now helped more than 500 schools, hospitals and businesses implement smoking bans as the director of the National Center for Tobacco Policy -- says most campuses today can effectively institute a policy in one year since there's less resistance to the concept than in 2003. Early morning smokers have higher cancer risk . It really works . The University of Michigan enacted a smoke-free policy on July 1. Campus officials spent three years researching policies and forming focus groups, committees and surveys to seek student and faculty input. Since the ban was implemented, school Chief Health Officer Dr. Robert Winfield says, it's uncommon to see smokers anywhere but along city of Ann Arbor sidewalks -- where smoking is permitted. He cited one entrance to the Michigan Union known as a smoker hot spot. When he visited the area recently, he noted, ""there wasn't a smoker in sight."" In 2009, the state of Kentucky had one of the highest smoking rates at 25.6%, according to the CDC. Since the University of Kentucky turned smoke-free in November that year, an increasing number of people have sought tobacco treatment services. In 2008, 33 people enrolled in a tobacco cessation program. After the policy's first year, enrollment rose to 146 people, according to Ellen Hahn, director of UK's Tobacco Policy Research Program. The number of nicotine replacement coupons redeemed by students and faculty also increased from 124 to 470 in the same period. For smokers visiting the campus, UK offers nicotine cessation products, such as gum or patches, for $5 at several locations. ""We're trying to make it comfortable for people so they don't feel like they have to light up and violate the policy,"" Hahn said. Secondhand smoke boosts kids' ADHD, learning disability risks . Policy patrol . During the first semester of a smoking ban, Patterson recommends that universities not come down with a heavy fist and instead educate the community about the policy and the negative effects of tobacco. Nearly two years later, the University of Kentucky still doesn't exercise strict enforcement. ""We certainly don't have smoking police,"" Hahn said. Instead, smoke-free supporters like senior Melissa McCann, a Tobacco-free Take Action! volunteer, remind smokers of the ban. McCann said the 10 smokers she asked to extinguish their cigarettes this summer all complied. ""In a tobacco state, you might think we'd have more backlash and opposition than we did,"" said Hahn, explaining that only a few students held a protest the day the policy launched. Regardless of the health benefits, opponents argue that smoke-free policies infringe on people's rights. Michigan senior Graham Kozak, president of the College Libertarians, says smoking is a ""personal choice."" ""It's not within the scope of the university's responsibilities to decide that smoking is an activity that we as adults shouldn't engage in,"" he said. Jonathan Sternberg, an attorney currently fighting a citywide smoking ban in Springfield, Missouri, says smoking bans ""just don't really make sense."" ""Any time you tell (people) that they can't do something they want to do, really they're just going to do it anyway. ... All you're doing is encouraging disrespect for authority,"" Sternberg said. Smoking in pregnancy linked to serious birth defects . A smoke-free future . The University of Florida went tobacco-free in July 2010, and Valencia College in Orlando plans to adopt the policy in 2012. This spurred students at Seminole State College of Florida to talk with administrators about following their lead, says Student Government Association President Krizia Capeles. In response, the association plans to distribute a ballot this fall, in which students will vote for or against a smoking ban. Patterson predicts that nearly all college campuses in the United States will be 100% smoke-free in 10 years. Talbott-Forbes, too, says it's a possibility -- mentioning how professors once smoked in their offices but can't today. ""We've gone from pushing smoking out of the building ... to now trying to push smoking totally off campus,"" she said. Although it may take time to sink in, Hahn said, people eventually ""get it."" ""They get the idea that tobacco use just isn't accepted here.""","About 530 colleges across the country that have enacted 100% smoke-free policies .

"Eight U.S. soldiers have been charged in connection with the October death of a fellow soldier in Afghanistan, the Army said Wednesday. Pvt. Danny Chen, 19, was found dead in a guard tower, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Chen's family says that until they see the autopsy results themselves, they cannot confirm or deny it was suicide. The eight officers and enlisted servicemen face various charges, including dereliction of duty, making false statements, maltreatment and involuntary manslaughter, the Army said in a statement. The Army did not specify what alleged acts by the soldiers resulted in the charges, which were filed Wednesday. But in correspondence with his family before his death, Chen complained of harassment by his fellow soldiers. At a candlelight vigil for Chen held in Manhattan last week, his brother, Banny Chen, read from a letter the soldier had sent to his family. ""They ask if I'm from China a few times a day. They also called out my name, 'Chen,' in a goat-like voice sometimes for no reason. No idea how it started, but it's just best to ignore it."" The Chen family told The New York Times in October that officials said that Chen had suffered physical abuse and ethnic slurs by superiors, including an incident in which he was dragged out of bed and across the floor for failing to turn off a water heater after showering. In its announcement, the Army makes no mention of the harassment allegations, but states, ""As the legal process continues, further information will be published as it becomes available."" The charges stem from ""conduct that occurred in the time leading up to (Chen's) death,"" an Army official familiar with details of the investigation told CNN.  He declined to be identified because the military criminal investigation remains ongoing. The Army official said the soldiers are essentially charged with hazing and abusing Chen in the weeks and days before he apparently killed himself. But the case remains open and other charges could be filed, the official said. The soldiers facing charges were identified as 1st Lt. Daniel J. Schwartz, Staff Sgt. Blaine G. Dugas, Staff Sgt. Andrew J. Van Bockel, Sgt. Adam M. Holcomb, Sgt. Jeffrey T. Hurst, Spc. Thomas P. Curtis, Spc. Ryan J. Offutt and Sgt. Travis F. Carden. All the soldiers belonged to C Company, 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 1st Styker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, the Army said. Schwartz, the only officer charged, faces eight counts of dereliction of duty. The enlisted soldiers face more serious charges, including dereliction of duty but also maltreatment, assault, involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide. The eight men charged have been moved to a different base in southern Afghanistan and remain under restriction. They are not permitted to leave the base, the Army official said. ""We feel some comfort and relief to know the Army is taking it seriously,"" Chen's mother, Su Zhan Chen, said through a translator at a news conference Wednesday. ""We are cautiously optimistic because of today's news,"" said Elizabeth Ou Yang, president of the Asian-American group OCA-NY, who spoke as a representative of the family. But, she added, the family hopes that those responsible will be not just charged, but convicted. ""They must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" Yang added. Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who was also present with the family at the conference, said that she has requested the autopsy results and asked the inspector general of the Army to conduct a separate investigation. ""We are here today to demand answers... and that begins with a full accounting of all the facts,"" she said. In a similar case earlier this year, three Marines were charged with beating and hazing a fellow Marine, Harry Lew, after Lew fell asleep on watch duty. The Marine was beaten and forced to do exercises and to dig a hole until the early morning. When the punishment was over, he climbed into the hole he had just dug and shot himself, said Rep. Judy Chu of California, Lew's aunt.","The family is glad for the charges, but wants convictions .

"Anyone who's ever attempted to lose weight knows the frustration of trying -- and failing at -- different diets. But a study published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests any low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet can produce significant weight loss results. People should choose diets that they can stick to, rather than fret over low-fat versus low-carb, says study author Bradley Johnston, assistant professor of clinical epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. The study . Researchers looked at 48 previous studies that included a total of 7,286 overweight and obese adults. Many participants followed popular name-branded diets, including the low-carb Atkins, South Beach, or Zone diets, the balanced ""Biggest Loser,"" Jenny Craig, Nutrisystem, Volumetrics or Weight Watchers diets, or the low-fat Ornish or Rosemary Conley diets. The participants reported their body weight or body mass index before and after following the diets. Calculate your BMI . The results . After six months, those on low-carb diets and low-fat diets lost approximately the same amount of weight -- around 18 pounds. The researchers found those on brand-name diets saw only small variations in the amount of weight lost. 11 simple weight loss tips . ""There may be important differences to some individual clinicians or some individual dieters, but overall the differences are minimal,"" Johnston said. In addition, exercise and behavioral support enhanced weight loss. Behavioral support includes things like group support, counseling and/or meeting with a registered dietitian. After a year, many people stopped losing weight and gained a couple of pounds back. The average sustained weight loss was 16 pounds. The researchers noted exercise continued to enhance weight loss, whereas the results for behavioral support were no longer significant after a year. In an editorial accompanying the study, Linda Van Horn of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago argued that limiting carbohydrates or fat can be risky. Focusing solely on weight loss, she wrote, only makes these popular diets seems healthy. 5 ways a healthy diet is making you tired . As soon as you start reducing or eliminating macronutrients like fat, carbs or protein, you run the risk of avoiding foods that ""actually have a host of nutrients to them,"" she said. People who eat a low-carb diet, for example, often miss out on the fiber, potassium, Vitamin C and other phytochemicals that are important to good health. Another take . The debate over low-fat and low-carb diets has been going on for decades. And the JAMA study likely won't put a stop to it. Just on Monday, a study of 148 people published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that a low-carb diet is superior to a low-fat one for weight loss. Participants on the low-carb diet reduced their cardiovascular risk factors. They also saw reductions in fat mass, along with improved cholesterol levels. Low-carb, high-protein diets linked to women's heart disease . ""With the obesity epidemic, everyone is really interested in the best way, the easiest way to lose weight,"" said Lauri Wright, registered dietitian nutritionist and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, who was not involved in either study. ""For every one study that shows the low-carb is better, then there's a counterstudy that shows that low-fat is better.  And it's very confusing."" Wright recommends people see a dietitian to develop an individualized plan. ""We're not only trying to lose weight, but we're also trying to prevent diseases too,"" she added. ""We want to make sure the diet is not only low in calories, but it has really high-quality nutrition value.""","A new study suggests any low-carb or low-fat diet can help with weight loss .

"In 2010, Americans were prescribed 258 million courses of antibiotics, a rate of 833 per thousand people. Such massive usage, billions of doses, has been going on year after year. We have few clues about the consequences of our cumulative exposures. We do know that widespread antibiotic treatments make us more susceptible to invaders by selecting for resistant bacteria. These risks are now well-known, but I want to lay out a new concern: that antibiotic use over the years has been depleting the pool of our friendly bacteria -- in each of us -- and this is lowering our resistance to infections. In today's hyperconnected globe, that means that we are at high risk of future plagues that could spread without natural boundaries from person to person and that we could not stop. I call this ""antibiotic winter."" To explain: In the early 1950's, scientists conducted experiments to determine whether our resident microbes -- the huge number of bacteria that live in and on our bodies, now called our ""microbiome"" -- help in fending off invading bacteria. They fed mice a species of a typical invader, disease-causing salmonella. It took about 100,000 organisms to infect half of the normal mice. But when they first gave mice an antibiotic, which kills both good and bad bacteria, and then several days later gave them salmonella, it took only three organisms to infect them. This isn't a 10 or 20% difference; it's  a 30,000-fold difference. That was in mice, but what about humans? In 1985, Chicago faced a massive outbreak of salmonella. At least 160,000 people became ill and several died from drinking contaminated milk. The health department asked victims of the outbreak and unaffected persons, ""Have you received antibiotics in the month prior to becoming ill?"" People who said yes were five times more likely to become ill than those who drank the milk but hadn't recently received antibiotics. People carry a small number of highly abundant bacterial species and a large number of much less common ones. For example, you may carry trillions of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in your colon and only a thousand cells, or fewer, belonging to many other species. We are not sure how many rare species any of us has. If you had only 50 cells of a particular type, it would be difficult to detect them against the background of trillions of others. When you take a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which is the kind most commonly prescribed, it may be that rare microbes occasionally get wiped out entirely. And once the population hits zero, there is no bouncing back. For your body, that species is now extinct. My worry is that some of these critical residential organisms -- what I consider ""contingency"" species -- may disappear altogether. Why might it matter? Those puny species may not be so inconsequential. Microbes multiply. Any small population of, say, 50 cells can explode into a billion or more in one week. The trigger for their massive bloom could be a food you've eaten for the first time, which only they have the enzymes to digest. In the presence of this food, the rare microbe goes into overdrive, doubling every 12 or 20 minutes, multiplying by a million percent or more. This could be good for you because some of the energy captured by these digesting microbes might end up in your bloodstream. When food is in short supply, as has been the case for most of human existence, and people need to eat unfamiliar plants or animals, it is useful to have a repertoire of enzymes that help us process a wide variety of nutrients. The genes of our flexible partners, our resident microbes, provide those enzymes. Now consider the consequences if one of your rare microbes -- an ancient one that has been dwelling in Homo sapiens for 200,000 years -- went extinct. One possibility is that it doesn't matter. Perhaps that microbe was a marginal player -- good riddance. Another possibility: It's a ""contingency"" organism,  useful -- crucial -- when we need it for protection. When a new influenza epidemic arose in Mexico in 2009, people in California and Texas soon fell ill, and then flu appeared in New York a few days later. After a few weeks, this flu spread throughout the world. Considering the numbers of people infected, we were lucky that it was not a highly lethal strain.  Yet thousands of people all over the world did die. Even when a strain is not that virulent, when hundreds of millions of people are infected, deaths add up. And when the strain is worse, the deaths climb into the millions. Our world has gotten smaller. We have much greater global access to one another -- at the very moment in our history when our ancient microbial defenses are degrading. This makes us vulnerable to microbial invaders and provides fuel for disease conflagrations, with consequences scarcely imaginable. Plagues are inevitable wherever people congregate. With a global population of 7 billion, rising by 80 million annually, the question is not whether another big plague will come, but when it will happen, what will cause it, and who will be affected. In 1918-19, influenza killed tens of millions, in an era without airplanes and with much less mass transit to spread it. With a huge world population that is essentially contiguous, and with so many people with weakened defenses, we are vulnerable as never before. I see many parallels between our changing climate and our changing microbiome. The modern epidemics -- asthma and allergic disorders, obesity, and metabolic disorders -- are not only diseases, they are external signs of change within.  But they also indicate a deeper imbalance, the loss of our reserves. Our diverse microbes, with their millions of genes helping us resist disease, are the guerrilla warriors defending the home domain -- as long as we protect them. But recent studies suggest that otherwise normal people already have lost 15% to 40% of their microbial diversity and the genes that accompany it. This is the greatest danger before us -- invaders causing an epidemic against which we are helpless.  Unless we change our ways, we do indeed face an ""antibiotic winter."" We must end the assault on our microbes, by cutting antibiotic use and also such elective practices as unnecessary cesarean sections that bypass the natural order of mothers passing on their bacteria to their babies. There are times when both of these are needed urgently, but we already know that we are overusing them. Technology already provides important tools to improve doctors' judgments about when antibiotics are needed, but we must get them into the clinic. We also must develop new tools, like ""narrow-spectrum"" antibiotics that target only the invader and minimize collateral effects. We must understand that every antibiotic course has a biological cost, and more precisely align possible benefit with the full costs. I predict that in the future we will routinely be giving children back their lost microbes, in early life to restore their patrimony and after the antibiotic courses that are truly necessary. Just as we have abused marvelous inventions like freon and the internal combustion engine, so too we have abused our ""wonder drugs."" But the possible costs of these practices are our worst nightmare; we need to prepare, starting now.","Martin Blaser: Overprescription of antibiotics put Americans at risk for disease .

"(CNN)It's been a bloody year in Iraq, where ISIS militants have seized swaths of territory and remain on the offensive. And the latest figures from the Iraq Body Count monitoring project show that civilians, as so often in war, are paying a heavy price. At least 17,049 civilians were recorded killed in Iraq during 2014, Iraq Body Count said, roughly double the number recorded in 2013 -- which in turn was about double that of the previous year. The shocking rise in deaths in 2014 is due in large part to the ISIS offensive and the military response to it by Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led international coalition, the group said. Based in London and made up of academics and human rights and anti-war activists, Iraq Body Count monitors and compiles media reports of Iraqi civilian casualties resulting from the violence that followed the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. Since that invasion, ""not a single day has passed without Iraqi civilians being killed,"" it said. ""The year 2014, however, reflects an increase in violence to levels not seen since the worst years of 2006 and 2007."" According to the group, the greatest number of deaths in 2014 were in Baghdad, Nineveh, Salaheddin and Anbar provinces, which together account for about 80% of civilian deaths. The highest number of civilian deaths was seen in Baghdad, with more than 4,750 reported. More than 3,600 civilians were killed in western Anbar province, half of them by the Iraqi military in daily airstrikes, primarily in and around Falluja, the group said. Meanwhile, in Salaheddin and Nineveh provinces, the killings of civilians by ISIS contributed significantly to the death toll, it said. From 2010 to 2012, there was a relative reduction in civilian casualties, but the level of violence in the country started to climb again in 2013, Iraq Body Count said. That rise followed the withdrawal of U.S. troops at the end of 2011 and the implementation of increasingly sectarian policies by the then-Shia-led government. There has been no monthly civilian death toll lower than 900 since July 2013, the group said, with most being much higher. 'New brutality on the ground' The bloodshed peaked in June, when ISIS launched a major offensive to take Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, and extend its reach far into the country. There were 2,534 civilian deaths recorded that month. Since then, the average has been more than 1,500 civilian deaths a month. It's not always possible to tell who's to blame for the deaths. But according to Iraq Body Count's analysis, 1,748 civilians were reported killed by Iraqi military airstrikes, while 4,325 were killed by ISIS. There were also 118 civilians reported killed by U.S. coalition airstrikes last year. ""There is a new brutality on the ground and renewed attacks from the air. ISIS and the Iraqi army have caused thousands of civilian deaths this year, while the international coalition has yet again been responsible for civilian killings, for the first time since U.S. withdrawal three years previously,"" Iraq Body Count said. ""Iraqi civilians are once again being killed by all sides."" Combatant deaths . As for those taking part in the fighting, it's hard to say with certainty how many have died, the group said. Iraqi military and insurgent deaths have increased ""dramatically"" in 2014 in relation to previous years, it said. But there's also been a sharp divergence in the information coming from different sources, such as news agencies, official statistics and media reports -- giving a total ranging from 4,000 to 5,000 at the low end to roughly 30,000 at the other extreme. ""The truth probably lies somewhere between these two numbers, but neither can be ruled out at present,"" Iraq Body Count said. Taking that variation into account, between 21,000 and 47,000 people were killed in war-related violence in Iraq during 2014, it said. That makes it the third-deadliest year since the invasion, after 2006 and 2007.","Iraq Body Count says the number of civilian deaths roughly doubled from 2013 to 2014 .

"First, immigrants steal Americans' jobs. And now foreigners are stealing Americans' rightful place on U.S. postage stamps! OK, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration. But a new line of Harry Potter stamps released this week by the U.S. Postal Service has outraged some stamp enthusiasts.  As the former head of the American Philatelic Society (that's a stamp collecting society to the rest of us) noted:  ""Harry Potter is not American. It's foreign, and it's so blatantly commercial it's off the charts."" First off, can a fictitious teenage wizard ever become a U.S. citizen?  Secondly, and far more importantly, the Postal Service is in a financial ""hot mess.""  It's losing $25 million every day. And for the 2013 fiscal year, which ended September 30, the USPS ran up a deficit of $5 billion. At this point, I'd be all for a stamp bearing the image of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford smoking crack if that could generate revenue.  That's preferable to higher deficits, drastic cuts in services and increases in stamp prices. Look, I understand that one of the mandates of the Postal Service is, ""portraying the American experience to a world audience through the issuance of postage stamps."" But the ""American experience"" is not just colored by U.S. citizens. Plus Harry Potter and his cast of cohorts are not the first non-U.S. citizens to grace our stamps. Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, Mother Theresa and French singer Edith Piaf have all been featured on past stamps. This is not the first time a new set of stamps has caused controversy.  In 2001, the Postal Service came under fire from some on the right when it released the Frida Kahlo stamp because she was a Communist, a Mexican and a bisexual. In fact, the late Republican Senator Jesse Helms denounced the stamp on the Senate floor. Some have even objected to stamps honoring Mother Theresa, celebrating the Muslim Eid holiday, or bearing the image of the famed Botticelli painting of the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus. Why?  Because they were troubled by the religious implications. It appears, though, that the real reason for the uproar over the Harry Potter stamp isn't his citizenship status. Rather, it's because stamp purists are dismayed by the increasing commercialization of U.S. postage stamps.  As one collector said: ""They shouldn't be reduced to the latest fads, whatever's going to sell."" This very issue has caused friction between the Postal Service and the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee -- a body established in 1957 to evaluate and recommend to the USPS what should be chosen for stamps. The tension undoubtedly escalated when the Postal Service chose not to consult with this advisory committee before approving the new Harry Potter stamp collection. But here's the thing: It's not an either/or scenario. Stamps bearing images of iconic America, like national parks and national heroes, will always have their audience. And pop culture stamps certainly have their legion of fans. Keep in mind that the stamp featuring Elvis Presley is the top seller of all time with over 700 million sold. So I say it's time for the Postal Service to roll out stamps that will make money. I don't care if it's Miley Cyrus swinging on a wrecking ball, an angry Donald Trump or Honey Boo Boo wearing a tiara. These are all preferable to the Postal Service incurring more debt and slashing services to the point where it ends up having to lay off so many postal workers that it's stuck delivering mail via carrier pigeon.","Some stamp collectors are upset over a new line of Harry Potter stamps .

"The school board representing Minnesota's largest school district on Monday night will consider scrapping a controversial policy requiring teachers not to discuss homosexuality in school. The Anoka-Hennepin School District's sexual orientation curriculum policy, adopted in 2009, bars teachers from taking a position on homosexuality in the classroom and says such matters are best addressed outside of school. It's become known as the neutrality policy. During Monday night's hearing, the school board will propose replacing that policy with a ""controversial topics curriculum policy"" that, according to the proposed wording, ""recognizes the importance of providing information about controversial topics in a democracy."" However, it states that teachers and staff ""shall not advocate personal beliefs or opinions"" regarding those controversial topics -- which are not named -- in the classroom. It's one of many changes being considered to the district's harassment, violence, and discrimination policy and its religious activities policy.  The so-called ""neutrality policy"" triggered a federal lawsuit by students who allege the policy creates a toxic environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender students -- or students perceived to be LGBT. The school district has refrained from commenting on specifics in the lawsuit.  Superintendent Dennis Carlson has said in the past that the neutrality policy -- which has attracted just as many local supporters as it has critics to heated school board meetings -- is a reasonable response to a divided community. ""It's a diverse community,"" Carlson told CNN earlier this year, ""and what we're trying to do, what I'm trying to do as a superintendent, is walk down the middle of the road."" The Southern Poverty Law Center, which filed the lawsuit in July on behalf of the students, praised the school district for reconsidering the neutrality policy. ""The students and families ... feel that policy improvements are one important step forward in making the school district a more welcoming environment for all students,"" the SPLC said in a statement issued last week. Anoka-Hennepin encompasses the Twin Cities' northwestern suburbs and is the state's largest school district. The school district made headlines in recent years after seven students committed suicide between November 2009 and May 2011. Parents and friends say four of those students were either gay, perceived to be gay or questioning their sexuality. They say, at least two of them were bullied because of their sexuality. The school district says there is no evidence that the suicides were linked to bullying, noting that it has a separate, and comprehensive, bullying prohibition policy. ""We have no evidence that bullying or harassment took place in any of those cases,"" Superintendent Carlson said. Carlson emphasized students need to report bullying, and he acknowledged ""gay students in our district struggle with bullying and harassment on a daily basis."" Nevertheless, the string of suicides stirred public debate over the school's sexual orientation curriculum policy. The school district is also in the middle of a federal investigation into ""allegations of harassment and discrimination in the Anoka-Hennepin School District based on sex, including peer-on-peer harassment based on not conforming to gender stereotypes,"" according to a district memo. The school board could vote on the proposed changes to the neutrality policy as soon as the next school board meeting in early January, said Julie Blaha, president of the local teachers' union. Blaha, whose union represents about 2,800 teachers in the school district, plans to meet with the teachers to formulate a ""position statement"" on the proposed changes.  She said she wants to make sure the policy clearly defines ""controversial topics"" and what it means for teachers and staff to ""advocate personal beliefs or opinions,"" which the proposed policy prohibits. Overall, Blaha says she welcomes changes to the existing neutrality policy, which she described as vague and difficult for teachers to interpret. ""Neutrality has not given us good guidance in the classroom,"" Blaha explained.  ""You can interpret that so many ways (so) it had a chilling effect on any discussion. ""And these times when ... our gay students are under more likely to be a target of bullying, that's not the time to chill a discussion about sexual orientation,"" she said.","Minnesota school board to propose changes to controversial ""neutrality policy""

"Searchers looking for more bodies and wreckage from AirAsia Flight QZ8501 continue to be hindered by tough weather conditions. Ships, planes and helicopters are being used to try to find victims of the disaster. Most of the people on board the flight remain missing, and search teams are still looking for the main wreckage of the plane. Efforts are being concentrated in a zone covering 1,575 square nautical miles (5,400 square kilometers) that officials believe is the ""most probable area"" to find the remains of the aircraft. But on Friday, waves in the Java Sea as high as four meters (13 feet) were making it hard for divers search underwater. The weather is ""the biggest obstacle,"" said Bambang Hermanu, chief of police in Indonesia's Central Kalimantan province, where much of the search operation is based. Here's more key information about where things stand on Flight QZ8501: . The flight . What we know: The aircraft took off early Sunday from Surabaya, Indonesia, bound for Singapore. Roughly 35 minutes into the flight, the pilot asked air traffic control for permission to turn left and climb to a higher altitude to avoid bad weather. Minutes later, the plane disappeared from air traffic control's radar. What we don't know: What happened on board after contact with the plane was lost. No distress call was received. Indonesian aviation authorities have suggested that the plane ascended despite permission being denied because of traffic. Some experts have speculated that the aircraft might have experienced an aerodynamic stall because of a lack of speed or from flying at too sharp an angle to get enough lift. Analysts have also suggested that the pilots might not have been getting information from onboard systems about the plane's position, or that rain or hail from thunderstorms in the area could have damaged the engines. Until the main wreckage of the plane is found, along with the flight recorders, experts have little evidence to support their theories. How can a modern airliner vanish? The search . What we know: Search teams found debris and some bodies in the water Tuesday, 100 to 200 kilometers (about 60 to 120 miles) from the aircraft's last known location over the Java Sea, Indonesia's search and rescue agency said. Thirty bodies have so far been recovered from the sea, Indonesian officials said Friday. Early Friday, what appears to be a piece of the fuselage was found, Singapore's Defense Ministry said. It resembles a window panel. The USS Sampson, the U.S. Navy ship that is helping with the search, recovered two bodies Thursday, the U.S. Seventh Fleet said Friday. Indonesia is leading the international search effort, with assistance from a range of countries including Malaysia, Singapore and the United States. What we don't know: The exact location of the body of the aircraft. An Indonesian search official told CNN on Wednesday that he thought sonar equipment had detected wreckage from Flight 8501 at the bottom of the Java Sea. But the country's search and rescue chief said the plane hadn't been found yet. Bad weather has hindered the search operation. The ones who missed the flight . The people on board . What we know: The plane was carrying 155 passengers and seven crew members. The overwhelming majority of those on board were Indonesians. There were also citizens of Britain, France, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea. Details are emerging about some of the people on the flight, recounted by family members and friends. What we don't know: When the missing passengers and crew members will be recovered. Indonesian authorities have identified four of the recovered bodies so far. The first victim they identified, an Indonesian woman named Hayati Lutfiah Hamid, was buried Thursday. Many family members are waiting in Surabaya for news about their loved ones. Who was aboard AirAsia Flight QZ8501? The investigation . What we know: The key to understanding what happened may be in the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, commonly known as black boxes. The black boxes, which are actually orange, are in the tail of Airbus 320-200s. If recovered, they will be taken to a lab in Jakarta, Indonesia, to be analyzed, said Tatang Kurniadi, head of Indonesia's National Committee for Transportation Safety. The batteries powering the ""pingers"" that send acoustic signals have only about 25 days of power left, he said. What we don't know: Where the plane's remains might have been taken by the elements. Investigators will need to use information gleaned from the flight recorders and clues from the wreckage. ""The more bits I can put into my mosaic, the better my picture will be,"" aviation safety expert Michael Barr said. ""The better the picture, the better I can come up with an understanding of what happened."" But the conditions at sea make that work much more difficult than on land. ""In the water, you are working with currents and winds, and so the pieces won't be where they had the initial impact,"" he said. What happens next? The plane and the pilots . What we know: The 6-year-old Airbus A320-200, operated by AirAsia's Indonesian affiliate, had accumulated around 23,000 flight hours in about 13,600 flights, according to Airbus. The plane's last scheduled maintenance was on November 16. Flight 8501's veteran captain, Iriyanto, 53, had 20,537 flying hours, 6,100 of them with AirAsia on the Airbus A320, the airline said. The first officer, Remi Emmanuel Plesel, 46, had 2,275 flying hours, a reasonable amount for his position. What we don't know: Whether technical problems, human error or other issues were involved in the crash. According to information from the Aviation Safety Network accident database, there have been 54 incidents involving the A320. ""In the A320 family, accidents and incidents range from fan-cowl detachment, landing gear collapse, bird strikes, right through to hull losses through pilot error,"" said Kane Ray, an analyst with the International Bureau of Aviation, a global aviation consulting group. ""Most aircraft have teething problems, and in most cases, these are eradicated. Very rarely, these issues cause disasters -- largely because of a culmination of factors that lead to the event,"" Ray said.

"New York City police arrested a man for allegedly flying a drone inside the U.S. Open venue Wednesday night. Serena Williams and Flavia Pennetta were battling for a spot in the semi-finals on another court when police spotted the drone around 9 p.m. Wednesday near courts 16 and 17, which were empty at the time, according to New York City Police detective Martin Speechley. By the time Williams beat her opponent in straight sets that night, the alleged drone-flying intruder was already in police custody. Police said the drone was piloted by Daniel Feighery of Yonkers, New York, who was arrested 50 yards outside U.S. Open grounds. Feighery, 36, was charged with reckless endangerment, violation of a local law, and failure to comply with a sign. It's not known what the sign said. Police also took custody of the drone, Speechley said. Feighery could not be reached for comment. The U.S. Open fly-by is the latest in a string of recent incidents involving drones. Last month, a tourist crashed a drone into the Grand Prismatic Spring, the largest hot spring at Yellowstone National Park, prompting an investigation. The tourist approached a park employee about getting the drone back after losing it in the almost 200-feet deep hot spring. The employee let the tourist go without initially reporting the incident to authorities. Drones are banned in national parks. The National Park Service announced in June that it was prohibiting unmanned aircraft from all park service-controlled lands and waters, totaling about 84 million acres throughout the country. Visitors watching the sunset over the Grand Canyon were interrupted by a loud drone in April. And volunteers reported that a herd of bighorn sheep at Zion National Park in Utah scattered after being harassed by a drone. Also, a Seattle woman called police in June to report a ""peeping Tom"" drone. The drone was hovering outside of her high-rise window, and the woman saw operators on the ground below with camera equipment. The Federal Aviation Administration predicts some 10,000 civilian drones will be in use in the United States within five years, including those for law enforcement and commercial means. In August, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer called on the FAA and the Commerce Department to establish drone regulations by the end of the year. ""New York City has become the wild, wild west for commercial and hobby drones,"" Schumer said. Although 35 states have considered drone legislation, only five have passed laws to regulate drones. Schumer told CNN that a national law for the skies is key. Drones ""serve many useful purposes,"" he said. ""Smart regulation can save the baby and throw out the bathwater.""","Daniel Feighery, 36, is arrested for flying a drone over the U.S. Open .

"In a knife fight of a congressional hearing, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen defended his agency, but he sparked an uproar from Republicans by admitting it destroyed a key hard drive wanted in an investigation, and he did not apologize for the data loss. ""I don't think an apology is owed, not a single email has been lost since the start of this investigation,"" Koskinen told a dais full of skeptical GOP members on Friday. He argued the IRS has done its best to find the emails that originally went missing in 2011. Those emails are central to an investigation of why the agency targeted tea party and other political groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status. The hearing by the Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee focused on the week-old revelation from the IRS that a hard drive belonging to a former top agency official at the center of the congressional probe, Lois Lerner, crashed in 2011. Tens of thousands of her emails saved on it dating to 2009 were destroyed. Lerner and that time frame are critical in the investigation. The targeting issue has its roots in the 2010 rise of the tea party and the Supreme Court Citizen's United decision, which bolstered the ability of independent groups to engage in political activity. Lerner ran the division in charge of tax-exempt status and is the highest-ranking official directly connected to the targeting so far. She has since retired and refused to testify before Congress on the matter, citing her constitutional rights against having to do so. The House charged her with contempt of Congress for her refusal to speak. IRS pushes back . Koskinen told lawmakers on Friday that not only has the agency tried to retrieve the Lerner emails, but he also pushed back at Republican reports that emails of six other IRS employees, including a former chief of staff, are missing. ""It turns out ... that none  of (the chief of staff's) emails appear to be lost,"" Koskinen said, scolding the Republicans on the committee. ""Piecemealing out information about a possible problem simply results in press releases and angry letters to me."" For their part, Republicans were blistering. They expressed frustration that has built up for the past week. ""The American people have no reason to trust the IRS ... on this issue,"" said Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp. The Michigan Republican pressed Koskinen on whether his agency knows exactly where the destroyed hard drive ended up. He replied that he was not sure if there was a serial number attached to the hard drive and that it was destroyed three years ago. Republicans drilled down on when the IRS knew about the hard drive problems. Time line key . The time line from Koskinen was nuanced. He said the agency knew in February that there was some kind of problem with Lerner's hard drive, but that it took until late April or May to determine that the hard drive crash had erased data. Why didn't he tell Congress sooner? Koskinen responded that the agency was trying to retrieve as many lost emails as possible first but decided to notify lawmakers after receiving a letter from the Senate Finance Committee last Friday. The committee indicated that it had completed its investigation and was doing a final check to make sure the IRS had sent every available Lerner email. Koskinen also pointed out that emails about the Lerner hard drive crash had been included in large bundles of documents, tens of thousands at a time, that the agency sent to congressional committees last fall. ""We've provided the information,"" Koskinen began to say under questioning by Texas Republican Kevin Brady. ""You have not provided us the information!"" Brady blasted back. ""At this point why should anyone believe you? ... This is the most corrupt and deceitful IRS in the history!"" Not to be believed . The outcry continued, leading to one of the most contentious exchanges of the day. ""This is unbelievable!"" exclaimed a visibly irate Rep. Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican. ""The apology should be to the American people. I don't believe it. That's your problem. No one believes you."" Koskinen, whose tone was sharp and defensive at times, responded that he has had a long career in government. ""And that is the first time anybody has said they do not believe me,"" he said. ""I don't believe you,"" Ryan repeated. ""That's fine,"" Koskinen said. ""We can have a disagreement."" Democrats defended the IRS as an agency overloaded with work and underfunded by Congress, and accused Republicans of turning the hearing into a political tribunal. ""Was (Lerner's) hard drive crash a conspiracy? No,"" said Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the panel.  ""The prevailing conspiracy in this matter is that of the Republican's desire to stir their base, tie the problem to the White House and keep up this drumbeat until the November election."" At one point Democratic Rep. Xavier Becerra of California  gave the IRS leader friendly advice to take a deep breath before speaking. What's up with the IRS emails? Key questions about the controversy .","Sparks fly at congressional hearing on lost IRS hard drive .

"You may not have heard of Snapchat. But if there are teenagers or 20-somethings in your life, it's a safe bet that they have. Snapchat is a mobile app which lets users share images or videos that disappear after a few seconds. That's right -- they vanish forever in the time it takes you to read a tweet. In a little over a year since it was released by a Stanford student and his recently graduated business partner, Snapchat has has quietly amassed millions of users and now claims to process more than 30 million messages a day. Some bloggers have called it the ""next Instagram."" Not bad for a mobile tool which, rightly or wrongly, is often cited for one very specific ability -- the ""sexting"" of naughty images to other users. In an age when young people are constantly being warned not to post inappropriate things online, Snapchat offers a degree of freedom by letting users share unfiltered thoughts or images without much fear of reprisal. ""Like most people born before the 1990s, I'm not a Snapchat user, and I've long assumed the worst about the app -- that combining cameras; young people; and secret, self-destructing messages could only mean trouble,"" wrote Slate's Farhad Manjoo last week. But increasingly, he writes, it appears possible that ""teenagers are more likely using the app to safely explore the sort of silly, unguarded, and sometimes unwise ideas that have always occupied the teenage brain ... in a manner that won't haunt them forever. In other words, they're chatting with Snapchat precisely because it's not like chatting with Facebook."" Not to be outdone, Facebook last month actually launched a virtually identical social app called Facebook Poke, a mobile re-imagining of one of the site's earliest, and ultimately most ridiculed, features. But instead of siphoning users from Snapchat, Facebook's move appears instead to have launched the upstart app to new heights. Both apps let users send images or short videos and messages via their smartphones. The sender can choose how long the message will be visible -- up to 10 seconds -- before it self-destructs. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly was part of the team that coded the Poke app, currently available only on Apple's iOS system, in only a couple of weeks. A family photo posted by sister Randi Zuckerberg purportedly showed their family playing with the app over the holidays. But if Facebook was looking to flex its billion-user muscle to take over the instant-chat market, it doesn't appear to be working. On Thursday, Snapchat was the sixth-most popular free app for Apple's mobile devices. Facebook Poke wasn't in the top 100. As Forbes said in a recent headline, ""the kids like SnapChat because it's NOT Facebook."" A newer version of Snapchat for Google's Android devices sat at a respectable No. 33 in the Google Play store, ahead of stalwarts like Draw Something, Spotify, Fandango and Amazon Mobile. Facebook Poke isn't available for Android. A look by analytics firm Topsy showed that mentions of Snapchat on Twitter spiraled to more than 212,000 on New Year's Day, up from about 16,000 on December 20, the day before Facebook introduced Poke. Facebook Poke got 1,822 mentions on January 1, according to Topsy. So, does that mean young, socially savvy users are sending millions of racy pictures of themselves through cyberspace every day? It's difficult to say. Technological advances and nudie shots have shared a strong, if secretive, relationship for centuries. From the printing press to pay-per-view to VCRs, new tech (particularly the kind that creates new levels of privacy) has always been followed closely by folks figuring out how to personally or professionally use it to get dirty. There are clear, and sometimes ugly, signs that sexting is common on Snapchat. ""Snapchat Sluts,"" a Tumblr blog full of nude and semi-nude images, was started up last month by a ""party photographer"" who says he put out an open call for salacious shots on Twitter and was overwhelmed by the response. Another Snapchat-themed blog on Tumblr is filled with complaints about male users sharing photos of their genitalia. Snapchat users may think their naughty images will never come back to haunt them. But people can still grab screenshots from their phones, even though both Snapchat and Facebook Poke notify the sender if the recipient of an image takes a shot of it. And last week, Buzzfeed exposed an apparent security flaw that it says lets recipients retrieve videos sent via Snapchat. All of which should be bad news when young people and questionable decisions collide with the dark alleys of the Internet, where even the most ill-gotten of sleaze is posted. Snapchat did not respond to an interview request from CNN. But in one of only a handful of interviews he's given since launching, Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel told TechCrunch he thinks the sex talk about his app is overblown. ""I'm not convinced that the whole sexting thing is as big as the media makes it out to be,"" he told TechCrunch. ""I just don't know people who do that. It doesn't seem that fun when you can have real sex."" But he also acknowledged to TechCrunch that the idea for the app, which he and Bobby Murphy hashed out after meeting at Stanford's Kappa Sigma fraternity house, was partly inspired by U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner's unfortunate decision to share racy photos via Twitter. So, if not for naughty bits, what exactly is the purpose of sending images and videos that rapidly disappear? In a September blog post celebrating its first anniversary, Team Snapchat shared a vision that comes off as downright wholesome. ""We believe in sharing authentic moments with friends,"" it read. ""It's not all about fancy vacations, sushi dinners, or beautiful sunsets. Sometimes it's an inside joke, a silly face, or greetings from a pet fish. ""There is value in the ephemeral,"" the post continues. ""Great conversations are magical. That's because they are shared, enjoyed, but not saved.""","Competition from Facebook Poke may have spurred popularity of mobile app Snapchat .

"Unlike most harried men in many other countries around this time each year, Korean men don't have to worry about shopping for jewelry or flowers or writing nice cards to give to their significant other on February 14. Instead, for South Koreans Valentine's Day is when women shower men with chocolates. It's also just one romantic day in a whole series of calendar-dictated romantic days. Next up is March 14. Known as White Day, on this occasion men gift women with candy. Fact: Chupa Chups is the most sold candy. Next is Black Day on April 14, when downbeat singles who didn't receive any goodies head to local Chinese restaurants to commiserate over their loneliness while eating jjajyangmyeon, or ""black noodles."" Surprisingly, one of the most popular gift-giving days of the year is November 11, or Pepero Day, so named in honor of a favorite Korean stick-shaped snack. (Link in Korean only) Catering to women . Throughout the country, stores selling confectionery prepare for months leading up to February for one of their best-selling days of the year. As February 14 nears, visitors to the country will notice lines and lines of women at such stores. Naturally, retailers need to cater to the female shopper's eye. ""Valentine's Day is one of our top five days of the year,"" Chul-hyun Yoo, the public relations representative for CU convenience stores, told CNN. With 7,900 stores throughout the country, CU is the number one convenience store chain in South Korea, recording almost ₩3 trillion (US$2.8 billion) in total sales last year. ""You can tell what concerns women and men is different by comparing the sales of Valentine's Day and White Day,"" said Yoo. ""Women tend to go for value for money, while men buy big, flashy baskets."" One translation: women are comparatively stingy, while men like to show off. Some of the best-selling items on Valentine's Day are the Ferrero Rocher chocolates sold in packets of three or five. Fellas, don't eat all at once. Becoming unhealthy? At the more upscale Jubilee Chocolatier dessert cafe in Seoul, women line up on the days up to Valentine's Day to buy handmade chocolates that can be customized with their loved one's initials. ""Our Valentine's Day sales make up 20 percent of our entire sales,"" said Gae-ra Lee, public relations representative for the cafe. Although the series of romantic days used to cater more towards couples, or those wanting to confess their secret loves using a romantic day as an excuse, in recent years, goodie-gifting on Valentine's Day and White Day has expanded to include family, co-workers and pretty much anyone you come into contact with on those days. ""I'm buying chocolates for my father. I feel like Valentine's Day should about confessing romantic love,"" said Jin-hee Oh, 28, an office worker shopping at Lotte Department store. ""Nowadays, you don't give chocolates on Valentine's Day because you really like that person,"" said Chun Kyung-woo, a culture reporter for a local newspaper. ""The custom has evolved so that now you have to give small crappy candy that no one actually wants to all your friends and everyone at the office down to your security guard as a show of goodwill,"" said Chun. ""It's unhealthy."" So what did I do? Along with the other female members of the Seoul office, we each gave the Turner Korea boss some chocolate.

"You may have been paying it for 30 years without even knowing. But it all ends Friday. After a protracted legal battle, the Department of Energy is removing a small fee from electric bills intended to pay for the disposal of spent fuel at nuclear power plants. Power companies and state regulators successfully fought the Energy Department over the matter, saying the government has been collecting the fee for 30 years but won't begin disposing of nuclear waste for another 34 years. In a November ruling, a federal appeals court called the fees ""quite unfair"" and ordered the government to stop collecting them. The change takes effect Friday. The fee is tiny -- one mill, or a tenth of a cent, for every kilowatt hour generated by nuclear power. That amounts to about 15 to 20 cents on the average monthly electric bill, industry officials estimate. But those tiny fees add up. Since 1982, the Nuclear Waste Fund has grown by about $40 billion, and fees contribute an additional $750 million every year. But interest income means the fund will continue to grow by about $1.3 billion a year. Currently, the fund contains $31 billion, after the government spent billions on the failed effort to open a nuclear repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. Waste not removed . For Michigan Public Service Commissioner Greg White, who fought the fee for years, the court victory is ""bittersweet."" The lawsuit, White says, primarily was intended to prod the federal government into solving the nuclear waste issue. ""From the very infancy of the commercial nuclear power industry, the federal government has always stated that it would take responsibility for the (disposal) of high-level nuclear waste, and that hasn't happened,"" White said. ""The waste all sits at the plant sites where it was generated, despite the collection of some $40 billion."" Meanwhile, stockpiles of spent nuclear fuel continue to grow. An estimated 2,000 metric tons of waste are generated every year to the 70,000 tons stored at some 100 sites nationwide. Cooling the fuel . Spent nuclear fuel typically is stored for five years in pools of water, where it is allowed to cool. Then it is transferred to dry casks, which are considered safer because they can be cooled passively with air. In 1982, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which gave the Department of Energy a 1998 deadline to begin disposing of spent nuclear fuel. After lengthy studies, Congress designated Yucca Mountain as the site for a permanent repository of nuclear waste. But opposition was intense, both from Nevada residents and environmentalists.  And in 2010, President Barack Obama, fulfilling a campaign promise, scuttled the Yucca Mountain program. A group of state utility commissioners, power companies and others went to court arguing that the government should not be collecting fees in the absence of a program. The court, in turn, pressed the Department of Energy to defend the fee, demanding estimates on the cost of future waste disposal efforts. It didn't like what it heard. The real solution: dispose of waste . ""According to the Secretary (of Energy), the final balance of the fund to be used to pay the costs of disposal could be somewhere between a $2 trillion deficit and a $4.9 trillion surplus,"" U.S. Appeals Court Judge Laurence Silberman wrote.  ""This range is so large as to be absolutely useless as an analytical technique"" to determining the size of the fee. The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry organization, heralded the decision to kill the fee, and lamented the lack of progress in finding a nuclear waste storage site. ""On-site storage is safe and can be maintained without any environmental impact. But that does not in any way excuse the federal government's failure to meet its commitment... to remove used fuel,"" it said in a statement. White, the Michigan utility commissioner, said the fee is ""a consumer rip-off.""  ""When you're paying a fee, you should be getting something for what you're paying for."" But he said the court ruling is an imperfect victory. ""A perfect victory would have been that the court would compel the federal government to do the program as required by law,"" he said. White said he would welcome the return of the fee if it was accompanied by a workable plan to dispose of spent fuel.","The Department of Energy is removing a small fee from electric bills for nuclear disposal .
Power companies said the government was collecting the fee for 30 years .
But the government is not disposing of nuclear waste ."
"The news that a large number of Westerners, including several Americans, had become hostages in North Africa shook the U.S. once again out of the delusion that it is possible to turn away from the world's problems. Many Americans would like nothing better than to forget about the rest of the planet and focus on all the challenges crying for attention at home. After more than a decade of fighting costly and painful wars in faraway lands, people have grown weary, tired of worrying about complicated conflicts that seem to have no connection to their own lives. But then bad things happen. Read more: Power struggle: The North African gas industry targeted by militants . On Wednesday, in a dramatic operation in Algeria's portion of the Sahara, Islamist militants in the desert attacked a convoy of oil workers -- the people who work to satisfy the world's need for fuel. The jihadists claimed to have captured more than 40 hostages, including Americans, British, French and others. The U.S. called the incident a ""terrorist"" attack, and what followed has been the typical flurry of confusion -- possible escapes, killings. Without a doubt, the families of the hostages are suffering unbearable anxiety. Meanwhile, there is a war raging in Mali, neighbor to Algeria. Until recently a democratic state, landlocked Mali is becoming home to terrorism, as Islamist militants affiliated with al Qaeda and its allies have been conquering the country and brutally subjugating the population in the process. France has just sent military forces to the country after a desperate plea from its president. Fortified with weapons seized from the Libyan war and emboldened by their unstoppable march across Mali, these militant groups have been growing stronger. Zakaria: Prepare for refugee crisis in Mali . The hostage emergency is only the most recent in a dramatic series of events occurring in North Africa over many months. In this chaotic and fluid crisis, we hope the hostages will return safely to their families. But that will not end the bigger crisis in the region. While it unfolds, the rest of the world has to pay attention, whether it likes it or not. Islamist militants, including al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), have operated in Algeria and other parts of North Africa for years, massacring civilians indiscriminately, taking countless Western hostages, collecting ransom, and more importantly, seeking to overthrow existing governments and imposing their rule. In Algeria, the government has the upper hand. But Mali has gone into free fall despite having served as a shining example of democracy in West Africa, for decades a place of tolerance, art and culture. After separatist Tuareg rebels joined forces with al Qaeda-linked militants, the country's political system began to unravel. A military coup weakened government forces, and the insurgency pushed ahead, conquering the northern half of the country. People living in areas under Islamist rule have endured floggings, amputations and public executions, according to human rights groups and witnesses. Killings, rapes, torture and other crimes have prompted calls for the International Criminal Court to become involved. Residents say the rebels have been buying children to use as soldiers. And they have engaged in the wholesale destruction of the ancient treasures of the city of Timbuktu, a world heritage site, much as the Taliban did when they conquered Afghanistan and blew up the ancient Buddha statues in Bamiyan. The United Nations warns that hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee their homes and millions more are at risk of running out of food in the Sahel, the area bordering the Sahara, which is experiencing a severe drought. As the rebels entrench their position, they build a stronghold in a part of the world where institutions are fragile and people are vulnerable. The conflict may be local, but the rebels' ideology considers the West the enemy, and non-Muslims as well as moderate Muslims fair game for their brutality. It's been almost a year since the U.N., the U.S., NATO and Africa's leaders agreed that the international community urgently need to lend a hand to the embattled government and people of Mali. World leaders met, argued, discussed and did essentially nothing. Until this week. That's when the rebels launched an advance toward the capital, Bamako, and Mali's president sent out an SOS to Paris and the U.N. France, a former colonial power, mobilized its military and launched bombing raids and sent in troops. France has deep connections with Mali, Algeria and other former colonies. Thousands of French citizens live there, and personal and business connections run deep. The military operation, launched by France's Socialist President Francois Hollande, has strong support at home, at least so far. The hostage-takers in Algeria claim their attack on the foreign oil workers was retaliation for France's intervention and for Algeria's granting permission for military overflights. But experts say the militants' attack was too sophisticated, probably planned well before Paris became involved with Mali. More likely, the Algerian hostage crisis signals that Islamist extremists and dangerous gangs are gaining ascendancy in that part of the world, a region that is remote but crucial. It is a part of Africa at the intersection of the Arab world -- of enormous strategic importance to the West -- and the West African heartland, a region only now becoming more stable after years of unspeakable human tragedy. We may want to avert out eyes, worry about the problems at home, and think this one, too, can be ""kicked down the road,"" to use the term fashionable for explaining inaction on domestic matters. But some problems become much worse if ignored. The hostage crisis is a warning that militants must be pushed back. Without sending American troops into combat, the U.S. should provide greater support to the French and other African governments in helping Mali to defeat the Islamist militants and return democracy to Mali. The last thing the people of Mali and the West want is a gang of al Qaeda-affiliated Islamist militants in charge of an entire country.  We've already seen that once before, and it didn't end well for anyone.","Americans, others have been taken hostage by Islamist militants in Algeria .

"The New York Police Department, the largest police force in the United States, announced Tuesday that it has received funding to equip close to 20,000 officers with naloxone, a heroin antidote that can instantly reverse the effects of an overdose. State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman declared that his office would provide the funding of more than $1.1 million to equip and train the NYPD officers as part of the Community Overdose Prevention Program. ""By providing NYPD police officers with naloxone, we are making this stunningly effective overdose antidote available in every corner of the five boroughs. This program will literally save lives,"" Schneiderman said at a press conference. Each naloxone kit consists of a zip bag or pouch containing two pre-filled syringes of naloxone, two atomizers for nasal administration, sterile gloves and a booklet on the use of the drug, according to a statement from Schneiderman's office. The emergency treatment works like the well-known EpiPen -- an epinephrine auto-injector for serious allergic reactions -- as it is injected into the muscle and does not require training, making it more user-friendly. Once injected, the naloxone stops heroin and other opioids from slowing a person's breathing down to the point that it stops. The FDA approved the prescription treatment after just 15 weeks under priority status. Currently, most law enforcement agencies are using the nasal spray version of the antidote, which is slightly different than the auto-injector. How heroin kills you . ""A recent pilot project in Staten Island has already proven effective with several overdose victims,"" said NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, who did not have an exact time frame of when the officers would officially be equipped. The training for each officer takes roughly 45 minutes, Bratton said. Joining Schneiderman and Bratton at the announcement was Carol Christiansen, co-founder of Drug Crisis in Our Backyard. Christiansen's son, a former NYPD detective, died of a heroin overdose in 2012. Erik, 28, injured his back at the gym and became addicted to oxycodone for the pain, which led to an eventual addiction to heroin. ""It's an epidemic I think everybody should be aware of,"" Christiansen said, who believes the real problem is the poor monitoring of prescription medication. Schneiderman also led the effort to pass legislation to create I-STOP, a monitoring program that prevents individuals from going from doctor to doctor to accumulate multiple prescriptions. ""If the I-STOP law was in effect over two years ago possibly my son, Erik, would be alive today,"" Christiansen said. The police department of Quincy, Massachusetts, was the first in the nation to require its officers to carry naloxone and has successfully reversed 211 overdoses with a success rate of over 95%. In New York's Suffolk County, 563 lives were saved last year alone, the statement said. ""Equipping the NYPD with naloxone is a tremendously important step in the fight against New York's growing opioid addiction epidemic,"" said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, chief medical officer of Phoenix House in Manhattan. Attorney General Eric Holder vows to fight rising heroin deaths . The heroin epidemic, and the antidote for overdose . Long Island sees exploding heroin use .","The NYPD will equip nearly 20,000 officers with naloxone, a heroin antidote .

"Bill de Blasio is 6-foot-6.  Joshua Jenkins is 4-foot-2. It's probably too much to expect the mayor of New York to get down on his knee and look Joshua in the eye before he destroys the 9-year-old's future.  But de Blasio could at least learn his name. Or Briana Pizarro's. Or any of the 600 children whose future de Blasio just sacrificed. Last week, the New York mayor reversed plans to allow three charter schools -- all run by the high-performing Success Academy chain -- to open in city buildings.  De Blasio killed off two of the schools before they could open next year. But the closure of the third, Harlem Central Success Academy, has evicted hundreds of fifth-, sixth- and seventh-graders and abandoned them to a predictable path. Admittedly, I am a fan of school choice in general and Success Academy in particular.  I have a kindergartner who attends Success Academy. And on Saturday, I went to the condemned Harlem Central to meet the evicted parents and children. So I have seen something de Blasio refuses to see. I have been in a Success Academy school. There, face to face, you can't avoid the two clear paths -- one of these families' choosing and one de Blasio has chosen -- and seeing where they will lead these children's lives. Briana Pizarro looks people in the eye. I noticed it first when she firmly shook my hand. She held my gaze while telling me about the Louisiana Purchase.  But that's not the most impressive thing about this 10-year-old. In 2013, Briana was one of the 96% of Success Academy Harlem Central fifth-graders to pass the state math test. In the state of New York, no class did better. Not the rich kids on the Upper East Side; not the rich white kids in Westchester. These kids ranked first. ""We're not talking about associates degrees here,"" said Brianna's mother, Wendy Martinez, about the path where Success Academy placed her daughter.  ""My kid is talking about being a judge. A doctor."" Martinez grew up in Harlem. She went to the district zone schools she was assigned to attend. ""It's not fair,"" Martinez said, comparing the process to the ""Hunger Games.""  ""If you're in District 5, you go to a bad school; if you're in District 2, you go to a good school."" When she married, both Martinez and her husband committed to providing their children the best education they could find. That was Success Academy. Education ""is the one thing no one can take away from you,"" she said. We sat silently for a moment. There was no need to point out that her statement was obviously untrue.  ""He's taken my child's future away."" Natasha Brown knows the path her son Joshua and his brother Jayden Jenkins will be forced to follow because of de Blasio's decision. It's the path her three oldest daughters went down. They all went to the assigned district school in Harlem. ""The nonsense. Uggghhh. The fights."" Brown dropped her head to the table before relating of school fights involving her daughters a week ago, two months ago, years ago. ""I'm not sending my sons to the school by my house. I've seen it. ""My youngest daughter has been held back three times. She's now too old for her class, so they're about to transfer her to an alternative school. She wants to drop out.  My middle daughter did drop out.  But my oldest, she eventually graduated,"" Brown said. Joshua sometimes helps his teenage sisters with math.  ""Math is my favorite,"" said Joshua, who, like Briana, looks me directly in the eye. "" They teach us different ways to do math ... besides the standard algorithm.""  Again, Joshua is 9. Joshua and Briana were on a path at Harlem Central where 85% of all the students passed the state math test. A few blocks away is the path Brown described and de Blasio would force them to follow. At PS 76, 8% of the students passed the state math test. At PS 149, 3% passed. Three percent. Why would anyone shut down these schools? There are two theories as to why de Blasio would evict hundreds of minority children in Harlem. The first theory is political retribution. De Blasio hates the founder of Success Academy, Eva Moskowitz, who is also a Democrat, and he's made no secret of it. In fact, he called his shot. ""Another thing that has to change starting in January is that Eva Moskowitz cannot continue to have the run of the place,"" he said at a candidates' forum last year. ""I have had a lot of contact with Eva over the years, and this is documented. She was giving the orders, and chancellors were bowing down."" At a United Federation of Teachers forum in May, de Blasio said Moskowitz must not be ""tolerated, enabled, supported."" If it's true that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie made traffic the collateral damage of his vendetta, then he is an amateur compared with his neighbor across the Hudson River, who easily made the future of 600 children his collateral damage. The second theory is de Blasio is a true believer. Maybe he truly believes in the teachers union over students. Maybe he truly believes in a perverted sense of fairness that demands if everyone can't have a good education, then no one should. Why should you -- in Sacramento or Waco -- care about the story of these kids? Why should you care about Joshua Jenkins? Because  generations -- four decades of children, in every state in this country -- have had a stagnant and subpar education.  One assessment has ranked the U.S. education system 17th in the world. This is a distorted mirror for anyone who calls himself a progressive to stare into. How does de Blasio, or anyone who says he or she stands for the progress of the underprivileged, justify looking at the percentage of minorities who fail to graduate from high school -- in 2013, 32% of Latinos and 38% of African-Americans --  and get rid of a way out for them? De Blasio was elected on a campaign theme of a Tale of Two Cities. What he should see here is a tale of two paths. If inequality and opportunity for minorities were more than empty slogans to him, de Blasio would  go to Success Academy on his knees, hoping to find something to duplicate, not destroy. Maybe from that position, the imposing mayor can face his victims. I promise, mayor, they'll look you in the eye.","New York mayor decided not to let three charter schools operate in city buildings .

"Of all al Qaeda's affiliated groups, the Somali terrorist organization Al-Shabaab has over the past several years had the deepest links to the United States. Some 15 Americans have died fighting for Al-Shabaab, as many as four of them as suicide bombers in Somalia, and an American citizen even took up a leadership role in the group. Al-Shabaab has also found supporters in places as diverse as Seattle, St. Louis, San Diego, Minnesota, Maryland, Ohio and Alabama. Al-Shabaab had particular success recruiting Somali-Americans to its cause after the Ethiopian army invaded Somalia in 2006, which Al-Shabaab cast as Somalia being taken over by a ""crusader"" army. Ethiopia is a majority Christian nation. The largest group of American citizens and residents who have provided manpower and money to Al-Shabaab reside in Minnesota. According to a count by the New America Foundation, 22 residents of Minnesota have funded or fought with Al-Shabaab during the past four years. Opinion: How Al-Shabaab picks its targets . Three of them provided funds to Al-Shabaab, and 19 have been indicted for traveling to fight in Somalia or have died in the war there. The story of Minnesotan support for Al-Shabaab began in late 2007, when Cabdulaahi Ahmed Faarax, an American citizen of Somali descent in his early 30s, and several other men met at a Minnesota mosque and discussed traveling to Somalis to fight for Al-Shabaab. Faarax told the group that he had ""experienced true brotherhood"" while fighting in Somalia and that ""jihad would be fun"" and they would ""get to shoot guns,"" according to the U.S. Justice Department. That meeting resulted in seven men traveling from Minnesota to Somalia to fight for Al-Shabaab in late 2007. One was Shirwa Ahmed, a 26-year-old naturalized American citizen. Ahmed became the first American to conduct a suicide attack when he drove a truck loaded with explosives toward a government compound in Puntland, northern Somalia, blowing himself up and killing 20 other people in October 29, 2008. He is buried in a cemetery in Burnsville, a suburb of Minneapolis. Other American suicide attackers would follow. In early June 2011, Farah Mohamed Beledi, 27, of Minneapolis detonated a bomb, becoming one of two suicide attackers responsible for killing two African Union soldiers in Somalia, according to the FBI. The third American to conduct a suicide attack was Abdisalan Hussein Ali, a 22-year-old from Minneapolis who took part in a strike on African Union troops in the Somali capital of Mogadishu on October 29, 2011. There may even have been a fourth American suicide attacker in Somalia. On September 17, 2009, two stolen U.N. vehicles loaded with bombs blew up at the Mogadishu airport, killing more than a dozen peacekeepers of the African Union. The FBI suspects that 18-year-old Omar Mohamud of Seattle was one of the bombers. For those Americans who have traveled to Somalia to fight for Al-Shabaab, it has often proved to be a one-way ticket. A 2011 report by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security found that at least 15 Americans had died while fighting for Al-Shabaab (as well as three Canadians). Opinion: What threat do foreign jihadists pose? Some of the young men who volunteered to fight in Somalia had grown up in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis, which is one of the poorest places in the United States. In recent years, Somali-American family incomes there averaged less than $15,000 a year, and the unemployment rate was 17%. Al-Shabaab's American support network also extended well beyond Minnesota. Basaaly Saeed Moalin, a cabdriver in San Diego who was in contact with an Al-Shabaab leader, was convicted of sending funds to the group along with three co-conspirators this year. In St. Louis, Mohamud Abdi Yusuf pleaded guilty in 2012 of providing funds to Al-Shabaab. A resident of Ohio, Ahmed Hussain Mahamud, was indicted in 2011 for funding Somali-Americans traveling to join Al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab's support network in the United States has reached beyond the Somali-American community. Ruben Shumpert, an African-American convert to Islam from Seattle, was killed in Somalia in 2008. A former U.S. soldier, Craig B. Baxam, 24, of Laurel, Maryland, was arrested by Kenyan authorities in December 2011 as he tried to make his way to Somalia to join Al-Shabaab, which he told FBI agents he considered to be a religious duty. Omar Hammami of Daphne, Alabama, grew up Baptist and converted to Islam when he was in his teens.  In a lengthy autobiography that Hammami posted online last year entitled ""The Story of an American Jihadi,"" he explained his long journey from growing up Christian in a small town in Alabama to fighting on the front lines in Somalia with Al-Shabaab. The journey began with a life-changing trip to Syria, the homeland of his father, when he was 15 that sparked his interest in Islam. Hammami wrote in his autobiography (PDF), ""when I came back from that vacation, I had become a different person."" Over the past several years, Hammami rose up the ranks in Al-Shabaab, becoming an important leader. Disputes with other Al-Shabaab leaders led him to split off from the group. He was killed this month, probably by members of Al-Shabaab, according to Islamist websites. In the wake of many of these developments, for the past three years, the Justice Department and the FBI have engaged in a serious effort to crack down on U.S. support for Al-Shabaab, in particular in Minnesota, in an effort codenamed Operation Rhino. This seems to have had some success, as the number of Americans indicted for supporting Al-Shabaab on the front lines or with their wallets has dropped sharply since the launch of Operation Rhino. Al-Shabaab breaks new ground with complex Nairobi attack . Over the weekend, Al-Shabaab issued a list of nine names it claimed were among the attackers who carried out its deadly assault on the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya. Al-Shabaab alleged that three of the attackers were from the United States. The FBI is looking into whether these claims are true. Whether or not any Americans played a role in the massacre in Nairobi that has claimed 62 lives, there is a deadly history of American support for Al-Shabaab.","Peter Bergen: Of al Qaeda's affiliates, Al-Shabaab has had deepest links to the U.S.

"Despite his designer clothes and BMW, Isla Vista shooting suspect Elliot Rodger was not from a wealthy family. Rodger's father, a photographer and film director, was deeply in debt, and his mother made just $40,000 a year as a research assistant for a film company, according to documents from his parents' divorce. Santa Barbara County, California, investigators say Rodger, 22, stabbed to death three people in his apartment, shot two women to death outside a sorority house and killed another man inside a deli with gunfire before apparently killing himself near the campus of the University of California at Santa Barbara on Friday. Timeline to 'Retribution': Isla Vista attacks planned over years . The 107,000-word ""story"" that Rodger sent to his parents, therapists and several others just before the killings suggested that he was angry that his parents were not wealthy. ""Where's the justice? I thought. Why couldn't I have been born into that life?"" Rodger wrote.  His father's family in Britain ""was once part of the wealthy upper classes before they lost all of their fortune during the Great Depression,"" he wrote. Rodger's mother and father had rich friends in Los Angeles, which allowed him to sometimes enjoy the benefits of money, such as tickets to a private Katy Perry concert in 2012. ""I tried to pretend as if I was part of a wealthy family,"" he wrote about that night. ""I should be. That was the life I was meant to live. I WOULD BE!"" He blamed his parents for his lack of wealth. ""If only my damnable mother had married into wealth instead of being selfish,"" he wrote. She dated wealthy men after her divorce, giving her son hope and prompting him to ""pester"" her to marry one, he said. ""I will always resent my mother for refusing to do this. If not for her sake, she should have done it for mine. Joining a family of great wealth would have truly saved my life. I would have a high enough status to attract beautiful girlfriends and live above all of my enemies."" His father also failed him, he wrote. ""If only my failure of a father had made better decisions with his directing career instead wasting his money on that stupid documentary."" The documentary -- a film about celebrities' view of God titled ""Oh My God"" -- plunged his father into debt when Rodger was a teenager and caused him to stop paying child support, according to court papers. ""My business has not generated any income in over a year,"" Peter Rodger said in a 2009 filing asking the judge to modify his $2,000 a month child support payments for his two children.  ""As a result, I currently receive no income from any source. I am searching for employment, but have been unable to find a job."" His mother noted that her former husband used the equity in his home to finance the documentary, but she agreed to a one-year suspension of child support.  With her monthly income just $3,200 a month, she said had to ""depend in the generosity of family and friends to make ends meet."" It was his working mother's generosity to her adult son, including paying his rent and the gift of a used BMW 328i, that allowed Rodger to live in the college community of Isla Vista.  He bought his three handguns with money saved from gifts from grandparents and the $500 a month his father sent him, according to Rodger's writing. Five revelations from the 'twisted world' of a 'kissless virgin' He became obsessed with gaining wealth as the ""only way I could lose my virginity, the only way I could have the beautiful girlfriend I know I deserve."" ""I had no talents, so it was impossible for me to become a professional actor, musician, or athlete; and those were usually the ways that young people acquired such money,"" he wrote. ""I could invent something, or start a business just like Mark Zuckerberg did with Facebook, but the chances of me achieving such a thing were the same chances I had of winning the lottery anyway."" He played California's Mega Millions lottery whenever the jackpot rose above $100 million.  He drove to Arizona four times to buy Powerball lottery chances.  He went into a rage each time he did not win. ""Without the prospect of becoming wealthy at a young age, I had nothing to live for now,"" Rodger wrote. ""I was going to be a virgin outcast forever. I realized that I had to start planning and preparing for the Day of Retribution, even though I hadn't yet had any idea of what day that would be."" The divorce documents also confirmed that Elliot Rodger was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, a form of autism, when he was 7.  ""Elliot has special needs,"" his mother said in a sworn statement.  ""He is a high functioning autistic child."" That he was autistic should not lead to a conclusion that autism had any connection to the attacks, according to Scott Badesch, the president of the Autism Society of America.

"(CNN)It's Movember, that time of year when men everywhere grow ridiculous looking mustaches to raise awareness about men's health. Dallas photographer S. Van Lokey may not be able to grow a bushy mustache, but that hasn't stopped her from taking her own ""hairied"" journey. Yes, that's a woman in those photos. For the second year in a row, the short-haired, part-time office manager has been transforming herself into old-timey mustached men with the help of black face paint, some hair gel, a few props and an iPhone. She shoots hundreds of photos in slightly different poses and picks her favorites to make her Facebook profile picture throughout the month. She recently shared some of them on CNN iReport with the headline ""Just a crazy woman wearing mustaches."" As she describes it, ""What started out as a wacky Movember mustache photo project turned into a serious exercise in making me unrecognizable even to myself."" Send us your Movember selfies . While some of these mustached-characters may look familiar, most aren't based on real people though Lokey draws inspiration from her Italian family and old photographs she finds online. She estimates she owns more than 50 mustaches of varying thicknesses, her favorite being the big and bushy style. This year, in particular, she's going with a '40s-inspired look. She's modest about her talents, hesitating to call herself an artist despite a degree in painting and drawing and a freelance art and photography business. ""I love doing it and it's definitely fun,"" she said. ""I try not to fixate too much on just one. It either works or it doesn't."" It all started last year around this time. Lokey had some goofy stick-on mustaches lying around. She decided to take a picture wearing one and post it on Facebook in honor of the Movember campaign. She thought about posting one every day of the month, but quickly got bored. That's when the characters began to come to life. Lokey used props she found around the house and bought more realistic-looking mustaches from an online theater supply shop. ""I decided to spice it up a little, and then eventually my friends were like, 'I don't even see you in this photo.' And that made me think, 'Wow, let me see what I can really do with this.' "" Soon, Lokey's friends were finding her pictures unrecognizable and her face completely lost in the midst of makeup and facial hair. Lokey says she has always liked playing characters. You can see her zany sketches on YouTube, including a woman named Penny, who she describes as ""this drunk person who's really drunk all the time."" After last year's Movember series, she compiled her characters in a self-published book for her friends. If she ever makes any real money from the book, she says she'll donate a portion of the proceeds to the Movember Foundation. To become her mustachioed men, Lokey plays around with accents and poses, extending her jaw or turning her head in a certain way to manipulate the look. Then it's time for the shot. No fancy camera or tripod here -- Lokey does it, selfie-style, with an iPhone 5S. For the final effects, she makes no alterations in Photoshop but uses photo apps on her phone to add filters, brighten the images and achieve the vintage feel. ""Even though my pictures are not real, in that I'm trying to be someone else, I try to make sure they're real without altering them too much digitally,"" she said. ""Keeping the fake real is what I'm trying to do."" The entire process can take a couple hours and ends with Lokey looking nothing like herself. ""People ask me, 'Oh, who is this in the photo? And I'm always like, that's me,' "" she said. ""My stepdad tells me all the time that it's not me in the photos."" And that's exactly what she wants. ""My goal is to lose myself,"" she said. ""If someone can't recognize me, I have done my job.""","The Movember Foundation challenges men to grow mustaches in November to raise awareness for men's health .

"(CNN)Americans will spend about $550 million on self-help books this year and more than $1 billion on motivational speakers. Obviously, many of us are on a quest for happiness. I get it. We all want, and deserve, that sense of well-being. But save your money. Achieving happiness is easier than you may think. We all experience emotional highs throughout our lives -- with a job promotion, on our wedding day, with the birth of a child. But these moments only yield temporary feelings of elation, and experts say that they alone are not enough to achieve true happiness. Happiness isn't just an emotional state. Decades of research proves it goes much deeper. In fact, science shows people who are happy live longer and healthier lives. The good news is that generating better bliss is something we can all do regardless of our environment or genetics. Here are seven ways to boost your life satisfaction: . Start by changing your attitude. That's right -- I'm talking to you, pessimists. A Harvard University study found that optimists are not only happier but are 50% less likely to have heart disease, a heart attack or a stroke. It turns out that keeping a positive outlook actually offers protection against cardiovascular disease. The science doesn't fare as well for pessimists. They have lower levels of happiness compared with optimists and are three times as likely to develop health problems as they age, researchers say. Learn from people who are already happy. Denmark has earned the top spot on the European Commission's ""Eurobarometer"" for well-being and happiness every year since 1973. And when the United Nations went on the hunt for the happiest nation in the world, it ranked Denmark No. 1. So what makes Danes more satisfied with their lives? Sure, things like life expectancy, gross domestic product and a low-corruption rate help. But the overall level of happiness in Denmark has more to do with the generosity that's common among citizens, their freedom to make life choices and a strong social support system, according to the U.N. World Happiness Report. Copenhagen: The world's happiest city . Work less. The Danes seem to strike a great work-life balance, which ups their happiness level. Simply put: They don't overwork. In fact, the average workweek in Denmark is 33 hours -- only 2% of Danes work more than 40 hours a week. Almost 80% of mothers in Denmark return to work after having a child, but they balance their free time between families, weekly happy hour with their girlfriends and participating in community club programs. Focus on experiences. Danes also pay less attention to gadgets and things and more attention to building memories. Studies show that people who focus on experiences over ""things"" have higher levels of satisfaction, long after the moment of the experience has passed. Too much stuff tends often leads to debt, not to mention the time and stress associated with keeping up all those gadgets, cars, properties, clothes, etc. Researchers say when people focus on experiences, they feel a greater sense of vitality or ""being alive"" during the experience and afterward. It also brings you mentally closer to the people around you, which may contribute to your happiness boost. Build up your social network. By simply being social, you could slow down your biological age. Research shows that a strong social support system can lengthen our telomeres. Telomeres are the tiny caps on our DNA chromosomes that indicate our cellular age. According to experts, no friends can equal shorter telomeres and, in turn, a shorter life. Other studies have showed that loneliness leads to higher rates of depression, health problems and stress. Solution: Have at least one close friend to boost your happiness level and health. Volunteer. People who volunteer are happier with their lives than those who don't, according to dozens of studies. The United Nations even credits volunteerism as one of the reasons Denmark is the happiest nation in the world -- 43% of Danes regularly give back to their community, compared with 25% of Americans. The joy of helping others starts early. A 2012 study found children prefer to give than to receive. Researchers gave two groups of toddlers snacks and then asked one group to give their treats away. The children who gave away their treats showed greater happiness about sharing their possessions, suggesting that the act of personal sacrifice was emotionally rewarding, researchers say. The sacrifice doesn't have to be big -- previous research has found that donating or spending as little as $5 on others has emotional benefits. Experts say we are all inherently compassionate. Performing acts of kindness, volunteering time and donating money increases happiness by improving your sense of community, purpose and self-image. Just start laughing. Research shows that laughing doesn't just signal happiness, it produces it. When we laugh, our stress hormones decrease and our endorphins rise. Endorphins are the same brain chemicals associated with the ""runner's high"" you get from exercise. Live to 100: Laugh more . Laughing is also good for your heart. A study found that only 8% of heart patients who were made to laugh daily had a second heart attack within a year, compared with 42% of the non-laughers. Studies show our bodies can't differentiate between fake and real laughter; you'll get the health boost either way. So you can even fake it until you make it. Laugh in your car, in the shower -- force yourself to start laughing a few minutes every day.","Science shows happy people live longer and healthier lives .

"A Georgia truck driver has been charged in a New Jersey wreck that left comedian Tracy Morgan in critical condition and another man dead, authorities said Saturday. Kevin Roper, 35, of Jonesboro, was charged with one count of death by auto and four counts of assault by auto after the tractor-trailer he was driving crashed into the limo bus carrying the comedian and others, the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office said. Initial reports indicated there were seven people injured in the crash, but the prosecutor's statement put the number at four. Morgan's condition was not expected to change Saturday, publicist Lewis Kay said. ""His family is now with him and he is receiving excellent care."" Morgan, 45, was a regular on ""Saturday Night Live"" for seven years and received an Emmy nomination for his role on ""30 Rock,"" in which he played Tracy Jordan, an exaggerated version of himself. The New York City native made his reputation with over-the-top characters and impressions of celebrities such as Mike Tyson and Oprah Winfrey. The wreck occurred at about 1 a.m. ET on Saturday on the turnpike in Mercer County, said Sgt. Gregory Williams of New Jersey State Police. ""NJSP says the driver of the tractor-trailer failed to observe slow-moving traffic ahead,"" Williams said. ""At the last minute, he swerved to try and avoid the Mercedes limo bus but struck it from behind, forcing the limo to rotate and overturn."" A limo passenger, 63-year-old James McNair of Peekskill, New York, was killed and three people besides Morgan were taken to the hospital, authorities said. McNair was a comedian who performed under the name Jimmy Mack, said his sister, Valerie Daniel. ""He spoke very highly of Tracy,"" she told CNN. ""They go way back."" The prosecutor's statement said Morgan and two others, whose identities have not been formally released, remain hospitalized in critical condition. The remaining passenger was treated at the hospital and was released, the statement said. Four other vehicles were involved in the crash, the prosecutors said, but the people in those vehicles were not injured. Williams said he does not believe alcohol played a role in the accident, but that is under investigation. Brooke Buchanan, a Walmart spokesperson, said the truck driver is a Walmart employee. ""This is a tragedy and we are profoundly sorry that one of our trucks was involved,"" said Bill Simon, president and CEO of Walmart U.S., in a statement. ""The facts are continuing to unfold. If it's determined that our truck caused the accident, Walmart will take full responsibility."" The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate ""safety issues related to commercial trucking and limousine safety,"" said agency spokesman Keith Holloway. Christopher Thompson, spokesman for limo owner Atlantic Transportation Services, said driver Tyrone Gale, who is part owner of the company, was shaken up. ""Although the investigation is still pending, we concur with the preliminary reports that the accident was caused by another vehicle traveling behind the Atlantic limo bus and we are grateful that our drivers did not sustain life-threatening injuries,"" Thompson said. Morgan performed a comedy tour act Friday night at the Dover Downs Hotel & Casino in Dover, Delaware, the venue said. Thompson said he thought the limo bus was heading to drop Morgan off in New Jersey. The actor received messages of support and concern on Twitter. ""Wishing a speedy recovery to our friend @RealTracyMorgan,"" tweeted SNL Weekend Update. ""Shocked to wake up and read that @RealTracyMorgan is injured. Love to Tracy and wishing him strength,"" said  former SNL cast member Rachel Dratch. ""My thoughts are with Tracy Morgan and his family. I hope he pulls through this soon and gets back to making us laugh!"" said Joan Rivers. ""Saying a prayer for @RealTracyMorgan,"" said actor-director Jon Favreau. ""Come on @RealTracyMorgan pull through this buddy,"" tweeted actor Ike Barinholtz of ""The Mindy Project.""

"Kirsten Haglund was 19 when she became Miss America in 2008, one of the youngest beauty queens ever to win the national title.  She used that platform to speak about what for her was a very sensitive subject: eating disorders. ""I realized what's making an impact on other people's lives is not this perfect image of the American ideal,"" she said. ""It's a true human story of struggle and triumph."" Unlike many of her fellow contestants, Haglund didn't spend her childhood competing in pageants. Instead, the Michigan native dreamed of performing as a professional ballerina. The pressures of trying to live out that dream led her into the nightmare of anorexia nervosa at age 12. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that causes people to obsess about their weight and the food they eat, according to the Mayo Clinic. People with the disease try to maintain a weight that's unhealthy for their age and height. Going to extremes: Eating disorders by the numbers . ""I was in ballet from just 3 years old. So from a very early age, the ideal female body type was very thin,"" said Haglund, now a political science major at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. ""That was the first image I had in my brain; I always equated beauty and worth with being skinny."" Haglund excelled in her studies while training in ballet, tap and jazz seven days a week. Her older brother had multiple learning disabilities, so she felt pressure to perform extraordinarily well. At 12, she left home to study at the Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet School, hoping it would lead to a professional career. It was her first time living away from her parents, and her body was developing as she entered puberty -- a risky time, experts say, for the onset of anorexia. Haglund's self-esteem began to plummet quickly as she was overwhelmed by panic and a fear of not achieving perfection. Once priding herself on a high level of performance and over-achievement, she was now questioning every move. ""I became more self-aware and all of the sudden felt this panic, like maybe I wasn't good enough or maybe my life was going to collapse around me and I couldn't accomplish this dream,"" she said. Adding to her anxiety, Haglund's mother was diagnosed that summer with breast cancer, a condition she was treated for and survived. The pre-teen looked for an answer to her out-of-control world from her peers. What she saw was a struggle many dancers face: the pressure to be thin. ""I looked at what they were doing, and so many of them were throwing away their lunches and not eating. I thought, 'if I can at least be thin, I know I can be successful at ballet.' "" She began to severely restrict her food intake and admits this gave her a sense of triumph. ""I remember the first day I decided to throw away my lunch, and I drank a Coke instead,"" she said. ""I felt really good. I remember that day and the choice I made. And it was a choice made out of fear, not logic."" This kind of behavior isn't uncommon among younger girls who are dealing with transitions in their life, said Linda Craighead, a psychology professor at Emory University. ""For them, it's not (as) much about looks and weight than it is with controlling something."" An estimated 10 million women and 1 million men in the U.S. battle anorexia or bulimia, according to the National Eating Disorders Association. And these disorders carry the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. Haglund scoured the Internet for tricks on how to avoid social situations involving food and frequently looked through images of celebrities for ""thinspiration."" ""I was living off coffee, Diet Coke and gum,"" she said. ""Every once in a while, I'd have vegetables, fruit or a spoonful of peanut butter."" She was consuming fewer than 900 calories daily, less than half the amount recommend for the average woman. Her hunger for more control morphed from starving herself to increasing her exercise routine in addition to her demanding ballet schedule. ""It was many days of small steps toward something extreme. It was a recipe for disaster and a really serious and painful situation."" Though anorexia most frequently occurs during teen years or young adulthood, it also may develop during childhood or later in life, experts say. Haglund was competing with the most talented dancers out there, all with dreams of becoming the prima ballerina. ""You were seen as elite if you engaged in some of those kinds of behaviors,"" Haglund said. ""It was something that most girls did, and if you ate like a normal person, you were looked down upon."" Her obsession with thinness worsened over the next three years. By then, the 5-foot-8 dancer had lost 30 pounds from her already tiny body. She admits she was pleased when family and friends noticed her shockingly thin frame. ""I felt like a shell of a human being. It wasn't happiness,"" Haglund said. ""Internally, I knew there was something seriously wrong with me, but I didn't know how to stop."" Undernourished and extremely depressed, she hazily recalls the day her mother picked her up from high school and forcibly took her to a doctor. Haglund angrily insisted that she was healthy, but her test results told another story. For the next two years, she was under intensive outpatient care, routinely meeting with her interdisciplinary team of a nutritionist, a psychologist and an eating-disorder specialist. ""At first, it was really yo-yo, especially with my food intake,"" she said. ""It's extremely difficult to unlearn all of that bad thinking. I had to work on visualizing a life outside of ballet if I wanted to get better."" Haglund left the performing company and scaled back on dancing to focus on getting better. Beauty pageants seem an odd fit for a recovering anorexic, but they offered Haglund an avenue for moving forward.  At age 17, her health was improving, and pageant competitions could win her a college scholarship. Back home in Farmington Hills, Michigan, she entered the Miss Oakland County pageant and, to her great surprise, won. But her eating disorder physician was concerned. ""I told her this could be triggering for someone who has a history of an eating disorder,"" said Kathleen Mammel, medical director at the Hough Center for Eating Disorders in nearby Royal Oak. ""She had to be very cautious to ensure she's not setting herself up for a difficult backslide."" That's not the way Haglund saw it. During the next year, as a freshman in college, she began to publicly speak about her struggles with anorexia, hoping to destigmatize the illness. Next came the Miss Michigan pageant. At 18, Haglund was the youngest contestant; she won the crown over several pageant veterans. Her new responsibilities forced her to leave college, and she spent six months traveling the country to attend national conferences on eating disorders. ""I learned so much about the illness; it was a really good educational period for me,"" she said. ""From hearing other people's recovery stories, I learned how to share my own personal struggles."" When Haglund entered the Miss America pageant, she was placed on a workout regimen monitored by her nutritionist. She was motivated to achieve her goals the healthy way. ""Of course, I felt pressure; I'm thinking, 'Gosh, if I get called to the top 10, I'm going to be in my swimsuit in front of 12 million people.' It was scary, but I was thinking of being healthy first. I knew that was more important than anything else."" Written off as the underdog by peers and judges, Haglund felt a greater freedom to be herself. ""I actually think that was more attractive to the judges. There were several girls who came up to me during the week and shared previous struggles with an eating disorder. It opened the door to many great conversations."" ""She used the topic of battling anorexia as a sincere commitment to help others struggling, and as a tool to solidify her own recovery,"" Mammel said. ""She was more surprised than anyone when she actually won."" Since stepping into the national spotlight, Haglund has continued to spread awareness as a role model for young girls. She's launched the Kirsten Haglund Foundation, which provides financial aid to those seeking treatment for eating disorders. ""Those who struggle with substance abuse can get off their drug and never face it again,"" Haglund said. ""But for somebody who overcomes an eating disorder, you have to face it every day, multiple times a day.""","The pressures of trying to be a ballerina led Haglund into anorexia nervosa at age 12 .

"Ferguson, Missouri, police Officer Darren Wilson, in his first interview since he fatally shot unarmed teenager Michael Brown, said he's not tormented by that fateful encounter on a street in suburban St. Louis last summer. ""I don't think it's haunting,"" Wilson told ABC News on Tuesday. ""It's always going to be something that happened. The reason I have a clean conscience is that I know I did my job right."" Repeating what he told a grand jury investigating the shooting, Wilson said Brown reached into his police vehicle and grabbed for his gun. He feared for his life, he said. It all started when Wilson asked the teenager to move out of the middle of the street, the officer told ABC's George Stephanopoulos. Brown walked over to his car and pushed the door back as Wilson tried to get out, the officer said. ""As I looked back at him, punches started flying,"" Wilson said in the interview, which aired Tuesday night. ""He threw the first one and hit me in the left side of my face."" Wilson doesn't know how many times he got hit. ""I just know there was a barrage of swinging and grabbing and pulling for about 10 seconds,"" Wilson told ABC. ""I reached out my window with my right hand to grab on to his forearm."" Wilson said he wanted to move Brown away. ""I just felt the immense power that he had. And then the way I've described it is, it was like a 5-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan. That's just how big this man was,"" Wilson said. ""He was very large, very powerful man."" Wilson is 6-foot-4 and 210 pounds; Brown was the same height and weighed nearly 300 pounds. Brown unleashed another punch and struck the officer in his face, Wilson said. ""How do I survive,"" Wilson recalled thinking. ""I didn't know if I'd be able to survive another hit like that."" Wilson reached for his gun and told Brown to back off or he would shoot, the officer said. ""You're too much of a (word bleeped) to shoot me,"" Wilson said Brown told him, before grabbing the top of the officer's gun. Wilson tried to squeeze off two shots but the gun jammed twice. Brown, he said, tried to reach the trigger guard to shoot Wilson. Wilson got a shot off on his third attempt, he said. ""He gets even angrier,"" Wilson said. ""His aggression, his face, the intensity just increases. He comes back in at me again."" There was another shot, Wilson told ABC. The officer gets out of his car and goes after Brown, who turns around from 30 to 40 feet away. Wilson said Brown reached into his waistband with one hand and made a fist with the other. ""He starts charging me,"" Wilson said in the interview. ""My initial thought was, is there a weapon in there."" Wilson said Brown never had his hands up as if to surrender. Brown charged at Wilson, the officer said. ""I decide to shoot,"" he said ""I fired a series of shots and paused. I noticed at least one of them hit him. I don't know where. I saw his body kind of flinch a little."" Wilson said he paused again and commanded Brown to stop. Brown kept coming. Wilson said he fired again and Brown flinched as if hit. With Brown just 15 feet away, Wilson said, he backpedaled. Brown got closer and positioned himself to tackle the officer, according to Wilson, who then shot the teenager in the top of the head. Wilson told ABC that he was sorry for the loss of life but that he was simply doing his job and following his training. Wilson said he recently married. ""We just want to have a normal life,"" he told ABC. ""That's it."" The death of Brown sparked violent demonstrations in the days after the shooting and again on Monday night, when it was announced that a Missouri grand jury would not charge Wilson. There were more protests Tuesday, in Ferguson and around the nation. In the hourlong interview, Wilson said he could not have done anything differently. Asked if the incident would have turned out differently if Michael Brown had been white, Wilson said no. What's next for Wilson? Wilson, 28, spent six years with the Ferguson police department before being placed on administrative leave following the shooting. Wilson worked for two years at another police department before that. He remains on leave, pending the outcome of an internal investigation, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told reporters Tuesday. ""No decision has been made,"" Knowles said. ""His current employment status has not changed."" Last week, people close to the talks told CNN that the officer was in the final stages of negotiations with city officials to resign from the police department. Wilson has told associates he would resign as a way to help ease pressure and protect his fellow officers. The United States Justice Department is also investigating whether Wilson violated Brown's civil rights. In newly released transcripts of testimony that the grand jury heard while considering whether to bring charges in Brown's death, Wilson told the jurors that he had never fired his gun on duty before that day. Wilson told the grand jury his original goal was to arrest Brown, after identifying him as a possible suspect in a shop theft. Wilson fired 12 shots, according to the grand jury proceedings. The officer told the St. Louis County grand jury that two shots were fired during a struggle at his police vehicle and that he then fired three bursts of gunfire as he chased and later backed away from Brown. He testified that his Sig Sauer .40-caliber gun held a maximum of 13 bullets.

"(CNN) -- A Louisiana justice of the peace who drew criticism for refusing to marry an interracial couple has resigned, the secretary of state's office said Tuesday. Keith Bardwell resigned in person at the Louisiana secretary of state's office, said spokesman Jacques Berry. The state Supreme Court will appoint an interim justice of the peace to fill Bardwell's position, Berry said, and a special election will be held next year to fill the position permanently. Bardwell, a justice of the peace for Tangipahoa Parish's 8th Ward, refused to perform a marriage ceremony for Beth Humphrey, 30, and her boyfriend Terence McKay, 32, both of Hammond, Louisiana, and sign their marriage license. The two were married by another justice of the peace. The couple filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against Bardwell and his wife, Beth Bardwell, on October 20, claiming the two violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Bardwell, speaking to CNN affiliate WBRZ, said he was advised ""that I needed to step down because they was going to take me to court, and I was going to lose."" ""I would probably do the same thing again,"" he said. ""I found out I can't be a justice of the peace and have a conscience."" Sen. Mary L. Landrieu, D-Louisiana, who had called for Bardwell's dismissal, said Tuesday night that ""Bardwell has finally consented to the will of the vast majority of Louisiana citizens and nearly every governmental official in Louisiana. Bardwell's refusal to issue marriage licenses to interracial couples was out of step with our Louisiana values and reflected terribly on our state. We are better off without him in public service."" Initial reports were that Bardwell refused to issue a marriage license to the couple, but in the lawsuit Humphrey and McKay say they obtained the license from the parish court clerk's office and contacted Bardwell to see if he would perform the ceremony and sign the license to legally validate the marriage. Humphrey wound up speaking by telephone with Beth Bardwell, the lawsuit said, and Beth Bardwell asked Humphrey if they were a ""mixed couple."" When told they were an interracial couple, Beth Bardwell said, according to the lawsuit, ""We don't do interracial weddings,"" and told her the two would have to go outside the parish to marry. Bardwell did not return repeated phone calls from CNN in October, but told CNN affiliate WAFB that he had no regrets about the decision. ""It's kind of hard to apologize for something that you really and truly feel down in your heart you haven't done wrong,"" he said. In addition, he told the Hammond Daily Star in an October story that he did not marry the couple because he was concerned for the children that might be born of the relationship and that, in his experience, most interracial marriages don't last. ""I'm not a racist,"" he said. ""I do ceremonies for black couples right here in my house. My main concern is for the children."" Humphrey said in October that she wanted Bardwell to resign. ""He doesn't believe he's being racist, but it is racist,"" she said. According to the lawsuit, Bardwell estimated he refused to marry at least four other interracial couples in the past 2½ years. ""Defendant Beth Bardwell ... aided, abetted and conspired with defendant Keith Bardwell to deprive plaintiffs of their constitutionally protected civil rights,"" according to the suit. No response to the suit has been filed, and it was unclear whether the Bardwells had retained an attorney. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, claiming that Humphrey and McKay suffered emotional distress as a result of the incident. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has said he believed Bardwell should lose his license, and the National Urban League called for an investigation into the incident by the U.S. Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, saying in a statement that Bardwell's actions were ""a huge step backward in social justice."" According to the Census Bureau, Tangipahoa Parish is about 70 percent white and 30 percent black. The U.S. Supreme Court tossed out any racially-based limitations on marriage in the landmark 1967 ruling in the case Loving v. Virginia. In the unanimous decision, the court said that under the Constitution, ""the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.""

"Americans in two dozen states from the Midwest to the Southeast and Northeast are shivering this week courtesy of a distorted polar vortex. The rush of cold air it's  sending southward is the biggest visitor from the North Pole since Santa Claus. The gifts it brings, however, are chilling and generally unwelcome. Much of the United States has plunged into a deep freeze from record low temperatures. CNN International senior meteorologist Brandon Miller answers a few pressing questions about this phenomenon. What is a polar vortex? What distinguishes it? The polar vortex, as it sounds, is circulation of strong, upper-level winds that normally surround the northern pole in a counterclockwise direction -- a polar low-pressure system.  These winds tend to keep the bitter cold air locked in the Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is not a single storm. On occasion, this vortex can become distorted and dip much farther south than you would normally find it, allowing cold air to spill southward. How frequently does this polar vortex distortion occur? The upper-level winds that make up the polar vortex change in intensity from time to time. When those winds decrease significantly, it can allow the vortex to become distorted, and the result is a jet stream that plunges deep into southern latitudes, bringing the cold, dense Arctic air spilling down with it. This oscillation is known as the Arctic Oscillation and it can switch from a positive phase to negative phase a few times per year. This oscillation -- namely the negative phase where the polar winds are weaker -- tends to lead to major cold air outbreaks in one or more regions of the planet. Where on Earth can this happen? The polar vortex can lead to major cold air outbreaks in any portion of the Northern Hemisphere -- North America, Europe and Asia. This will lead to cold snaps in multiple locations, though not always. How dangerous is a polar vortex distortion as compared to a tornado or hurricane? Completely different type of systems. A cold air outbreak caused by the polar vortex is much more widespread and lasts longer than a single storm. With the widespread drop in temperature, however, you can see significant winter storms develop, especially when the cold air is initially advancing into a previously warm region -- much like the nor'easter this past week. When was the last big one to hit a densely populated area? Serious cold snaps happen several times a year, though in different regions of the world and with different severities. Last March saw a significant decrease in temperature as a result of the polar vortex pushing into much of Europe. Many locations experienced an Easter holiday that was much colder than their Christmas holiday. The United Kingdom, for instance, had its coldest March in 50 years. If you get caught up in one, what should you do? Again, it's not a ""storm"" that you get caught in. But when faced with significant cold temperatures, you should stay inside whenever possible, layer clothing if you must be outside, winterize your home and car, etc. Is it a side effect of global warming and should we expect more events like this? This is a hotly researched topic. In short, yes, it could be. It seems counterintuitive that global warming could cause significant cold snaps like this one, but some research shows that it could. We know that different types of extreme weather can result from the overall warming of the planet, melting of the Arctic Sea ice, etc.  This includes extreme distortions of the jet stream, which can cause heat waves in summer and cold snaps in winter. Parts of Western Europe have been battered by the worst storms for two decades during the past week -- are they related to the weather system in the United States? They are related in a sense, but I wouldn't say ""caused by."" The storms in Europe are the result of a persistent pattern that has seen the jet stream parked near the United Kingdom and Ireland, which has brought a train of storm systems over the British Isles. This is the same jet stream, of course, that has plunged deep into the southern portions of the United States.  So, the jet stream has been ""stuck"" in a position that is allowing cold Arctic air to spill into much of the United States and Canada. But it is in a position that is bringing warmer, moist air from the Atlantic over Northwest Europe, resulting in the stormy conditions.","Polar vortex is circulation of strong, upper-level winds that normally surround the North Pole .

"The nation's largest veteran organization, The American Legion, and one other veterans group, Concerned Veterans for America, on Monday called for the resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric K. Shinseki. The calls for his resignation came after months of CNN exclusive reporting on U.S. veterans who have died while waiting for care at VA hospitals across the country, including in Phoenix. ""It's not something we do lightly. But we do so today because it is our responsibility as advocate for the men and women who have worn this nation's uniform,"" said Daniel M. Dellinger, national commander of the American Legion, speaking in Indianapolis. Responding to the legion's call for the secretary's resignation, the VA issued a statement late Monday: . ""Secretary Shinseki has dedicated his life to his fellow veterans, and nobody is more committed to completing the work that lies ahead,"" said a VA statement by Drew Brookie, VA spokesman. ""As the secretary says, providing veterans the quality care and benefits they have earned through their service is our only mission at VA."" The White House also responded with a statement: ""The President remains confident in Secretary Shinseki's ability to lead the department."" CNN's ongoing look at health care for veterans . CNN has been reporting on delays in care and patient deaths at VA hospitals for the past six months, including at hospitals in South Carolina, Georgia and Texas. After CNN's coverage, the VA acknowledged this April that 23 veterans had died as a result of delayed care in recent years. But sources tell CNN that number could be much higher. In an exclusive report two weeks ago, CNN interviewed a retired VA doctor from Phoenix who charged that more than 40 American veterans have died waiting for care at the VA hospital there. A fatal wait: Veterans languish and die on a secret list . Many of the veterans, the doctor and other VA sources told CNN, were placed on a secret list created by VA managers to hide the wait times of veterans seeking medical care. VA officials in Phoenix denied there was any secret list or that they had given any orders to cover up or hide wait times. They acknowledged that veterans had died waiting for care but said they did not know whether those deaths were tied to waiting for care. But following those reports on Friday, Shinseki placed the Phoenix VA Director Sharon Helman and two members of her staff on administrative leave. On Monday, Dillinger of the American Legion said that growing concerns about the problems at numerous VA facilities are what led him to call for the resignation of Shinseki and two other top VA officials: Under Secretary of Health Robert Petzel and Under Secretary of Benefits Allison Hickey. ""These disturbing reports are part of what appear to be a pattern of scandals that has infected the entire system,"" Dillinger said Monday. Another VA facility under the spotlight . Also Monday, the Fort Collins, Colorado, VA facility came under scrutiny as concerns were raised that officials there might have allegedly instructed workers to change records in an effort to make veterans' wait times appear less severe. ""The House Committee on Veterans' Affairs has learned of appointment scheduling manipulation occurring at the Fort Collins, Colorado, Community Based Outpatient Clinic that is remarkably similar to issues recently referred to you regarding the Phoenix VA Medical Center,"" stated a letter to the VA's Office of Inspector General and signed by Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colorado. The director of health care at the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Congress' watchdog organization, told CNN on Monday that even the VA does not truly know how many American veterans are waiting for care across the country. Director Debra Draper said that's because they do not keep careful track of how many ""consults"" or doctor-requested appointments are open at any given time. Draper said some of the VA numbers and details of wait times are ""unreliable."" The VA reported that in just the last year, it basically cleared 1.5 million backlogged orders of patient care or services, which they call consults, but Draper said there is no way of knowing why they were closed. Draper said it is ""a little disconcerting that 1.5 million records were closed. ... We can't determine that they did a review, a clinical review and appropriately closed out the consult."" She added that to find out how many consults have been truly closed, ""you'd have to really go back to each individual patient record and see how the consult, why it was closed."" Rebuffed on repeated interview requests . Throughout the network's reporting, CNN has submitted numerous requests for an interview with Shinseki. Yet in the six months that CNN has been reporting on these delays, Shinseki has not publicly spoken about the issue. CNN is not alone in getting virtually no response from VA officials. U.S. Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, issued this statement late Monday: . ""For nearly a year, we have been pleading with top department leaders and President Obama to take immediate steps to stop the growing pattern of preventable veteran deaths and hold accountable any and all VA employees who have allowed patients to slip through the cracks. ""In response, we've received disturbing silence from the White House and one excuse after another from VA."" Brookie's statement, released by the VA late Monday, read: . ""The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) takes any allegations about patient care or employee misconduct very seriously.  If the VA Office of Inspector General's investigation substantiates allegations of employee misconduct, swift and appropriate action will be taken. Veterans deserve to have full faith in their VA care. ""Under the leadership of Secretary Shinseki and his team, VA has made strong progress in recent years to better serve veterans both now and in the future.  The secretary knows there is more work to do. ""VA's progress includes enrolling 2 million more veterans in high-quality VA health care, reducing veterans' homelessness by 24 percent, providing post-9/11 GI Bill educational benefits to more than 1 million students, and decreasing the disability claims backlog by nearly 50 percent."" But veterans groups were not convinced. Late Monday, another veterans group joined the American Legion in the call for Shinseki to resign. Pete Hegseth, CEO of the Concerned Veterans of America, issued the following statement: . ""We're proud to stand with The American Legion as they take this courageous and historic stand. As America's largest veterans organization, their moral authority on this issue is unimpeachable. We applaud their demands for accountability at the very top of the Department of Veterans Affairs.""

"On paper, Nur Suryani Mohamed Taibi is entirely average for athletes competing in the women's 10-meter air rifle event at the 2012 London Olympics. There's just one difference: when she steps up to the line to shoot, she will be eight months pregnant. ""When I found out that I was pregnant before competing in the Asian meet, I thought that that was the end of my Olympic dream as I will have to turn my attention to the baby,"" she told Malaysian's leading newspaper, The Star. ""But when I eventually qualified for the 10-meter air rifle event on merit, it made me rethink that perhaps I am supposed to go all the way despite my pregnancy."" Nur Suryani is not only the sole pregnant woman in this year's games, she is also the first female Malaysian rifle shooter to compete in Olympic history, according to The Star. While shooting requires less physical strain on the body than sprinting or some of the other summer sports, Nur Suryani said she has had to alter her stance and train at all times of day to predict how she would feel during competition. ""The Olympic Games are important to me ... Every athlete dreams of competing at the Olympics,"" she told the Star. ""Yes, there will be pressure on me to perform, but I will just focus on my preparation and nothing else."" But Nur Suryani is not alone in navigating the Olympics games while expecting. The first pregnant athlete to compete was Magda Julin of Sweden, who was four months pregnant when she won the gold medal in figure skating during the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium, according to her Sports-Reference biography. Figure skating did not become a winter event until 1924. Diana Sartor of Germany took fourth in the skeleton race in the 2006 Winter Olympics while in her first trimester and most recently, Kristie Moore served as an alternate to the Canadian curling team in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Moore was called up during a match against Sweden, who took gold ahead of Canada's silver. Nur Suryani is ranked 47th in the world and took gold at the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi in 2010 after placing third in the 2010 Asian Games held in Guangzhou, China. The 10-meter air rifle event is set for July 28.","Malaysian shooter Nur Suryani Mohamed Taibi will compete while eight months pregnant .

"For anyone who has experienced the brutality of a bully, a blunt-talking mayor in California with a horseshoe mustache now weighs in with this bit of wisdom: ""Grow a pair."" Looking and talking like an Old West figure, Mayor Cameron Hamilton made his declaration while on the dais of the Porterville City Council last week. ""I'm against bullying, but I'm getting damn tired of it being used as a mantra for everything and the ills of the world,"" Hamilton said during the City Council meeting. ""(Most) people just have to grow a pair and stick up for them damn selves."" Hamilton imparted his advice while discussing a proposal to create an anti-bullying safe zone for students. His remark immediately ricocheted around the council chambers -- and, in subsequent days, around the country. Councilwoman Virginia Gurrola immediately challenged the mayor. ""It's hard to just grow a pair when you're a 10-year-old girl,"" Gurrola shot back. The councilwoman's retort was just the beginning of how the mayor's tough-talking comments have roiled many people nationwide, especially advocates of bullying prevention. What's bullying . Indeed, in the past few years, a robust debate has been unfolding about what is -- and isn't -- bullying. Sponsors of National Bullying Prevention Month say it's wrong to view bullying as ""a childhood rite of passage"" and something to make ""kids tougher."" In fact, bullying can be a traumatic experience, causing school avoidance, anxiety, depression and loss of self-esteem. Some researchers, however, say ""bullying"" has been misused and misstated in recent years -- recklessly assigned to describe mere slights, teasing or inevitable growing pains in childhood relationships. The bald, cigar-smoking Hamilton seemed a little wounded this week by the resulting controversy, but he wasn't backing down. He has also received some hate e-mail. ""Of course, I wish I would have put it a little different, a little less colorful, but let's not lose track of what the message is,"" Hamilton said in a CNN interview. Watch Hamilton speak about the controversy . ""We're starting to define any action that is a little bit controversial as bullying,"" he continued. ""We're not addressing the fact that the students are running to or running from (something) or never allowed through the zero-tolerance policies of the schools to actually stand up for themselves. ""The one I worry about the most is physical intimidation, and that's certainly not advocating that we meet violence with violence,"" he said. ""But if somebody puts their hands on you, it's up to you and your friends to put a stop to this."" People should ""just tell the bully we're not going to put up with this,"" he said. Raising two grandchildren . Hamilton has been raising two grandchildren for 10 years because he lost his daughter in a wreck. ""I guarantee I'm not raising them to be whiny,"" Hamilton said. But he's frustrated with school policies that don't allow bullied pupils to stand up for themselves, he said. His grandson came home from school a month ago after he and another boy had a tussle. In fact, the principal called Hamilton about the incident. ""I asked my grandson afterwards, what'd you do about it?"" Hamilton said. ""I didn't do anything,"" the grandson told him, according to Hamilton. ""Why?"" Hamilton said. ""Because I'll get in trouble,"" the grandson told him. Hamilton expressed exasperation -- and blamed zero-tolerance zones in school as a big part of the problem. Those zones empower bullies, Hamilton said. ""How do you have a safe zone when the schools are telling the kids to stand down and not really holding the bully accountable?"" Hamilton said. ""They don't expel them or don't suspend them. They have them come back to class, and you're brought back in the same environment."" When Hamilton was in 7th grade, he was bullied by ""a guy that kept pullin' a knife on me,"" he said. ""I made up excuses not to go to school. ... I didn't tell my mom and dad what was going on, didn't tell my friends cause I didn't want them to think I was afraid of this guy,"" Hamilton said. ""Finally it came to a head. I dropped him like a rag doll. Everything was cool again,"" he said. Hate mail . Hamilton acknowledged he's receiving a lot of e-mail excoriating him. ""I could show you e-mails right now that would blow your mind,"" he said. One e-mail was profane and condemning, but Hamilton read it aloud in a CNN interview. ""Hey there mayor... Just reading this makes me want to throw up in my mouth,"" the e-mail read, according to Hamilton. ""You have no idea what it's like to be bullied. You have no idea what it takes for a 10-year-old to stand up to someone who is picking on them. And you have no idea how much bad press you bring on Porterville. That town is a backwards bastion for bigotry, and you made it worse by becoming mayor."" Among experts taking exception with Hamilton is Simone Bienne, a British human behaviorist and therapist who appears on U.S. television programs. ""I would like to say that the mayor is actually coming off as a bully,"" Bienne said. ""You can very easily say 'I'm against bullying,' but then blame the people, the victims who were being bullied and say grow a pair. ""What does that actually mean? Be braver and you won't get bullied? I don't think that's how bullying works,"" Bienne said. ""If we put responsibility on children to do an adult's job, or to do a politician's job or to do a teacher's job, then what we are basically doing is asking children -- children! -- to be adults.""","Mayor is raising his two grandchildren not to be 'whiny'

"As a school nurse in Rochester, Michigan, Ronda Harrison has more than 15,000 students in 23 buildings under her care. She works out of the district's administrative offices and spends her days giving PowerPoint presentations to educators and communicating with parents over the phone. ""[It is] scary the fact that I'm responsible for so many schools,"" Harrison said. ""I miss being 'Nurse Ronda.' "" The 16-year veteran has seen a lot of changes during her career as a nationally certified school nurse, but most notable is the shrinking ranks of her colleagues. Michigan has the highest student-to-school nurse ratio in the country at 4,411 to 1, according to the National Association of School Nurses. Utah isn't far behind, with a ratio of 3,637 to 1. This means nurses are handling bigger caseloads, Harrison said, while students' medical needs are becoming more complex. And educators are now the ones doling out daily medication. It's not all bad news, said Linda Davis-Alldritt, president of the National Association of School Nurses. Overall, there has been an increase in funded school nurse positions in the U.S. in the last decade.  But the numbers vary significantly by state, and some districts have no school nurses at all. The bottom line, Davis-Alldritt said, is that the school nurse's job tends to be at risk during budget cut time. ""The big question for parents to ask when they drop their child off at school is, 'Who's going to be taking care of my kid's health care needs?' "" Davis-Alldritt said. "" 'What if my child gets sick? Who's going to take care of them? What are their qualifications?' That's an important question for parents to ask, and the school needs to have the answers."" It was certainly a question Wendy Rose asked when she and her husband moved their three children to Peoria, Arizona. Their 8-year-old daughter, Adalyne, has type 1 diabetes and celiac disease. The first requires constant monitoring of Adalyne's blood glucose levels; the second a gluten-free diet. ""Our school nurse has been invaluable,"" Rose said. ""Insulin is a really tricky hormone -- a little in either direction can have drastic results. In reality, it could kill her. I would be very, very nervous sending her to a school environment for a large chunk of her day [with] no one there to monitor her."" Ever year before school starts, Rose meets with Adalyne's nurse, a member of the administration and all the educators she will be encountering -- from the art teacher to the librarian. A registered nurse herself, Rose had no qualms about putting up fliers around the school with her daughter's photo that said, ""My name is Adalyne. I have diabetes"" to alert staff if they noticed her wandering around looking confused because of low blood sugar. Adalyne is not alone. One in every 400 children has type 1 diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and children are more frequently developing type 2 diabetes, normally an adult disease linked to obesity. In addition, the prevalence of reported food allergies in children increased 18% between 1997 and 2007. That's not to mention children with asthma or mental health issues. Often, the people administering medication in schools are secretaries, principals or teachers. They're given instructions by parents or the district's supervising nurse but have little understanding of what the results should be, Davis-Alldritt said. ""Yes, they can give the medication -- that's not really hard,"" she said. ""But it is really difficult to teach someone how to assess how that medication is working, or how it's not working."" Anecdotally, Davis-Alldritt has heard about mistakes made by untrained staff: the child who got  ADHD medication twice from a busy principal; the secretary who didn't know how to properly work an insulin pen and ended up giving none; the child in Washington who died because no one knew to reach for her allergy autoinjector. She recommends that parents advocate for more school nurses in their district and check in with the staff that handles any health needs. ""Parents have a strong, powerful voice, and they want to make sure their child goes to school and comes home and in the interim is protected and safe.""","Michigan has the highest student-to-school nurse ratio in the country, at 4,411 to 1 .

"While the issue of President Barack Obama's birth has long been settled, and it's a moot point anyway since he's in his second term in office, there remain some people who won't be convinced. Just ask members of Congress, who even this summer are encountering so-called ""birthers"" at town hall meetings. With Ted Cruz, there is no conspiracy. He wasn't born in the United States. But that hasn't stopped the junior Texas senator from courting a possible presidential bid. The dynamic young senator has traveled to Iowa and other early primary states. If his moves toward a candidacy become more serious, they're sure to spark first a debate about his conservative politics, but also that recurring debate about whether a ""natural-born citizen"" can be born outside the United States. Birther-in-chief Donald Trump, who appeared to be running singularly on that issue in 2011, was more restrained when he was asked if Canadian-born Cruz was eligible to be president. ""Perhaps not,"" Trump told ABC News on Sunday. ""I don't know the circumstances. I heard somebody told me he was born in Canada.  That's really his thing,"" said Trump, who could face Cruz in a GOP primary if both men follow through with runs they appear to be teasing. Another Cruz trip to Iowa raises 2016 speculation . Cruz seems to think the facts are on his side. ""My mother was born in Wilmington, Delaware. She's a U.S. citizen, so I'm a U.S. citizen,"" Cruz told ABC in July. ""I'm not going to engage in a legal debate. The facts are clear,"" he added. ""I can tell you where I was born and who my parents were. And then as a legal matter, others can worry about that. I'm not going to engage."" TIME: Cruz talks about Obama, spats with fellow Republicans . There is precedent for people born outside the United States making credible runs for the presidency. George Romney, Mitt Romney's father, was born in Mexico to Mormon missionaries. He ran for president in 1968. For all the ink spilled about Obama's provenance -- Hawaii, people -- it was actually John McCain in the 2008 presidential contest who was born outside the United States. McCain's father, an admiral, was stationed in the Panama Canal Zone. Democrats didn't make an issue of McCain's birthright to run, however. In fact, Democratic candidates Obama and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton sponsored a non-binding resolution in the spring of 2008 declaring that McCain was a natural-born citizen. This is all the U.S. Constitution has to say about the qualifications to be president: . ""No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States."" That's pretty clear. Only a 35-year-old (or older) ""natural-born citizen"" can be president.  But it turns out not be that clear. Who is a ""natural-born citizen?"" Citizen scholarship falls on the side of McCain. He had two American citizen parents and one was working for the U.S. government when he was born in Panama. Cruz doesn't check all those boxes. His father, a preacher who has delivered stem-winding speeches of his own, has since become an American. But at the time of Ted's birth in Canada, he was a Cuban émigré working for an oil company. His mother, however, hails from Delaware. Ted Cruz's father makes fiery anti-Obama speech . There is a 50-page report prepared for lawmakers by the Congressional Research Service. You can read the whole thing here. The key paragraph in that lawerly paper reads this way: . ""The weight of legal and historical authority indicates that the term ""natural born"" citizen would mean a person who is entitled to U.S. citizenship ""by birth"" or ""at birth,"" either by being born ""in"" the United States and under its jurisdiction, even those born to alien parents; by being born abroad to U.S. citizen-parents; or by being born in other situations meeting legal requirements for U.S. citizenship ""at birth."" It does not specifically deal with the issue of someone born outside the United States to one American parent. But if Cruz could claim citizenship at birth, according to the argument, he could claim to be natural born. The natural-born citizen requirement was put into the Constitution, according to the congressional report, to ward against aristocracy coming to America and setting up a new kingdom. There has been discussion of doing away with the requirement altogether. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah introduced the Equal Right to Govern Amendment in July 2003. It would allow immigrants who had been naturalized for at least 20 years to run for president. But it has gone exactly nowhere.

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- If an elementary school teacher graded you on your involvement in your child's education, what kind of a grade would you get? Should your kid's first-grade teacher be grading you in the first place? If Florida state Rep. Kelli Stargel's bill becomes law, public school teachers will be required to grade the parents of students in kindergarten through the third grade. The parents' grades of ""satisfactory,"" ""unsatisfactory"" or ""needs improvement"" would be added to their children's report card. Stargel, a Republican who sits on several education legislative committees, says that parental involvement is key to educating children for years to come. As the mother of five, Stargel says, she understands the importance of her role in educating her children. ""I think a lot of parents understand that is something that is critical,"" she said. ""On the other hand, you have some parents that don't realize they are not providing the needs."" Florida lawmakers have spent years overhauling the public school system to make schools and their teachers accountable for student achievements. Many parents and teachers have not welcomed the changes. In the late 1990s, the state began the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, or FCAT, in which a school would be graded based on the overall score of its students. From the beginning, proponents of the FCAT wanted schools held accountable for their students' grades through standardized testing. Critics contend that teachers are forced to spend too much time preparing students for the test instead of actually teaching. Teachers, do you want to grade parents? Share your thoughts in the CNN Teachers' Lounge. Last year, Gov. Charlie Crist vetoed a bill that tied a teacher's pay to his or her students' achievement. Another version of the bill is expected to pass this year under new Gov. Rick Scott. ""We have student accountability, we have teacher accountability, and we have administration accountability,"" Stargel said. ""This was the missing link, which was, look at the parent and making sure the parents are held accountable."" Veita Stephens, an academic intervention facilitator for Polk County Public Schools, called the proposal a ""unique notion."" ""The thought has never entered my mind to grade a parent,"" she said. Teachers agree that parental involvement is crucial to a child's education. But some teachers say that grading the parents is not the answer. Sharon Francis, who teaches first grade in the small central Florida city of Winter Haven, is not sure that grading parents will work. ""I think those parents that are not going to show up or not do anything,"" said Francis, who teaches students from primarily poor homes, ""it's not going to faze them, whether you put 'unsatisfactory.' "" The grading system is based on three criteria that Stargel wrote in the legislation: . • A child should be at school on time, prepared to learn after a good night's sleep, and have eaten a meal. •  A child should have the homework done and prepared for examinations. •  There should be regular communication between the parent and teacher. ""Those three things are key to a quality education,"" Stargel said. Steve Perry, a CNN education contributor and founder of Capital Preparatory Magnet School in Hartford, Connecticut, says he couldn't disagree more. Perry insists that a good education is based on what a child learns in the classroom and not what a parent might know that could help their child. ""There is nothing in any teacher's training that would put them in a position to be able to effectively judge the parenting of one their student's parents,"" Perry argued. ""If getting a bad grade was the impetus for people doing things right, then I would have an entire school of kids getting A's."" Kindergarten teacher Theresa Hill of Snively Elementary School in Winter Haven disagrees. ""This is the real world. You don't always get a superior rating if you're not doing a superior job. That's life,"" she said. ""We grade our children based on their performance. Why should the parents be any different?"" Some parents said they laughed out loud after hearing about the proposed legislation. On the sidelines of his son's soccer practice in Winter Park, J.C. Adams said he thought it was an interesting proposal. ""It could have some validity. We could try it and see how that might work out for everyone,"" he said. Kim Granger, who has two daughters -- one in high school and the other a mother of three young children -- welcomed the idea of being graded on her parental skills. ""I wouldn't mind that at all. I would get a good grade,"" she said. ""If you're more involved with your children when they're littler, when they grow older, they're more stable, more willing to sit down and do the work."" Stargel acknowledges that not everyone agrees with her legislation, which she said is still under revision. The bill was not intended to tell parents how to raise their kids, she says. ""We want to make sure parents are involved in the education of their children,"" Stargel said. Francis Monteiro agrees that parents like him appreciate feedback from their children's teachers, but he says requiring teachers to grade parents is not the answer. ""Bottom line: Everyone wants the best for their kids,"" he said.","State lawmaker Kelli Stargel has proposed a bill calling for parents to be graded .
Parents of kids in kindergarten through third grade would be graded by teachers .
The criteria would include making sure their kids are on time and do their homework .
The bill is getting mixed reviews from parents and teachers ."
"The race to develop an effective treatment or vaccine against Ebola is on as the largest outbreak in history continues to spread in West Africa. Meanwhile, questions about whether unproven treatments are appropriate to use, and who should get them, are inspiring passion and resentment. On Wednesday, an Iowa-based company called NewLink said it has enough doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine to begin clinical trials in the next few weeks, if such trials are approved. Meanwhile, a shipment of 800 to 1,000 doses of the vaccine, known as VSV-EBOV,  were delivered to health officials in Liberia, as a donation from the Public Health Agency of Canada. The Canadian agency developed the vaccine but says its stockpile is gone. Earlier in the week, we learned that Mapp Biopharmaceuticals also sent its entire stock of the experimental drug ZMapp to the government of Liberia. Left undetermined is which individuals will receive any of the drugs. As we track these and other developments, here are 10 facts to keep in mind about Ebola and experimental drugs: . 1. There is no approved or scientifically proven treatment for Ebola, and no vaccine. Whether the setting is primitive or in a developed country's advanced hospital, existing treatment is primarily supportive: giving fluids, carefully monitoring vital signs and responding to acute medical crises. 2. There are several experimental drugs in development, with the potential to be useful against Ebola. The market for these drugs is small -- Ebola is a rare disease, almost completely confined to poor countries -- so funding for drug development has come largely from government agencies in the United States and Canada. 3.  ""Vaccine"" and ""treatment"" are not interchangeable terms. A vaccine is given to prevent infection, whereas treatment generally refers to a drug given to a patient who has developed symptoms. ZMapp, given to American medical workers Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly when they were seriously ill, is not a vaccine. 4. Another term you may hear is ""post-exposure prophylaxis,"" meaning a drug that is given to a person who has been exposed to an infection, but is not yet sick. A familiar example is the rabies vaccine, often given to someone after they have been bitten by a rabid animal. Some promising Ebola drugs, like Tekmira's TKM-Ebola, have been developed and tested as ""post-exposure prophylaxis."" Be warned: The terms can become confusing because research is ongoing and there's no clear evidence to define the window of time for treatment to be effective -- or if this type of drug might still be helpful once symptoms develop. This uncertainty influences the decisions that doctors and health officials have to make in determining if and when to use experimental drugs, especially those in short supply. 5. No Ebola treatment has been formally tested in humans with the illness. ZMapp has been given to at least three people in the current outbreak (the two Americans and a Spanish priest); experts say they are studying the cases, but there is not enough evidence to say whether the drug will be effective in others. 6. At least one Ebola therapy (TKM-Ebola) has been tested for safety in a small clinical trial; it was given to healthy human volunteers to see if they suffered any adverse effects. To date there have not been serious side effects. 7. One experimental post-exposure prophylaxis drug was given to a German researcher in 2009 after he pricked himself with a needle thought to carry Ebola. He did not develop the disease. 8. A handful of potential treatments have been tested in primates that have been infected with Ebola. Macaque monkeys are the usual test subjects. 9. The U.S. National Institutes of Health says a safety trial of an experimental vaccine could begin as early as September. Other companies are also preparing for new clinical trials. 10. At least one group of researchers -- at the University of Texas Medical Branch -- is working with a $26 million award from NIH to test the possibility of combining multiple therapies, similar to the HIV-fighting ""cocktail"" approach.","There is no approved or scientifically proven treatment for Ebola, and no vaccine .

"Young children are far more likely to experience attention and hyperactivity problems if their mother develops diabetes during pregnancy and they are born into a poor or lower-middle-class household, a new study suggests. The study, published this week in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, found that children whose mothers received a diabetes diagnosis during pregnancy (known as gestational diabetes) were twice as likely as their peers to meet the criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at age six. Living in a family with below-average socioeconomic status likewise doubled the risk of ADHD in six-year-olds. But children with both risk factors -- those who were exposed to gestational diabetes and grew up in a less-than-affluent household -- had a 14-fold increased risk of ADHD compared to children with neither risk factor. Health.com: What causes ADHD? 12 myths and facts . The findings don't prove that gestational diabetes directly causes ADHD, but the researchers say they send a message to mothers and doctors that gestational diabetes may pose hidden dangers to a child well after birth, especially if the child grows up in a challenging environment. ""Mothers should be aware that gestational diabetes can affect her fetus,"" says Yoko Nomura, Ph.D., the lead author of the study and an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York City. Gestational diabetes, which affects roughly 5% of expectant mothers in the United States, generally develops during the second or third trimester of pregnancy -- the same window of time in which a fetus undergoes a critical burst of brain development. Health.com: Tips for a healthy pregnancy with diabetes . Women with gestational diabetes have abnormally high blood sugar (glucose). If the fetus is bombarded with excess blood sugar, energy normally used for nervous-system development could potentially be diverted to absorb that excess, Nomura says. As a result, the central nervous system may not develop properly. Growing up in poverty would likely aggravate any underlying nervous-system deficits, Nomura says. ""When babies are born into higher socioeconomic status households, they have better access to medical care [and] remedial activities, intellectual stimulus is higher, they have better foods,"" she says. In addition, low-income women may not control their gestational diabetes as well as more prosperous mothers-to-be, says Luigi Garibaldi, M.D., clinical director of pediatric endocrinology at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. ""Having diabetes during pregnancy by itself may not be so bad, but if you don't take care of it, there may be consequences on the brain development of the child,"" says Garibaldi, who was not involved in the study. Health.com: Exercise tips for people with type 2 diabetes . Nomura and her colleagues followed 212 ethnically and socioeconomically diverse children living in Queens, New York, 10% of whom were exposed to gestational diabetes. From preschool through age six, a trained psychologist or doctoral student evaluated each child for ADHD symptoms annually. The study had several shortcomings. It was relatively small, and although they did take into account the parents' history of ADHD, the researchers didn't collect data on whether the children had siblings or other relatives with attention or hyperactivity problems. Also, Garibaldi notes, the researchers didn't measure how well the mothers controlled their gestational diabetes. Still, the study is a valuable reminder that a child's environment -- in and out of the womb -- appears to affect the risk of ADHD, says Joel Nigg, Ph.D., a professor of psychiatry at Oregon Health & Science University, in Portland. Health.com: ADHD linked to pesticide exposure . Previous research suggests, for instance, that children are at increased risk of ADHD if they're exposed to lead and certain pesticides. ""As a precaution, we might want to add [gestational diabetes] to the list of risk factors we're aware of,"" says Nigg, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.","Findings don't prove that gestational diabetes directly causes ADHD .

"Punched. Slapped. Cursed at. Deprived of water and food. Shackled to a bed with a ""four-point restraint for almost a month."" U.S. Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi says that's what life was like for him in his first weeks in a Mexican prison. He ended up there after unwittingly crossing the border from California two months ago with several guns in his car -- firearms he says legally owns, but that it's unlawful to bring into Mexico. Tahmooressi told CNN on Friday that things have gotten better for him. He gets by on phone calls to his family, his faith, reading, exercise, sleep and -- perhaps above all -- hope. ""I think that they will see that I'm not guilty of the crime they've (accused) me of doing,"" he said. ""They'll just let me go."" Yet there's no guarantee that will happen. After a judge started and then quickly suspended a hearing Wednesday after Tahmooressi fired his attorneys, a Mexican judicial source said his next court hearing will be June 4. But his mother, Jill Tahmooressi, said the next hearing is still weeks away, as it will take time for the new attorney to be briefed. Until then, at least, Tahmooressi's days are going ""by pretty slow."" But at least he's not being -- as he puts it -- ""abused"" any more, something he credits in part to the attention his case has gotten in the media and among politicians. ""Since I got media coverage, and people I guess realized that I'm not dangerous,"" Tahmooressi said, ""it's been pretty relaxed and not so bad -- after the first month."" Prison authorities denied the abuse allegations and said he is being treated well. 'I got here accidentally; please let me turn around' It was March 31. Tahmooressi had walked across the border into Tijuana to patronize an establishment popular with Marines from Camp Pendleton, his mother ,Jill, said. As Tahmooressi explained, out of a parking lot, ""I just made one wrong turn, and then that one wrong turn that I thought was going to take me north to San Diego was actually an on-ramp that swooped around back to the south and to Mexico."" At one point, he got ""funneled"" across the border. ""There was no way out of that except for if I had turned my truck around and drove into oncoming traffic,"" Tahmooressi said. ""That would have been the only way that I could have done it."" According to Jill Tahmooressi, her son immediately disclosed to the border guards that he had weapons and requested that he be allowed to turn around, she said. ""The first thing he said to the first person that stopped him was, 'I got here accidentally; please let me turn around. I have three guns in my truck,' "" his mother said. A 911 tape released by U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, appears to support his version of events. In it, the Marine is heard saying, ""I crossed the border by accident, and I have three guns in my truck, and they're trying to take my guns from me."" After learning he's in Mexico, the 911 dispatcher responds: ""There's nothing I can help you with then, sir. I do apologize. You're not on American soil anymore."" Tahmooressi asks whether authorities have a right to take his guns. The dispatcher tells him he should have seen large warning signs on the freeway saying it's illegal to enter Mexico with guns. ""There are warning signs that do say that as you're driving down the freeway, before you enter Mexico,"" she says. ""Yeah, I was hoping there would be a turnaround point,"" he says, ""but there never was."" Friend: Marine already suffers from PTSD . What happened, at a state penitentiary called La Mesa, left his mother ""mortified."" In addition to being punched in the stomach and slapped in the face, Andrew Tahmooressi said he was at times ""naked ... overnight in the cold"" and ""shackled in a way that made me want to stand overnight."" He added: ""I was not allowed to drink water for about maybe 12 hours, and I was not given food for a certain amount of time like half a day or so."" While CNN could not independently verify these claims with Mexican authorities, if true, they would be the latest ordeal for a man who a close friend says was having trouble with post-traumatic stress disorder even before he was detained in Mexico. ""His PTSD started from combat. Now, he's got a whole other load of PTSD that he is going to get when he gets out of jail,"" said Sam Vranicar, who served with Tahmooressi in Afghanistan in 2010. Tahmooressi has been able to speak with his friend when he calls Vranicar's house collect from the Mexican jail. The two have talked about 10 times, Vranicar said. Vranicar said he's astonished that a Marine -- or anyone -- could be treated the way his friend describes. ""Being tied to a bed in four-point restraints and joint manipulation restraints -- like ways that a POW would be treated ... it's just ridiculous,"" Vranicar said. ""I don't think it's right for any American to be in a Mexican jail treated like that. They are our neighboring ally, and it's inhumane."" 'A different guy' Vranicar had urged Tahmooressi to move from Florida to San Diego so that he could help him seek treatment for PTSD. ""As soon as he got out here, I realized that the Andrew that I used to know has gone,"" Vranicar said. ""He became a different guy."" Vranicar and his wife noticed his friend was acting distant. ""I took him to La Jolla, he got diagnosed and he started seeing people on a regular basis,"" Vranicar said. Not long afterward, he said, Tahmooressi made the wrong turn at an exit close to the Mexican border. He had all his belongings, including his guns, with him, Vranicar said. ""It wasn't just his guns that he crossed with,"" he said. ""It was everything he had. All his worldly possessions."" His mother said Tahmooressi was searching for permanent housing and often stayed in San Diego hotels. Over 100,000 sign White House petition . Jill Tahmooressi said no one from the State Department in Washington had contacted her, but she heard from Bill Whitaker, chief of American citizens services at the U.S. Consulate General in Tijuana. ""I immediately let Mr. Whitaker know that Andrew was abused at the hands of the guards,"" she said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told CNN on Wednesday that he spoke with Mexican authorities about the veteran's case last week. Tahmooressi and his family have pressed their case in other ways as well. That includes a White House petition his mother started on May 1 that, as of Friday night, had 110,000 signatures -- above the mark needed to garner an official government response. The Marine has tried to appeal to U.S. lawmakers like Hunter, one of several who have petitioned for his release. ""I accidentally drove into Mexico with 3 guns ... a rifle (AR-15), a .45 cal pistol and a 12 gauge pump shotgun with no intensions (sic) on being in Mexico or being involved in any criminal activities,"" Tahmooressi wrote in a statement of innocence to Hunter, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee. ""I have rights to all 3 weapons,"" he wrote. ""They are under my name. ... Please help me."" And many more people not in positions of power have heard his story as well. He's grateful for all of the attention, which he believes has already contributed to his improved condition. ""I just want to say thank you to everyone who has been a part of this and has been helping me and rallying with me and signing my petition,"" Tahmooressi told CNN. ""I can't thank you enough.  I thank God for you guys.""","Marine says he was hit, left naked, shackled, deprived in Mexican prison .

"An FBI agent was arrested in Pakistan this week after he attempted to board a domestic flight between Karachi and Islamabad with ammunition and knives, police said Wednesday. Joel Cox was arrested on Monday with 15 9mm bullets, three small knives and a wrench, according to police superintendent Malir Rao Anwar.  All of those items, along with his laptop computer and cell phone, have been taken to a forensics lab for analysis. Cox was visiting Pakistan as part of an assignment to provide training to local police, according to a U.S. law enforcement official. A State Department official said diplomats are working with Pakistani authorities to gain the release of the agent. Cox appeared in court Tuesday to face anti-terrorism charges, which restrict unauthorized weapons or ammunition on commercial flights, and is scheduled to appear again on Saturday. Employees for the FBI and other U.S. agencies are allowed to carry weapons in Pakistan when authorized. U.S. officials hope this incident is more easily resolved than the 2011 case of a CIA contractor who was arrested and charged with killing two men. Raymond Davis said that he believed they were trying to rob him. The case inflamed local anti-American sentiment and soured relations until the United States agreed to compensate the families of the two men. Davis was then freed. Rao Anwar said he expects the case to go to trail, calling it a matter of ""upholding Pakistan's dignity and honor.  (Cox) acted illegally and his arrest is perfectly legal.""","Agent was stopped for carrying ammunition as he attempted to board flight .

"The U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a Class I recall for 40,000 pounds of ground beef products intended for Georgia school lunches, due to possible E. coli contamination. The beef was produced by Palo Duro Meat in Amarillo, Texas, by September 9, according to a statement released by the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service Friday.  It was shipped to two Georgia warehouses, where it was to be distributed to a variety of institutions, including six school districts associated with the National School Lunch Program. However, USDA authorities say they are not aware of the beef having been served as part of any school lunches, adding that the bulk of the beef products have not left the warehouses. The beef was shipped in 40-pound boxes.  Each case contains the mark ""Est. 7282"" and a production code of 19110. The contaminated products may have gotten mixed in with commercial products due to a sample tracking error, according to the USDA statement.  Neither the company nor the USDA has received any reports of illnesses related to consumption of the beef. E. coli bacteria can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration and, in severe cases, kidney failure, according to the USDA statement.  Babies and toddlers, seniors, and persons with weakened immune systems are the most susceptible to food-borne illnesses, the statement says.","U.S. Department of Agriculture issues recall for 40,000 pounds of beef products .

"A man shot four men with whom he had worked -- two of them fatally -- in northern Florida on Saturday before shooting and killing himself, the Union County sheriff said. Sheriff Jerry Whitehead told CNN affiliate WJXT that  the Lake Butler ""community is in shock,"" after 72-year-old Hubert Allen Jr. allegedly went on a shooting spree, killing his longtime boss, Marvin Pritchett, 80, and a former co-worker Rolando Gonzalez-Delgado, 28. Two other men were shot and wounded. Whitehead said he knew all of the individuals and is Pritchett's nephew. Lake Butler, where most of the shootings took place, is a small community of fewer than 2,000 residents. Whitehead said Pritchett was a ""self-made millionaire"" and ""just a great guy, with a great family."" Pritchett's death will have a ""terrible impact on the community,"" Whitehead said. Whitehead knew Allen for 40 years, and said he'd just talked to him just last week. Police: 4 dead after man opens fire in 2 Dallas-area homes . Allen was the step-grandfather of Buffalo Bills running back C.J. Spiller, the sheriff said. A law enforcement authority with detailed knowledge of the case said the gunman had an argument with Pritchett earlier in the week,  The same source clarified an earlier report, saying the argument happened Monday and that the gunman was retired from the company, though he was still involved in some capacity and still interacted with its owner. Whitehead said he couldn't confirm any details related to a motive, but that his department was investigating. The Union County Sheriff's Office said Allen went to a Lake Butler farm owned by Pritchett, where he fatally shot Gonzalez-Delgado. A short distance away, Allen shot and killed Pritchett, authorities said. From there, police said Allen confronted another former colleague driving a farm tractor. The men exchanged words before Allen fired a shot at 66-year-old Lewis ""Buddy"" Mabrey Jr., striking him in the left arm and side. Mabrey was rushed to the hospital, where he was expected to undergo surgery for a broken arm and other injuries. He was in good condition. Allen traveled to Pritchett Trucking Inc. and shot a third co-worker, 44-year old David Griffis, in the stomach, officials said. Ex-official in Kentucky shoots ex-lover, kills her relatives . Griffis was taken to the hospital for immediate surgery; he was in critical condition. The suspect then fled the scene to his home, where he shot and killed himself, officials said.

A statement posted Saturday evening  on the company's website said Pritchett Trucking was shocked and mourning the loss of its founder and the employees. ""Words cannot express the pain and sorrow felt by so many, yet we are comforted by the memories of those lost."" According to the site, Marvin H. Pritchett founded Pritchett Trucking Inc. in 1980.

"(CNN) -- Elvy Musikka, 71, of Eugene, Oregon, says the post office lost something that could cost her more than just a buzz. She could lose her eyesight. Six metal tins packed with medical marijuana joints --1,800 in all -- are in transit somewhere with her name on it. That's enough for up to 10 potent smokes a day for six months. It's a prescription she receives twice a year to treat her glaucoma. ""I just don't know what to do,"" Musikka said. Musikka says she's one of four remaining patients getting pot for free as part of a federal government program called Compassionate Use Protocol, developed in the 1980s. Her attorney says the cannabis is grown in a government lab at the University of Mississippi. ""It relaxes the eye so whatever excess fluid can get through, "" Mussika said. She usually flies back to Miami, her former home, to pick up the pot from her eye specialist at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute. But this time, the medicine was delayed, and she had to fly home without it. Her attorney, Norman Kent of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, accepted the pot for her and shipped it as next-day delivery through the U.S. Postal Service on March 17. It never arrived at Musikka's Oregon home. ""I spent $120 for (shipping) three cartons, "" Kent said. On Monday, Kent started calling the postal service. He discovered he mislabeled the ZIP code. It was off by one digit and the shipment was sent to the post office in Santa Monica, California, about 850 miles away from Eugene, Oregon. ""I called consumer affairs' lost and found, the complaint and tracking departments, and everyone says that they're looking,"" Kent said. Now, more than a week after the packages were mailed, there has yet to be a whiff of the missing cartons. ""I find it fascinating that the post office can tell me because of their tracking that it was misrouted and can acknowledge that it went to the wrong place, but they can't tell me what happened to it after that,"" Kent told CNN. ""It's astounding."" Kent said the contents are not marked on the outside of the cartons. Inside, he included letters explaining why the rolled joints are stacked within the shiny metal tins. ""As each day goes by and it doesn't show up, I just get more confused. It's just very exasperating,"" Musikka said. Musikka has her own website and sometimes lectures on the medical need for marijuana. After spending hours on the phone with the postal service, Kent sent a letter to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration on Thursday asking for help. In the letter, he wrote that he hopes ""the DEA recognizes it is not in the public interest to have marijuana missing in the U.S. mails,"" and adds the need to ""make a record of this loss in order to procure a new prescription."" Contacted by CNN, a U.S. Postal Service spokesman said the agency is looking for the lost shipment. ""She's not asking for much,"" Kent said. ""Just her marijuana.""","Elvy Musikka, 71, says the post office lost an overnight delivery of her marijuana .

"A resounding boom over Tucson, Arizona, roused residents from their dinner tables Tuesday and had them pointing up to the sky. With the largest meteor shower of the year around the corner, the heavens seemed to be giving them a sneak preview. A whopper of a fireball roared over their heads and exploded, rattling their houses. A dash cam captured it on video as it vanished in a bright blaze. The spectacular annual Geminid meteor shower kicks into high gear Thursday night, NASA said, and people around the world will be able to enjoy it. Some of its meteors have already been dashing through Earth's atmosphere. The agency recorded nine of them Tuesday night. But the Tucson meteor did not appear to be one of them, said NASA meteor expert Bill Cooke, who analyzed the flying space rock after two NASA cameras in Arizona recorded it on video. Traveling at 45,000 mph, it was too slow. ""A Geminid moves at 78,000 mph,"" he said.  And the direction it came from was not typical for a meteor from the big shower. The Arizona fireball was just one of the handful of ""sporadic background"" meteors that whiz through the atmosphere every day. But this was a big one, Cooke confirmed. It weighed about 100 pounds and was about 16 inches thick. It made quite a bright flash, as it burned up in the atmosphere. Even with 100 to 120 meteors per hour coming down during its peak on Friday and Saturday, the Geminid shower now has a tough act to follow. Kaboom! Astronomer Tod Lauer heard the blast but did not bother to look outside. ""We were eating dinner and heard a good bang that rattled the roof of our house. I dismissed it as a sonic boom,"" he posted to Facebook. He realized it had to be more than that, when a local TV station phoned the scientist, who studies images from the Hubble Space Telescope, to ask him to explain what had happened. Frantic eyewitnesses across the state called local news outlets to report what they saw. The explosion shook Tony Kubrak's house, too, he told CNN affiliate KGUN, which received a flood of calls and hundreds of posts to its Facebook page. Kubrak went outside to check it out. ""I see this tremendous, white, bright light in the western sky. And it was just ... it was absolutely enormous, I couldn't believe it."" Others took to social media. ""Did y'all see the meteor that flew above Tucson? Crazzzzy. That was toooo craaaazy!"" Tucson resident Eric Gomez posted on Twitter. Watch Geminid! People around the world can share some of the thrill that bedazzled Arizonans until at least Monday, NASA said. The Geminid meteor shower will be ""rich in fire balls."" ""Of all the debris streams Earth passes through every year, the Geminids are by far the most massive,"" he said. ""When we add up the amount of dust in the Geminid stream, it outweighs other streams by factors of 5 to 500."" NASA calls it the 900-pound gorilla of meteor showers. Most meteor large showers are caused by comets, which are loosely put together with lots of debris in tow that fly into the atmosphere -- but not Geminid. An asteroid large space rock named 3200 Phaethon flings the stardust that makes the sparkling magic. Of all the named asteroids, it is the one that flies closest to the sun, Cooke said -- 2.5 times closer than the planet Mercury. It's a bit of a mystery why 3200 Phaeton is flying with so much debris, Cooke said. He thinks perhaps it was produced by a collision eons ago with another asteroid. Geminid contains the name of the constellation Gemini, which is the direction the meteors will be coming from. They can be viewed well starting at 11 p.m., but Cooke recommends waiting until an hour before dawn, ""if you can stand the cold.""

"Twitter responded Saturday to a backlash in the United Kingdom sparked by recent online threats against women by announcing it had revised its rules on abusive behavior. ""It comes down to this: people deserve to feel safe on Twitter,"" says a statement posted by Twitter's UK boss Tony Wang and Del Harvey, senior director for trust and safety. The social network's announcement comes in the wake of rape threats made via Twitter against feminist Caroline Criado-Perez and Labour Party politician Stella Creasy, and bomb threats made to a number of women journalists. The women's treatment at the hands of Internet ""trolls"" has prompted outcry and fueled a wider debate over whether Twitter does enough to protect its users from ugly abuse. More than 120,000 people put their name to an online petition set up on Change.org calling for Twitter to add a ""report abuse"" button to tweets in the space of a week. ""Abuse on Twitter is common; sadly too common. And it frequently goes ignored,"" the petition states. Twitter said Saturday an ""in-tweet"" report abuse button had been introduced in the latest version of its app on Apple devices, and that from next month the button will also be available in its Android app and on Twitter.com. This means users won't have to go to Twitter's help page to file an abuse report. ""We have updated the Twitter Rules to clarify that we do not tolerate abusive behaviour,"" the statement said. ""We want people to feel safe on Twitter, and we want the Twitter Rules to send a clear message to anyone who thought that such behaviour was, or could ever be, acceptable."" Wang also tweeted an apology to the women who have been targeted by abuse in recent days. ""I personally apologize to the women who have experienced abuse on Twitter and for what they have gone through,"" he said. ""The abuse they've received is simply not acceptable. It's not acceptable in the real world, and it's not acceptable on Twitter."" The company is adding extra staff to the teams that handle abuse reports and will be exploring new technology to boost protection for users, it said. Twitter's new pressure to limit hate speech . Arrests made over threats . A national cybercrime unit is now investigating allegations made by eight people that they have been subject to harassment, malicious communication or bomb threats, according to a police statement Friday. Two men were arrested in the past week in connection with the rape threats made against Criado-Perez and Creasy. Criado-Perez attracted the attention of Internet ""trolls"" by petitioning to have women displayed on British banknotes. The feminist champion and freelance journalist, whose campaign resulted in the Bank of England agreeing to picture ""Pride and Prejudice"" author Jane Austen on every 10-pound bill, tweeted throughout the abuse: ""I actually can't keep up with the screen-capping & reporting -- rape threats thick and fast now."" Creasy, who represents an east London constituency in Parliament, became the target of online rape threats after she spoke out in support of Criado-Perez. Newspaper columnists Hadley Freeman, of The Guardian, and Grace Dent, of The Independent, received a bomb threat via Twitter on Wednesday, as did Time magazine's Europe editor, Catherine Mayer, and Emma Barnett, women's editor for The Telegraph newspaper.","Twitter updates its rules on abusive behavior following a backlash in Britain .

"When R&B singer Seal and Heidi Klum met in a New York City hotel lobby, the supermodel told CNN's Piers Morgan, ""it was kind of like two magnets."" The model-turned-mogul, TV superstar and mother of four is a guest on Friday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" Klum said that she was sitting in the lobby with a mutual friend of hers and Seal's, and that Seal didn't even recognize the internationally famous model. Klum told the story of the couple's engagement, in which the singer had an igloo built on a mountaintop in the Canadian Rockies, to which he whisked her by helicopter. ""And then we get there,"" Klum said. ""We hop off and the helicopter leaves, and there we are in the middle of nowhere. It was beautiful. And then he had his guitar with him. And he sang a song for me and he went down on his knee."" Klum described the igloo as ""a full-on igloo with a bed inside with pillows and blankets and candles and rose petals."" When Morgan asked Klum how the couple manages to sustain such a happy relationship, Klum said ""I just think because we love each other. We have fun with each other. We respect each other. I let him do his thing, even though that's hard for me sometimes."" Klum, 38, admitted that she had to forgo her propensity for controlling things and ""learned how you have to, like, let him do his creative thing, because I am quite bossy in my industry."" When Morgan asked if the couple was planning on having more children, Klum answered, ""No, we have four children, and we're complete now."" With the ninth-season finale of ""Project Runway"" coming up, Klum told Morgan she never imagined the series would last so long. ""No way,"" she said. ""No. You just don't when you get into something like that. You know, when we first created 'Project Runway,' it was Harvey Weinstein, Desiree Gruber, my publicist for the last 15 years and myself, and we just shopped it around. We went to all these different networks and tried to explain to them what we wanted to do was a show about fashion."" Klum said that she had a hard time convincing networks that they had a hit for them. ""Everyone was like, 'Well, why is that interesting? Why would we want to watch how people make clothes?' "" Klum said. When ""Project Runway"" finally found a network to call home, she said, what really led to success was word of mouth. Klum told Morgan that audiences love the show ""because it's really about talent."" When Morgan asked Klum if she grew up dreaming of being a model, the Germany native told the CNN host that as a child, she didn't even know that modeling was a career option. ""I didn't even know that that was a job, to be honest,"" she said. ""I wanted to be a fashion designer."" Klum called her entrée into fashion modeling ""pure luck"" and likened it to ""winning the lottery"" when she told Morgan the story. ""I entered a competition,"" she said. ""I, literally, out of a fashion magazine, cut out a coupon with my girlfriend, sent some random photos in that she took of me, entered this competition. And it went on for six months. It was a model search."" Klum, who also host's ""Germany's Next Top Model"" in her native country, told Morgan that she counts getting ""Project Runway"" on the air among her most cherished business successes. She also called designing her real passion and said she continues to design: There's a Heidi Klum for New Balance line of apparel and sneakers, Wildlife by Heidi Klum is sold on QVC, Heidi Klum on AOL, Shine by Heidi Klum, a fragrance with Coty, and more. Klum, who has lived in the United States since 1994, became an American citizen before the 2008 presidential election so she could vote for Barack Obama. She holds dual citizenship and remains a German. ""I've been paying quite a few taxes in this city -- in this country,"" she said. ""And I felt that it would be right for me to vote for the next president.""","Heidi Klum said Seal proposed to her in front of an igloo he had built .

"(CNN) -- More than 800 Somali children are arriving at crowded refugee camps in Kenya daily after walking for days to escape a prolonged drought, an aid group said this week. About 10 million people are at risk of starvation as the Horn of Africa region faces the worst drought in 60 years, according to the United Nations. The drought has left thousands of children in Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda malnourished, and millions others in danger, Save the Children said. Nearly 1,300 people, including children, are arriving daily at the Dadaab refugee camps in northeastern Kenya, according to Save the Children. ""Children have made long journeys in terrifying conditions, often losing their families along the way and arriving at the camps in desperate need of security, health care and a normal life,"" said Catherine Fitzgibbon, program director of Save the Children in Kenya. The influx of refugees in the Dadaab area has worsened conditions in a camp already battling limited resources. Dadaab, which was built for 90,000 people, is home to more than 350,000 refugees. ""Drought has forced children out of school as both human and livestock diseases spread,"" the United Nations said in a statement. ""Competition for the meager resources is causing tensions among communities."" Conflict in Somalia is adding to the problem as government forces battle militants in the capital of Mogadishu. The clashes between the two sides have made it hard for aid groups to access the hardest-hit areas. ""It is essential that we move quickly to break the destructive cycle of drought and hunger that forces farmers to sell their means of production as part of their survival strategy,"" said Josette Sheeran, the executive director of the World Food Programme. Aid groups said the combined problems of drought and conflict have sent food prices skyrocketing. ""In Somalia, if we are not able to respond rapidly and effectively to it, there will be many more lives lost,"" said Mark Bowden, a U.N. humanitarian coordinator in the nation. Food prices have gone up by 270% in some areas since last year, Bowden said.

"It was a bit awkward the first time Kate Daggett asked the question. She didn't want to offend her friends, after all, and it seemed rather personal. She stammered, she stalled. ""I probably rambled for two or three minutes,"" she said. Finally, she got it out. What do you do with the guns in your house? the mother of two asked the parents of her teenage son's friends, both avid hunters. It's not a new question -- about 19 million parents were asking it back in 2006, according to a survey conducted by the Center to Prevent Youth Violence. But in the wake of December's Newtown, Connecticut, school massacre -- and recent accidental shootings involving children -- it appears to be one that parents are asking more often before sending their kids on play dates and sleepovers. Related: Parents defend right to keep guns in home . The Center to Prevent Youth Violence has been getting a lot more calls since the Newton shooting, said Becca Knox, a senior manager. The group is behind the ASK campaign --  ""Asking Saves Kids"" -- which encourages parents to ask questions about guns in homes where their children play. In a discussion about guns in homes on CNN's Facebook page, commenters agreed that asking the question is good parenting. While some parents said they would never allow their children into a home where guns are kept, others were comfortable knowing that the guns were secure. ""You should be asking, 'Are your guns locked up?' "" commenter Kristine Caster said. There's ""no crime in having legal guns in your home."" Injuries are rare . Despite incidents such as the recent death of a 6-year-old New Jersey boy shot in the head by a 4-year-old playmate, as well as the accidental shooting of a Tennessee sheriff's deputy's wife by a 4-year-old boy, accidental firearms deaths are rare among children. According to the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 703 children under the age of 15 died in accidental firearms deaths between 2001 and 2010, the latest year for which the agency's statistics on fatalities are available. During the same period, 7,766 children under the age of 14 suffered accidental firearms injuries -- about one injury for every million children. But statistics don't matter much if it's your child that's shot, said Missy Carson Smith, founder of Gun Safe Mom, a campaign to make the gun question as common as asking about food allergies, swimming pools and video game limits. ""It just shreds your family,"" said Smith, whose own teenage brother died in a shooting. She started the campaign in 2009, after learning during a carpool trip that unsecured guns were in the home of a family where her daughter had played. ""The kids knew where they were, they could get to it,"" she said. ""That's when my heart just dropped in my stomach."" She resolved to ask the family about their guns, but first she had some housekeeping of her own to do. Her family had an unsecured gun, owned by her husband. After getting it out of the house, she reached out to the other family to ask about the weapons there. ""They didn't realize that the way guns were stored in their home posed a threat to other people,"" she said. ""It was a good conversation."" Since then, she has reached out to friends and leaders in her Traverse City, Michigan, community to press her cause and encourage parents to routinely ask the question. She's had the conversation with friends of her children probably 50 times, she says. It's not about gun rights, she stresses. In fact, she counsels parents to make a point of saying they understand and accept the rights of gun owners to have firearms -- even loaded, unlocked weapons. The point, she says, is to make sure you're comfortable with the environment where you're sending your kids. CNN Facebook commenter Kathe Valeri said she only allows her children to go on playdates with children of families she knows well. ""We pick our friends and our social circle very carefully. If I don't know the parent well enough, then my kids don't play. That's it,"" she said. ""Being that they are trustworthy friends, I have no problems worrying about if my children will be safe in their homes."" Gun owner's reaction . Gun owner Timothy Turner said he asks if guns are in his kids' friends' homes and how they're secured. If they keep a loaded gun, he specifically requests that they remove the ammo and keep it in a separate place when his daughters visit. He's not worried about his daughters finding them ""because they know what to do if they find a gun,"" Turner said on CNN's Facebook page. He's worried about others who don't know how to handle a gun. If they don't agree to keep them locked up or are unable to keep the ammo and gun separate, ""my daughters don't go,"" he said. In turn, he makes sure to inform every parent whose child is visiting that he keeps a gun in the home. He said he keeps one gun in his home ""for protection,"" locked in a fingerprint-scan safe. He has more, but he keeps them in vaults off his property at a location that only a few trusted people know about. As for Daggett, she said her friends responded well to the gun question the first time she asked it. The avid hunters assured her that all of their weapons were locked up in a gun safe. She's gotten better at asking the question since. It's part of her standard rundown now, anytime she ponders allowing her kids to visit another family's home. With a curious 4-year-old daughter she calls ""the raccoon"" and a 13-year-old son -- the age of so many school shooters and victims -- she feels like she doesn't have much choice. ""I could so easily see my son or one of his friends picking up a pistol and saying, 'This is so cool!' "" Daggett said. Starting the conversation . Here are some tips from Knox and Smith about having the gun conversation with other parents: . -- Start by having a family policy on firearms safety that you're already following, Smith said. ""If you're not thinking about it ahead of time, you don't really know what you like or don't like,"" she said. -- Don't make gun safety a bigger deal than, say, pool safety or food allergies, but do make sure to clearly cover it, Knox said. ""Blend it in with other topics,"" she suggests. ""It's important to not make this too heavy or a subject that shouldn't be talked about."" -- Don't make judgments. ""It's not just what you say and the content of your question, but the manner you express your question,"" Smith said. -- Don't worry about offending other parents, Knox says. She said the group's field work shows gun owners are rarely offended by the question, but concern about opening up a rift between families keeps some parents from talking about the issue. ""It's a barrier of anticipation,"" she says. -- Have the conversation when kids aren't around, Smith suggests. She recounted the experience of a friend who brought up the issue when her son's young friends were around. Their mother froze -- she hadn't told the children that a gun was in the home. It turns out the weapons were secured, Smith said. ""But she didn't want the kids to know they were there."" Whether you agree with that or not, respect the other family's values, Smith said.","Conversations about gun safety are becoming more common before play dates, sleepovers .

"In 2010, an Icelandic volcano with an unpronounceable name spewed an ash cloud into the skies that disrupted travel for millions of passengers and cost airlines a small fortune. Now another Icelandic volcano is rumbling, prompting fears of a repeat of the travel chaos that afflicted northern Europe when the Eyjafjallajokull volcano did its worst. Its name -- Bardarbunga -- is a little less daunting, but it could still cause trouble. Something is brewing . While there's no sign yet of magma moving to the surface, according to Iceland's Meteorological Office, something's definitely up beneath the Earth's surface. In what the Meteorological Office describes as an ""intense earthquake swarm,"" scientists registered some 2,600 earthquakes between early Saturday morning and Monday evening. And after the strongest earthquake since 1996 was measured in the area early Monday, an orange aviation alert was posted by Icelandic authorities -- indicating ""heightened or escalating unrest with increased potential of eruption."" ""The reason we are reacting in this way is that this one is bigger and more powerful than we have seen in a long time in this area,"" said Vidir Reynisson, of the Iceland Civil Protection Agency, of the earthquake swarm. Scientists have noticed an increase in seismic activity around the volcano, located in the northwestern region of Vatnajokull glacier, one of Europe's largest glaciers, over the past seven years, the Meteorological Office said. The level dropped a little after the eruption of another volcano on the same glacier, Grimsvotn, in 2011, but has since picked up again. Earthquakes may signal eruption . As of Monday evening, the majority of earthquakes measured were at a depth of 5 to 10 kilometers. There's more potential for a volcanic eruption if magma movement occurs at less than 10 kilometers' depth. According to the Smithsonian Institute Global Volcanism Program, Bardarbunga last erupted in 1910. If it should blow its top again, it could be bad news for travelers. Volcanic ash can be a serious hazard to aircraft, reducing visibility, damaging flight controls and ultimately causing jet engines to fail. The Eyjafjallajokull eruption forced the cancellation and diversion of thousands of flights per day at the peak of the problem. ""It was causing problems for millions of passengers, the airlines themselves were losing lots of money because they could not fly,"" Paul Charles, former director of communications for Virgin Atlantic and Eurostar, told CNN. ""And the customer relations departments of airlines were really suffering because they were taking huge numbers of complaints and they had no solution."" Air travel still smooth . Europe's air authority, Eurocontrol, said Tuesday it was monitoring the Bardarbunga situation but that there is no impact at this time on European aviation. It also insists that changes have been made to help avoid the kind of chaos seen after Eyjafjallajokull erupted. ""Europe is more prepared to deal with volcanic ash these days; we have better mechanisms in place than we did in 2010. Every year, volcanic ash exercises are conducted and we learn from them: the latest one was held in April this year,"" it said. ""However, volcanic ash is still a hazard for aviation and does have the potential to cause disruption. Safety is, as ever, our primary concern."" Road melts at Yellowstone National Park .

"Wendi Deng, a businesswoman and mother of two is perhaps best known for the slap that protected her media mogul husband, Rupert Murdoch. In July 2011, Deng lunged at a protester who was advancing on Murdoch with a shaving cream pie during a UK parliamentary hearing on allegations of phone hacking by Murdoch's media company. The Twitterverse lit up with chatter about the incident and bloggers in her native China largely applauded her. But that one instinctive, protective swipe could not completely remove suspicions about the 44-year-old woman's marriage to 82-year-old Murdoch. So often, the age difference, his riches and her beauty were mentioned alongside each other. Deng first made waves when she married Murdoch in 1999, shortly after he divorced his wife of more than 30 years, Anna Torv Murdoch Mann. Now Murdoch is divorcing Deng . The couple have two daughters, Chloe and Grace, the youngest of his six children. The couple met at a cocktail party shortly after Deng graduated with an MBA from Yale, Murdoch told CCTV's ""Dialogue"" in 2011. She went to work as an intern in Hong Kong at Star Television, a satellite television service he bought in 1993. By then, Murdoch's holdings under News Corp. included the Sunday Times, The Australian, News International, the New York Post, the Times of London, 20th Century Fox and Fox Broadcasting. Deng served as his interpreter during a tour of China, he said. On CCTV, Murdoch recalled the days when he pursued Wendi and his efforts to get her to marry him. ""I fell in love with her, and I asked her. She said no, and it took a long time to persuade her,"" he said. Murdoch's media empire . They married after he finalized his divorce from his second wife. Deng has come a long way, coming from a small town in China, the daughter of a poor factory engineer. Her marriage to Murdoch wasn't her first. She married the man who, with his then-wife, sponsored her for a student visa in the United States during the late 1980s. She eventually secured a ""green card"" to stay permanently in the United States, but her first marriage was short-lived. Despite her moments in the spotlight and her pre-marriage career in Murdoch's empire, not much is known about Deng. She sits on the board of advisers at the Yale School of Management, her alma mater. She is listed as a co-founder of Big Feet Productions and is also co-producer of the movie, ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan.""","Wendi Deng rose from humble beginnings to marry one of the world's richest men .

"The GOP-led House of Representatives passed legislation Friday, voting 252-161, approving construction of the Keystone pipeline, which would take that decision away from the Obama Administration. The debate over Keystone has become a central issue in the Louisiana Senate runoff election, which is scheduled for Dec. 6. Republican U.S. Rep Bill Cassidy is running against Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu. The House has already passed similar legislation, but Republicans hope that this latest vote will give Cassidy a boost in next month's election. Landrieu has also been pushing for approval of the pipeline, and the Senate is expected to vote on the measure Tuesday. The bill will need 60 votes to pass and it's expected to be a close vote. The long-stalled measure got a jump start when Landrieu -- the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee chairwoman facing an uphill re-election battle -- saw it as one last chance to demonstrate her clout and began pushing for an immediate vote. Senate Democrats who had previously ignored the bill are now moving toward giving it a vote in the lame duck session, knowing that Republicans are likely to force the issue after their newly-elected majority is sworn into office in January. Republicans sought to mute Landrieu's chances of getting a political boost in her oil-rich state by promising Cassidy a spot on the energy panel, and also having him sponsor the House's legislation to authorize the pipeline. The legislation would take the approval of the pipeline, which would run from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, out of the hands of President Barack Obama's administration. His State Department -- which must approve the pipeline, since it crosses international borders -- is six years into a review of the project. Obama told reporters Friday in Myanmar that his ""position hasn't changed."" He said the pipeline is still facing a challenge from Nebraska landowners and said he doesn't think ""we should circuit that process."" ""My government believes that we should judge this pipeline based on whether or not it accelerates climate change or whether it helps the American people with their energy costs or their gas prices,"" he said. A State Department spokeswoman said the votes will have no effect on the department's consideration of the pipeline, and that the review is continuing. Landrieu, meanwhile, has insisted that the Senate has at least 60 votes to approve the pipeline -- and is taking credit for the legislation's sudden movement. ""I am so pleased to have been one of the spark plugs to help to get us moving -- not in the next Congress, but in the lame duck session of this Congress,"" she said on the Senate floor Thursday.","The House approved a bill that authorizes construction of the Keystone pipeline .

"It might be hard to believe that two of the handsome boxers in the photos above were once shelter or rescue dogs with severe cases of mange and little hope of finding their forever homes. But Myles, left, and Merlin beat the odds, which is remarkable considering that according to the Humane Society of the United States, 6 million to 8 million pets enter shelters each year, and half of those animals are euthanized. Here are their stories. Merlin's path to his family began when Frank and Katie Rannou toyed with the idea of adding a third dog to their family. But plans took a back seat when Grace, their 8-year-old boxer, developed cancer and began a slow decline. Coping with the loss of a pet proved difficult for the couple. Their boxer Josie had an even tougher time adjusting to life without her constant companion. Once again, they considered adoption and contacted Atlanta Boxer Rescue about a dog named Merlin that had been featured on the group's website for more than a year. ""We were kind of called to Merlin,"" says Katie Rannou of Smyrna, Georgia. ""He was 22 months old and Josie was about 7. That's quite an age gap, so we were anxious to see how that would work."" A rough startThe age gap paled in comparison to other challenges Merlin already had overcome. He was deaf, and when Merlin arrived at an Atlanta animal shelter, the large white puppy was malnourished and struggled with severe mange, a treatable skin condition that causes hair loss and itchy sores. Animal control called Atlanta Boxer Rescue after another rescue group gave up on the dog. Leg fractures led to $3,000 in veterinary bills that the nonprofit covered through donations and fund-raisers. MNN: How to help pets without taking in another animal . ""There was so much stuff going on, and he was such a young dog when we got him,"" says Dianne DaLee, president of Atlanta Boxer Rescue. ""We didn't know his bones were that bad. We just looked at the mange and said, 'It's treatable; this is a young dog that will grow up to live a happy life.' "" The home visitMerlin's foster family had taught him about a dozen hand signals for basic commands, and the Rannous were ready to give Merlin his happy ending — as long as timid Josie could handle an energetic, 75-pound male companion. His next big hurdle would be a home visit. On February 11, Merlin joined his forever family. ""The best way to honor Grace's legacy was to give another dog a wonderful home and lots of love,"" Rannou notes on her blog. ""There are a bunch of hidden treasures in rescues and I wish more would look at this as an option,"" she said recently. MNN: How to help a charity without writing a big check . Settling in with the familyBoxers tend to be large, athletic dogs that require plenty of mental and physical stimulation to keep them out of mischief, so the Rannous take their dogs on daily 6-mile walks. Merlin's muscular build, square head and fine, white coat with dappled spots attract plenty of attention. People walk a wide path or approach to ask questions about the striking boxer. Regarded as loyal and protective, this popular breed also is known to interact well with children. Later this year, Merlin and Josie will help celebrate another human addition to their pack when the Rannous welcome their first child. ""While he would never take the place of Grace, it really helped heal our hearts a little bit,"" Rannou says. ""And he brought out such a playful side in Josie."" Myles finds a homeNichole Hess also chose to honor the life of her boxer, Bailey, by fostering another dog. She was all set to care for a female puppy when Atlanta Boxer Rescue posted photos of a male named Myles. At only 4 months old, his body was covered with sores caused by severe mange and Myles required daily medicated baths. ""It just broke my heart,"" Hess says. ""He was so sickly and so bad off and I knew he was going to need a lot of care. At that time, I couldn't say no. I reached out and said, 'Somebody else take this female who is healthy and will probably get adopted pretty quickly.'"" MNN: 7 incredibly loyal dogs . Meeting her new chargeOn the day after Thanksgiving, Hess met Myles and worked on his recovery. Doubts began to creep in when she gave Myles his first medicated bath, treating wounds that spread from his muzzle to his paws. But Hess pushed those thoughts aside and focused on caring for the pup, administering pills and hand-feeding Myles until he gained strength. ""I honestly didn't know if he was gong to make it or not,"" she says. ""He was on pain meds and didn't come out of his crate for the first week."" Healing brings a new challengeAfter two months of treatment and a little coaching from George, Hess' French bulldog, Myles finally was on the mend. Healing brought a new challenge. Atlanta Boxer Rescue had spread the word about Myles and adoption requests began to pour in for the boxer. Hess also had shared his story, driving people to the Atlanta Boxer Rescue site to raise money and awareness for rescued boxers. ""It was a double-edged sword,"" she says. ""I was happy that people were interested, but I had gotten attached and knew it would be hard to let him go."" MNN: Why do pet rescuers ask such nosy questions? Foster mom gets second chanceRescue groups help relieve overcrowding in animal shelters by giving pets a better chance at finding forever homes through adoption fairs, foster care and aggressive social media campaigns. Once prospective families are identified, reputable rescue organizations rely on a detailed application process to pair pets and people. Many find a love connection. Occasionally, things don't work out and the pet returns to a rescue organization. Myles fell into the latter category. Fortunately, Hess had fallen for the rambunctious pup and wanted to keep him. In addition to the occasional foster dog, her pack now includes George, Myles and a young boxer named Finn who was turned in to animal control shortly after having a litter of puppies. To keep her pack occupied, Hess relies on frequent walks, obedience classes and interactive puzzle toys. ""I've worked hard to get them on the same page,"" she says. ""We do a lot of team-building exercises."" Help pets find a forever homeIf your team is ready to foster a pet, Hess recommends researching local rescues and talking to other foster families about the experience. Of course, there's always the chance that your foster will turn into a permanent resident. That's not such a bad thing, according to Hess and Rannou. ""You can get a phenomenal dog from a rescue,"" Rannou says. ""We have had three phenomenal experiences. Dogs from rescues show their gratitude every day. Something in them knows you kind of saved them and they pay that back lovingly.""","Two boxers, Myles and Merlin, beat the odds as rescue dogs .

"The accusations against the Revlon CEO are ugly -- but that doesn't mean Twitter can't pretty them up with some humor. According to the New York Post, the cosmetics company's CEO, Lorenzo Delpani, is being sued by a former company scientist, Alan Meyers, who is alleging discrimination. Meyers says in the suit that the Italian-born Delpani expressed disdain for such groups as Jews, blacks and Americans as a whole. According to the suit, Delpani said he could ""smell a black person when he entered a room,"" noted that ""Jews stick together"" and said Americans were ""small-minded"" and ""dirty."" A Revlon representative told the Post that the suit was a product of an unhappy ex-employee. Meyers was let go because he ""repeatedly demonstrated critical lapses in judgment and failed to perform at the high standard we demand of our employees,"" she said. Revlon Chairman Ronald O. Perelman said in a statement, ""I know Lorenzo as an executive and as a person. ... He is among the least bigoted or biased human I have ever known. He has my full support."" Nevertheless, the kerfuffle hasn't stopped wags on Twitter from making the hashtag #ShadesofRevlon trend, whether out of outrage or comic potential. ""Don't forget #ShadesOfRevlon's fragrance line: Dirty Americans perfume, Black Room cologne, & Yiddish Smell of Success. Last 2 KKK-approved!"" wrote Chris Six. ""Malcolm X-foliating cream,"" suggested Ryan Dalton. It may be a while before some customers kiss and make up with the makeup giant. To a tweet that said, ""Black twitter will NEVER let you off the hook,"" the Kitchenista was in blunt agreement. ""Not ever,"" she wrote.","Revlon chairman says CEO ""has my full support""

"Many Americans think global warming is a distant risk that threatens faraway places with ice caps and polar bears. Very few Americans link global warming to infectious disease, but that could change. As the climate of the northern United States warms, the Asian tiger mosquito, one of the world's most invasive pests, continues spreading northward from Texas to New York, while extending its breeding season. These changes are happening just when chikungunya, an infectious disease carried by this and other mosquitoes, is rapidly spreading throughout the Caribbean. Pieces are falling into place for a historic epidemic on U.S. shores. If that happens, then mosquitoes might just shift the debate from whether climate change is happening to a more serious discussion on how to respond to the consequences of a warmer world. Studies by the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication have found that when Americans are informed about the broad health consequences of climate change, they are more likely to engage with the issue. When what's threatened are our neighbors, rather than far away polar bears, the perception of climate change is likely to shift. When informed about the broad health consequences of climate change, participants surveyed by the Yale Project for Climate Change Communication are more likely to engage with climate issues. In the end, disease-carrying mosquitoes don't care if you are a Democrat or a Republican. Asian tiger mosquitoes are opportunistic; they breed nearly anywhere. Unlike most other mosquitoes, they bite all day long. Nor do they mind having their blood meal interrupted by an attempted swatting. They just fly off to other victims and increase the odds of spreading disease. Arriving in Texas in the mid-1980s,  Asian tiger mosquitoes spread northward to their ecological limit where annual average temperatures are 50 degrees Fahrenheit or warmer — a boundary that runs more or less through New York City. Indeed, New York health officials are monitoring Asian tiger mosquitoes in 61 locations across the city's five boroughs. The mosquito is abundant in the Washington, D.C., area. The Asian tiger mosquito is also adapting its behavior and is able to ignore the onset of autumn, postpone hibernation, and extend its egg-laying season. More time to breed allows more Asian tiger mosquitoes in northern latitudes, just as one of the worst diseases they can carry arrived near U.S. shores. News reports on chikungunya picked up their pace last December when the disease first appeared on the Caribbean island of St. Martin. We know it originated in East Africa, how the Makonde people in Africa named it for the contorted posture related to its painful arthritis-like symptoms, that the number of confirmed or suspected cases in the Caribbean has passed 25,000, and that it is highly likely to spread to the U.S. mainland. There is little or no discussion of the virus' propensity to mutate. Although the outbreak is driven by the yellow fever mosquito, which thrives only in the tropics, recent mutations allow the chikungunya virus to be carried 100 times more efficiently by the Asian tiger mosquito. This new virus strain infected hundreds of thousands of people on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean in 2005; about 255,000 cases were reported. Many died and thousands experienced high fever and intense physical pain. The same strain has caused at least five outbreaks in Asia affecting millions, with smaller outbreaks in France and Italy. Unfortunately, just when public health officials should be preparing for a chikungunya outbreak in the United States, the federal budget sequestration reduced funding for research on all infectious diseases. Global warming is enabling the Asian tiger mosquito to spread northward, yet climate policy remains stalled in Congress, where some elected officials still dismiss even the reality of the measurable rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution. The relationship between climate change and infectious disease needs to be a focus of the nation's strategy for outbreak prevention, preparedness, detection and response. Public understanding of chikungunya and the broader links between rising temperatures and human health could help change public discourse. Since the first outbreak of Lyme in Connecticut, the disease has already spread into Canada. cryptococcosis, a frequently lethal fungal disease formerly restricted to the tropics, was identified in the Pacific Northwest in 2007. Valley fever and hantavirus are also spreading. All have been associated with changing environmental conditions as temperatures increase.
