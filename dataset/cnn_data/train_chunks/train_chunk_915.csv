"By . Freya Noble . Adam Freeman was arrested at the weekend after a man fell 10 metres from a balcony in Bondi . Adam Freeman, a well-known nightclub identity in Sydney, has been arrested over the alleged assault of a man who fell from a balcony in North Bondi. Mr Freeman, the eldest son of notorious underworld figure George Freeman, was taken to Waverly Police Station on Sunday after police were called to an apartment on Brighton Boulevard just before 10am. The 31-year-old is on bail awaiting a sentence on drug charges relating to the seizure of chemicals used to make drugs in December 2010. Police arrived at the North Bondi property at the weekend to find a 29-year-old man had fallen 10 metres from the balcony of the apartment. 'At the scene they found a 29-year-old man with face and spinal injuries,' a police statement said. 'The man was treated at the scene by paramedics and taken to hospital.' The 29-year-old victim was taken St Vincents Hospital in Darlinghurst with head injuries. A spokesperson for NSW Police told Daily Mail Australia that a '31-year-old has since been released pending further enquiry and no charges had been laid at this point'. Freeman is well-known on the Kings Cross club scene and once owned the now defunct nightclub Lady Lux, with nightclub owner, John Ibrahim. A senior police officer told  The Daily Telegraph he did not know why Freeman's drug matter had not been finalised yet and said he's been a 'real pest' since returning from Thailand. Scroll down for video . The 29-year-old who tumbled from the balcony was taken to St Vincent's Hospital with face and spinal injuries . The Thailand trip the senior officer was referring to occurred on December 16, 2010, when Freeman paid cash for a one-way ticket out of Australia after two of his co-accused were busted with 20 kilograms of precursor drugs used to make ecstasy. The two men were apparently pulled over for an RBT and were driving a hired van when police discovered the drugs. Freeman handed himself into authorities in Sydney on August 6 2011 after a global warrant was issued for his arrest. Freeman, 31, spent time in Klong Prem Prison in 2010 before he returned to Australian after a global warrant was issued for his arrest . Before returning to Sydney he spend 30 days inside the notorious Klong Prem Prison, known as the 'Bangkok Hilton', . In September 2013 - after spending some time in Long Bay Jail later in 2011 but being released on $860,000 bail - he pleaded guilty to manufacturing a commercial supply to ecstasy just days before his trial was due to start. He could face up to 25 years behind bars on the drug charges. The self-confessed drug manufacturer dated swimsuit model Dominique Le Toullec, who is said to have visited him in Thailand back in 2010 . Freeman's latest brush with the law comes after he was on the luxury Oscar II boat in Rose Bay when it was shot up early in January. Also on board were alleged Brothers for Life gang members Farhad Qaumi, his brother Mumtaz and another man, Fawad Bari, who was allegedly a member of the Blacktown chapter. The Daily Telegraph report the men were on the boat with a group of women as part of a 'send-off' for Freeman due to his impending sentencing. Adam Freeman's father George Freeman was a notorious organised crime figure and featured in two seasons of Underbelly . The yacht was docked at the time of the attack and police sources said the hit was organised by some of the men who were on board the boat. Farhad Qaumi was hit in the shoulder during the shooting. Freeman previously dated Dominique Le Toullec, whose Facebook page describes her as 'Personal Trainer - International/Australian Glamour & Fitness Model'. She is believed to have visited him when he was holed up in Thailand, though had no link to any of her boyfriend's crimes. Le Toullec recently spent some time in the US to watch the Surf Open and take part in some photoshoots. It is unclear if the pair are still an item. The boy's father George Freeman is one of Australia's most famous organised crime figures, who was a one time bookie and illegal casino operator. He served some time in jail during the 50s and 60s, had links to the drug trade in the 70s and 80s, and was later named in an organised crime Royal Commission. George Freeman's life has been detailed in two of the Underbelly series' that aired on Channel Nine, which implied his involvement in an international drug syndicate and the unsolved murder of another criminal. He survived an attempt on his life in 1970 when he was shot in the neck but died 11 years later from an asthma attack and heart failure when his eldest son was just eight.

"By . Freya Noble . A woman whose husband was killed in a tragic boating accident while the family were holidaying in Fiji has spoken of her heartbreak for the first time. Mark Hardaker was on a fishing trip off Mana Island in May when, just 50 metres from shore at the end of a two hour trip, another boat slammed into their vessel, killing him instantly. The father of three's wife, Vanessa Hardaker, told A Current Affair he was supposed to be going jet-skiing but made the switch to fishing because the high-powered machines were booked out - to the relief of his wife who thought fishing was the safer option. Scroll down for video . Vanessa Hardaker spoke for the first time about losing her husband Mark and her struggle in coming to terms with being a single mum . Speaking of the last time she ever saw her husband, Mrs Hardaker said: 'I saw him walk away, walk down to the beach... and he never came back.' The Hardakers, from Toongabbie in NSW, were on vacation with another family on what Mrs Hardaker described as their dream holiday to celebrate her 40th birthday. Their three kids Georgia, Sam and Jake were 'beside themselves with excitement' as they had never been on a plane before or overseas. One the day he died Mr Hardaker had gone out to sea with Sasha, the husband of Mrs Hardaker's closest friend Tracey. Just 15 minutes before the accident that claimed his life, the two men switched seats. Sasha told the program he lives with the guilt every day. The father of three was killed instantly when another boat collided with the one he was on board . 'You question it every day. Why am I here? And he's not,' Sasha admitted through tears. Tracey was the one who had to break the news to her devastated friend,, who said she knew it was bad news by the look on her face. 'And then I had to go back and tell the kids.' Mrs Hardaker recalled, before saying the last thing she expected to be doing the next day was making funeral arrangements on her 40th birthday. Mrs Hardaker, now a single stay at home mum, revealed the struggles - both financially and emotionally - that the family has faced since her husband's death. They were in the middle of renovations on their house, and many unfinished jobs and rooms are waiting to be completed by a husband who will not return. The family were on their dream holiday on Mana Island in Fiji with another family when tragedy struck . A Fijian man who was driving the boat which crashed into Mr Hardaker's has been charged with manslaughter. Jimi Beti, 33, was also charged with criminal recklessness and negligence over the death. It is understood he did not have a boat license. Sasha recalled that the other boat looked overcrowded, but there were only four men on board their vessel. After Mr Hardaker's death tributes poured in from family and friends who described the man as thoughtful, selfless and a devoted father.","Mark Hardaker, from Toongabbie, NSW,  was killed instantly when another boat collided with the one he was aboard in May .

"By . Freya Noble . An entertaining university student took home $100,000 from game show Hot Seat Millionaire on Monday night without being certain of a single answer to any of the questions. Khaled El-Katateny, a second year law student from Melbourne, was calm and more than a little cheeky, as he joked with host Eddie McGuire and plugged his Instagram page in between each round. 'I'd buy 10 jet-skis, for me and all my friends... I'd have my name on the side', he revealed when asked what he would spend the jackpot on if he won. Scroll down for video . Khaled El-Katateny, a law student from Melbourne, took home $100,000 from game show Millionaire Hot Seat on Monday night . El-Katateny made it seem as though he was making his way blindly through the six questions which saw him leave the show with $100,000, but the 19-year-old said he had a a plan from the beginning. He attributed his win to his ability to read body language, and said his strategy involved repeating the answers back to McGuire to gauge his response. 'I didn’t play the game — I played the man,' he told news.com.au. Though it is entirely possible this admission is just another part of the performance which kept viewers entertained throughout. El-Katateny had the audience in stitches the whole time he was in the chair, cracking jokes and jumping between options before locking in one of the multiple choice answers in a seemingly random manner. The prankster joked his way through the questions, and proclaimed each time one popped up on the screen 'I have no idea' Each time a question popped up on the screen, his reaction was the same: 'I have no idea.' He even asked McGuire 'if I win or lose can I take a selfie?' The first question he was asked who Nicholas Cowdery was, a man well-known for his work in law, the field which El-Katateny is studying in. Before he answered he cheekily proclaimed in a hilarious act of self-promotion 'Wouldn't have a clue, it kind of reminds me of my Instagram name Khaled_ELK,'  as he stared straight down the barrel of the camera. When it got to the $100,000 question and McGuire quipped that the law student hadn't been certain of any answer so far, the 19-year-old was quick to respond. El-Katateny said early in the program he would buy 10 jet-skis for him and all his friends if he won the money . 'Maybe I make you think that I don't know the answers', El-Katateny said with a straight face, sending the audience into fits of laughter once again. The final question asked who the artist behind 1908 masterpiece The Red Room was, and the Melbourne man nearly went with Vincent van Gough because 'I know he's popular.' At the last second he locked in Henri Matisse, and had a very good reason for doing so. The 19-year-old appeared to guess each answer, but said he was actually reading host Eddie Maguire . 'If you wanna know my thought process it's like I haven't done D in a while so I'll choose that.' Whether he was lucky or just much smarter than he let on, the 19-year-old still left up the show with much more money than he came with. However he admitted he might stick to just one jet-ski instead of 10, as his previous promise was causing some trouble between his friends. The Melbourne man made sure to plug his Instagram page and ask for a selfie with Eddie McGuire while on TV .","Khaled El-Katateny won $100,000 on Millionaire Hot Seat on Monday night .

"By . Freya Noble . At the inquest into the death of a young woman who was killed when her car slammed into a tree, conflicting accounts of her last moments came to light. Sarah Durazza was travelling along the Wakehurst Parkway in Narrabeen on Sydney's northern beaches last August when she crashed her car and was killed almost instantly. The 26-year-old swerved, crossed lanes and smashed into a tree in her Holden Barina while apparently on the phone to her boyfriend, who raced to the scene after he heard the accident. However at court on Tuesday, confusion emerged over who was actually on the phone to Ms Durazza when she died. Scroll down for video . Sarah Durazza was killed in a car crash last year when she lost control of her vehicle and veered off the road into a tree . It was originally thought that Ms Durazza's boyfriend, Scott Bidder had answered a call from the part-time model, but her mother, Fiona, told Parramatta Local Court she was the one who took the call, according to The Daily Telegraph. 'I heard her breathing and then one last gasp,' Mrs Durazza revealed, speaking of her recollection of her daughter's last moments. Mrs Durazza said she had been in the car with Mr Bidden searching for Ms Durazza when she answered the phone. However the Mona Vale model's boyfriend said he was the one who spoke to her, and was in the car alone when he picked up the phone, heard her swear, and then listened to the sound of the crash and Ms Durazza's final breaths. The part-time model was apparently on the phone to her boyfriend Scott Bidder at the time of the accident, and a court has heard that distraction may have contributed to her death . Also at the inquest into the death of the beautician and part-time model, a magistrate called for a total ban on mobile phones in cars. Magistrate Hugh Dillon said 'Frankly, If it was up to me I would ban mobile phones in cars all together', . Magistrate Dillon is set to release the formal findings of Ms Durazza's death early next month, but said it was likely that distraction caused by her mobile phone played a role in the accident. Mrs Durazza described the Wakehurst Parkway as a dangerous strip of road, despite crime scene investigators saying the road was in good condition. She revealed she wanted the road upgraded and called for better lighting and more guard rails to be installed. Fiona, Ms Durazza's mother, called for the road to be upgraded while at Parramatta Court on Tuesday . Ms Durazza was the woman at the centre of a scandal involving a Manly Sea Eagles rugby league player in 2009. She was attending a pre-season party with her father Paul, a sponsor of the club, when Anthony Watmough, Brett Stewart and Matt Orford began insulting her. In the fallout, Ms Durazza's father was alleged to have taken a swing at Watmough before officers were called to the Manly Wharf Hotel where the event was held.","Sarah Durazza was killed when her car slammed into a tree last year .

The replica was built on a 430 hectare property in Esperance, 700km south-east of Perth, three years ago and was carved to look exactly like the UK Stonehenge as it would have in 1950 BC. The Stonehenge replica and a three-bedroom house are included in the $5 million price tag, which has become a tourist attraction of sorts in the West Australian town. The full-size granite Stonehenge replica has gone on the market on an Australian farm for $5 million. The whole Stonehenge concept started three years ago when a man just decided he wanted to replicate the piece of history .

"By . Freya Noble . These incredible photos of a huge saltwater crocodile devouring a foal in the Northern Territory give a fascinating insight into the natural world. Australian landscape photographer Paul Arnold, who captured the moment, and told MailOnline 'It was fascinating without being brutal... Real nature doing what it does.' While on one of his photographic tours on a billabong in Kakadu National Park Mr Arnold said something caught his eye on the bank. Photographer Paul Arnold captured these incredible photographs of a huge saltwater crocodile chowing down on a foal . The saltwater dragged the baby horse into the billabong with him as amazed tourists watched on . 'We were out there on a cruise and we saw this horse acting a bit strange... about two metres back from the bank. I thought ""That crocs trying to get the horse"" but it didnt look right.' He then spotted the crocodile below, which had scared off the large horse. Left behind on the banks was a stillborn foal. Mr Arnold said: 'We watched this croc grab this foal and back into the water', and kept the boat nearby for about 20 minutes watching the scene before him unfold.' The 4.5 metre long croc then dragged the foal onto the banks where Mr Arnold believes he stowed it away to devour . The foal was stillborn and after the crocodile had scared off its mother seized the moment and claimed the baby . 'Two customers from the Netherlands were on board they were amazed and they just couldnt believe what was happening.' From there, the 4.5 metre saltwater croc dragged the foal back up the bank, and Mr Arnold said he thinks the animal stored the baby horse nearby before it could devour the whole thing. 'It wasn't graphic... Just nature, brute force of nature and this big croc just doing what it does. It was enjoying to watch 'cause it's natural,' Mr Arnold revealed. The photographer who captured the amazing images said he spotted the crocodile the next day looking very full . Mr Arnold said the whole thing was very natural to observe and in no way graphic or upsetting . When back in the same area the next day, the photographer saw the same crocodile 'wallowing' in the shallows who looked as though he'd eaten far too much. 'The next day we came across this croc and he was huge! He had eaten that whole horse.' Mr Arnold is convinced it was the same creature, as there are only four or five ones of the same size which roam the area. The animal is one of the boss crocodiles and is a massive 4.5 metres long, one of only four or five of the same size in the area .","Landscape photographer Paul Arnold captured the moment the huge crocodile chowed down on a stillborn foal .

"By . Freya Noble . Nearly two months ago Ultramarathon burns survivor Turia Pitt reached a confidential multi-million dollar settlement deal with organisers of the marathon in which she nearly lost her life. Ms Pitt suffered burns to more than 60 percent of her body after she became trapped in a bushfire during an outback marathon in the Kimberly Region of Western Australia in 2011. Now, The Daily Telegraph reports that the settlement agreement has still not been signed by Hong Kong based company Racing The Planet, and the 26-year-old is yet to receive a cent. Scroll down for video . Turia Pitt's legal battle with organisers of the race that left her with life-threatening burns is still ongoing . On Wednesday Ms Pitt's lawyers fronted the Supreme Court, and have now lodged a motion to enforce the settlement agreement in court. They have until Friday to submit any evidence supporting its case. Racing the Planet have still refused to pay the woman's astronomical medical bills, even after a West Australian inquiry slammed the company's disastrous handling of the tragedy. Greg Walsh, Ms Pitt's lawyer told the publication the former model is very distressed that the company are refusing to sign the settlement. The agreement was finalised on May 29, and was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. At the time, Ms Pitt's boyfriend Michael Hoskin said it was settled through mediation and the couple were glad the process was over. The 26-year-old, pictured here with boyfriend Michael Hoskin before the tragic accident, reached an agreement with Racing The Planet in May . He told 60 Minutes the couple were glad they could move forward from the terrible hardship of the past few years, and he was grateful they would not have to think about the court case again. However with the settlement still dragging on the pair may have to wait a little longer, as the case was adjourned to next Tuesday. Ms Pitt launched the court action in February last year after a WA parliamentary inquiry found Hong Kong-based Racing The Planet did not take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of competitors. In 2012 Ms Pitt and fellow competitor Kate Sanderson - who also suffered severe burns during the race - were awarded $450,000 by the WA government as an 'Act of Grace'. Western Australia Tourism Minister Dr Kim Hames said that the money was to 'assist in alleviating their financial stress while they explore other options.' However two months later the company have still not signed the deal nor paid her any compensation for the accident which left her with burns to 64 percent of her body . Ms Pitt, who was working in mining engineering when she entered the marathon race, told a 2012 inquiry that she wasn't even planning to enter the event because she thought the entry fee was ridiculous. But two weeks before the marathon on September 2 2011, she was invited by organisers to compete for free. She was joined in the event by adventure enthusiast Ms Sanderson and 40 other runners who were destined to run across the parched outback Kimberley region of north west Australia. But part-way through the race Ms Pitt and Ms Sanderson, along with two male competitors, became trapped by a bushfire in a narrow, rocky gorge. Ms Pitt underwent countless operations and took on enormous medical bills during her ongoing recovery . Ms Pitt's injuries were so bad that not only did she suffer burns to 64 per cent of her body, she also had four fingers from her left hand and her right thumb amputated. They told the inquiry earlier they had no idea they were running into danger because the organisers had spoken only 'in passing' about spot fires. Ms Pitt said she and Ms Sanderson would have died at the gorge if not for a risky rescue mission undertaken by a helicopter crew.","Turia Pitt was caught in a bushfire while running a marathon in Western Australia in 2011 .

"By . Freya Noble . Claire Falls wrote a letter to the Prime Minister when she heard funding to the Paralympic football team had been cut . A young girl who penned a letter to the Prime Minister of Australia when she discovered funding to her favourite sport had been slashed, has hit back at Tony Abbott's response saying he didn't answer her questions. Claire Falls, who is just 12 years old, was outraged when she heard that Australia's Paralympic football team had their $175,000 Commonwealth funding reduced to nothing. A footballer herself, Claire is vision impaired and expressed her disappointment with the Australian Sports Commission in a letter to Mr Abbott, the Sydney Morning Herald report. The Australian Sports Commission is responsible for distributing the funds which are allocated to Paralympic sports, and this year the Pararoos missed out completely. Currently ranked 12th in the world, the Pararoos haven't made an appearance at the Paralympics since 2000, and the team's low rank was apparently one of the big reasons funding was pulled. The team was formed by the Cerebral Palsy Australian Sport & Recreation Federation and the Australian Paralympic Committee back in 1998. In her letter, Claire told the Prime Minister she was upset because she looked up to the team as role models and her sport wasn't all about winning medals. 'What hope is there for us kids? What do we have to aim for? How is that promoting encouragement, respect or inclusion?' she wrote. The vision impaired footballer was not happy with Mr Abbott's response and said he didn't answer her questions . She received a letter back from Mr Abbott, but was not impressed with the stock-standard response he sent her. His letter opened with 'One of the most enjoyable things about being Prime Minister is hearing from young people like yourself.' 'It says something positive about you that you were willing to take the time to write and share with me your thoughts about the issues that face our country,' it continued. But for Claire, who also wrote to the Sports Minister Peter Dutton and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, described Mr Abbott's response as rude. The Pararoos are currently ranked 12th in the world but haven't competed at the Paralympics since 2000 . 'Isn’t democracy supposed to be about equality and social justice and being able to have a say about things that important to you? The PM couldn’t even be bothered to answer any of my questions,' she told the publication. Claire's mother Shari Maguire said she doesn't think the MPs know who they're up against and her daughter will not be easily deterred from pursuing something she is passionate about. 'There is no grey in Claire’s world and certainly not when it comes to issues of equality.' When the funding announcement was made, Pararoos coach Paul Brown launched an online campaign to restore funding and is apparently in talks with the Australian Paralympic Committee to devise a solution. Claire said she was not impressed with the Prime Minister's response and has also written to the Sports Minister and Opposition Leader .","Claire Falls wrote to the Prime Minister when she discovered funding to the Pararoos had been cut .

"By . Daniel Mills . and Freya Noble . Capital cities on the east coast of Australia have experienced their coldest winter mornings in years as temperatures plummeted over the weekend. In Melbourne the mercury dropped to just above 1 degree, the coldest recorded temperature in 16 years. Though the city itself managed to stay just above zero, some of the outer suburbs were a little chillier, and Richard Carlyon from the Weather Bureau told the ABC the drop in temperatures was due to clear skies and light winds. Scroll down for video . Melbourne and Sydney have woken up to their coldest mornings in years after snowfall across the weekend . The coldest suburb in the Melbourne-Geelong area was Avalon at -3C degrees, while further west Ballarat got down to -5C, the lowest temperature since 2002. In the mountains the cold weather continued, and the mercury at Mount Bulla dropped to 8 degrees, the coldest of any of the ski resorts. It was also a frosty start in Sydney, which woke up to its coldest morning in four years - with a low of 5.5 degrees. While temperatures plummeted in Sydney, bushfires raged in northern NSW . An unconfirmed number of houses were lost as firefighters battled the blazes overnight . An emergency warning for Kremnos in far-north NSW has since been downgraded to advice . On Thursday Sydney was at the other end of the scale when it reached 25 degrees, just shy of the record July 24 date, set 14 years ago, when the city was hit with a top of 25.9 degrees. Despite the plummeting temperatures in some parts of the state, in northern NSW bushfires have destroyed homes and still threaten many more on the far north coast. Hundreds of firefighters battled blazes through the night and the number of homes lost it yet to be confirmed. The emergency alert for Kremnos in far-north NSW has been downgraded to advice. More than 90 fires are burning across the state and on Saturday afternoon three people were rescued by air from the out of control blazes. More than 90 blazes are still burning across NSW .

Elsewhere Australians have experienced a wild weekend of winter chills as a cold-snap brought snowfall and extreme winds to many parts of the country. Residents living in Sydney's scenic Blue Mountains were treated to a splattering of snowfall on Friday night, as the first pictures of white atop the ranges appeared on Twitter around the Katoomba and Lithgow region. Further afield it was Bathurst, about three hours from the city, which copped an unexpected overnight overnight drenching of snow as residents braved the plummeting temperatures. The opening of the heavens ended Sydney's spell of above average temperatures which peaked on Thursday with a top of 25 degrees celcius. Senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology Peter Zmijewski told the Sydney Morning Herald that snow had been forecast to fall down to 600 metres across the Blue Mountains and Central Tablelands.

Canberrans and South Australians were also met with minor snow falls and weather experts are anticipating more ahead for the weekend. Weatherzone meteorologist Sam Brown said he had heard reports of snow falling around the Canberra region on Friday although he said any sighting would have been fleeting. 'I've heard reports that there has been snow falling around the Canberra region, but most likely around the elevated areas and higher peaks around Canberra, not the city itself,' he said. The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast 'a brief snow shower' around the higher peaks of the Adelaide Hills and Flinders Ranges in South Australia. region.

"By . Freya Noble . The White Australia Game released in 1914 had one simple objective - 'Get the Coloured Men Out and the White Men In.' Documents from the White Australia Era which have been discovered in the National Archives give a startling insight into the explicit racism in Australian society well into the 1900s. The rules of the game state 'Place the Men the same as the 'Game'. The puzzle required the player to get all the 'coloured' men out of Australia and replace them with 'white men'. The White Australia Game: 'A New Australian Game For New And Old Australian People' The game was advertised as 'A New Australian Game for New and Old Australian People', sold for a sixpence, and included two bonus puzzles. Kate Naughtin, Education Project Officer at the National Archives of Australia told the ABC the game was 'very much to do with the White Australia Policy'. 'The aim of this game is to get them to change places, getting all the coloured men out and all the white men into Australia which very much was, I suppose, the attitude of the time,' she said. The Immigration Restriction Act introduced in 1901 aimed to stop non-European immigration to Australia . Some families such as the Gees, were exempt from taking the Dictation Test used to keep Australia European . The game is also a reflection of the attitudes at the time, with the policy introduced with the Federation of the states into the Australian nation in 1901. Legislation officially known as the Immigration Restriction Act was passed in 1901 which aimed to restrict non-white immigration to the country. This legislation required all non-European people to sit for a 'Dictation Test', which last until 1958. This required applicants to write out 50 words in any European language dictated to them by an officer. The White Australia policy was introduced because of concerns about non-European settlement when Chinese miners came New South Wales and Victoria for the Gold Rush in the 1850s and with the arrival of Pacific Islanders to work in Queensland's cane fields. The policy was reinforced in Second World War by Prime Minister John Curtin, but then progressively dismantled from 1949 until it was finally abolished in 1973. Travel, education or family were often reasons individuals could be exempt from taking the test . This cartoon from 1936 shows tests were determined by the officer so could be pitted against applicants to ensure failure . The National Archives of Australia described the Dictation Test: 'As the language used was at the discretion of the officer, it was easy to ensure failure if an applicant was thought to be 'undesirable', either because of their country of origin, criminal record, medical history or if they were considered morally unfit.' 'Despite the restrictive legislation, many non-European immigrants, including people from Asia, did enter or continue to reside in Australia during the period of the White Australia Policy.' Exemptions from the Dictation Test were non-European coming for a specific period to work, to visit family or for educational purposes. This is the Prohibited Immigrant identification document for James Francis Kitchen Minahan's,1908 .","The White Australia Game showed the extend of racism in Australia in the early 1900s .

"By . Freya Noble . An exhausted leopard seal in need of a good sleep was spotted seeking refuge from the serious swell battering the New South Wales coast on Monday. The young seal lay sprawled out in the sand on Avalon Beach on Sydney's northern beaches, looking somewhat sad as he struggled to get some shut eye. The cute creature was seen flopped on his front with his flippers by his side and tail straight out behind it, covered in sand with his eyes closed. Dozed off: The leopard seal took a nap on Avalon Beach on Sydney's northern beaches on Monday . In another shot the seal had opened his eyes slightly and rolled over on to his back, baring the lighter coloured fur on his belly. However authorities are very concerned for the welfare of the 'underweight' animal, who is originally from the Antarctic region south of Australia. 'He's a long way from home, we've had very very big seas over the last four to five days so the seals are getting bounced and pounded around in the waves,' Organisation for the Rescue and Research of Cetaceans in Australia (ORCCA) Vice President Shona Lorigan told the Daily Mail Australia. Exhausted: The animal was worn out from the big seas which have been beating off the NSW coast . Officers from ORRCA and the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service were at the beach keeping an eye on the seal, but he slipped back into the sea before a vet arrived to do an assessment. This time of year is the most common for seals to be sighted along the coast of NSW, but it is very rare to see leopard seals as their main habitat is in the Antarctic and sub-antarctic regions. 'We wish that the seal could have stayed a shore so we could have had a look at it,' Ms Lorigan said. ORRCA is hoping the animal will reappear along the coast in the morning so they can check on its health. Ms Lorigan also assured that the creature was not injured, but she is concerned about its survival as it is visibly underweight. Concerned: Wildlife authorities are worried about the sea leopard as he is visibly underweight .","A leopard seal was spotted sleeping on Sydney's northern beaches .

"By . Freya Noble . A Queensland father who was brutally bashed by four young adults after a night out at the pub has described his attackers as 'scum' and their punishment as 'a joke'. Jason Wivell was leaving a nightclub in his local area of Rockhampton, about 600 kilometres north of Brisbane, when a female approached him and punched him repetitively until he was sprawled on the ground. In the security footage of the incident, aired by A Current Affair on Tuesday evening, one of the women initiated the shocking assault before another female and two males joined in. Scroll down for video . Shocking security footage showed Queensland father Jason Wivell being brutally attacked by four people outside a Rockhampton nightclub . The father of two told the program he believes his assailants got off easy and only two of them served time behind bars . Jason was repeatedly bashed while on the ground, forced to use his arms to cover his head. He was kicked and punched more than 30 times during the vicious assault, even after he had lost consciousness. Surrounded by the gang, he was severely outnumbered and even when a fifth person appeared late in the footage, he did not assist the victim but rather watched on. Security from a nearby nightclub were forced to intervene, and even as they attempted to help the man one of the attackers took a final swing at Jason with one more kick to the head. 'It's ridiculous, I was laying there passed out and they're still going for it,' he told the program. The father of two suffered a broken arm and head injuries as a result. The violent assault saw him punch and kicked to the head and body while he lay helpless on the ground . Jason suffered head injuries and a broken arm from the bashing, which continued even after he was knocked unconscious . Detective Acting Inspector Paul Elliot from Queensland Police said the vicious attack was inexcusable. 'We say it all the time and it has been proven, one punch can kill.' Jason said he believes his attackers did not receive harsh enough punishments, as the two women did not even serve time behind bars. Jason revealed he is scarred from the violent bashing and now too frightened to walk the streets alone. 'Every now and again, you get little flashbacks of it,' he said. The group argued that they followed the Queensland man out of the bar after he inappropriately touched one of the females while inside the club, a claim which Jason denied. The assault continued until two members of security from a nearby nightclub intervened and contacted emergency services . The bashing was initiated by one female who claimed Jason had touched her inapptropriately . The four people were charged with assault occasioning bodily harm, and plead guilty. The two male assailants both spent time in jail, Anthony Reabel was sentenced to 12 months and released on parole after three, while Ricky Zizza was supposed to serve nine months but is set to be released in the coming days. Neither Tara Cable nor Natasha Hughes, one of whom initiated the brutal bashing, served any time and were both handed eight month sentences which were wholly suspended for two years. All four of the attackers were banned from any licensed premises for a year, and despite three of them being ordered to pay Jason $7000 in compensation he has not recieved any money.","Jason Wivell was brutally attacked by four young adults outside nightclub .

Clive Palmer allegedly shouted at a senate female staff member who was trying to help him, just hours before storming out of an interview with the ABC's 7.30 program last Thursday. The senate assistant clerk was reportedly helping the Palmer United Party leader redraft his carbon tax repeal amendments. Aiding all senators draft bills regardless of their political party, it's reported the MP questioned the impartiality of the office and yelled at the staff member, reported The Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . Clive Palmer reportedly yelled at senate assistant clerk on Thursday, just hours stormed out of an interview on the ABC's 730 program after host Sarah Ferguson quizzed him about an ongoing legal dispute . 'He was literally yelling at them,' a source said. 'He basically accused them of doing the government's bidding.' A source confirmed the incident had been formally raised with senate president Stephen Parry, who was unable to comment on the matter. 'As a rule I am not able to make any comment about matters that may or may not come before the president,' he said. The outburst happened just before Palmer controversially withdrew his support for repealing the carbon tax. Also last Thursday, Mr Palmer yanked out his earpiece and refused to answer further questions from host Sarah Ferguson during an interview on the ABC's 7.30. Palmer appeared via videolink from Queenstown, New Zealand, but when asked about an ongoing legal battle with Chinese company Citic Pacific, which is hinged on the financials of an iron ore project in WA, he refused to continue the interview. 'Don't talk to me about allegations and b******t,' Palmer said. Palmer appeared via videolink from Queenstown, New Zealand, but when asked about an ongoing legal battle with Chinese company Citic Pacific, he refused to continue the interview . Host Sarah Ferguson couldn't get a word in as Palmer spoke over the top of her before storming out . Mr Palmer was unfazed by earlier questions about his party's last-minute tactics in the upper house denying the government a day of celebration. But after flying out of Canberra for a holiday, Mr Palmer would not be denied his day. The mining magnate refused to be drawn on the court battle, saying there were no proceedings against him personally. 'I'm not answering any more, so goodbye ... see you later,' he said, snatching off his earpiece and walking out of the New Zealand studio. Earlier on Thursday the Abbott government's carbon tax repeal bills were defeated in the Senate, after Clive Palmer threw a last-minute curve-ball by voting against abolishing the carbon tax. The final vote count was 37 opposing the repeal and 35 supporting. Mr Palmer's decided to dump his support for abolishing the carbon tax after amendments he demanded, which would have seen all savings from abolishing the bill be handed back to consumers, were not included. After the farcical vote, the Abbott government announced they would support Mr Palmer's. Mr Palmer appeared via videolink from New Zealand (left), but left an empty room behind when he cut the talk short (right) last Thursday . Clive Palmer had no qualms throwing a last-minute curve-ball at the Abbott government by announcing his senators will delay a Senate vote on the carbon tax last week . 'There are no circumstances that we'd be voting today for the carbon tax repeal.' The abolishment of the carbon tax was one of the key policy planks of Tony Abbott when he was elected to government last year. One of the key changes is a penalty imposed on entities that do not pass on savings to gas and electricity customers. The penalty would be 250 per cent of the saving that has not been passed on. It also removes reference to 'domestic' electricity and gas customers, potentially leaving it open for companies to be penalised if they don't pass on savings to overseas customers. The definition of 'entity', which replaces 'corporation', is expanded to include individuals and 'any party or entity which can or does buy or sell electricity or gas'. Prime Minister Tony Abbott promised an immediate drop in power prices should the Senate scrap the carbon tax as expected prior to Mr Palmer's decision . The time in which entities have to give the consumer watchdog a notice they are complying with price cuts has been set at 30 days after the bill gains royal assent. Entities face a $34,000 fine if they don't comply - double the original fine. Mr Palmer said the amendments were lodged with the Senate Clerk's office at 8.30am last Thursday. 'We asked that it be distributed and we had a violent action from government, a violent reaction I would say,' Mr Palmer said. 'We had ministers calling us and visiting our senators and complaining.' Mr Palmer defended his party's move, arguing the changes ensure savings would be passed onto consumers. Mr Palmer claimed he had been on the receiving end of 'nasty conversations' with the government and other people. Prime Minister Tony Abbott promised an immediate drop in power prices should the Senate scrap the carbon tax as expected prior to Mr Palmer's decision. The carbon tax was a nine per cent impost on power bills, a $9 billion 'handbrake' on the economy, and a $550 annual hit for households, according to the PM. Former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett says Clive Palmer is a great blimp . Former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett says Clive Palmer is a great blimp that occasionally farts, causing damage to the country. He gave the unflattering assessment of Mr Palmer on Fairfax Radio when he asked to comment on the development that the Palmer United Party wouldn't vote to repeal the carbon tax last Thursday. 'He reminds me of a great blimp flying around this world of ours, this country of ours, and every now and then it lets off steam, or, to use a Clive Palmer expression, he just farts,' Mr Kennett said. 'That's all he does, he floats around, he causes trouble, there is no logic to what he is doing and it can be so damaging to this country.' Palmer has previously likened Australia's carbon tax to a 'fart tax' in place in New Zealand to curb methane gas emissions from the farming sector.","Clive Palmer allegedly shouted at a female staff member last Thursday .

A 28-year-old Melbourne man handed himself into police late on Thursday in relation to the assault of two schoolgirls on a packed tram in Melbourne's CBD last month. The man of Maidstone, north west of the CBD, was later charged with two counts of indecent assault, a Victorian Police spokeswoman said. He has been bailed to appear in Melbourne Magistrates Court on November 10. A man had been wanted for questioning after he allegedly assaulted two year 11 schoolgirls on the busy vehicle around 3.30pm on Friday June 20, according to Victorian Police. After the attack the 17-year-olds snapped photos of a man on their mobile phones and the same individual was also caught on CCTV footage. Detectives on Thursday released still images and CCTV footage of the man wanted over the assault, which occurred as the tram passed through the Domain Interchange on St Kilda road. Victoria Police previoulsy released a statement in their appeal for information about the incident.

Both girls left the tram immediately, and Detective Campbell said other schoolgirls on the tram were quick to act. 'We've met with the schools in the area to devise a plan, should this behaviour occur to the girls, on what action to take, and on this occasion they performed flawlessly and took some very good stills of the male which will allow us, hopefully, to identify him and speak to him about what occurred,' he said. The man left the train when it got to Flinders Street Station but his movements after that are unknown. The assault happened on a packed Melbourne train at the end of last month . Officers applauded the young girls for their quick thinking in snapping the shots . Detective Campbell told The Age the man’s conduct on the tram was 'no doubt concerning'.

"By . Freya Noble . A New Zealand man who died two days after falling from a ladder outside his home had his injuries 'seriously underestimated' according to an independent report into his death. Gary Wilmshurst died on his 62nd birthday on December 28 2011, after an accident on Boxing Day which left him with eight broken ribs, bleeding in his chest cavity and a collapsed lung. According to Stuff.co.nz, Mr Wilmshurst went to the Porirua Accident and Medical Centre, part of Kenepuru Hospital in Wellington, but was sent home with painkillers after being given a tetanus shot. Gary Wilmshurst had a fall from a ladder in 2011 from which he suffered serious injuries, but when he presented to his local medical centre was just sent home with painkillers . The grandfather was said to be in serious pain and had trouble sleeping for the next few nights, and his injuries did not get any better. Two days later he was at home with family celebrating his birthday when his breathing began to quicken and he turned pale. Family members gave the man CPR while paramedics were on the way but he died before they arrived. An independent doctor, Charles Freeman, who gave advice to the inquest into Mr Wilmshurst's death said the man's critical injuries were seriously underestimated and the broken ribs were identified as the cause of the internal bleeding and subsequent collapse of his lung. Dr Freeman insisted that Mr Wilmshurst's condition should have been more closely noted, and a chest x-ray should have been taken to assess any internal damage. In an inquest report released on Wednesday, Coroner Ian Smith said the medical centre's handling of the situation was partly to blame for Mr Wilmshurst's death. The 62-year-old was taken to Porirua Accident and Medical Centre, part of Kenepuru Hospital in Wellington after his accident . Coroner Smith revealed that the medical centre, which the 62-year-old was taken to in 'extreme pain' after his accident, was not equipped to deal with such a serious injury, as it had no emergency facilities. But, Mr Smith also noted the devastating outcome that misdiagnosing Mr Wilmshurst's injuries led to, especially since rib and chest injuries are known to be particularly detrimental to older patients. The injuries were sustained when the New Zealand man was on a step-ladder sanding his home in Purirua when he fell into a rocky part of his garden, reported the New Zealand Herald. The garden was tiered and it is possible he fell onto a garden statue which had sharp parts protruding. Mr Wilmshurst was said to be in extreme pain in the two days leading up to his death. The doctor who attended to Mr Wilmshurst, Dr Phillip Gartland told the coroner he did not x-ray the man's chest as he did not believe the simple x-ray facilities at the medical centre could have detected the damage. However, Dr Freeman disputed this, and said if an x-ray had been taken the extent of his injuries could have been identified and any complications could have been dealt with effectively.","Gary Wilmshurst fell from a ladder in the garden outside his home on Boxing Day 2011 .

"By . Freya Noble . A new study has revealed married men would much prefer to watch the FIFA World Cup final than have sex . Nearly three out of four married men would rather watch players getting hot and sweaty on the field at the FIFA World Cup final than get down and dirty with their significant others. A study released by dating website Ashley Madison surveyed more than 15,000 of their members and revealed that 72% of the married men would prefer sport to sex if the big game was on. Noel Biderman, CEO and Founder of AshleyMadison.com revealed the reason for the 'sport-related sexual drought'. 'These men are die-hard soccer fans who, for the past month, have devoted all of their spare time and emotional energy to supporting their favourite team. 'Believe it or not, the passion and excitement men feel for the game is often on par with that for their partner, however, in this case watching the game has taken priority over fulfilling sexual needs in their relationship,' he said in the study. But this comes at a price, as International Spokesperson for the website, Christoph Kraemer, told Daily Mail Australia that female sign-ups to the site soar during serious sporting competitions such as the World Cup. 'While the men are watching the game and neglecting their wives and girlfriends they take it as the perfect opportunity to sign up,' he said. The findings were released by dating site Ashley Madison who surveyed more than 15,000 of their members . In the study women ranked the most 'cheat-worthy' players, putting Gerard Pique (left) in the top spot with Christiano Ronald (right) also making the top five . Mr Kraemer also said that numbers of new female members to their dating website - which boasts the tagline 'Life is short. Have an affair' - in France and Germany climaxed at between 600 and 900 percent while their men were watching others play the field. 'Whenever there are major sport events, especially when they seem to be more male oriented, female sign-ups go up,' he revealed. Women, if they're not jumping onto dating websites while the football is on, are perving on the players while their partners are engrossed in the play. The site asked female members to rank the exceptional eye-candy, and the favourite was Spanish defender Gerard Pique, followed closely by Glen Johnson from England. More than half of Brazilian and Dutch male married members of the dating site said they would be keen to get intimate during the final as long as they could watch the game at the same time . Germany's Mats Hummels, Argentinian forward Ezequiel Lavezzi and Portuguese heartthrob Cristiano Ronaldo all made the top five. Despite the Socceroos being knocked out after just three games in the World Cup, increased numbers of Australian women were also said to be straying while the soccer was on. In a similar vein to the married males, just eight per cent of single men admitted they would be willing to miss the big game for some intimate time with a lover. Women ranked Glen Johnson from England (centre) as one of the most desirable players in the game . Meantime, sport is on the brain for a third of Germans and Argentineans, who admitted to thinking about soccer while between the sheets with their female 'wives or affair partners'. Taking it a step further, more than half of Brazilian and Dutch members are open to a bit of multi-tasking, keen to watch the game and score a goal of their own at the same time. And married men apparently have excuses to get out of sex while the final is on at the ready, with more than half of them worried they might miss a goal if they instead spend time with their missus.","A new study revealed that 72 percent of married men would watch the soccer over having sex .

She is a strapper for a horse racer in the Hunter Valley and is in charge of looking after the animals before they race . 'I shampoo the, wash them, trim their manes and tails, get them as presented as I can, keep them as calm as I can, and give them massages and keep them relaxed until they race,' she revealed. On the other side of her life, Ms Gillespie's modelling career features a lot of bridal work, which she hopes to move away from, but the way it all began was unexpected. 'I went to a photoshoot with one of my friends, and the photographer who shot that contacted me after and said I needed to do one too.' She often uses her own horses in photoshoots and has never had riding lessons . Bringing some of her 18 horses in some of the shoots was her own idea, and she said despite her love for both worlds she'll always be a country girl at heart. Ms Gillespie said she gets a lot of attention when she's down at the tracks, but it's not the ideal place to find a partner. 'Though I'll stop and have a chat to anyone,' she added. When asked if she would consider abandoning them for a modelling career, Ms Gillespie said the decision was too difficult to make. 'It would have to be amazing, or if I could do something like that part-time it would be ideal.' Her ambition lies in working as a brand ambassador for a big label, admitting that she's done enough bridal shoots, saying 'it's very weird for a single girl.' Ms Gillespie has a large portfolio of bridal modelling but hopes to move away from that .","Temika Gillespie splits her time between strapping racehorses and modelling .

"A crew member on a Carnival cruise ship has gone missing and there are concerns the individual may have fallen overboard. Despite initial reports that the missing member was Australian, Carnival Cruise Liners have not released the nationality of the person is, but said that he is not an Australian national. David Jones, spokesman for Carnival Crusies told the Daily Mail Australia 'We've expressed deep concern for the welfare of a crew member on Carnival spirit. The crew member didn't report to his normal work station this morning.' Desperate search: The Carnival Spirit has turned around to search for missing Australian crew member. 'That promoted an extensive search of the Carnival Spirit,' Mr Jones said, adding that the search did not locate the crew member. Earlier on Tuesday, it was decided that the Carnival would retrace her course in the hope of locating the crew member and search and rescue authorities in the area had been notified and were assisting. Mr Jone also said the 'ship will remain in the ship pattern until officially released by the search and rescue.' The 2500 passenger ship left Vanuatu yesterday on a 12-night Pacific Islands cruise and was scheduled for a sea day today between Vanuatu and Fiji. This comes just over 12 months since an Australian couple went missing while aboard the same ship. Kristen Schroder and Paul Rossington from Barraba near Tamworth jumped form the balcony of the cruise liner in May 2013. The young couple were found to missing when they didn't collect their luggage, and CCTV footage reportedly showing the pair going overboard on the morning of May 8.

"By . Freya Noble . Clive Palmer has made a strange accusation against ASIO, saying they have bugged his phone and computers . The colourful character that is Clive Palmer has made some interesting accusations against the Australian Security Intelligence Operation (ASIO), claiming all electronics in his office are bugged. Mr Palmer has refused to use the computer system in Parliament House, and declared 'all the phones and all the computers are tapped', the Herald Sun report. Despite these incredulous claims, ASIO have responded telling the publication they're not particularly interested in the Palmer United Party leader or any of his MPs. Palmer has reportedly paid for and installed brand new computers in his parliamentary office, to ensure his activity can't be monitored in any way. Furthermore, he's purchased new mobile phones instead of the tax-payer funded ones MPs are issued with, leaving it up to other members of his party to decide whether to follow suit. Australia's spy agency denied they have any need to investigate the party leader, despite his claims that historically the country's richest were under surveillance. They said they have no authority to monitor individuals simply based on financial status. Mr Palmer also warned naivety was dangerous in the digital age, and you can never be too careful especially when politicians are making important decisions on behalf of a nation. The billionaire has now replaced all the electronics in his parliamentary office, despite the fact ASIO deny the bizarre claims . These are not the first concerns the businessman has voiced about his personal security, with his first question to the Prime Minister during question time an enquiry about the bugging of politicians phones. He queried whether anyone was having their phones or emails intercepted, and whether the offices MPs work out of were bugged or monitored. In another unusual outburst, last September the billionaire accused Rupert Murdoch's ex-wife Wendi Deng of being 'a Chinese spy'. In an interview with the Today Show he shocked Karl Stefanovic who was conducting the interview by stating that she had been 'spying on Rupert for years, giving money back to Chinese Intelligence.' Palmer has made accusations of spying before, saying Rupert Murdoch's ex-wife Wendi Deng of being a Chinese spy .","The Palmer United Party leader claims ASIO has bugged his office .

"By . Freya Noble . Tom Bond was tragically killed at the weekend after running through the path of a moving train while high on cannabis . In a tragic first encounter with drugs, a young man has been killed after he ran into the path of a moving train. Tom Bond, from Ipswich in Queensland smoked marijuana in the early hours of Saturday morning, but is said to have had a severe reaction to the drug. He ran onto the train tracks at Bumdamba station and was killed instantly, The Sunday Telegraph reported. The young man's father Andrew told the publication he was left devastated over the tragic and unexpected loss of his 'best friend' and described his son as fun-loving and big-hearted. 'It's wrong that he's gone,' he said, . Tom completed his studies at St Edmund's College in Ipswich, and Andrew revealed Tom had only recently found his calling in life, helping others. The 20-year-old was working at Goodlife Gym assiting people on their journey to achieve their fitness goals, and was in the midst of planning a trip to Vanuatu for his 21st birthday later in the year. The young man's father revealed the devastation of losing not only his son but his 'best friend' The 20-year-old was hit by a moving train after he jumped a safety barrier at Bundamba station . He also had plans to travel the world with three of his closest friends. Tom's best mate Joel Carter also spoke to the newspaper, and he urged others to avoid peer pressure and stick with their closest friends and look out for each other. Joel said he didn't want anyone else to find themselves in a similar situation and hoped people would learn from the death of his closest friend, who he had known for 10 years. According to the Australian Drug Foundation, over 35 percent of Australians 14 years or older have used cannabis at least once in their life. In a report from the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at the University of New South Wales it states that no deaths have been recorded as a direct result of cannabis consumption. 'However, there is growing evidence that cannabis use has the potential to have adverse physical, psychological and social outcomes,' the study noted. The accident was caused after Tom smoked marijuana for the first time .","Tom Bond killed by a train when he ran onto the tracks on Saturday .

"By . Freya Noble . and Aap . An Australian woman who served eight months in an Indonesian jail for drug charges says she is happy to be free, but doesn't want to return Down Under. Julie Anne Joseph was arrested on the holiday island of Lombok last year after she was found with crystal meth, but is now upset she is being deported from the country she has made her home. Police assisted the 32-year-old after she was involved in a motorcycle accident, but grew suspicious of her behaviour. They found 1.72 grams of crystal meth when they searched her handbag. Julie Anne Joseph, pictured with Purniawal, head of security at Mataram Prison, was released from jail on Thursday but says she doesn't want to leave Indonesia . The woman was released from Mataram Prison on Thursday and although she covered her face with a scarf as she left the premises she couldn't hide her joy. The mother of two is now set to be deported back to Australia, after she was released into immigration custody where she will remain until she can present her passport. Joseph has two young kids back home in Australia, aged four and six . Joseph says she considers Bali her home, and regrets that she is banned from returning to Indonesia for six months, despite the fact she has a two children, aged four and six, back home in Australia. 'My home, my clothes, my pet dog are all in Bali,' she said. 'But because this is an Indonesian government regulation, I'll just follow it.' Her kids are said to have visited her in jail, along with some of her friends. Joseph said she hopes to return to Indonesia some day. During her trial Joseph apologised to the court and pleaded for a short sentence for the sake of her two young children. However prosecutors pushed for charges carrying a maximum sentence of four years, despite accepting that the meth was for the single mother's personal use. The former truck driver was sentenced to eight month and given credit for time she had already served before the trial. At her trial, the court heard Joseph was in 'a state of depression' when she accepted the small package of meth from a man she had just met in a bar in the tourist area of Senggigi. The head of prison security, Purniawal, told reporters that while in prison, she had mastered the Indonesian language, attended yoga classes and Christian religious instruction. 'We believe that she will continue behaving well and hopefully, her life will improve and we will never meet again in prison,' he said.

"By . Freya Noble . What started out as a man with a passion for photographing the sea, has now become the entire world for an early-rising and seriously skilled photographer from Bondi. In 1999 Eugene Tan begun to wake that little bit earlier before his commute into the city to his full-time design job, and took the time to capture the sunrise. Every morning since then Uge, as he's known to nearly 45,000 Aquabumps subscribers, has photographed the first light of the day over Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach. Aquabumps began more than 15 years ago, when Eugene Tan decided to photograph the sunrise over Bondi Beach every morning . Uge specialises in underwater photography, and what begun as a hobby has become his entire business . Another of his trademarks is aerial shots, sometimes taken from a remote operated helicopter . Aquabumps has taken Uge and his family around the world to shoot in Hawaii, Fiji, Indonesia and Italy . Since 1999 Uge has sent a daily email with shots of the sunrise over Bondi Beach to subscribers . 'I believe in the niche. My niche is underwater and aerial shots of Australian beaches, I started doing aerials about five years ago,' Uge told the Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm looking for interesting light, a lot of action, bright colours. Anything distinctive.' And distinctive is exactly what Uge's pics are, showing stunning serene waters in some images, while others showcase tumultuous swell and surfers taking on huge barrels and breaks. Most portray incredible light patterns, some are perfectly formed waves against a bright backdrop, while the underwater shots reveal the full power of the sea from a whole new perspective. Intricate and interesting light patterns are prevalent in many of the Aquabump photographs . Almost 45,000 people now subscribe to the emails, which arrive in inboxes around the world each weekday . Uge photographs all sorts of swimmers and surfers good and bad and tried to capture what happens down the beach in the early morning . Aerials are a big part of his portfolio, which he started shooting five years ago . Though the images usually feature bright colours, black and white photographs sometimes make an appearance . Before the immediacy of social media and the  infinite blogs which flood the online world, Uge was a pioneer of sorts, sending a daily email to friends and family featuring his favourite shot of the morning, giving people that little escape as they sat in their cubicles or at their desks. 'Basically I just emailed 20 friends, then 50, then 1000 and it just grew,' Uge told the Daily Mail Australia. 'In the 90s daily pictures of the beach weren't as prevalent.' Just one year after Google's inception, Uge turned his passion for photographing the ocean into Aquabumps, a website which now has fans and clients all around the world and a permanent art gallery in Bondi. 'We sell online. I can't remember anyone selling photography online when we started.' Crystal clear waters and perfectly formed waves make up much of the Aquabumps archives . The photographs often feature one or more subjects, and aren't exclusively of the sea itself . The crowded shores of Bondi are also a big feature in the Aquabumps images . Serene beach scenes perfectly composed and captured are another identifying factor in Uge's shots . The gallery is just back from Bondi Beach and Uge insists he wants people to feel comfortable and spend time in the place . He describes his site as somewhat 'under the radar' despite boasting 104,781 Facebook likes and a further 47,552 followers on Instagram. And that's in addition to the 44,125 website subscribers. 'The ultimate compliment for me is for someone to say ""I think that's one of Aquabumps' shots"", in a time when there's just a sea of photography and we're bombarded with mediocre pictures. There's a lot of noise.' Aquabumps has collaborated and partnered with some of the biggest brands in Australia and the world, including Speedo, Havaianas, Audi, Cannon and Corona just to name a few. One of his photographs was featured as a print on Havianas thongs last summer, and the shoe was the biggest selling design after plain black. 'Everyone was really surprised by how well that did,' Uge admitted. Still waters and spectacular sunrises are often seen in the daily Aquabumps emails . Skilled surfers are a favourite subject for Eugene to shoot, as he loves being out in the waves himself . The Bondi beach lover has only missed two morning shoots, the days his two sons were born . Aquabumps has collaborated with huge surf brands such as Speedo swimwear and Havianas thongs . The shots give a different perspective to the sea through Uge's lens . Despite this, the photographer maintains 'we're really fussy about who we do collaborations with, we get a lot of offers from huge brands.' He also urges that he wouldn't have enjoyed the same successes if he wasn't so devoted to the work. 'You just have to it with passion, I started something I was so passionate about, and did it for free in my spare time for the first five years. It's so important when you start with something you love.' Aquabumps takes the Tan family all around the world every single year, and Uge has surfed swells and photographed waves in Hawaii, Italy, the Mediterranean, Indonesia, and New Zealand. 'You name it, I've done it,' he said. 'Helicopters in the Kimberleys, over the Great Barrier Reef... We (along with his wife and two young boys) spend a month every year in Hawaii.' The images show the Australian beach culture quite literally in a unique light . Beaches in New Zealand, the Mediterranean  and America also make appearances in the collection . Uge and his wife Debbie recently travelled to London and New York to investigate the overseas market who are also purchasing the prints . Photographs with lots of action and movement in them are preferable for the photographer . The early morning shoots are a ritual for Uge, who says he feels like his routine is interrupted if he doesn't get out in the water . Uge said it's 'very rare' for him to ever miss a morning in the surf at Bondi, and described his early alarms as a 'ritual.' 'The days my sons were born I wasn't down... It has to be extreme circumstances.' On an overseas trip earlier this year Uge and wife Debbie spent time in New York and London, trying to scope out the market, as they ship prints to both cities every week. 'We were trying to figure out how people find out about us,' he said, and added that they have plans in the works to get some of the brand there, and looked at the possibility of adding galleries overseas. There is something distinctive about the style of the Aquabumps photographs . Swimmers of all sorts have made appearances in the stunning series of snapshots of the sea . Simplicity is sometimes king in the serene images . Light and colour plays a big role in the composition of Aquabumps photographs . The thing all the images have in common is Uge's clear passion for what he does and his love of the ocean . For now though, the home of Aquabumps is at a stunning location just back from Bondi Beach, and Uge said insisted 'it's not like a regular shop.' 'I want people to feel comfortable for a while, I want people to come for an hour or two. It's all free, you subscribe free.' Aquabumps' roots are firmly planted in the beachside community, and Uge credits that, in part, to its great success.","Eugene Tan (Uge) has been waking up early every day for the last 15 years to catch the sunrise over Bondi Beach .

"By . Stephanie Linning . and Freya Noble . Chilling leaked footage of South African paralympian Oscar Pistorius re-enacting the moment he shot and killed his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp was taken illegally, according to the athlete's lawyers. The harrowing video, which shows Pistorius as he runs towards the the camera with one arm outstretched as if holding a gun, was broadcast on the Sunday Night documentary slot of . Australia's Channel Seven. But a statement from Pistorius' lawyers Ramsay Webber said the 'visual mapping' re-enactment was only for trial preparation. They alleged the footage had been 'obtained  illegally' by Channel Seven. Scroll down for video . In the footage from Australia's Channel Seven, Pistorius is seen running awkwardly through a living room without his prosthetic legs. His right arm is stretched out in front of him, as if he was clutching a gun . Further into the video, he can be seen lifting a woman re-creating the moment he found Reeva shot . Pistorius, who remains emotionless throughout the footage, holds his hand out in front of him, in place of a gun . 'For the family, the airing of this footage constitutes a staggering breach of trust and an invasion of the family's privacy,' Brian Webber said in a statement, according to Reuters. They said no permission for the disclosure of the material had been given. One legal expert in Johannesburg, Professor Stephen Tuson of the Wits School of Law, told Reuters the screening of the re-enactment footage could be a breach of sub-judice laws that prohibit the publication outside the courtroom of evidence or material that could influence the outcome of the trial. ""If this was done in preparation for the trial in the context of attorney-client confidentiality, it would be privileged and its publication would be a breach of the sub-judice rule. Its consequences could be a reviewable irregularity,"" Tuson told Reuters. Sunday Night Executive Producer, Mark Llewellyn, said in a statement that the story 'was a significant investigation by Walkley Award-winning journalists'. 'We would not have run the footage if we thought we had obtained it illegally. The story was run in Australia only and not made available to any other territory,' Mr Llewellyn said. 'The material shown on Sunday Night goes to the heart of both the prosecution and defense cases, including the account provided by Oscar Pistorius.' Pistorius, who was born without a fibula bone in either leg and had his lower legs amputated before he could walk, is seen moving quite quickly and with a high level of agility for a man without the bottom half of his legs. Pistorius can be seen running towards and away from the camera and circling back around the living room of his home. As he re-enacts the scene he explains to investigators: 'I heard the noise and fired four shots.' Pistorius' lawyers alleged the usage of the video filmed by a U.S. company specialising in forensic animation, The Evidence Room, which had been engaged by Pistorius' defence team, also breached a non-disclosure agreement made with the Cleveland, Ohio company, Reuters reports. The footage is overlayed with a recording of Pistorious' voice, a recreation of the moment he claims he warned what he believed was an intruder in the bathroom. 'I'll call the police, get out, get out! Get the f*** out!,' he said. The paralympian can then be heard screaming and shouting hysterically after he opened the door to find his girlfriend dead on the bathroom floor. 'Please, God, please, please help. Help me. Help me!' In another scene the athlete can be seen on all fours, dragging a woman from a bathroom similar to the one in which he shot Miss Steenkamp. Later in the chilling footage, Pistorius is timed on how long it takes him to put his prosthetic legs on, just over 25 seconds. He then recreates the moment, slumping himself over the toilet with his legs splayed on the floor, he found his girlfriend 'bleeding to death' after he beat down the bathroom door with a cricket bat. Pistorius recreated the whole event in the chilling footage, including his movements from the bathroom to the bedroom . The footage also times how long Pistorius takes to put his prosthetic legs on . In another harrowing excerpt from the video, Pistorius shows how he found his girlfriend slumped over the toilet bleeding to death . Scott Roder, an American crime scene specialist, told Sunday Night that when he had his legs or blades on Pistorius was a confident man. However when he was without them he felt vulnerable. 'When he's on his stumps, he's short, the confidence washes away from his face,' Mr Roder said. The program reported that Mr Roder prepared a full analysis of the crime scene and supplied it to Pistorius' defence team. Earlier on Sunday a leaked promotional clip was released by Seven. This week a psychiatrist told the Pretoria court that Pistorius could not simply run away if he found himself in a vulnerable position. Even turning around is 'quite a process', he said. Oscar Pistorius maintains that he shot Reeva Steenkamp thinking she was an intruder . The video is reported to have been shot by an American company and Pistorius' lawyers are said to be livid at how the video was released. Pistorius' spokeswoman Anneliese Burgress has said the 27-year-old's legal advisors are seeking 'urgent clarification' from the broadcaster in relation to the footage. It was reported before the trial that an American firm called The Evidence Room was preparing an animated re-enactment of the events, but no mention was made of it in court. Pistorius, 27, . is accused of deliberately murdering Reeva Steenkamp. He shot her four times through a locked toilet door at his Pretoria home on Valentine’s Day last year. The . double amputee told the court he was convinced she was an intruder and that he fired his 9mm pistol accidentally out of fear and panic. He said he went to . investigate the noises coming from the cubicle before he fired. Pistorius' trial resumed last week after a lengthy adjournment so the paralympian could undergo intense psychiatric evaluation. The trial heard that Pistorius has a 'split personality' with a superstar . status in front of the cameras and a private life as a disabled man. His legal team said he was acting out of 'morbid fear not anger' when he shot dead his girlfriend. As . the Paralympic star’s lengthy trial finally draws to a close, his legal . team have presented Pistorius as a highly . vulnerable double amputee who battled great pain and genuine fears every . day of his life. The prosecution paint a picture of a volatile, gun-toting man. Reading . from a psychiatric report into Pistorius’ mindset, defence counsel . Kenny Oldwage told Pretoria’s High Court on Wednesday that the runner was 'the . international superstar more confident and in control' standing six feet . tall on his famous carbon blades. While he was 'a vulnerable and fearful . disabled person' barely five feet tall on his stumps. As the lengthy trial finally draws to a close, his legal team have been at pains to paint a picture of Pistorius as a highly vulnerable double amputee who battled great pain and genuine fears every day of his life . Pistorius, 27, is accused of deliberately murdering Reeva Steenkamp by shooting four bullets through a locked toilet door at his home in the South African capital on Valentine's Day last year . Professor . Wayne Derman, who specialises in treating disabled athletes, is the . final witness to appear in defence of the sprinter who. He said: 'Although he loathes to be pitied in any way, the . hard truth is that he does not have lower legs. You’ve got a paradox, . of an individual who is supremely able and an individual who is . significantly disabled.' Professor Derman will face a second day of gruelling cross-examination from prosecutor Gerrie Nel when the trial resumes on Monday. Pistorius, . whose carbon running prosthetics have earned him the nickname the . ‘Blade Runner’, denies murder and three firearms charges. Miss Steenkamp’s mother June, who has seen much of the trial at Pretoria High Court, hopes her daughter will rest in peace after the verdict. She said: 'I don’t hate Oscar, I’ve forgiven him. But I am determined to face him.'","Family lawyers believe the footage was taken without permission .

"By . Freya Noble . and Aap . Marine life in the Great Barrier Reef could be under threat if new plans to transfer coal between ships in the middle of the ocean go ahead. This process has never been undertaken in Australia, and environmentalists have concerns that ships could crash into each other spewing coal into the world heritage-listed waters. They also say activity could disturb sensitive eco-systems and upset fisheries and turtles. Mitchell Ports is the company which has applied to the federal Department of Environment, and are aiming to get permission to send barges into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Scroll down for video . The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park could be under threat if plans to transfer coal between ships in the area go ahead . Their subsidiary company, Hay Port Exports, have plans to expand their already existing terminal at Hay Point, south of Mackay in central Queensland. They have lodged an application to construct a new barging and trans-shipping terminal at the location, equipped to handle up to 15 million tonnes of coal per year. Instead of docking at a land-based port, ships would anchor offshore, above a sand bed, as cranes on a barge transfers coal from a smaller ship to a larger vessel. However Hay Port Exports has admitted in its Bowen Basin Terminal plan could affect endangered migratory species such as the irrawaddy and indo pacific humpback dolphins. 'Although it is likely to be minimal, the project could impact on listed, threatened and migratory species,' it said in its application. Mitchell Ports have applied to expand Hay Point Port, south of Mackay, so they can unload coal offshore . The Australian Marine Conservation society have great concerns for the transfer of coal between ships, as any accident could pose a threat to sea life. 'We could see boats crash into each other. We could see coal spewing into reef waters,' campaigner Felicity Wishart told AAP, adding light pollution and noise could affect spawning fisheries and turtles. 'We don't think a marine park is a place where you should be dredging, dumping or transferring coal from ship to ship. 'Mitchell Ports, however, argues its trans-shipping proposal minimised the need for sea bed dredging, which occurs when a land-based port is expanded.' Executive director of Mitchell Ports Ben King, who is heading up the Hay Port project agreed the proposal presented some risks, but said they would use European technology. Environmentalists are against the move saying any accidents could seriously upset sensitive eco-systems in the reef . 'There's always the potential for accidents and we have to make sure that ... our engineering comes up with a suitable risk profile where we have safeguards,' he told AAP. He added this type of trans-shipping was carried out in Italy and the Netherlands. Mitchell Ports has put forward a controversial proposal like this before - the Fitzroy Terminal near Rockhampton in central Queensland. The Fitzroy Terminal is also an expansion of a current port, Port Alma, claiming to export more than 25 million tonnes of coal per year.

"By . Emily Crane For Daily Mail Australia . Australia's Great Barrier Reef is at risk because authorities are failing to protect the marine park by approving the dumping of dredge spoil, a former government official says. Jon Day, who was a former director of Conservation Biodiversity and World Heritage at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, says the dumping of dredge spoil will put more pressure on a reef that is already in decline. The authority approved plans in January to dump three million cubic metres of dredge spoil at the Great Barrier Reef to expand Queensland's Abbot Point coal port. Scroll down for video . Australia's Great Barrier Reef is at risk because authorities are failing to protect the marine park by approving the dumping of dredge spoil from Abbot Point coal port, a former government official says . It's a decision that should not have been made, according to Mr Day, and is part of an ABC Four Corners investigation on Monday. Scientists and senior officials within the authority faced a tense year-long struggle against the proposal, with fears about the effect the spoil could have on the marine park. 'The big question is why was it allowed to be approved,' Four Corners reporter Marian Wilkinson told Daily Mail Australia. 'The official view from the Environment Minister (Greg Hunt) is that they've put tougher environmental conditions on so they believe it can be done safely. But there's a lot of questions among experts inside and outside the agency about it.' Jon Day, who was a former director of Conservation Biodiversity and World Heritage at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, told ABC reporter Marian Wilkinson the dumping of dredge spoil would put more pressure on a reef that is already in decline . Mr Day, who resigned from the authority last month, says alternatives to sea dumping for Abbot Point weren't properly considered. 'If we take that into account and if we did a proper evaluation of all the alternatives, that decision would not have been made,' he said. 'Our own legislative mandate says ""the long-term protection and conservation of the values"", and we're not doing that.' Wilkinson said the decision was criticised by UNESCO's World Heritage Committee, which will decide next year whether the reef should be declared 'in danger'. The authority approved plans in January to dump three million cubic metres of dredge spoil at the Great Barrier Reef to expand Queensland's Abbot Point coal port . Reporter Marian Wilkinson Wilkinson said the decision was criticised by UNESCO's World Heritage Committee, which will decide next year whether the reef should be declared 'in danger' 'The other options to look at were trying to find a place to dump on land and trying to do something to extend the port's trestles so that ships didn't have to come so close to the reef,' Wilkinson said. Mr Hunt, the federal environment minister who approved the dumping, told the program that Abbot Point was a 'line in the sand' and he has guaranteed that no further dumping will take place in the marine park under his watch. 'Of course, the argument from some of the scientists is why did we have to have this one in the first place?' Wilkinson said. The ABC's Four Corners is on Monday night at 8.30pm.

The O'Shea children - Saoirse, 9, Connor, 3, and Soren, 11 - were killed on impact when the car their mother was driving was hit in Denmark last year . Ms O'Shea, who works in Pemberton, Western Australia, as a doctor with her husband Brian, was initially charged with involuntary manslaughter a day after the accident as she recovered in hospital with their surviving son, four-month-old Torben. The O'Sheas started their own investigation to clear Maria's name and eventually had police prove that Burholt, a Danish father of three, had been speeding, Sunday Night reports. Police initially claimed the mother of four had turned into the path of Burholt's oncoming car. Lasse Burholt, 40, was travelling at 125km/h in an 80km zone when he hit Maria O'Shea's car on July 16 last year . The O'Sheas started their own investigation to clear Maria's name and eventually had police prove that Burholt, a Danish father of three, had been speeding . Mr O'Shea claims Burholt had been using his phone at time, which he says would explain why there were no brake marks on the road. Burholt has denied using his mobile phone and that his actions were reckless, but he did admit to speeding. '(Ms O'Shea) caused the accident,' he told the program. 'The fact is Maria made a turn that she wasn’t supposed to do.' 'You can’t tell if I hit her at 80 kilometres an hour you can’t say some kind of fatality wouldn’t have happened. If I had to spend all of my, all of my day thinking about what if what if and blah, blah, blah, then I don’t have time to think about all the other stuff. 'The O'Sheas need to go on with their life.' The O'Sheas have since created a charity in honour of their children (Saoirse, Soren, and Connor) titled The Three Musketeers . Burholt was eventually found guilty in October of a low range dangerous driving charge and involuntary manslaughter. He paid a fine of about $2,000 and maintained his license. The O'Sheas have since created a charity and memorial Facebook page in honour of their children titled The Three Musketeers. 'I used to fear death. I don't any more, now the kids have gone before us. It's as if they're saying: ""We've done it Dad, so you can do it too when the time comes for you"",' Mr O'Shea told the Independent. Nine-year-old Saoirse O'Shea was the only daughter of Maria and Brian, who lived in Pemberton in Western Australia . Maria O'Shea said her 11-year-old son Søren was a keen soccer player and would have been glued to the TV during the recent World Cup in Brazil . Connor O'Shea was just three-years-old when he died on impact on the Danish road . The O'Sheas said returning to their home in Australia after the crash was one of the biggest challenges they faced. 'I haven't been able to go into their bedrooms. I've looked into the boys' but haven't stepped into Saoirse's,' he said. 'Sometimes, when I'm on the computer working on their Facebook memorial page, I have to turn my eyes away from the photos. I can't bear to make a connection with them.'

Grahame Bell, 65, pleaded guilty on Thursday to defrauding the National Australia Bank when he dishonestly dealt with a cheque he received from the bank in April 2012.

Grahame Bell, 65, pleaded guilty on Thursday to defrauding the National Australia Bank when he dishonestly dealt with a cheque he received from the bank in April 2012 . He sent the cheque to NAB bank with a letter saying the money was for electrical works in a mining project, a South Australian court heard. While the money was initially cleared by the bank, an 'observant' staff member picked up the error and the cheque was revered just a few hours later. 'Whilst at first glance it may have appeared the intended offence was so fabulous it was doomed to failure, in fact, had it not been for the observant steps taken by the drawer of the original cheque for $20 the fraud may have been completed and you may have been able to access the funds in question,' Judge Rauf Soulio said. Bell got his hands on the cheque by deliberately overpaying an account set up in a fake name, before closing the account and altering the refund cheque to read $20 million . Cheque fraud was famously carried out by Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the 2002 film Catch Me If You Can . Bell was arrested at a bus station when police seized his suitcase in August 2012. He was found with a number of false cheques and false identities. Bell was sentenced to three years and six months jail.","Grahame Bell has pleaded guilty to defrauding the National Australia Bank .

"By . Emily Crane For Daily Mail Australia . The man who was stabbed to death in a public housing block in Sydney last weekend did not deserve to become a footnote in a celebrity story, a former friend says. Daniel McNulty, 48, died after he was allegedly stabbed multiple times over a $70 drug deal inside his ground-floor apartment at Redfern, just outside of Sydney's CBD, on Sunday. The drug-user and suspected part-time drug dealer had been living in the rundown area for the past two years as he tried to battle his heroin addiction. Scroll down for video . Daniel McNulty, 48, died after he was allegedly stabbed multiple times over a $70 drug deal inside his ground-floor apartment at Redfern, just outside of Sydney's CBD, on Sunday . Police will allege Mr McNulty was stabbed twice on Sunday night, once in the left knee and again fatally in his back . One of three people arrested this week over Mr McNulty's alleged murder was former NSW Premier Neville Wran's daughter, Harriet Wran. The heiress' addiction to ice and subsequent fall from grace has been well documented, prompting those who knew Mr McNulty to speak out to remember him. 'He did not deserve this. He was a person who had feelings. He had a daughter,' one friend, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'Daniel was a street kid who never had any tools to live life. He just could never get it right. He was clean for quite a number of years but, you know, it's an insidious disease that he had.' The drug-user and suspected part-time drug dealer had been living in the rundown area for the past two years as he tried to battle his heroin addiction . Prior to his ill-fated death, Mr McNulty was a well respected sound engineer working in Sydney's film and music industry. He had worked on a Tropfest-nominated film in 1998 and had music projects and SBS documentaries to add to his resume. Mr McNulty studied at the Australian Film Television and Radio School in Sydney, friends told the Daily Telegraph. 'We all had good, budding careers back in the early 90s and it was a fun industry, we were a family,' film producer Gavin Barbey said. One of three people arrested this week over Mr McNulty's alleged murder was former NSW Premier Neville Wran's daughter, Harriet Wran . 'There are a lot of people who fall off the wagon but Dan was a nice guy. He was well-respected.' The 48-year-old dabbled with drug use as a young man, but had been clean for about 20 years while he worked on his film career. He moved to Bryon Bay for 10 years to work as a fisherman, before returning to Sydney a few years ago to try and curb his heroin addiction. Jim Hearne, a friend of Mr McNulty's for 20 years, said he was shocked to hear of his violent death. 'I bumped into him a few months ago at a festival on Oxford Street and he didn't look good to be frank,' he told the Daily Telegraph. Three people stand accused of Mr McNulty's murder - Harriet Wran, 26, Lloyd Haines, 29, and Michael Lee, 35 . A second man, Brett Fitzgerald, 42, was stabbed several times in the attack and remains in a stable condition at St Vincent's Hospital . 'But he was as charming as ever.' Mr McNulty was due in court later this year to face charges of possession of stolen goods and larceny. 'He was a cheeky bugger but he didn't have a history of violence,' Mr Hearne said. The keen fisherman had a nine-year-old daughter but had separated from his partner before he died.

The number of Australians heading to the UK for work has dropped about 50 percent in the past two years following the policy changes. The migration restrictions were introduced because the number of EU citizens working in the UK can't be stopped, so no more than 20,000 skilled workers from elsewhere in the world can take up residency.

"By . Emily Crane For Daily Mail Australia . When she looks back at photos of herself dressed up in costumes and cutting birthday cakes, Jessica Masuglia admits she had a 'pretty happy' childhood. But under the surface it was a little more complicated. The 24-year-old from Melbourne was raised by her heroin-addicted mother. Her mum, Kim Mackenzie, died from an overdose a few years ago when she was just 43. Sadly, it was a week after her daughter's 21st birthday.

She was very hands on and she would do anything to make me happy.' Her mother was in and out of sobriety for most of Ms Masuglia's life. While she knew her mum was different to others, Ms Masuglia was oblivious to the heroin abuse until she was older. 'For a lot of my young she was straight. She would fall into periods of a few weeks where she'd use. Then she would stop. Six months later she'd start again,' she said. 'She was two different people. 'She overdosed once and had to be brought back to life. I didn't see any of that. I never witnessed her taking drugs, I think she was trying to protect me.' Ms Masuglia said her relationship with her mum only became strained when she was a teenager and she developed drug psychosis because of her addiction, which by then included alcoholism. 'It was really hard. She had mood swings and she'd snap at me. It really hurt to see her this addiction and us arguing all the time,' she said.

"By . Emily Crane For Daily Mail Australia . and Ap . US Secretary of State John Kerry has condemned a photo taken of a Sydney-born boy clutching the severed head of a Syrian solider calling it 'disturbing' and 'grotesque'. Australian terrorist and Islamic State fighter, Khaled Sharrouf, posted the photo to Twitter of his son, believed to be aged seven, gripping the head in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa and has since been the subject of widespread condemnation. Mr Kerry, who was speaking after a US-Australia security summit in Sydney, said the image showed why the Islamic State group posed such a threat to the world and has called for international cooperation against the terrorist threat posed by fighters returning home from Iraq and Syria. Scroll down for video . Australian terrorist and Islamic State fighter, Khaled Sharrouf, posted the photo to Twitter of his son, believed to be aged seven, gripping the head in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa . 'This image, perhaps even an iconic photograph... is really one of the most disturbing, stomach-turning, grotesque photographs ever displayed,' Mr Kerry told reporters. 'Of a 7-year-old child holding a severed head up with pride and with the support and encouragement of a parent, with brothers there.' 'That child should be in school, that child should be out learning about a future, that child should be playing with other kids - not holding a severed head and out in the field of combat.' Sharrouf, 33, also posted a photograph of his three sons posing with him in matching camouflage fatigues and armed with assault rifles and a pistol with an Islamic State flag as their backdrop. US Secretary of State John Kerry has condemned the photo of the Sydney-born 7-year-old calling it 'disturbing' and 'grotesque' Sharrouf (right) posted photos of himself and a boy he claimed was his son holding a decapitated head . Mr Kerry proposed that the US and Australia take the issue of foreign fighters to the United Nations next month so that countries could agree on ways to protect themselves from the threat posed by terrorists returning from Syria and Iraq. 'We are going to work together to assemble a compendium of the best practices in the world today,' he said, calling for support from both the countries where terrorism occurs and those to where the terrorists travel. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop described the severed head photograph as 'truly shocking'. 'A 7-year-old child is involved in this barbarous display of ideology and they're Australian citizens,' she said. Sharrouf, 33, also posted a photograph of his three sons posing with him in matching camouflage fatigues and armed with assault rifles and a pistol with an Islamic State flag as their backdrop . 'Our fear is that they will return home to Australia as hardened, homegrown terrorists and seek to continue their work in Australia - and it's not a concern just of this country.' Ms Bishop noted that 'a significant number' of convicted terrorists would soon be released from Indonesian prisons, raising fears in that country that they will remain radicals. 'It's a shared issue across Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Europe, in Pakistan, in Great Britain, Canada - there are a number of countries across the globe reporting instances of citizens becoming extremist fighters in the Middle East,' Ms Bishop said. Australia last week announced plans to regulate travel to terrorist hotbeds such as Iraq and Syria as part of a raft of counter-terrorism measures aimed at addressing the domestic threat posed by Islamic extremists. Sharrouf used his brother's passport to leave Australia last year. The Australian government had banned him from leaving the country because of the terrorism threat he posed . Sharrouf, who also posted this photo of a boy wielding a gun, has a warrant out for his arrest by Australian authorities . Under legislation to be introduced to Parliament in the next few weeks, it would become a criminal offense to travel to designated countries 'without a valid reason'. The Australian government estimated in June that 150 Australians have fought with radical militants in Syria and Iraq. The domestic terrorism threat posed by homegrown jihadists was a focus of annual bilateral talks on Tuesday between Ms Bishop, Mr Kerry, US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and his Australian counterpart, David Johnston.

Mr Kerry, who was speaking after a US-Australia security summit in Sydney with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, said the image showed why the Islamic State group posed such a threat to the world . He was among nine Muslim men accused in 2007 of stockpiling bomb-making materials and plotting terrorist attacks in Sydney and Melbourne. He pleaded guilty to terrorism offenses and was sentenced in 2009 to four years in prison. Australian police announced last month that they had arrest warrants for Sharrouf and his companion Mohamed Elomar, another former Sydney resident, for 'terrorism-related activity'. They will be arrested if they return to Australia. The warrants followed photographs being posted on Sharrouf's Twitter account showing Elomar smiling and holding the severed heads of two Syrian soldiers.","Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf posted a photo of his son gripping the decapitated head of a Syrian soldier to Twitter .

A woman arranged for her ex-partner to be kidnapped and killed and then had sex with one of the hitmen shortly after they dumped his body in remote bushland, a court has heard. Robyn Jane Lindholm, 41, is charged with the murder of Melbourne gym owner Wayne Amey, whose body was found wedged between boulders at Mt Korong in central Victoria last December.

Robyn Lindholm denies murdering her ex-partner Wayne Amey, with whom she was having a property dispute . Wayne Amey's body (left) was found dumped in bushland, allegedly after Lindholm (right) organised his murder . Chief Crown Prosecutor Galvin Silbert told Melbourne Magistrates Court on Monday that Lindholm had engaged two men - Torsten Trabet, 45, and John Anthony Ryan, 37 - to kill Mr Amey. Two other men had repeatedly declined her requests. Mr Silbert said one of the men who refused to take part had warned Mr Amey, who subsequently went to police in August 2013 and told them of Lindholm's intent to harm him. Mr Amey was ambushed in the car park of his apartment block, where he was bashed with a baseball bat, tasered and thrown into a car boot and driven off, according to Mr Silbert. He told the court Mr Amey could be heard pleading for his life before he was stabbed a number of times and strangled.

Lindholm and Trabert then went to a secluded spot in nearby Kyneton where they had sex, before they returned to Melbourne. The court heard Mr Amey suffered stab wounds, fractured ribs and neck injuries and was wrapped in a canvas sheet with rope around his neck and his lower legs hog tied. Lindholm, Trabert and Ryan all deny murder. Lindholm and Trabert are also contesting charges of intentionally causing serious injury and assisting an offender. The committal hearing continues.

Russia have introduced trade sanctions on Australia which will block hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Aussie imports each year - but they will continue to import our wine. Russia has banned agricultural products from Australia and other western countries after they imposed their own sanctions against Moscow over its policy in Ukraine following the MH17 disaster. The retaliatory ban covers all imports of meat, fish, milk and milk products and fruit and vegetables. But bizarrely, President Putin has approved the importation of Australian wine. In 2013, Russia consumed $4.7 million worth of Aussie alcoholic beverages. Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, will continue to import Australian wines despite introducing harsh sanctions that ban the importation of most products from the Western world . Russia consumed $4.7 million worth of Australian alcoholic beverages in 2013 .

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has confirmed that Australia are working towards harsher sanctions, now that Australian personnel are returning to the Netherlands. Prime Minister Abbott was reluctant to strengthen sanctions against Russia whilst personnel on the ground were only 'within 20 or 30km from the Russian border.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says it's disappointing that Russia has retaliated rather than adhere to international concern . Russian President Vladimir Putin has introduced the sanctions in protest of the harsh sanctions Russians are facing as a result of their involvement in the Ukraine conflict. Russia's sweeping move will cost western farmers billions of dollars but could also lead to empty supermarket shelves in Russian cities. 'Of course this is a serious decision for the suppliers of such foods from these countries,' Mr Medvedev said. The ban will not cover baby food and people will still be able to buy the banned products abroad if they want, but Mr Medvedev warned those who tried to profit from reselling them would be 'harshly punished'. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday the 'full embargo' would come into effect immediately and last for one year . Experts said that local producers would find it hard to fill the gap left by the ban, as the nation's agricultural sector had continued to suffer from poor efficiency and shortage of funds. The damage to consumers inflicted by the ban would be felt particularly hard in big cities like Moscow, where imported food filled an estimated 60-70 percent of the market. Mr Medvedev said Russia could go further and ban western carriers from flying over Russia on flights to and from Asia - a move that would significantly swell costs and increase flight time. He said there has been no decision on that yet, and wouldn't specify when and under what conditions the move could be taken. The retaliatory ban covers all imports of meat, fish, milk and milk products and fruit and vegetables from Australia, the United States, the European Union, Canada and Norway . Experts said that local producers would find it hard to fill the gap left by the ban, as the nation's agricultural sector had continued to suffer from poor efficiency and shortage of funds . He made it clear that Russia hoped the sanctions would make the west revise its policy and stop trying to pressure Russia with sanctions. 'We hope our partners will put a pragmatic economic approach above bad policy considerations, and they will start thinking instead of trying to scare us,' he said. The decision shows that President Vladimir Putin has no intention of bowing to western pressure over Ukraine and will instead try to strike back at the west. The U.S. and the EU have accused Russia, which annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in March, of fomenting tensions in eastern Ukraine by supplying arms and expertise to a pro-Moscow insurgency, and have imposed asset freezes and loan bans on a score of individuals and companies.

"By . Emily Crane For Daily Mail Australia . A secret Catholic Church report found an Australian parish priest had been internally investigated and found guilty of child sex abuse, despite no criminal charges ever being laid against him. A report into a confidential investigation into Father Peter Searson of the Doveton parish, south east of Melbourne, in 1997 found he was guilty of the offences, ABC's Four Corners reports. While Cardinal George Pell rejected a church cover-up of Father Searson's crimes when he gave evidence at last year's Victorian inquiry into child sex abuse, he did not make reference to the internal 1997 investigation or the finding that he had sexually abused children in his parish. Scroll down for video . A report into a confidential investigation into Father Peter Searson of the Doveton parish, south east of Melbourne, in 1997 found he was guilty of child sex abuse offences . The revelation the church knew about Father Searson's abuse was found in a report by the Independent Commissioner into Sexual Abuse, Peter O'Callaghan. He was appointed in 1997 by Cardinal Pell, who was Archbishop of Melbourne at the time, to look at allegations from teachers and parents regarding Father Searson. Mr O'Callaghan's report revealed Father Searson had a track record of suspected sexual abuse even before he joined the Victorian parish in 1984. It also detailed a number of complaints against the priest made to the Catholic Education Office by people at the Holy Family School in Doveton during the 13 years he was there. When Father Searson died in 2009, 15 priests and a Bishop from the Melbourne Archdiocese gathered to pay their respects despite his behaviour with children . But the Melbourne Archdiocese never released these findings. Former school principal Graeme Sleeman said he lost his career fighting the church to deal with Father Searson and claims the actions of the church went well beyond 'maladministration'. 'You could almost call it a fetish that he had about having children go to confession to him and they'd have to sit by him and kneel at him,' Mr Sleeman told Four Corners. 'They were the complaints that children brought to me about him and his behaviour... (one) particular day he had confession and this young girl came screaming out of the church and she was brought to me by her teacher and she was inconsolable. She had been interfered with by Searson in the confessional.' Chrissie and Andrew Foster, whose two daughters were repeatedly raped by a priest in Oakleigh near Melbourne in the late '80s, successfully sued the Catholic Church for damage caused to their children . Cardinal George Pell, who was Archbishop of Melbourne at the time, poses with Katie Foster at her confirmation in September 1985. Katie was repeatedly raped by her priest Father Kevin O'Donnell in Oakley near Melbourne . Mr Sleeman resigned in 1986 to draw attention to what was happening but he said his letter of resignation was censored by a church official in the Catholic Education Office. 'I alleged that he had interfered with young girls at the school, and he had stolen money and that he terrorised young boys... he said I could not say that. I didn’t have the proof,' he said. Carmel Rafferty arrived at the school as a teacher a year after Mr Sleeman left. She immediately became concerned about the actions of the parish priest. '(The children) wanted protection from the priest…and I said what is your concern? ""We don’t want to serve on the altar"". So I asked them why they didn’t... and they said ""it’s because of the way he touches us"",' she said. 'It came to a head when the priest was going into the boys’ toilets several times a day and we more or less said that’s it, and the principal authorised the three year five-six teachers to go in a deputation to Pell at the time.' Katie and Emma Foster were both sexually assaulted by Father O'Donnell Sacred Heart Church. Their parents say the actions of priests have lasting consequences on families, even though the church doesn't recognise it . Father Searson was eventually placed on administrative leave but he wasn't sacked by the church when the assault charges were laid. Mr O'Callaghan’s report showed the priest had 'successfully appealed to the Congregation in Rome, which held that the Commission did not have appropriate jurisdiction or procedure to make the findings'. Father Searson died in 2009. He was the last of four priests who sexually abused children at Doveton Parish 25 years from 1972 to 1997. The other offending priests were Father Thomas O’Keeffe, Father Wilfred Baker and Father Victor Rubeo. Cardinal Pell blessed Emma Foster at her confirmation in 1993. Ms Foster took her own life in 2008 .

In 1999 Katie Foster, who had been drinking, was hit by a car, and remains profoundly disabled. In 2008 Emma Foster took her own life. When Father Searson died, the Fosters were on hand to take photos as 15 priests and a Bishop from the Melbourne Archdiocese gathered to pay their respects, despite his actions. 'The Royal Commission here, to do its job properly, needs all the documents associated with all the sexual assault complaints and all the priests that have carried those out in Australia,' Mr Foster said. 'And of course, the Catholic Church does not want us to see the whole picture, that's the whole problem.","A confidential church investigation in 1997 found a Victorian Catholic priest had sexually abused young children .

Five of those bites were considered minor, seven were major and none was fatal. The last fatal alligator bite in Florida occurred in 2007, when Justo Antonio Padron was drowned by a gator in a pond at the Miccosukee Indian Reservation in South Florida.

A South Carolina doctor has been arrested Wednesday on charges of animal cruelty after he left nine dogs to die in the back of his car while he went to work. Charles Allen Bickerstaff, 64, of Catbird Retreat on James Island near Charleston faces nine felony counts of ill treatment of animals. The animals all died earlier this week in the back of his car which were left in five crates without food and water for three hours. The temperature in the car reached close to 90 degrees. Cavaliers have long hair and can weigh up to 20 pounds. His attorney, Bill Thrower, said . during the bail proceeding that Bickerstaff had an emergency at the . hospital and had thought that the dogs would be safe in his Ford . Explorer. Bickerstaff said he 'feels as bad as anybody' about the death of his dogs, his attorney added.

"By . James Gordon . Google is being criticized after allowing users of its Android cellphone to download a game called Bomb Gaza. The sickening title sees players earning points by 'dropping bombs and avoid killing citizens'. The app, which has been available since the last week of July has been downloaded at least 1,000 times with a few people flagging the game as 'inappropriate.' As of last night, the game does not appear to be any longer available on Google Play. Bomb Gaza: The game was developed for Android phones and was downloaded roughly 1,000 times before it was withdrawn following complaints . Withdrawn: An extremely insensitive app has landed the Google Play store at the center of a controversy over what it allows to be sold . The game is described as via a series of screenshots. Users score points by controlling aircraft marked with Israeli flags as they drop bombs on cartoon Hamas militants. So far, Google Play has not commented on the outrage, though a current search through the store reveals that it seems to have disappeared from the catalog. Google Play is notoriously more tolerant than Apple in what it allows developers to sell in its store, however Google’s Developer Program Policies document, it notes under a subsection titled Violence and Bullying that 'Depictions of gratuitous violence are not allowed,' and that 'Apps should not contain materials that threaten, harass or bully other users.' Under another titled Hate Speech, Google writes 'We don’t allow content advocating against groups of people based on their race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender identity.' The aim of the game is to 'drop bombs and avoid killing civilians'. It shows a plan continuously flying over a cartoon version of Gaza, while trying to avoid rockets . The policy guidelines show that though the store doesn't allow spam or 'most nudity,' it doesn't have any explicitly stated rules on offensive content or violence. 'Bomb Gaza' is not the only app that deals with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. There are a number of other that follow a similar theme which are still available in the app store including Iron Dome, a missile-defense game, and Gaza Hero, which tells users it is a charity game for Gaza that encourages users to donate money. The game’s dismissal comes just as Israel says it’s pulling out of Gaza in observance of a three-day ceasefire, on the heels of a month-long fight that has to date left nearly 1,900 Palestinians and 67 Israelis dead. Comments in the game's review section expressed anger and bewilderment that real human suffering could be made into a game. 'Utterly shameful. Real people, many of them children, are dying in Gaza. Many of those who haven’t been killed face life with debilitating injuries, bereavement and without homes. Their suffering is as real as yours or mine, and to make light of it like this speaks of your essential failure as a human. Shame on the creators of this game, and those who ‘play’ it,' read one comment by user George Coote. Another comment on the Facebook page read: 'This is sick. You should be ashamed to have created such an app. Do you really think it's a game?' The app's withdrawal comes just as the latest ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect.","Customers angry at Android game on Google Play in which players pretend to be the Israeli military bombing Gaza .

"By . A. Greg . and James Gordon . The State Department has now launched an investigation after one of CNN's foreign ​correspondents ​allegedly bit two medical workers​ ​during a drunken fit at the US Embassy​ in Baghdad​. Senior international correspondent A​rwa Damon was said to be drunk and abusive to medics stationed on the grounds of the embassy. Tracy Lamar and Charles Simons, EMTs . working for a private contractor in Iraq, say Damon chomped into each of . their left arms as they tried to help her. More than she could chew: Arwa Davis, a respected journalist who covers the Middle East for CNN, allegedly bit two EMTs in a drunken rage . Top reporter: Arwa Damon speaks four languages and was recently awarded the Courage in Journalism Award by the International Women's Media Foundation . It's alleged she bit both EMTs on their forearms as they tried to treat her on July 19. The medics were called to calm the correspondent after she became 'totally out of control.' Gossip . and rumor column Page Six says the State Department prepared a report . on the incident, which was sent to CNN however Damon continued working . for the network regardless. She . then penned a groveling apology to US Embassy staff about her . 'disastrous behavior,' which she claims she doesn’t fully remember. She . said in an e-mail: 'It’s been an extremely stressful time, I was . exhausted, I had not had proper food all day and clearly miscalculated . how my body would handle the alcohol consumed … Needless to say, I am . utterly mortified and take full responsibility for my actions, which are . inexcusable.' She . added, 'I am being filled in on the details of my behavior. I am beyond . embarrassed. My actions and words were entirely out of my character, . and I hope that everyone can at some point forgive me.' 'So . once again, I am apologizing and extending my thanks to all that were . involved in ensuring that I am, thankfully, in the end, taken care of . and physically at least OK. Everyone was extremely professional and . courteous in the face of my unjustified behavior,' she continued. The suit claims that CNN was aware Damon had a history of drunken aggression, and was even known to be violent when sober . It's now believed a $2 million lawsuit​ has been filed against Damon and CNN in Manhattan​. According . to the New York Post, the papers say Damon, 36, bit EMT​​s Tracy Lamar . and Charles Simons as they tried to help her, before threatening them . and saying she was a 'major reporter for CNN,' but when this . failed she became physically violent.' She . was biting them both pretty furiously. She has good teeth. Eventually . they subdued her,' David Jaroslawicz, an attorney for Simons and Lamar said. The . suit claims CNN hired Damon knowing she 'has a history of becoming . intoxicated and then abusive,' and a 'penchant for violence even when . sober.' CNN are still denying all knowledge of the lawsuit and are refusing to comment on the case. The . EMTs’ lawyer, David Jaroslawicz, added, 'To get so very drunk and . attack people who are trying to help you is somewhat disturbing, . particularly as a reporter.' Damon's biography on CNN states that she's an award-winning journalist whose recent focus has been on the situation in Syria. She . won an Emmy for Outstanding Live Coverage of a Current News Story for . her reporting on the Arab Spring, as well as a Peabody Award. Recently, she was given the Courage in Journalism Award by the International Women's Media Foundation. She is from Boston but spent much of her childhood in Morocco and Turkey.","Arwa Damon, a CNN foreign correspondent, allegedly drunkenly bit two EMT workers in Baghdad .

"By . James Gordon . For a couple from Iowa, exit 52 on Interstate 35 will always be special after giving birth to a baby daughter at the roadside. Jessica and her husband Paul from Osceola, near Des Moines, were on their way to the hospital to allow Jess to give birth when all of a sudden she started having contractions. 'I had one at eight minutes and that one hurt and I said let`s go and we called his mom and got in the car.  By the time we made it to the interstate they were within three minutes,' said Jessica to WHO-TV. Teamwork: Jessica and her husband Paul were en route to the hospital overnight to deliver their baby when things took an unexpected turn . Coming - ready or not! It doesn't quite have the same facilities as Mercy Medical Center, but it's where their child was born . It was to be the couples' third child so both of them knew what to expect - the problem was, they were 30 miles away from the nearest hospital. 'I had another contraction and I said ‘her heads out, we`re not going to make it there,’' said Jessica. Her husband called  911 and pulled over on exit 52 in Saint Charles, just south of Des Moines. The operator ended up telling him to deliver his own child while telling his wife to remain calm. Welcome to the world! Gracie Lee was born just after midnight, weighing 7 pounds 3 ounces.  She was named after her unique arrival . Relaxed: The couple are able to smile and laugh about it now, but their daughter came when they least expected her to . He ran around to her side of the car and got into the back seat in order to deliver the child. 'She told us step by step what to do and I just followed her lead,' said Paul. 'He came running around and he said you`re going to have to push for me so I pushed once and there she was,' said Jessica. Paul performed the delivery superbly and even had to deal with the umbilical cord being wrapped around the baby's neck. Exit 52: It means so many things, to many people, especially those living in St Marys or St Charles . Race: The couple still had 30 miles to drive to reach Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines when Jessica¿s water broke . She also had trouble breathing so he had to rub her on her back in order to make her cry. Little Gracie Lee was born just after midnight, weighing 7 pounds 3 ounces.  She was named after her unique arrival. 'We decided that just by the Grace of God she was safe and healthy so thought it was kind of fitting,' said Jessica. Unusual: It's not your usual delivery room . Unaware: Both mother and baby are doing well and dad says he¿ll never look at exit 52 the same again . Recalling: Paul says there were some anxious moments when little Gracie wasn't breathing and the umblicial cord was wrapped around her neck .","Jess and Paul from Iowa were heading to hospital to give birth .

"By . James Gordon . Eight people had to be rescued by the U.S. Coastguard in Hawaii after the boat they were on sank. Four adults and four children traveling to Molokai from Oahu on Sunday afternoon were forced to abandon ship when boat they were in sank in the Kaiwi Channel. 'We knew it was going to go down so we just started getting anything that we really needed like life jackets and I put my fins on and we all jumped in the water and the boat went over,' said Jeff Kozlovich. The group left Sandy Beach Park around 1:30 p.m. and brought along three kayaks and the plan was to kayak back to Oahu on Monday. The Coast Guard says eight people were rescued in Hawaii waters after their vessel sank . Nno injuries were reported among those rescued. The group was able to tie three kayaks together and cling to them before rescuers arrived Sunday . Those on board the 21-foot recreational vessel were wearing lifejackets at the time of the sinking in Kaiwi Channel . Sea rescue: Four adults and four children traveling to Molokai from Oahu Sunday afternoon were forced to abandon ship when boat they were in sank in the Kaiwi Channel . The boaters were rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter crew. A boat crew also was dispatched to the scene . They were 12 miles west of Molokai when their 21-foot vessel got hit by rough waters. 'Eventually it got scary rough real fast where waves were breaking over the bow and it happened really quick. Before we knew it, too much water was in the boat and we really couldn't steer well or maneuver,' Kozlovich said. Just before the boat sunk, the crew used their cell phones to call 911. Although they managed to get through, the Coast Guard says it was a special tracking device called a 'EPIRB' that helped save the day. The Joint Rescue Coordination Center in Honolulu received a signal that people could be in trouble about 12 miles West of Molokai . Jeff Kozlovich made a call saying his son and seven others were in distress in the area of the signal . The group left Sandy Beach Park around 1:30 p.m. They brought along three kayaks and the plan was to kayak back to Oahu on Monday . They were 12 miles west of Molokai when their 21-foot vessel got hit by rough waters. The U.S. Coastguard manage to locate the group thanks to signals from their cellphones . EPIRB is an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon and is a safety device used to alert search and rescue services. 'It could have been bad...you have to have a lot of respect for that ocean and the wind and conditions out there can change very quickly,' said Kozlovich. The Coast Guard advises not to rely on cell phones in the middle of the ocean. They say it's important to have the appropriate safety equipment. All eight people were wearing their life jackets. No injuries were reported. Although their cell reception worked, the United States Coast Guard says it was a special tracking device called a EPIRB - Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon - that was the hero of the day . Right before the boat sunk, the experienced waterman crew untied the kayaks from the boat then tied them all together and used their cell phones to call 911 .

"By . James Gordon . They may have been searching in a galaxy far far away, but more pressing concerns here on Earth saw America's search for life on other planets grind to a halt earlier this week. Wildfires raging in Northern California briefly halted the search for extraterrestrial life on Tuesday. The Eiler Fire, burning some 200 miles north of Sacramento, forced employees at the SETI Institute's Allen Telescope Array to evacuate and temporarily shut down all of their computers, Internet and power. Life, but not as we know it: A wildfire that has consumed more than 31,000 acres in northern California forced the temporary evacuation of a telescope facility used to monitor the skies for extraterrestrial life . The fire came within a mile of the SETI Institute's Allen Telescope Array in Hat Creek on Tuesday, forcing staffers 'to evacuate and temporarily shut down all of their computers, Internet, and power' for several hours. 'We can't listen when all that is down,' said Seth Shostak, senior astronomer and director of SETI Research to CNN. At SETI -- which stands for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence -- scientists search the heavens for signs of extraterrestrial life by 'listening' with an array of small satellite dishes. The blaze came within a mile of the facility, located near Hat Creek, California, on both the east and west sides. 'The fire on the west had jumped the road, burnt down our favorite lunch place, got within a mile of the telescopes,' he said. Pat Heitkam and his wife, Laura, survey the damage Wednesday, Aug. 6, 2014, at their home in Hat Creek, California., off Highway 89. 'This place was really beautiful, and meant a lot to a whole lot of people,' Pat Heitkam said . Firefighters try to stop the spreading of the Eiler Fire from moving closer to Burney. Thunderstorms that brought light rain and increased humidity to Northern California helped crews make progress . The Allen Telescope Array, funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, includes 42 antennas designed to listen for extraterrestrial activity 'at centimeter wavelengths.' Despite the shutdown, Shostak downplayed the possibility that researchers had missed an E.T. discovery. 'We just lost some search hours,' he said. 'To expect that E.T. will somehow reach out at this moment, that would be very bizarre.' As the flames got closer, the staff fled to safer ground and shut down the satellites. We're listening: On a good day, this is how the telescope array normally appears . Tracy Porter, of Paradise, Calif., uses an axe to fragment a burning tree damaged by the Eiler Fire. Firefighters were focusing on two wildfires near each other in Northern California that have burned through more than 100 square miles of terrain . The Eiler Fire has burned more than 31,000 acres and threatened over 700 homes. Officials say the fire is 35% contained and is expected to be fully contained by August 20th. Fire officials are hopeful that wet weather and increased humidity in the region will help to control the blaze. The scientists were eventually given the all clear to return to the facility and the search for life is once again continuing.","Scientists at SETI Institute's telescope array fled as wildfires closed in .

Nathan and Erin Braun were camping in October 2012 when their five-year-old dog ran away. They ended up posting fliers and even set up a Facebook page for her, hoping against hope that somebody somewhere would find her. Despite receiving no responses, they continued to hold out hope. Scroll down for video... Found! Almost two years after Murphy the golden retriever went missing on a camping trip in Tahoe National Forest, the thin, frail dog has been reunited with her family . It paid off: The family kept searching for Murphy for two years until finally she was spotted not far from where she disappeared . Then, earlier this month, a camper at French Meadows Reservoir saw a similar-looking dog some five miles from where Murphy she had originally gone missing. Remembering the search that had taken place years earlier, the Brauns were notified and drove to the campsite. They even decide to leave their dogs' old bed and some clothing with the campground host in the hope the dog might sniff them out. The plan worked! A week later, the host of the campsite found Murphy had been sleeping on the blanket and curling up in clothing they had left behind. Glimmer: Earlier this month, a camper at French Meadows Reservoir saw the dog five miles from where she had gone missing. Upon being notified, the Brauns immediately drove from their home in El Dorado Hills to the site . We're glad to have you back: Nathan Braun says the family are completely shocked and amazed with the miracle of having Murphy back . The Brauns wrote that the campsite host had even been able to coax her into a kennel. 'The very first night I laid it out I heard some movement,' Jason Smith told KXTV-TV of Sacramento. 'There was Murphy, sleeping on the blanket. And right there I knew, that's Murphy. That's their dog. It was curled up with its head on the hat.'

"By . James Gordon . A man whose body was found in a cardboard box by the roadside was sliced open across his abdomen because he was carrying drugs inside of him. Jose Milthon Freddy Azurdia-Montenegro, 55, of Guatemala, has now been charged with one count of misleading a police investigation. The man who was found by the roadside outside a home in Duxbury, Massachusettes, was Estuardo Leonel Melgar Perez, 34, also of Guatemala and he was smuggling drugs that were those of a so-called drug mule. In plain site: A body was found stuffed into this box by the side of a road in Duxbury, Massachusetts last week . Charged: Jose Milthon Freddy Azurdia-Montenegro, 55, of Guatemala has been charged with misleading a police investigation . He had a 14-inch incision in his abdomen, the Plymouth County District Attorney's Office said. Azurdia-Montenegro has pleaded not guilty and was ordered held on $10,000 bail at his arraignment and was also forced to surrender his passport. He pleaded not guilty. Police were called to the side of a road last week where the box with human remains was found. The box containing Melgar Perez's remains was found on July 27 by neighbors who noticed a strong odor coming from the box. Using fingerprint analysis by the Department of Homeland Security, investigators were able to identify Perez. Plymouth County District Attorney Tim Cruz said there was a 14-inch incision on Perez’s abdomen. Although the box had been left by the roadside for several days, it was only noticed when nearby homeowners noticed a revolting smell . In court: Jose Milthon Freddy Azurdia-Montenegro, 55, of Guatemala, stands behind a partition between a court interpreter, left, who did not want to give her name, and his defense attorney Scott Bradley, right, during arraignment on Monday . 'We did conduct an autopsy on the man. The cause and the manner of death are still pending further testing,' he told WBZ NewsRadio 1030 Monday. Assistant Plymouth District Attorney Peter Maguire said the only injury to the body was the incision, which it appeared was made to 'empty the contents of his stomach.' Brockton District Court First Justice Julie J. Bernard ordered Montenegro held on $10,000 cash bail and to surrender his passport. Montenegro’s attorney Scott Bradley said the two men knew each other casually from buying and selling old cars, but that Montenegro knew nothing about Perez’s death and they were not flying back to Honduras together. 'At best he’s a witness who had some information and now they want to keep him in the United States indefinitely.' Bradley said. Investigators say Perez had arrived in the U.S. on a flight from Honduras to New York just two days before his remains were found and both he and Azurdia-Montenegro had been booked on a flight back to Honduras August 2. Montenegro initially lied abut knowing Perez and being in the area where the body was found but after he was confronted, he admitted knowing Perez for five or six years and being in business with him to buy cars to bring back to Guatemala. Jose Milthon Freddy Azurdia-Montenegro, 55, of Guatemala is charged with misleading police in an investigation of human remains found in a box in Duxbury on July 27.

"By . James Gordon . It was the time of her life he wanted to capture forever and when Justin Sylvester's wife became pregnant for the second time, he wanted to savour the moment with a photo shoot. However, his wife refused to pose before the camera, so the 31-year-old Austin insurance consultant decide to organize a photo shoot for himself. It wasn't just any point-and-shoot affair. Instead, Mr Sylvester struck the familiar poses of those taken by countless pregnant woman - and presumably the kind he would have liked his wife to mimic. Striking a pose: Justin Sylvester, an Austin insurance consultant, and his wife are expecting their second child. He wanted his wife to commemorate the big event with photos, but she said no . Manternity: Sylvester decided he, and his beer belly, would stand in for some maternity photos . Of course, Mr Sylvester's belly isn't from pregnancy or any health condition of any kind, but beer. With the help of Austin photographer Kerri Lohmeier, Mr Sylvester and his 'manternity' photos are now famous after going viral on the Internet. Lohmeier has been shooting traditional maternity photos for about four years but had never done a man-ternity shoot before. While her typical photo shoots are serious, she and Mr Sylvester couldn’t keep a straight face for this one. Cravings? With the help of Austin photographer Kerri Lohmeier, Sylvester and his beer belly are now famous, as the photos went viral on the Internet . Seeing double: So many husbands have taken a pose where they are seen to be kissing their partners pregnant stomach, but hear Justin Sylvester doubles up! Sylvester is featured in a wide range of poses, trying to emulate what a photo shoot might have looked with his pregnant wife. Posing in just Superman underwear the man is seen eating ice cream and gazing lovingly at his round belly. The hilarious pictures show him proudly pushing out his belly while striking popular expectant mother poses. 'I call my Facebook feed 'Babybook,' because it's filled with nothing but people having babies and maternity pics,' he told People. Pushing it out: Justin said that pushing his stomach out for half an hour in the way that he did, actually began to hurt after a while . Familiar? Sylvester is featured in a wide range of poses, trying to emulate what a photo shoot might have looked with his pregnant wife . 'I asked my wife, Meghan, if she wanted to take maternity pictures,she is nine months pregnant and due any day now. She didn't take them for our first child, and said she didn't want to now. When I sat back down I said, 'Screw it, I'll hire my own photographer and do it myself.' 'It was too hysterical,' says photographer Kerri Lohmeier of Harley K Photography. Getting the photos just right meant Sylvester had to stick out his belly for about a half-hour. 'It hurts your stomach to stick it out for that long,' he told Austin360. Sweet tooth: Mr Sylvester eats straight from a tub as his pregnancy causes massive cravings! How he really is: See, he doesn't have a beer belly at all! 'After the shoot, my stomach and lower back hurt — for 30 minutes I realized what it might be like to be pregnant.' In one photo, Ms Lohmeier even managed to manipulate the picture to show Sylvester kissing his own belly bump - just as so many loving husbands have done to their wives. Sylvester says his wife was in tears, laughing so hard when she received her gift. And while all the attention was a surprise, he says his friends and family weren’t necessarily shocked by the photos. 'They all know me and my sense of humor,' he says.","Justin Sylvester, 31, wanted a maternity photo-shoot for his wife but she refused .

"By . James Gordon . For most kids having a magician do some tricks, perhaps a clown make everyone laugh or even an outdoor pool party is enough to celebrate their birthday. However, children in Oklahoma are sharing their special day with aligators at a special pool party. The idea was dreamed up by staff at the Safari's Sanctuary in Broken Arrow, as part of their Zoo To You scheme. Scroll down for video... See you later: An Oklahoma zoo is under fire after it has emerged they are hosting alligator pool parties . Children are allowed to play with the animals as part of the Zoo To You program which sees the exotic creatures brought into people's homes . The zoo has come in for some criticism because the animals mouth is taped shut and they are dragged around by children on a leash . As part of the plan, the charity aims to teach children about some of the animals in the zoo, but it does so by bringing some of its most dangerous creatures including alligators. 'Our Zoo 2 You program is a great venue to talk to people about why we rescue, what these animals need to survive, costs, housing and climate needs.... while showing youngsters,' said a spokesperson at the zoo. Safari's Sanctuary says: 'The animals have always been in captivity, and don't know how to hunt for food. Plus, their mouths are taped shut.' 'They're banded; they have no strength,' Safari Sanctuary Lori Ensign-Scroggins told News 9. 'They weren't blessed with strength in opening, just in clamping down.' Although the pool parties are supervised, the idea has angered and caused concern for many . Lori Ensign-Scroggins from the zoo said the practice is safe for kids and beasts, but the Wildlife Department said the American Alligator should not be transported . Some of the favorites are an American alligator and a South American Caiman, especially since kids get to swim with them . The pool parties help to raise money for the zoo which is a charity . They're also rinsed and bathed before and after an event. The water is also tested to make sure it's not over chlorinated or harmful to the animal. 'We always have one staff member tending to every animal,' she said. Despite the zoo's best intentions, the response has been met with anger and concern from worried parents and animal lovers. 'I think you should have a certain responsibility to give these animals a lifestyle that is as close to natural as possible and this doesn't seem like that. They should be in a sanctuary not a swimming pool with their mouths taped shut,' said Laura Gann-Hodd of Morris, OKlahoma. Misty Richardson of Tulsa also had similar thoughts: ' I thought what these people were doing for these animals was awesome. Now after seeing this, they are just exploiting these animals. Taping their mouths shut to swim with kids is nothing short of animal cruelty. I hope all those animals get moved to a real sanctuary with people who'll only have the animals best interests at heart.' Others have sprung to the zoos defence saying that children enjoy the experience which is made safe by the zoo's volunteers. While animal sanctuaries with the right paperwork and permits, can take other animals off the property where they're permitted . The zoo says that Zoo 2 you is the charity's fun, educational way to bring some animals to children's birthday parties allowing them to interact and play while educating on the real needs of the animals . Once the party is over, the animals are returned to the Safari Sanctuary in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma . In addition to rescuing all kinds of exotic animals, Safari's Sanctuary also takes animals on the road . The Safari Santuary say that as a charity and animal rescue center they constantly need funding. The alligator pool parties are simply are creative way of pulling in much needed cash to the organisation which houses more than 200 animals - many of which would have been destroyed were it not for the zoo's intervention. Owner Lori Ensign-Scroggins said they have reptiles, birds, tortoise and baby donkeys but the favorites are an American alligator and a South American Caiman, especially since kids get to swim with them. 'It's an awesome experience,' Ms Ensign-Scroggins said. 'The kids have the goggles on and end up floating underneath it, touching it, the kids will swim the way the gators swim and try to race it across the pool.' Animal sanctuaries with the right paperwork and permits are allowed to take animals off the property where they're permitted but the rules are less clear about moving American alligators from one location to another. Safari's Sanctuary says the animals have always been in captivity, and don't know how to hunt for food. Plus, their mouths are taped shut . They're also rinsed and bathed before and after an event.

Joe Koblenzer has worked at the restaurant in Venice for the past three-and-a-half year and appears to have a heart of gold. It was when a man who looked as though he had fallen on hard times walked into the store, he thought he would give him a little extra. 'He looked a little needy. He asked if I had any mayonnaise and some tarter sauce. He said he was going to cook a fish,' he told ABC 7. Scroll down for video... Fired: Joe Koblenzer, a 73-year old veteran says he was fired from the Cracker Barrel restaurant in Venice for giving someone who looked in a need a few condiment packets and a corn muffin . Don't break the rules! The restaurant say Joe gave food away on several occasions and was written up for it . The man whose job it is to be friendly, obliged. 'I got it for him. As he walked out I put a corn muffin in.' That gesture cost Joe his job. 'The General Manager called me in and said he had some bad news for me. Joe we are going to have to let you go.' Joe says that he has been written up before for what sound like the most trivial of things. Once he was reprimanded for getting a fountain drink on the job and on a second occasion he gave a cup of coffee to woman, which he claims he paid for. The culprit: Joe gave a homeless a corn muffin for free. He was fired for doing so . Rewarded: Joe says he has worked hard to earn the four gold stars that adorned his apron . A lifetime of service: Joe served his country in Vietnam and he now says he is looking for something else to supplement his Social Security . He admits that rues are rules. 'It's a rule.

'He is truly such a wonderful and friendly guy. He was such a joy to those he greeted at CB. They wronged him in the worst possible way!! Shame on Cracker Barrel!! I will never step foot into one again.' Others, like Mike Cecil, have been less sympathetic.'I worked at Cracker barrel when they first opened. They were very strict about their products. I think it is horrible this vet lost his . job over a muffin. But the store has rules the food is their property. Where does the employer draw the line.

Ruthless: This reply stood out among Gaeta's other posts about school and his obsession with wrestling . Gaeta, a neighbor of the Wright family, was a star member of Olympic High School's wrestling team. But the strapping teen depicted smiling in Facebook photographs reportedly had a violent streak that manifested itself off the wrestling mat, reported KIRO-TV. In response to the question 'Wanna fight?' posted on the site Ask.fm, Gaeta wrote: 'No. I don't fight. I just kill people until the point where they're dead.' Replying to another question, 'What's the latest thing that made you smile?' the high school student portentously wrote: 'A child crying.' As the search for Jenise was in progress last week, a reporter for KIRO-TV briefly interviewed the teenage suspect's mother in her van. Gaeta was sitting impassively behind the wheel. ‘It’s very sad it feels like 9/11,' the woman said, describing her shell-shocked neighborhood. 'It’s very quiet and you don’t hear kids running around anymore. It’s sad.' The teen's mother then broke burst into tears. Gabriel Gaeta said nothing and drove away.

Clues: Police found evidence near Jenise's body that linked her to the DNA of Gaeta, her neighbor . She suffered blunt-force trauma to the head and was strangled and sexually assaulted, and that her body appeared to have been moved between a half-hour and three hours after she died. Her underwear and shorts were found 15-20 feet away from her remains. Authorities said they linked evidence found near the girl's body to the DNA of Gaeta, a wrestling champion with no criminal history. A search of his bedroom turned up a blood- and mud-covered shirt and a bloody towel. Gaeta made his first court appearance . Monday and was ordered held on $1million bail after prosecutors said . they had enough probable cause to detain him. Kitsap County prosecutor Kelly Montgomery asked for the bail amount 'based on the heinous nature of the crime that is alleged.'

After the hearing, Kitsap County Prosecutor Russ Hauge said . they sought the competency review to first determine whether they can . charge the teen with anything. Detectives . interviewed the teen Saturday, during which time he 'clearly nodded . yes' when they asked whether he was the only one involved, according to . court documents. Staying strong: James Wright, pictured with his wife Denise, said he has forgiven the 17-year-old neighbor accused of sexually assaulting and killing their six-year-old daughter Jenise earlier this month . 'Certainly, as you can see from the probable cause statement, his interactions suggested that he knew that responsibility was rightfully focused on him,' Hauge said. Katelynn Christenson and her friend Amanda Ungren, both 18, were among those who crowded the courtroom Monday for Gaeta's appearance. The two said they went to the same junior high school as the suspect. They said they weren't close with him but saw no signs of violence. 'He was a nice kid,' said Christenson, who said she called her mother in tears when she heard who the suspect was. James and Denise Wright reported . Jenise missing on August 3.

"By . James Gordon . A pair of twins have been born to a mother in Kansas City, but their birthdays are more than a month apart. Carl is more than five weeks older than his brother David. The two tiny little boys came into the world in such a staggered fashion after a rare and risky delivery. Scroll down for video... David and Carl: Two tiny little boys thriving in the Kansas City area are twins, but their birthdays are more than a month apart . Living life: Carl (left) was born 39 days ahead of his brother, David . Baby bracelet: At one stage Carl was so tiny that his mom was able to slide her wedding ring onto his wrist. The boys' father, David Cowan, is an emergency room doctor. He and his wife Elene live in Saudi Arabia but wanted to have the children born in the United States. The couple flew back to the Kansas City area for her to give birth when she was 23 weeks pregnant. But within hours of their plane landing, a complication occurred. Surprise arrival: Elene Cowan was just 23 weeks pregnant when she went into labor early and gave birth to the first twin . Four months on: Carl remains on oxygen, but the boys' proud mother is enthralled and overwhelmed . Lucky lady: 'I am so grateful to God and the prayers from everyone,' mom, Elene Cowan said . Doctors told them that the amniotic sac holding baby Carl was bulging and that she was in labor. Although they fought to prevent the labor from happening, Carl was coming out whether or not he was ready and at just 24 weeks, Elene delivered her first child. 'It's the hardest thing in my life that I've ever done,' Mrs Cowan said to KCTV. 'I thought that he would die and this really isn't a baby,' Elene Cowan recalled. 'There's no way he's going to make it.' Weighting just over a pound, the baby was so small that she was able to slide her wedding ring onto his wrist. After giving birth to Carl, doctors ordered bed rest for Mrs Cowan. Almost 40 days later after Carl's delivery, David was born. I'm your daddy: David Cowan is an emergency room doctor in Saudi Arabia and flew back with his wife to Kansas City in order for her to give birth . Doing everything they can: After Carl's birth, doctors literally tied his mother's cervix shut and put her on complete bed rest. She did everything for little David Jr. in her womb while Carl continued to gain a little bit of strength every day . 'David was 2.9 pounds and I thought, 'Oh my word, this is a real baby,' his mother recalled. Four months on, both boys are back at home with their mother. Little Carl is still on oxygen but the babies are both growing stronger everyday. Their father is now back in Saudi Arabia on the job. His wife and children will be heading over there as soon as the boys are well enough to travel.","Elene Cowan was just 23 weeks pregnant when she went into labor early and gave birth to the first twin to Carl .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Burger King is getting rid of its lower-calorie french fries at most restaurants after less than a year. The Miami-based chain said in a statement that it gave its franchisees the option to continue selling the french fries earlier this week. Only about 2,500 of the approximately 7,400 locations in the U.S. and Canada opted to continue selling them as a permanent item. The others have started phasing them out. The french fries, called Satisfries, were a big bet for Burger King when they were announced in September. But they weren't as well received as Burger King had hoped. Scroll down for video . Burger King is getting rid of its lower-calorie french fries at most restaurants after less than a year because the more expensive healthy option hasn't proved a hit with customers . The name was mocked in some corners, with one website referring to them as Saddest Fries. There also is some confusion about their caloric superiority, with a small order still containing 270 calories. A small order of McDonald's fries, by comparison, has 230 calories because the serving weighs less. Satisfries also are pricier, costing about $1.89 for a small order, compared with a $1.59 for regular fries. And it's unclear whether customers were aware what made the fries lower in calories. Burger King said Satisfries used a different type of batter to prevent some oil from being absorbed by the potatoes during frying. The return of the Big King, which resembles a Big Mac, is another recent move since investment firm 3G Capital took Burger King public again 2012 . But the company did not have signs in restaurants explaining the difference between Satisfries and regular fries. It's just one of the gambits by Burger King since investment firm 3G Capital took it public again 2012. Other moves have included the return of the Big King, which resembles a Big Mac and a French Fry Burger, which is essentially a burger with four french fries smashed on top. The efforts haven't yet sparked any big sales gains at a time when traditional fast-food chains are struggling. In the latest quarter, sales at established restaurants in the U.S. and Canada edged up just 0.4 percent. This week, Burger King Worldwide Inc. also announced the return of Chicken Fries for a limited time. The company said it brought back the deep-fried chicken in response to demand it saw online.","The chain is getting rid of its lower-calorie french fries at most restaurants after less than a year .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Trucks and jeeps trundled slowly across the pontoon bridge, packed with refugees, with children poking their dusty heads out of the windows and truck beds. Nearby, a distraught father frantically scanned them as they passed, hoping to catch sight of his missing son. Beside him, a young man searched for his sister, who he fears was snatched by extremists. Unknown numbers, perhaps hundreds, of men, women and children went missing in the chaos as tens of thousands of Iraqis from the Yazidi religious minority fled in a panic from marauding militants, then spent a week hidden in a barren mountain range before finally making their way into neighboring Syria. Scroll down for video . Displaced Iraqis from the Yazidi community cross the Iraqi-Syrian border along the Fishkhabur bridge over the Tigris River in northern Iraq . The loss of loved ones adds even more suffering to people who spent days stranded in the Sinjar mountains under a blazing son with barely any food or water. Some of the missing may have been gunned down by militants during the escape. Others were lost as families scattered in panic under gunfire from extremists chasing them into the mountains. Dizzy from thirst, some adults lost track of children in the crowds in the mountains. Some women may have been abducted by militants, and Iraqi and U.S. officials say they believe hundreds of women are being held captive by the radical Islamic State group. 'There are many missing, many,' said Naji Khano, who lost his 17-year-old son Sherwan as he fled gunmen. At the Semalka crossing, crowds of Yazidis made their way back from Syria on Sunday and Monday into the relative safety of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region in the north. Trucks, jeeps and cars full of Yezidis inched across a pontoon bridge over the Tigris River, which forms the border here. Hundreds of other refugees milled among them on foot, some barefoot, lips cracked from thirst, clutching water bottles, watermelons and flat bread loaves distributed by aid workers. At least 20,000 civilians, most of whom are from the Yazidi community, who had been besieged by jihadists on a mountain in northern Iraq have safely escaped to Syria and been escorted by Kurdish forces back into Iraq, officials said . The breakthrough coincided with US air raids on Islamic State fighters in the Sinjar area of northwestern Iraq on August 9, and Kurdish forces from Iraq, Syria and Turkey working together to break the siege of Mount Sinjar and rescue the displaced . At the Semalka crossing, crowds of Yazidis made their way back from Syria on Sunday and Monday into the relative safety of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region in the north . Some men walked into the Tigris river to cool off; mothers bathed their children. One woman walked weeping; a boy held her hand. Most said they had not eaten in days. And many searched for their missing relatives among the crowds. There was no way of knowing how many were missing with the situation still in flux. But over the course of one hour on Sunday, at least a dozen Yazidis said they had lost family members whose fates are now unknown. 'My sister is missing,' 22-year-old Amer Qassem said as he walked among the crowds. Refugees: Iraqis from the Yazidi community cross the border in Syria along the Feeshkhabour bridge over Tigris River as thousands flee Islamic militants . Much-needed rest: Displaced Iraqis from the Yazidi community cool themselves in the Tigris River at the Feeshkhabour border point . Fleeing genocide: Islamic State militants have killed at least 500 members of the Yazidi sect during their offensive in the north, according to Iraq's human rights minister . On the run: The Yazidis fleeing to Syria said Islamic State militants had given them the choice of converting to Islam or dying . Qassem said he and dozens of his extended family fled their village of Tel Qassab the night of Aug. 2 when they heard fighters from the Islamic State group were approaching. The militants consider Yazidis as heretics. As the sun rose, militants riding a jeep mounted with a machine-gun spotted them, and opened fire. 'We ran everywhere, we were terrified. We lost each other,' Qassem said. The jeep zoomed away. As the extended family regrouped, they realized some women - maybe 10 - were missing. 'My sister Amira was one of them,' he said. 'My father is a broken man now, he does not know what to do if something will happen to her.' Desperate: Yazidis ride in the trunk of a car as they make their way towards the Syrian border, on the outskirts of Sinjar mountain, near the Syrian town of Elierbeh . Two other men earlier said they saw militants round up women at a checkpoint as they shot the men in two different villages. Like others fleeing Yazidi-majority villages in the area, Qassem's family scrambled up the nearby Sinjar mountains, a 60-kilometer (40-mile) range that the Yazidis consider a holy site. There they remained for days, until Kurdish Syrian fighters battled the militants to clear a path for the Yazidis to escape into nearby Syria. Once there, they walked or hitched rides further north to Semalka to cross into Iraq's Kurdish-controlled areas. Dakhil Atuseld lost his sister-in-law Wadha and his aunt Laila as they fled the village of Siba under fire from militants. 'They disappeared,' he said. 'We were for six days in the mountains without food and water, how could we know what happened to them?' The confusion of fleeing under fire was so great that Hanash Hamo can't even say for sure who was last holding his 3-year-old daughter, Jalila. Now the girl has vanished, along with two others of his children, Suad and Azad, he said, showing their identification cards. Another man, Hussein Haji, said he had lost contact with over 25 relatives in the village of Solakh. He showed pictures of them on his phone - baby Sam, dressed in pink swaddling clothes, missing alongside his mother; Nashwan, a teenage boy; and Alina, a smiling girl, also missing along with her mother. 'Can you find my children?' asked another elderly man, Hashem Saleh, when he saw a crowd gather around a reporter. His daughters, 12 and 15 years old, and two sons, 24 and 14, were gone, lost as the crowds descended from the mountain through a desert valley toward the Syrian border. 'Who can help me find them?' Saleh pleaded, his white baggy pants, shirt and droopy moustache caked brown with dirt. Others tried to reassure him that his children probably hitched rides and were probably already in a camp for the displaced in northern Iraq. But he insisted he would not leave the border crossing until he found them. By evening, he was nowhere to be seen; there was no way of knowing if he found his family.","Tens of thousands of Iraqis from the Yazidi religious minority flee over the Tigris River in northern Iraq .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . False: Hayley Turner was not abducted by a man with a gun said police in Michigan on Sunday as they close the investigation into her disappearance . Michigan authorities are closing the investigation into 18-year-old Hayley Turner's claim she was abducted along a road and held hostage for 16 hours, saying it never happened. The Monroe County sheriff's department says a detective and an FBI agent re-interviewed the woman Sunday and 'determined that the incident did not take place.' The department says it's forwarding a report to the county prosecutor's office for review. The department says the woman earlier reported being abducted after stopping her car when she saw someone lying along a road Thursday night. The site is in Bedford Township, just north of Ohio. Ecorse police Cpl. Chris Trevino tells the Detroit Free Press that a driver saw the woman jump from the vehicle in the Detroit suburb Friday afternoon before it sped away. Earlier this week, southeastern Michigan was relieved when Hayley Turner was found after a 17-hour air and ground search on Thursday. She was 40 miles from home when she was seen jumping out of a moving vehicle in Ecorse after making a chilling call in which she claimed a man with a gun was approaching her. Questions: It's unclear what transpired between the time Hayley Turner (left) went missing and her discovery 17 hours later 40 miles from home . According to Click on Detroit, Turner gave the homeowner her mother's cell phone number before the homeowner drove her to the Ecorse Police Department. Initially police believed Turner may have been abducted when she disappeared after a phone conversations with a friend that was cut off. Indeed, authorities became worried when they learned that Turner had spent Wednesday going about routine tasks. She had gone to a local video store  to rent some movies and spoke to her friend as she headed home around 10pm. Mystery: The 18-year-old was found without her shirt sitting outside a house in Ecorse . Sighting: A young woman fitting Hayley's (pictured second right) description was seen walking with a Caucasian male near the Telegraph and Erie Road near the Erie VFW . A rental receipt would show that the Notre Dame Academy student had rented Muppets Most Wanted and Divergent. Employees would later tell the authorities that she was happy and smiling. Then on her drive home, she told her friend that she had spotted a man lying in a ditch and that she was going to check on him. 'Seconds later, Hayley told her friend ""he has a gun"" and the phone was disconnected,' Monroe County Sheriff Dale Malone related to reporters at a news conference. Police now believe this to be false, however, it did not stop a huge search being launched that utilized dogs, helicopters, and even enlisted FBI agents. Turner's family said the girl had been struggling with some emotional issues this year.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Police said a drive-by shooting killed a man and an 18-year-old woman and wounded five other people, three of them children, in the Lower 9th Ward, a neighborhood that was ravaged by Hurricane Katrina and has struggled with crime. A woman and two children, aged 2 and 4, were in critical condition and a 13-year-old girl and a 37-year-old woman were in stable condition, Officer Frank Robertson, a police spokesman, said in a news release. He said all were in front of a house when a dark car occupied by men drove up, opened fire and sped off. The slain man appeared to be in his late 20s, Robertson said in an email. Scene: People grieve where New Orleans Police are investigating a shooting in the Lower 9th Ward neighborhood of New Orleans, Sunday, August 10, 2014. The Lower Ninth, a predominantly black neighborhood less than 5 miles from the bustling tourist district of the French Quarter, was overwhelmed by Hurricane Katrina's floods in 2005. In a separate, unrelated spate of violence, a 20-year-old man shot a friend Sunday morning inside a hotel room at the edge of the Quarter, then killed himself after a three-hour standoff with police, authorities said. The shootings were the latest in a city dependent on tourists. In June, two men exchanged gunfire on Bourbon Street, killing one person and wounding nine others. The hotel shootings happened in a 17th-floor room at The Westin on Canal Street, where four friends from the Lafayette area were staying together for the weekend, Robertson said. Three of them came in from partying, waking the fourth about 5 a.m. The man returned to sleep only to be awakened by the plea, 'Put the gun down'. The 20-year-old, looking 'dazed and confused under the influence of some unknown substance', was pointing a gun at their 24-year-old friend, Robertson said. The older man kept asking his friend to put the gun down, Robertson said, but about 6:30 a.m., the 20-year-old man shot him in the chest. The other two ran for help, hearing a second shot as they fled. A SWAT team leaves the Westin Hotel on Sunday, Aug. 10, 2014 after a shooting left one man dead and another critically injured . When hotel staff let police into the room, the 20-year-old pointed a gun at them, Robertson said. The officers backed out and called a SWAT team. After about three hours of negotiations, the 20-year-old man apparently shot himself and the SWAT team stormed in. He was pronounced dead about 9:55 a.m. Rescue workers rushed the 24-year-old to a hospital where he was in stable condition Sunday evening. Police have not identified the men.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Joel Christie . The 17-year-old boy charged with the rape and murder of six-year-old Jenise Wright used blunt force trauma and strangulation to kill the girl, according to court documents. Prosecutors in Kitsap County say they had sufficient evidence to hold Gabriel Gaeta - a close friend of the Wright family who had visited their home many times - on first-degree murder with aggravating circumstances, felony murder and first-degree rape of a child. Gaeta has been held on $1 million, will undergo a mental health evaluation and is expected to be tried as an adult. Court documents released Monday lay out grisly details into the death of Jenise, who was last seen when she went to bed at the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park in Bremerton, on August 2. Her body was discovered Thursday in a muddy bog near her home. Held: Gabriel Gaeta will be charged as an adult in the rape and murder of six-year-old Jenise Wright, whose raped and murdered body was found in a muddy bog on Thursday .

Aerial: Pictured here is the 103-unit community at Steele Creek Mobile Home Park in Bremerton, Washington, where Jenise Wright lived with her parents . The girl was strangled, sexually assaulted and had blunt-force trauma to the head resulting in multiple skull fractures, according to the probable-cause statement signed by a Kitsap County detective. It appeared that her body was moved between a half-hour and three hours after she died. Jenise's body was found almost entirely submerged in a muddy bog in the woods next to the mobile-home park where she lived. Searchers found a small wood pallet over the body, and also located a nylon duffel bag on top of the pallet. They earlier discovered Jenise's underwear and shorts about 15 to 20 feet from where her body was found. Authorities say forensic evidence analyzed by the Washington state crime lab linked the clothing to the teen's DNA. During the investigation, the sheriff's office collected DNA cheek swabs from dozens of nearby residents, including Gaeta. Detectives interviewed the teen Saturday, during which time he 'clearly nodded yes' when they asked whether he was the only one involved, according to court documents.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Someone in Colorado is holding the winning Powerball ticket for a $90 million prize. The Colorado Lottery says it's the largest Powerball jackpot ever won in the state. It says the winning ticket for Saturday night's multistate drawing was purchased at a Kum & Go convenience store in the small western city of Rifle. The ticketholder has yet to come forward. Feeling lucky?  The winning $90million Powerball ticket was sold at one of three Kum & Go venues in the town of Rifle, Colorado . The winner matched the five winning numbers - 3, 12, 31, 34, 51 - and the Powerball, 24. The Colorado Lottery says the $90 million jackpot amounts to an estimated $54.9 million cash payout. The store will get a $50,000 commission. Another Colorado ticket also won $1 million in the drawing. It was purchased in the Denver suburb of Broomfield, and the winner hasn't come forward yet. In the money: What makes you play? So what drives people to play the lottery, and what makes them think their $1 investment— among the many, many millions — will bring staggering wealth? 'It's the same question as to why do people gamble,' said Stephen Goldbart, author of 'Affluence Intelligence' and co-director of the Money, Meaning & Choices Institute in California. 'It's a desire to improve your life in a way that's driven by fantasy... The bigger the fantasy, the tastier it gets.' In a piece called 'Lottery-itis!,' Goldbart and co-author Joan DiFuria wrote on their blog last year on the Psychology Today website that in times of economic stress, playing the lottery is a way of coping with financial anxieties and uncertainty. 'We may seek a magic pill to make us feel better,' they wrote. 'Ah yes, buy a lottery ticket. Feel again like you did when you were a child, having hope that a better day will come, that some big thing will happen that will make everything right, set the course on track.' Between 65 and 70 percent of roughly 259 million possible number combinations will be in play when the numbers are drawn, Otto says. For the ticket-buying optimists, that's no deterrent. 'Even though the odds are against you, it's just the excitement of, 'Hey, I might wake up one day and be a millionaire,' says Chris Scales, a 31-year-old hot dog vendor in downtown Nashville, Tenn., who brings in about $35,000 a year 'if I really hustle.' He usually reserves his lottery playing for jackpots of at least $40 million. The incredibly remote odds don't really sink in for people, says George Loewenstein, a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University who has researched the motives underlying lottery ticket purchases. 'People don't really understand probabilities at all,' he says. 'Once you have a bunch of zeroes, it doesn't matter how many you have — one in 10,000, one in a million or one in a billion. ... People do understand the meaning of the word 'largest.' They overact to one dimension and underreact to the other.' They also cling to a more romantic notion: Amazing things happen to others, so why not for me? 'When people are desperately sick, there's always a part of the brain that thinks there will be a miracle cure,' Loewenstein says. 'If you want something to be true, your brain is awfully good at figuring out reasons, magical ones, that there's a good likelihood that it is true. The desire to win does drive a certain kind of frenzied optimism.' That frenzy can grow during the holiday season, when financial hardships become more glaring and people feel pressure to spend money they don't have to demonstrate their love. 'If you have plenty of money in the bank, you're not likely to feel the need to buy a lottery ticket,' Goldbart explains. 'But if there's something missing financially and emotionally and you're thinking, 'I can't get a raise or I'm not likely to get another job,' you buy a ticket as a psychological compensation plan.'","The five winning numbers are 3, 12, 31, 34, 51 - and the Powerball is 24 .

A teenage boy who was critically injured while rappelling down on a popular mountain in Arizona has died. Phoenix police say 15-year-old Trevor Crouse died Friday evening after being taken to the hospital in extremely critical condition. Off-duty firefighter Gary Johnstone was also killed when he fell some 30 feet to his death trying to rescue two 15-year-old boys on Camelback Mountain, fire and police officials said. Authorities say the 50-year-old Johnstone, Crouse and another 15-year-old boy were about 200 feet up the Echo Canyon Trail around 7 a.m. when they fell. The other boy suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Police said the two boys were friends with Johnstone's son, who also was there at the time but was not injured. Authorities say it appears they were in the middle of a rappelling or rock climbing maneuver when the accident occurred on a formation called 'Sugar Cube'. Johnstone,  an engineer paramedic and 15-year veteran of the department and married with three children, was hailed by Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton. 'This is a person who loved his job so very much, he was proud to be a Phoenix firefighter,' Stanton told a news conference. 'It was more than a career, it was a calling.' Killed: Trevor Crouse, 15, died on Friday evening after being taken to the hospital in extremely critical condition . The Fire Department's deputy chief, Shelly Jamison, said the accident was a powerful reminder of the ever-present danger of hiking in the mountains in the Phoenix area. 'Those mountains are incredibly dangerous,' Jamison said. 'The level of experience doesn't necessarily play a part in what can happen on them.' Police are trying to determine what led to the fall but have ruled out foul play. Camelback Mountain, noted for its shape, is popular with hikers.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A 40-year political career came to a close after Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie lost his bid for a second term in a stunning primary-election defeat by a fellow Democrat and state senator who defied party leadership to challenge the incumbent. A second intraparty fight for U.S. Senate was too close to call. State Sen. David Ige, once seen as an underdog, cruised to a decisive 35 percentage point win in Saturday's primary after being dramatically outspent by Abercrombie, who also had high-profile endorsements including President Barack Obama. Ige said his win 'proves that people power can be money power, especially in Hawaii.' Tropical Storm Iselle, which pounded parts of the state earlier this week, also delivered a bizarre twist to Hawaii's election, leaving the heated contest between incumbent Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz and U.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa too close to declare a winner. Victory for the underdog: Hawaii State Sen. David Ige, left, waves to his supporters and thanks Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie, right, who promised his support after the challenger's victory on Saturday in Honolulu . In an unprecedented move, elections officials postponed voting in two precincts in the remote Puna region of the Big Island, deciding that damaged roads would make it unsafe for voters to get to the polls. With Schatz holding only a narrow lead over Hanabusa, both candidates will have to wait for the results from mail-in ballots that will be sent to as many as 8,255 registered voters there, then returned and tabulated. Both races divided the state's dominant Democratic Party and offered voters a choice between the political establishment and a new generation of leaders. Abercrombie called his four years as governor 'a singular honor,' and pledged in an email to help Ige 'with every ounce of energy I possess.' Whatever shortcomings I have, whatever faults that I have, I can guarantee you one of them has never been a failure to give all that I can every day to Hawaii,' he told supporters Saturday night. Abercrombie is the first Hawaii governor to lose to a primary challenger and only the second not to win re-election. His defeat comes after Obama last month cut a radio ad for Abercrombie, invoking the Hawaiian word for family to tell voters in his native state that Abercrombie is 'like ohana to me. 'The governor was seen as confrontational and he angered many voters with a proposal last year to raise a host of taxes. The politically influential teachers union also campaigned for Ige after Abercrombie alienated teachers in 2011 by imposing a final contract that cut pay by 5 percent after negotiations failed. Ige, a respected state senator who served in the Legislature for 28 years, felt Hawaii was headed in the wrong direction, and that too many of the governor's decisions were dividing communities. 'There's been so much friction between Abercrombie, the Legislature and communities,' said Tom White, 62, who voted for Ige and is retired from the U.S. Navy. 'He's too rough around the edges.'Abercrombie's decision to appoint Schatz to the U.S. Senate seat after the death of beloved political icon U.S. Sen. Daniel Inouye, who died in 2012, also angered many Hawaii voters. Before he died, Inouye told Abercrombie that he wanted him to appoint Hanabusa to his seat. Political upset:  Ige, left, was outspent by and seen as an underdog but cruised to a stunning win over Abercrombie, right, who was supported by President Obama . Hanabusa evoked Inouye's name throughout the campaign, aligning herself with the traditional Hawaii political establishment, while Schatz touted his endorsement from Obama. 'Colleen is riding on the backs of old senior Democrats,' said Andrew Tomoso, 53, who works in the surfing and film industries and voted for Schatz. 'She's been trying to put Schatz down on his record, which I think is old-school. We need new blood.'Both candidates played up their ability to steer federal dollars to Hawaii, a trait for which Inouye was known. Schatz took another jab at Hanabusa in an election night speech saying he wanted to offer representation 'that doesn't divide people across the state, that doesn't focus on the negative, that doesn't focus on ways to split communities up, that doesn't think about opportunities to topple someone else.' Hanabusa and Schatz immediately began emphasizing their concern for residents on the Big Island - and their critical votes. Schatz said he would head to the area to campaign if it does not interfere with clean-up efforts there. 'Can you imagine being in Puna, knowing you are determining this election?' Hanabusa said.The winners of each race will face Republicans and independent candidates in the November general election, but such campaigns are often longshots in heavily Democratic Hawaii. Voters Saturday also chose state Rep. Mark Takai in a seven-way Democratic contest to represent urban Honolulu in the U.S. Congress. He faces Republican Charles Djou in November.","Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie was defeated ending a 40-year political career .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Prosecutors in Minnesota argued Friday that a former nurse should be convicted of assisting suicide for sending emails and other online communications in which he urged two people to kill themselves and gave them information on how to do it. William Melchert-Dinkel, 52, of Faribault, was back in court more than three years after he was convicted of encouraging suicides. The Minnesota Supreme Court earlier this year reversed those convictions, saying the state's law against encouraging or advising suicides was too broad. The high court however upheld part of the law that makes it a crime to assist someone's suicide, and attorneys for both sides returned to Rice County District Court to argue over whether Melchert-Dinkel's conduct qualified. 'Depraved': William Melchert-Dinkel (right) and his attorney Terry Watkins leave court Friday, Aug. 8, 2014, in Faribault, Minnesota, after prosecutors argued he should face a new trial for urging Canadian student Nadia Kajouji to kill herself . Melchert-Dinkel was originally convicted in 2011 in the deaths of Nadia Kajouji, 18, of Brampton, Ontario, and Mark Drybrough, 32, of Coventry, England. Kajouji jumped into an icy river in 2008 and Drybrough hanged himself in 2005. Evidence at that trial showed Melchert-Dinkel was obsessed with suicide and sought out depressed people online, posing as a suicidal female nurse, faking compassion and offering detailed instructions on how they could kill themselves. Police said he told them he did it for ""the thrill of the chase."" In an hourlong hearing Friday, Assistant Rice County Attorney Terence Swihart said the state Supreme Court had defined ""assist"" as providing a person with what they need to commit suicide. Melchert-Dinkel met that definition by providing information, he argued, according to the Faribault Daily News (http://bit.ly/1sFCW7x ). 'He turned Kajouji from someone who was terrified to die into someone who killed herself,' Swihart said. 'He provided Nadia Kajouji with what she needed to commit suicide. ... He dissuaded Drybrough from using other methods, such as overdosing, which was his preferred method, because it's unpredictable, something he knew as a nurse.' Tragic: Melchert-Dinkel, 51, was convicted on . two counts of aiding suicide in the deaths of two people including Nadia . Kajouji, pictured, 18, of Brampton, Ontario, who jumped into a frozen . river in 2008 . Death: Mark Drybrough, 32, of Coventry, England, was also encouraged to kill himself by the nurse, a jury found . Defense attorney Terry Watkins said that while Melchert-Dinkel encouraged the suicides, he didn't have a knowing role in the commission of the acts and there is no evidence that his advice led to the suicides. 'There was no nexus between what (Kajouji) did and what (Melchert-Dinkel) said,' said Watkins. 'Although on its face Drybrough looks like a case involving assisting, it's not. 'He had decided on hanging as a second method long before he met Mr. Melchert-Dinkel.' Evidence presented earlier in the case included emails in which Melchert-Dinkel gave Drybrough details on how to hang himself, stating 'just a sturdy knot is very much all one needs'. Internet chats with Kajouji suggest he posed as a compassionate, suicidal woman who promised she would die shortly after Kajouji. In one conversation, he allegedly told her hanging would be better than jumping, and: 'im just tryin to help you do what is best for you not me.' District Judge Thomas Neuville took the case under advisement and was to issue a decision within 30 days.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . An autopsy has confirmed a body found in the woods near a mobile home park where a Washington girl went missing was that of six-year-old Jenise Wright, authorities said Friday . The coroner also ruled the death a homicide, said Earl Smith, incident commander for the Kitsap County Sheriff's office. No exact cause of death was immediately released. Sheriff's office spokesman Scott Wilson said earlier Friday that the wooded area where an FBI team found the body contained thick brush and likely was muddy. He said the person responsible for the girl's disappearance likely would have been covered in mud. This undated photo provided by the FBI shows Jenise Paulette Wright. More than 100 officers from 10 law enforcement agencies are involved in the search for 6-year-old Jenise, who disappeared from her Washington state home over the weekend, sheriff's officials said Tuesday, Aug. 5, 2014. (AP Photo/FBI) Meanwhile, Wilson said authorities are collecting DNA cheek swabs from dozens of residents who volunteer them in the Bremerton-area mobile home park where Jenise lived. The samples could be used to eliminate suspects if investigators later come across DNA evidence, he said, adding the DNA collection might be expanded outside the mobile-home park. Jenise disappeared over the weekend, and her body was found Thursday in woods near the trailer park. Her family has said she was an outgoing girl. 'She was a happy child, a bright light for those around her,' Smith said. Authorities are focusing on a criminal investigation of the death, though so far no arrests have been made. The FBI's Specialty Search Dogs Unit discovered the body after volunteer canine search teams reported their dogs showed interest in a particular area. Jenise was last seen when she went to bed Saturday night. Her parents waited a day before calling for help because they say the girl had wandered around the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park on her own in the past. Wilson said Thursday there were no signs of forced entry at Jenise's home and no indication she was taken from her room. This undated photo provided by the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office shows Jenise Paulette Wright.

(AP Photo/Kitsap County Sheriff's Office) The girl's parents are cooperating with authorities, he said. Hundreds of people, including officers from 15 law enforcement agencies, searched for Jenise, going door to door at  the mobile home park on the west side of Puget Sound, across from Seattle. They also pulled surveillance video from nearby businesses and checked in with sex offenders in the county. After the search began, state child welfare workers removed two other children, an 8-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl, from the home. Jenise Wright's father, James Wright, was charged more than a decade ago with molesting two girls, ages 8 and 15, court records show. He eventually pleaded guilty in Whatcom County Superior Court in December 2001 to a misdemeanor assault charge related to the older girl. It was not immediately clear why the molestation charges were dropped. Prosecutors there did not return calls. A judge in Whatcom County Superior Court sentenced Wright to a year in jail but suspended the entire jail term on the condition that he follow certain conditions, including paying fees. Wilson has said authorities were aware of the past charge against the father, but officers were focused on finding the girl. This undated photo provided by the FBI shows Jenise Paulette Wright.

On her drive home, she told her friend that she had spotted a man lying in a ditch and that she was going to check on him. Mystery: The 18-year-old was found without her shirt sitting outside a house in Ecorse . Sighting: A young woman fitting Hayley's (pictured second right) description was seen walking with a Caucasian male near the Telegraph and Erie Road near the Erie VFW . In an emotional press conference, mother Christy Turner begged for any word of her daughter's whereabouts . 'Seconds later, Hayley told her friend ""he has a gun"" and the phone was disconnected,' Monroe County Sheriff Dale Malone related to reporters at a news conference. According to Bedford Now, the unidentified friend called her father, who sped to the scene only to find his daughter's car running but empty, her iPad missing but her wallet still there. The ensuing search utilized dogs, helicopters, and even enlisted FBI agents. A potential suspect could be a white male described in a call to authorities Friday morning. Normal night: Turner went to get some DVDs from this local store but disappeared after telling her friend she'd seen a man with a gun . 'The male was described as a white male, 18-24 years old, wearing brown khaki shorts and a blue shirt. The female was described as 18-24 with a red shirt, long, black, tight-fitting pants and shoulder-length dark hair. This is very similar to Hayley’s description and what she was last seen wearing,' Malone told reporters. As she waited for word, mother Christy Turner was understandably desperate for information, pleading with the public for any word of her daughter's whereabouts. 'Hayley, please call. Call anybody,' Turner begged during a press conference. 'We miss you. We want you home.' She was taken to a local hospital, reportedly with minor injuries, but police declined to say whether she'd been assaulted. Turner's family said the girl had been struggling with some emotional issues this year.","Hayley Turner, 18, was found shirtless and 40 miles from home by a homeowner .

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated  Press Reporter . Senior staff who worked for former Virginia governor Robert McDonnell have been highly critical of his wife Maureen’s behavior as first lady, after taking the stand as prosecution witness in the couple's on-going federal corruption trial. The woman who ran the governor's mansion under McDonnell testified on Thursday that the governor and his wife appeared to be a happy couple but acknowledged telling investigators that the former first couple seemed to lack healthy communication skills. Sarah Scarbrough, a close friend of the McDonnells' daughter, who served as mansion director for much of the governor's four-year term, said at the trial of Bob and Maureen McDonnell that the pair ‘seemed like a very happy, in-love couple’ from her perspective inside the mansion. Scroll down for video . Senior staff who worked for former Virginia governor Robert McDonnell, left, have been highly critical of his wife Maureen’s, right, behavior as first lady, while taking the stand as prosecution witness in the couple's on-going federal corruption trial . Her testimony undercuts an argument by the defense that the marriage had deteriorated to the point that the couple rarely communicated, much less engaged in a criminal conspiracy. The McDonnells are charged with accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and secret loans from former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams in exchange for promoting his dietary supplement products. Under cross-examination from the former governor's attorney, though, Scarbrough acknowledged telling investigators that the marriage seemed to lack healthy communications and describing Maureen McDonnell as ‘sneaky’ and frequently yelling at staff. Scarbrough also admitted telling investigators that the former governor appeared to be in denial about Maureen McDonnell's ‘mental capacity,’ although there was no further description of what exactly that meant. Former Mansion Director Sarah Scarbrough also admitted telling investigators that the former governor appeared to be in denial about Maureen McDonnell's 'mental capacity,' although there was no further description of what exactly that meant . Her testimony comes a day after another former Maureen McDonnell staffer, Mary-Shea Sutherland, acknowledged describing Mrs. McDonnell as a ‘nutbag’ who excitedly accepted the gifts that Williams lavished on her. Scarbrough also testified about an August 2011 reception held at the governor's mansion to launch Star Scientific's new product, Anatabloc. Scarbrough said Maureen McDonnell was the impetus behind the reception and that it was unusual to use the mansion, operated under state funds, to launch a product for a private company. Under cross-examination, though, Scarbrough acknowledged that several receptions were held at the mansion over the years that specifically catered to private firms, including a dinner reception with Volkswagen, which has its U.S. headquarters in Virginia, the New York Stock Exchange and Forbes magazine. Scarbrough also testified that Maureen McDonnell insisted on adding multiple guests connected to Williams' company to a reception of health care leaders at another reception at the governor's mansion in February 2012, and that Williams was given the opportunity to speak at the reception. Mary Shea Sutherland, former chief of staff to former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell, acknowledged describing McDonnell as a 'nutbag' who excitedly accepted the gifts that Williams lavished on her . About 125 people attended the reception. Scarbrough said that Virginia's health secretary, Bill Hazel, refused to use his department's budget to pay for about 25 of the guests because he wasn't the person who wanted them there. Scarbrough testified that when law enforcement eventually interviewed Maureen McDonnell in February 2013 pertaining to the corruption investigation, she emerged from the long interview at the mansion angry and saying 'that they were interrogating her and it wasn't fair and they were trying to set her up.' The true nature of the relationship between the McDonnells is key to the corruption case, because defense attorneys have said their marriage was crumbling and that they could not have been involved in a conspiracy because they never talked to each other. Attorneys for the couple have argued that accepting the gifts was unseemly but not illegal. If convicted, the McDonnells could face more than 20 years in prison and a large fine. McDonnell's four-year term as governor ended in January.

Jacob Lavoro is accused of selling the brownies for $25 and is facing felony charges that carry stiff penalties, ranging from five years to life in prison . A 19-year-old Texas man is facing possible life in prison for making brownies laced with marijuana and hash oil. Jacob Lavoro is accused of selling the brownies for . $25 and is facing felony charges that carry stiff penalties, ranging . from five years to life in prison. He appeared at a Williamson County courthouse near Austin, Texas, on Wednesday for the second time since his April arrest. His attorney, Jack Holmes, told reporters and supporters outside that new evidence should reduce the charges. Lab results have shown that there was only 2.5 grams of marijuana's psychoactive ingredient, THC, in the brownies. Authorities have also said there was a separate jar that had 145 grams of hash oil. In Colorado, where recreational marijuana is now legal, edible products are required to be easily divided into servings of 10 milligrams of THC - about the amount in a medium-sized joint. Holmes said the test results don't justify tough punishments but was skeptical of getting a break. Although neighboring Austin is a liberal haven in deeply conservative Texas, Williamson County has a long reputation of law and order, which came under national scrutiny in 2011 after an innocent man was freed after serving 25 years in prison. Scroll down for video . Jacob Lavoro and his attorney, Jack Holmes, speak with State District Judge Stacey Mathews in court on Wednesday. The 19-year-old is accused of making and selling brownies laced with marijuana and hash oil . ‘I'm scared. Very scared,’ Lavoro said. ‘I'm 19 years old and still have a whole life ahead of me. Take that into account.’ Supporters of Lavoro rallied outside the Williamson County Justice Center on Wednesday afternoon. Pot legalization supporters have collected 243,000 signatures in support of Lavoro’s case. First District Attorney Mark Brunner said Holmes was ‘grandstanding’ and that prosecutors are not trying to lock up Lavoro for the rest of his life. Pot legalization supporters have collected 243,000 signatures in support of Lavoro's case . His office has offered Lavaro a plea deal to a lesser felony charge that would include no jail time if he stayed out of trouble. Holmes said they won't take the offer because they fear prosecutors would be overzealous if Lavaro missed so much as a mandatory meeting. Brunner said the county isn't trying to make some statement on the war on drugs and defendants take risks when they choose a trial over plea bargains. ‘If this was just some college kid experimenting in his friend's Easy-Bake Oven, with a reefer's worth of pot and a bunch of brownies, that'd be different,’ Brunner said. ‘This man was trying to run a business, allegedly.’ Lab results have shown that there was only 2.5 grams of marijuana's psychoactive ingredient, THC, in Lavoro's brownies . Hash oil is a controlled substance that carries much harsher state penalties than marijuana. The oil has higher concentrations of THC. It's in a penalty group with amphetamines and ecstasy. Holmes said he expects Lavoro to be formally indicted later this month. State District Judge Stacey Mathews set a key September hearing, when Holmes said he will argue that the charges should be dropped altogether over whether the search of Lavoro's apartment was lawful.","Jacob Lavoro is accused of selling the brownies for $25 in Williamson County, Texas .

"By . James  Nye . and Associated  Press Reporter . The US Coast Guard have released video of the minutes before and after police detained Jessica Smith, 40, who is accused of murdering her two-year-old daughter and critically injuring her 13-year-old daughter in Oregon last week. Smith had been on the run for two days before police caught up with her after staff at the hotel she was staying at in Cannon Beach discovered her toddler, Isabella Smith and teenager, Alana Smith on Friday, August 1. The footage shot from a Coast Guard MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter on Sunday shows that Smith was taken into custody without incident after crews spotted her Chevrolet Suburban 15 miles east of the Cannon Beach resort and directed officers to her hiding place. Scroll Down for Video . Located: Jessica Smith is seen by the surveillance camera of a US Coast Guard Helicopter on Sunday - two days after she disappeared from an Oregon coastal resort . During the course of the video, which shows Smith wandering through a heavily wooded area, one law enforcement officer is seen to wipe the nose of Smith, who is in handcuffs. The pilot and crew first spotted Smith from 1,000 feet and were about to call of their search for the day when they caught glimpse of her car. However, the crews noted that Smith seemed to be trying to get their attention and figured that she was ready to turn herself in after she waved to the helicopter with both arms. An engineer in the helicopter wrote a note, 'Help is on the way' and put it into a plastic pouch attached to a weight and lowered it down to Smith according to Oregon Live. Watch Video Here: . Found: The pilots aboard the US Coast Guard helicopter compared the search for Smith to looking for a needle in a haystack . Hands up: At one point, Smith openly waved her arms in the air as if to signal the helicopter to let them know where she was . 'Once she read that, she sat down on the ground and stayed there,' Blair Petterson, a Coast Guard flight mechanic said to Oregon Live. Then the helicopter crews directed police through the winding forested road to where Smith was. Helicopter pilot, Lieutenant Commander Josh Nelson said that he was stunned they found her. 'Given the information we had, you're basically looking for a needle in a haystack,' said Nelson. 'It's amazing he was able to spot it,' Nelson said. 'Even after we knew where it was I had trouble keeping the car in sight.' Apprehended: Jessica Smith with two law enforcement officials after being brought into their custody in Oregon on Sunday . On Sunday, Oregon police held a press conference to say that Smith was found at the end of a logging road off Highway 26. She did not appear armed or injured. Jessica Smith, 40, of Goldendale, Washington, was ordered held without bail Monday during her first court hearing, in which she appeared via a video feed from jail. Her lawyer, William Falls, declined to comment, except to say the case would be tried in the courtroom, not the media. Authorities began looking for Smith on Friday after a housekeeper at the Surfsand Resort in Cannon Beach found the body of Smith's 2-year-old daughter in a room. The other daughter, age 13, was badly cut and taken to a Portland hospital for surgery, police said. She's expected to recover. On Sunday, a Coast Guard helicopter spotted an SUV driven by Smith in the woods east of Cannon Beach, and authorities soon took her into custody. Found: Jessica Smith, 40, was arrested Sunday night for allegedly murdering her two-year-old daughter Isabella. She was found in her car at the end of a remote logging road, two days after her daughter's death . The mother had been under a court order to turn over the children to their father, Greg Smith, at 5 pm on Friday, the day the girls were found in the hotel room, The Oregonian reported. An autopsy concluded the toddler's death was a homicide, although it didn't determine the precise cause. Investigators were awaiting toxicology reports. Custody battle: Smith was in the process of a divorce and was supposed to be dropping her children off with her estranged husband the day she allegedly killed her two-year-old and attempted to kill her 11-year-old . Smith faces charges of aggravated murder, which could lead to the death penalty, and attempted aggravated murder. At the hearing Monday, she sat at a table, said nothing and frequently looked down. She did not enter a plea, and her next court appearance is scheduled for August 12. Smith checked into the Cannon Beach lodging Wednesday. She and Greg Smith separated in April after 17 years of marriage, according to news reports. Greg Smith filed for divorce in June and sought shared custody of the children. Court records show Greg Smith obtained a temporary court order that prevented Jessica Smith from taking their children from the Washington area, or the Portland-Vancouver area, The Oregonian reported. Greg Smith's attorney, Nathan Petersen, told the newspaper a judge had ordered that Greg Smith be granted limited parenting rights starting August 1. A parenting plan set out in court records shows he was to have the children from Friday evening through Sunday night every other weekend. According to The Oregonian, Greg Smith in July received worrisome text and voice messages from Jessica Smith and the teenage daughter. Pictured for the first time: An arrest warrant was issued earlier in the day for Smith, who stands accused of murdering 2-year-old daughter Isabella (right) and seriously injuring 13-year-old daughter Alana (left). Both were found alone in an Oregon hotel room the day Smith was supposed to turn over custody to her soon-to-be ex-husband Greg . Day in court: Smith is set to be arraigned Monday afternoon . Smith was last seen driving this 2007 Chevrolet Suburban with Washington APX3141 plates . He requested that a psychologist conduct an evaluation of where the children should be placed. Greg Smith wrote in court papers that the teen sounded in a voice message she left for him as though she was 'reading from something that Jessica scripted,' making statements like 'I'm so sick I can hardly talk,' and 'It's terrifying and cruel of you not to respect us.' According to The Oregonian, the father wrote in the court records that he had a positive relationship with his daughters and did not understand ""why Jessica is manipulating our children into believing otherwise."" On Sunday, Greg Smith's family released a statement through the FBI thanking law enforcement and others for their help. 'We are extremely grateful for the outpouring of sympathy and support from Cannon Beach and the surrounding communities,' the statement said. Cannon Beach is a popular weekend getaway for people from the Portland region, about 80 miles away. It features galleries, shopping and scenic seascapes.

"By . Michael Zennie . and Associated  Press Reporter . Walgreens was hammered by investors today - its stock plunging more than 14percent - after the company announced it would keep its headquarters in the United States - and not move overseas to avoid taxes. The nation's largest pharmacy company is bucking the trend of U.S. companies incorporating overseas despite buying Swiss-based Alliance Boots in a $15billion deal. The practice, called inversion, allows American corporations to avoid paying U.S. taxes on overseas profits by buying or merging with a foreign company. It also allows companies relief from the 35percent corporate tax rate, which is the highest in the industrialized world. After Walgreens - which bills itself as 'America's premier pharmacy - released the news, stocks plunged to below $59 a share Wednesday - the lowest price in six months. Walgreens, the nation's largest pharmacy chain, said it would keep its headquarters in the United States - despite potentially saving millions in taxes if it moved to Switzerland . Hammered: Walgreens stock plunged to its lowest price in six months - dropping more than 14 percent on Wednesday . The decision to keep its headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois, was not entirely egalitarian. Walgreen CEO Greg Wasson said the board and outside advisers weighed several benefits and risks, including the hard-to-quantify but significant potential for consumer backlash and political headaches. The company was not  confident such a deal could withstand IRS scrutiny. A spokesman also said its original agreement with Alliance Boots, which runs the United Kingdom's largest drugstore chain, also was not structured as an inversion, and that would have forced the company to essentially create a new deal. Walgreens is working on a deal to buy the remaining 55percent share of Alliance Boots that it doesn't already own. It purchased the initial 45percent share in 2012. Companies are facing a growing pushback from Democrats in Congress and President Barack Obama due to lost U.S. revenue from corporate taxes from inversions. On Tuesday, the Treasury Department said that it was considering actions that could limit the ability of companies to use the tactic. Illinois Senator Dick Durbin had sent a letter to Wasson urging him to reconsider an inversion and warning that the company may find its customers are 'deeply patriotic and will not support Walgreen's decision to turn its back on the United States.' There have been 47 U.S. companies that have put together inversions through tie-ups with foreign businesses over the past decade, according to the Congressional Research Service. Several others are planning or considering the move. Those including the drugmaker AbbVie, which last month announced a roughly $55 billion combination with drugmaker Shire Plc, which is incorporated in the United Kingdom. Pressure: Illinois Democrat Senator Dick Durbin made a public appeal to urge the Chicago-area-based company not to leave its American roots . In an inversion, a U.S. company reorganizes in a country with a lower tax rate by acquiring or merging with a company overseas.  Inversions allow companies to transfer money earned overseas to the parent company without paying additional U.S. taxes. That money can be used to reinvest in the business or to fund dividends and buybacks, among other things. Inversions also can reduce a corporation's corporate tax liability in other ways, and they provide some relief from the U.S. corporate tax rate of 35 percent, which is the highest in the industrialized world. Walgreen Co. had drawn criticism for considering an inversion, in part because it receives part of its revenue through government-funded programs that help cover the poor and elderly people. The company addressed that issue Wednesday. 'The company also was mindful of the ongoing public reaction to a potential inversion and Walgreens unique role as an iconic American consumer retail company with a major portion of its revenues derived from government-funded reimbursement programs,' Walgreen Co. said in a statement. People walk past the Boots flagship store,  owned by Swiss health and beauty retailer Alliance Boots, on Oxford Street in London, Wednesday, Aug. 6, 2014.  Walgreen, America's largest drugstore chain, plans to keep its roots firmly planted in the United States, saying it will no longer pursue an overseas reorganization, or inversion, that would have trimmed its U.S. taxes but drew political scorn. Walgreen said Wednesday that it will buy the remaining stake in Alliance Boots that it does not already own. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham) Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj has said Wall Street had largely expected Walgreen to pull off an inversion, even though he thought there was a strong chance it wouldn't happen, in part due to public backlash. Instead of an inversion, Walgreen and Alliance Boots will form a new holding company named Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. that will be headquartered in the Chicago area. Wasson will serve as CEO. Walgreen will pay about $5.29billion in cash and 144.3million shares of its stock, a portion valued at $9.97 billion based on Tuesday's closing price. The companies expect the deal to close in next year's first quarter. The company also said it expects adjusted earnings of between $4.25 and $4.60 per share from the combined operation by 2016. That translates at the midpoint of the range into about $7.2 billion in adjusted earnings, which is lower than a previous range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion the company had forecast. Wasson told analysts during a Wednesday morning conference call that he wasn't happy about lowering the company's goal, but the move reflected global pharmacy reimbursement pressures. That includes lower reimbursement for its Medicare prescription drug business in the United States. Walgreen shares sank more than 13 percent, or $9.62, to $59.50 in Wednesday morning trading.

A Maine mother busted for driving 124 mph with her two children in the car in April has been sentenced to six months in jail - and police say she's now also facing a driving under the influence charge. Cheryl Gilson, 26, of Cornish, was sentenced Monday in Portland District Court. She pleaded guilty to endangering the welfare of a child, driving to endanger and driving more than 35 mph over the speed limit.

"By . Josh Gardner for MailOnline . Slip up: Banana mogul Thomas Hoey pleaded guilty Thursday to charges he supplied a sex partner with fatally potent cocaine and delayed calling for help when she overdosed during a 3-way sex romp at a posh Manhattan hotel in 2009 . A New York banana mogul on the hook since 2009 on charges he contributed to a woman's death during a cocaine fueled 3-way sex romp at a posh Manhattan hotel finally pleaded guilty Thursday. Thomas Hoey Jr., 46, admitted in federal court that he delayed calling for help when one of his ladies, 41-year-old Kimberly Calo, began seizing and bleeding from the nose that April night after doing too much of his potent coke.

Calo, a personal trainer, retired NYPD detective Edward Boyle, who . investigated Calo's 2009 death, said on the stand last year.

Calo . had first snorted the coke laying on a coffee table and when she went . back for more, she began overdosing and 'her head dropped to the table . with a thud,' Boyle told jurors at Manhattan federal court, where Zobkiw . was on trial for making false statements and perjury. Zobkiw was later found guilty of lying to a grand jury about the fatal party. The . court was told Zobkiw attempted to get Hoey to call the emergency . services but he refused, allegedly telling her that Calo would be fine. Boyle told the court that Hoey assured Zobkiw that a 'doctor friend' was on the way. Hoey also admitted to coercing the other woman there that night, Nicole Zobkiw, to lie for him about the night's events while under oath (pictured is the scene of the tragedy, the Kitano Hotel) Zobkiw's lawyer Leonard Lato admitted his client had to tried to hide what happened on the night. But she was intimidated two days before her grand jury testimony in 2011 by a 'corrupt lawyer' allegedly linked to Hoey, Lato said. Zobkiw has not yet faced sentencing. Under his new plea deal, Hoey faces 11 to 13 years in prison on federal charges. For the state charges he tampered with evidence by trying to clean up Calo's blood, Hoey faces four years.

"By . Ap  Reporter . Finally going to court: Charles Black stands accused of pushing his then-wife Lisa off 800-foot Maiden Cliff in Maine's Camden Hills State Park in April 2011 in an attempt to kill her and claim a $4 million inheritance . Charles and Lisa Black moved to Maine after careers as teachers in Kansas, pursuing an idyllic retirement that prosecutors say was destroyed by arguments over money and infidelity before both plummeted off a cliff. Prosecutors say 71-year-old Charles Black hit his wife on the head with a rock before pushing her off the 800-foot Maiden Cliff in April 2011 in in Camden Hills State Park. Lisa Black, 55, says she believed Charles was chasing her when he, too, tumbled down the mountain, according to a police report. His trial is set to begin Monday in Rockland with jury selection. Law . enforcement officials have said Lisa Black received a $4 million . inheritance from her father, and she and Charles Black had a dispute . over how he spent some of the money without her permission. Lisa has . also accused Charles Black of having an online affair. Charles . Black now lives in Salt Lake City and faces numerous charges, including . attempted murder, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in . prison. The prosecution has also asked the court for permission to . introduce evidence that he had earlier tried to poison Lisa Black. Black's . attorney, Walter McKee, attempted to have the charges dismissed over . the way prosecutors obtained hundreds of pages of Black's medical . records. He has said prosecutors used 'secret search warrants' to get . Black's the records and should have subpoenaed them instead. McKee lost . the bid for dismissal in April.

He told police he fainted, fell forward and hit the back of Lisa Black's head with his own head, but he had no memory of pushing her off the cliff. They divorced in 2013 after nine years of marriage. The Blacks are former Johnson County, Kansas, teachers who had moved to Maine about a year earlier. Lisa Black had taught fourth grade while Charles Black was a social studies teacher.

"By . Ap  Reporter . and Joshua Gardner . Guided by voices: Clinton D. Inabnit, 40, told his interrogators that 'these people' whispered messages to him to kill 57-year-old Mark Stanziano and that if he did, the ringing in his ears would stop. Inabnit is accused of shooting Stanziano in the street outside his Somerset, Kentucky office . A Kentucky man accused of killing a prominent area lawyer told police that hidden messages he received from music and newspapers made him do it, court testimony revealed Wednesday. Clinton Inabnit, 40, told interrogators after he allegedly gunned down 57-year-old Mark Stanziano on June 27 that whispers from 'these people' told him ringing in his ears would only stopped if he murdered the well-liked Somerset, Kentucky defense attorney. Somerset detective Chris Gates testified at a preliminary hearing Wednesday that Inabnit told police he didn't want to kill Stanziano, but he had to. Inabnit lived in an apartment directly across the street from the attorney's office. Inabnitt allegedly fired seven shots from a 9mm pistol at him from less than 15 feet away as Stanziano arrived for work. Stanziano was pronounced dead at the scene at 9:12 a.m. Among . Stanziano's high profile cases was an acquittal last year for a Wayne . County man accused of murdering his 20-month-old son after the boy drank . drain cleaner in a mobile home that was host to a meth production . operation. A . police arrest citation says Inabnitt told officers that he shot . Stanziano because the attorney declined to help him with a problem the . previous night and laughed at him. Defense attorney Richard Leary whispers to Clinton Inabnitt shortly before a court hearing on Wednesday where a police officer recounted when the 40-year-old accused killer said hidden messages in newspaper and music told him to murder a man . Inabnitt appeared largely unmoved as a witnessed painted him as a mentally unsound killer . According . to a report from the Lexington Herald-Leader, Inabnitt later admitted . to being angry not because Stanziano denied him help but because he . laughed at him. Police found out during about 45 minutes of interrogation that Inabnitt warned Stanziano the day before the shooting that there were people who wanted him killed, and they wanted Inabnitt to carry out the slaying, Gates said. Inabnitt told police that Stanziano laughed off the warning. 'Later that evening ... he stated that he had deciphered a message in the paper that this was something that he had to do,' said Gates, who participated in the questioning. 'He made it very clear to us that he said this is something I don't want to do but it's something that I had to do.' Gunned down: Somerset police say 57-year-old attorney Mark Stanziano was shot at least four times about 8 a.m. June 27 by a man who lives across the street. A police citation said Inabnitt said he killed Stanziano after the lawyer refused to help him with an unknown task and then laughed at him . Inabnitt also said he had received messages through music to target Stanziano, Gates said. The detective didn't mention any songs. Police later executed a search warrant at Inabnitt's residence and seized a box of ammo, a newspaper, iPhone and laptop computer, Gates testified. When Inabnitt's pockets were emptied by police, they found about 10 bullets, he said. Inabnitt purchased the handgun about a year before the shooting, the officer said. Police also have reviewed surveillance video from a business that has aided the investigation, Gates said. Inabnitt, clad in an orange jail jumpsuit, sat quietly during the testimony. His attorney, Richard Leary, argued that the charge should be reduced to manslaughter. Afterward, Leary told reporters that Inabnitt's comments to police 'tend to lend credence to the fact that he might have been not in his complete right mind when this happened, and we're going to get into that.' 'That's a mountain that has to be climbed to see what the mental state was here of my client during the alleged commission of this crime,' he said.

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Ap  Reporter . A Utah jury on Thursday found wife-killing Mormon doctor Martin MacNeill guilty of sexually assaulting his daughter. It took just two hours for the jury of five women and three men to convict the 58-year-old of fondling his daughter not long after he overmedicated his wife so she'd drown in the bathtub. MacNeill is still awaiting sentencing for the coldblooded 2007 murder. In addition to that possible sentence, he could now receive 15 years on the sex abuse charge. The daughter MacNeill assaulted was 30-year-old Alexis Somers, who identified herself to reporters as the victim as the jury first left the courtroom to deliberate. Murderer and sexual predator: Martin MacNeill enters the courtroom for his trial on forcible sexual abuse Wednesday. he was found guilty on Thursday of sexually assaulting his own daughter in the wake of his wife's murder . Daughter and victim: Alexis Somers testifies against her father in his trial for sexually assaulting her in the days after he over-medicated his wife after her face lift and then let her drown in the bathtub . 'At the end of the day and regardless of the outcome, I will have done everything in my power to protect my family,' she told KSTU. MacNeill says she came forward with revelations her father assaulted her after she fell asleep on her mother's bed while cleaning it out following her death because she feared for her siblings. Following her mother's death, MacNeill's younger sisters still lived at the family home with their father. 'I was feeling panic, horror, fear that  my sisters were not safe,' she told the jury. 'They were at the home of someone who just murdered my mom.' In September 2007, then-24-year-old Alexis Somers filed a police report claiming that her father had abused her on two occasions in the three months after her mother's death. According to the charging documents, in May 2007, Alexis was asleep in her parents' bed when she was awakened by her father fondling her and kissing her hand. He was supposed to be sleeping on the couch. Fractured family: Martin MacNeill, second from right, murdered his wife and the mother of his eight children . Loss: Michele MacNeill, right, was found unconscious in a bathtub in 2007. Her husband, left, left her there to die after overmedicating her with prescription painkillers she was given after a face lift he urged her to get . Alexis demanded to know what her father was doing, to which he allegedly replied, 'I'm sorry, I thought you were your mother.' A similar incident reportedly took place two months later while the family were vacationing in California. Killed his wife to be with a 'Gyspy': During the murder trial, MacNeill's daughter Sabrina testified that their 'nanny' Gypsy Willis spent every night in the doctor's bedroom after their mother's death . In a recorded phone conversation, MacNeill allegedly told Alexis that he 'was asleep' when he assaulted her. When confronted with allegations of sex abuse while being questioned by police, MacNeill stated that a person cannot be held accountable for his actions while he's asleep, according to court documents. MacNeill sat silent and motionless throughout the two-day proceedings. In December, MacNeill left a suicide note and slit a major leg artery with a disposable razor, court documents show. Utah County jail officials intervened to save his life. Alexis Somers and her sisters had spent years dogging the authorities to open a murder investigation, and were instrumental in bringing their father to account for their mother's slaying. The young women claimed that the seemingly respectable doctor and a former bishop in his local congregation of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was, in fact, a monster and philandered who led a double life and killed his wife so he could be with his mistress, Gypsy Willis. It wasn't until MacNeill's release in July 2012 from a federal prison in Texas on charges of fraud that Utah prosecutors moved to file charges of murder and obstruction of justice. During the trial, MacNeill's daughter Sabrina testified that Willis, who was hired as their nanny, spent every night in the doctor's bedroom after their mother's death. Not looking good: MacNeill recently tried to kill himself in prison by slicing an artery in his left with a disposable razor.

"By . Ap  Reporter . Sixty-eight years after she was left on the doorstep of a western Michigan family's home, Julie Himebaugh is still trying to discover the identity of her parents and why her mother decided to give her up. Ludington police said this month they no longer have records of the discovery of the baby on May 7, 1946. But the Detroit Free Press reported Sunday stories in several newspapers at the time paint a detailed picture of the baby's discovery. Himebaugh was about 6 months old when she was left, authorities said. A note from a woman identifying herself as the mother said the father was a soldier killed in World War II and said she was unable to care for the baby. ''Insatiable curiosity': Julie Himebaugh, 68, of Elizabeth City, North Carolina learned in 1999 that she was abandoned as a 6-month-old girl on the porch of a family in Ludington, Michigan. Since then, Himebaugh has used a range of approaches, including DNA testing, to discover the story about her unknown birth parents--all to no avail . Himebaugh now lives with her husband in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. Newspaper stories told the tale of the doorstep baby, detailing the efforts that went into trying to find her mother. The Pere Marquette car ferry was monitored closely. An ad was put in the Ludington Daily News asking for information. A probate judge made an appeal in the Ludington newspaper, asking the child's mother to come forward to sign off on rights in order to speed a potential adoption. Nothing worked. 'It's hard to believe all of this was done because of me. I caused a whole lot of commotion,' Himebaugh said. Shocking details: Himebaugh only learned of the way she was abandoned after petitioning for her adoption papers in 1999. They showed the name state workers had given her at random, Marlene Madison, before her adoption. She later learned the pinned to her on the porch was a note indicating her birth mother was intent on killing herself . Newspaper accounts said a note pinned to the blanket-wrapped baby said the parents ran away and married and had a happy home before the father left for the Army, then was killed. 'I'm just grieving my life away, so I have decided to end it all by taking my own life,' the letter said. 'Please keep this quiet and do not have it printed in papers as I should never want my baby to know what has happened.' Shockingly, Himebaugh didn't learn about her true origins until 1999, when she petitioned for adoption records after the death of her adoptive parents. 'It blew my mind,' she told the Detroit Free Press. Since then, Himebaugh has pursued DNA and other leads, but has had no luck. Her daughter, Laura McCombie of Accokeek, Maryland, said it would bring peace of mind to have some information. 'She just runs into roadblock after roadblock after roadblock. I don't want her to just give up,' McCombie said. 'I want her to follow through.' Himebaugh and her husband visited Michigan this month in the hopes of finding new clues in the mysteries. She's also done DNA testing, through which Himebaugh found a second cousin, but the lead led to nowhere. 'I would just like to know what happened, and know if I have siblings out there. I had a great adopted life. I couldn’t have asked for better parents and sister and brothers. 'It was just wonderful. But I have an insatiable curiosity. I just wish I could find something out, or that someone would come forward,' she said.","Julie Himebaugh was discovered on a Michigan's family's doorstep at around 6-months-old .

"By . Ap  Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporters . Authorities are overreaching with a murder charge against an Alabama father accused in the slaying of his daughter's sexual abuser, his defense attorney said Wednesday. Tommy Drake, who represents the 41-year-old man, said there's no way evidence would support a murder charge because the shooting happened 'in the heat of passion.' 'Even if you believe the facts asserted by the authorities the most it would be is ... manslaughter,' said Drake. Shot dead: Raymond Earl Brooks, 59, who was convicted of molesting a 7-year-old girl in 2002, was gunned down at his parents' home . Fit of rage: This is the 41-year-old father who is charged with murder for killing the registered sex offender who molested his daughter . Raymond Earl Brooks, 59, was shot to death at his home near Cullman on Sunday. Brooks pleaded guilty to sexually abusing the accused shooter's daughter in 2002 when she was in elementary school. The Associated Press doesn't identify victims in sex crimes, and it isn't naming the suspect to protect the daughter's identity. 'We are investigating all aspects of this case and cannot comment on a motive at this point,' Cullman County sheriff Mike Rainey said in a press release. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the victim’s family.' Drake described his client as a construction worker with no previous felony convictions and a solid work history. With the man's bond set at $156,000, Drake said he would request a reduction and a hearing could be held as early as Thursday. 'There's no way someone in his position can meet a bond like that,' said Drake. Supporters have created a website to help pay the man's legal expenses, and $625 had been donated by Wednesday. That's far short of the amount needed to pay the bond, at least $75,000 on which authorities said must be in cash, and the man also will face legal fees. A Facebook site created to show support for the man had more than 950 members within hours of its creation, and donors gave more donations on another website to help fund his legal defense. Jason Lackey, a longtime friend of the alleged shooter, contributed $150. 'The guy was guilty of raping his little girl, and I guess he dealt with it for 12 years and it just built up,' said Lackey, who has a recreational vehicle business in Cullman. 'I won't say (he) had the right to go murder him, but I understand when he did.' 'It would be unbelievable to hold animosity in your heart for 12 years,' said Brooks' father Ralph Brooks. He also said his son had been living a Godly life since prison and did not deserve to die . Meanwhile, the father also is charged with opening fire on a stepdaughter's boyfriend outside a convenience store moments before the slaying. Sheriff's officials have said the man first opened fire on a stepdaughter's boyfriend outside a store and missed. Then, they said, he rode his motorcycle to Brooks' house less than a mile away and killed Brooks, who served 27 months of a five-year sentence after pleading guilty to sexually abusing the man's daughter. Mike Hays, who cooks and operates a small barbecue restaurant inside Berlin Plaza Quick Stop, where the shooting occurred, said he came face-to-face with the shooter after the man opened fire outside and then entered the store looking for his intended victim, who wasn't hurt. 'People here are calling him a hero for killing a child molester. I'm calling him a psychopathic lunatic for endangering peoples' lives, including mine,' Hays said. Rampage? The shooter allegedly shot up a convenience store as he fired at his step-daughter's ex-boyfriend just before murdering Brooks . 'People here are calling him a hero for killing a child molester. I'm calling him a psychopathic lunatic for endangering peoples' lives, including mine,' said Mike Hays, who came face-to-face with the shooter . After stopping his motorcycle at an intersection outside the store, the father fired once at a man who was standing beside an ice cooler, Hays said. The bullet entered an exterior wall of the store and chipped a window but no one was injured. Hays said he retrieved his own weapon and confronted the gunman near the cash register. 'He had the gun down by his side. He was calm, as calm as you are standing there now. But he had that look in his eye,' said Hays. 'I have no problem with him shooting a child molester, just not 12 years later. If it was my daughter he would have died back in 2002.' Brooks' father, Ralph Brooks, told WBRC-TV in Birmingham that his son did not deserve to die. He said Raymond Earl Brooks turned his life around after his conviction and lived a godly life that included being active in his church. Because his son's conviction happened so long ago, he said he couldn't be sure if the shooting was a form of revenge. Support: Supporters on the Facebook page for the murder suspect call him a 'hero' 'It would be unbelievable to hold animosity in your heart for 12 years,' Brooks said. A person who answered the door at the Brooks' home Tuesday told an Associated Press reporter the family was making funeral arrangements and was not available to comment immediately. Lackey said he was told by a relative that the shootings followed a family argument over the stepdaughter's boyfriend that grew heated enough to include a reference to the sexual abuse case from years before. 'I'm 100 per cent behind him,' Lackey said. Chief Deputy Mac Barlett said the father did make a statement to deputies after he was arrested Sunday night, but Barlett said he could not comment on what the man had said. The father and Brooks 'obviously didn't have a whole lot of good blood between them,' but it was unknown whether the shooting was directly linked to the sex abuse case, Bartlett said. 'It is odd. He apparently had a lot of stressors going on in his life,' Bartlett said. The suspect's father told MailOnline he has no idea why he might have waited 13 years to attack Brooks.","The father, 41, who is not being identified by MailOnline, shot dead Raymond Earl Brooks, 59, Sunday .

It was the Houston-area family's first ever party for a temple blessing ceremony in their second-floor apartment above a garage, but it only took the one to send 36 injured revelers to the hospital. While there were no fatalities, at least one victim was wheeled away with serious head trauma and another was just 8 years old. Scroll down for video... Out from under them: Hell broke loose in a Houston-area suburb Thursday afternoon when a family's temple blessing ceremony in their home's garage apartment crashed into the earth . In shock: The Katy, Texas family had invited over 100 people to the garage apartment above their home when the floor collapsed beneath them and injured 36 people . The collapse occurred while as many as 125 people gathered for the event in a residential neighborhood of Katy, just west of Houston. People were in a room above a detached garage when the floor gave way, though it wasn't immediately clear how many people were inside at the time, West I-10 Fire Department spokesman Tim Thomas said. He said 36 people were taken to hospitals. Three people suffered 'urgent' but not critical injuries, while the others mostly suffered minor injuries, he said. More than a dozen ambulances rushed to the scene shortly after the collapse was reported around 1 p.m. A few people were trapped when the floor above the garage 'pancaked in,' Houston Fire Department Captain Ruy Lozano said. 'The floor gave way,' Captain Lozano told Chron.com. 'It looked like it bowed.' Mayhem: Ambulances raced to the home after the 1pm collapse in a scene neighbors described as chaotic . Young: Among the three dozen injury victims was an 8-year-old child . Neighbor Jill Allred did not attend the party, but descirbed the ensuing scene as total chaos. 'It's crazy,' Allred said. 'we can't get in or out of our neighborhood.' He said emergency responders pulled victims from the building. Firefighters and emergency crews treated people outside in a makeshift triage area set up in the front yards of nearby homes. Some of those injured were lifted onto stretchers before being taken away by ambulance. One neighbor estimated that between 100 and 150 people were gathered at the family's two-story brick home, where the front doorway was decorated with red, turquoise and white fabric and a large white tent had been set up with stacks of folding chairs. Men were mostly dressed in white linen pants and shirts, while many women were dressed in brightly colored saris . Lozano said building inspectors don't regulate the number of people in such residential structures. 'We just have to use good judgment,' he said. Neighbor Jill Allred did not attend the party, but descirbed the ensuing scene as total chaos. 'It's crazy,' Allred told Chron.com. 'we can't get in or out of our neighborhood.' Tragically, it appears that the family was greatly looking forward to the day's religious festivities. The family even sent their son around the neighborhood to pass out invitations. 'It was such a nice letter,' said neighbor Leticia Sahagan-Rubio, who nonetheless did not attent. 'I feel bad...they don't deserve this...This is the only party they've ever had.' Sahagan-Rubio said many of them couldn't speak English, so she started . giving them water and letting them inside her home to make phone calls. She . said emergency crews started arriving almost immediately. ‘It was just a stream of ambulances. For 30 minutes, you . could hear nothing but ambulances,’ she said. She said the family who lives at the home, an Indian couple . and their college-aged son, had sent neighbors letters a few days earlier . saying they would be holding a religious ceremony to bless a temple.

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Ap  Reporter . A woman testified she was stunned and confused when Jason Omar Griffith told her that a big plastic tub of cement he wanted to store at her house contained the remains of his ex-girlfriend. Kalae Casorso told a jury in Las Vegas on Friday that she didn't call police because she feared what happened to cabaret dancer Deborah Flores Narvaez could happen to her. Griffith, a Cirque du Soleil performer, is standing trial on charges that he killed Flores in December 2010 by putting a plastic bag her head, before dismembering her body and trying to dispose of it in tubs of cement. Casorso said that when she had asked Griffith - who wanted to store some things at her Vegas home - what was in the tubs, and he said: 'It's Debbie.' Jurors are hearing that Griffith and Flores had a tempestuous relationship, and that Flores told people she was pregnant before she disappeared. Gruesome murder: Jason Omar 'Blu' Griffith (left) is on trial in Las Vegas for allegedly murdering his girlfriend Deborah 'Debbie' Flores Narvaez (right) and dismembering her body in 2010 . Blank stare: Griffith appeared impassive in court Thursday as the prosecutor laid out the evidence for the jury. on Friday, a witness testified that Griffith told her he had hidden the remains of his ex-girlfriend in concrete . Griffith, now 35, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder. Banks said evidence will show he was defending himself when his ex-girlfriend died. 'They will show you pictures, and they will be gruesome and they will be shocking,' Banks said. 'But that does not change the fact ... that he was scared and he was afraid that she was violent, and Jason Griffith was defending himself on Dec. 12, 2010.' Jurors were questioned for three days this week about what they remembered about news reports of Debbie Flores' disappearance in December 2010 and Griffith's arrest in January 2011. The story began as a missing person case, with posters and fliers distributed to the media. It made headlines for weeks through the Christmas and New Year's holidays while Flores' sister, Celeste Flores Narvaez, pleaded publicly for information. On Thursday, the jury heard from Flores Narvaez’s roommate and fellow Fantasy dancer Sonya Sonnenberg, who testified that on the day of the murder, the woman had gone to Griffith’s house to watch Dexter - a TV show about a serial killer - and never returned. Her dismembered, badly decomposing body was discovered weeks later in tubs of cement. Banks said the jury will hear about violence, property crimes, stalking, threats, harassment — all 'by Debbie Flores against Mr. Griffith' — as well as acts of battery and weapons. Horrific: The dismembered body of dancer Deborah Flores Narvaez was found encased in concrete in 2011 . Adult entertainer: Flores Narvaez was a backup dancer in the risque Fantasy revue at Luxor hotel . A key piece of evidence is a video recording that Griffith made while confronting Flores about his car tires being slashed. In it, Flores admits to hitting Griffith, entering his house, looking on his computer, pouring egg whites on his car and slashing three tires. DiGiacomo predicted that every witness in the case would describe a volatile relationship between Flores and Griffith, who was arrested after an October domestic argument with Flores. The prosecutor spent more than an hour weaving a tale of tangled and overlapping romances — and Griffith becoming depressed and suicidal between the October fight with Flores and his 31st birthday on December 10. Griffith, a dancer in the Cirque du Soleil show Love at The Mirage, was having trouble juggling relationships at the time with Flores and with another woman, a dancer in another Cirque show at another Las Vegas Strip resort, DiGiacomo said. Police finally cracked the disappearance-turned-homicide case when they gave Griffith's housemate, Louis Colombo, immunity from prosecution. Opening statement: Prosecutor Marc DiGiacomo told the jury that evidence will prove that Griffith choked Flores Narvaez and asphyxiated her with a plastic bag over her head . Defense strategy: Griffith's lawyer Jeff Banks said his client was afraid that the dancer was violent, and he defended himself . Colombo told police he left the house after seeing Griffith put his hands around Flores' neck as they argued. When he returned, he could see Flores was dead. The tub, with Flores' body and 600lbs of cement, weighed more than 700lbs as Griffith and Colombo tried to wheel it on dollies to a vacant home, the prosecutor said. He said Colombo would describe standing watch outside as Griffith chiseled the big block apart and sawed the legs off Flores' corpse to fit her remains in two smaller concrete-filled tubs that weighed less. 'The problem for Mr. Griffith is, it's painfully apparent that he never does anything alone,' DiGiacomo told the jury as he stood before a video screen showing autopsy photos of the torso and severed legs. Griffith allegedly admitted to a friend that Debbie Flores was in a huge 600lbs tub of cement . Bitter irony: Flores Narvaez’s roommate and fellow Fantasy dancer Sonya Sonnenberg testified that on the day of the murder, the woman had gone to Griffith’s house to watch Dexter - a TV show about a serial killer . Celeste Flores Narvaez, sister of Deborah Flores . Narvaez, was outraged by the defense attorney's theory that the slain dancer was the aggressor .","Jason Omar 'Blu' Griffith, 35, is on trial in the December 2010 murder of Fantasy revue show dancer Deborah Flores Narvaez .

"By . Ap  Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporter . A malnourished 10-year-old boy was found living in squalor in a locked bedroom at an Ontario home, where authorities allege he'd been held for up to two years by his aunt and uncle, police said Friday. The boy was fed twice a day with fast food, was left alone for long stretches each day, did not attend school and spoke limited English, authorities said. Police were alerted to the boy by the Children Aid's Society, which received a tip from the public, London Police Detective Kevin Heslop said. Grotesque: Authorities found the boy in this home in filthy conditions after two years of confinement . According to CHCH, a neighbor saw the boy in the window and called police. Other neighbors told the station they had no idea that a boy was living in the home, and that the homeowners - the boy's aunt and uncle - were 'weird' and that they rarely spoke to anyone. When police arrived to the home where the boy was staying alone at the time, they found him locked in a bedroom with food waste and feces strewn about. 'The bed was soaked in urine as was child's pajamas and there was food remains throughout the house,' said Heslop. 'The child was confused and upset but the child is doing quite well now.' The boy was taken to hospital Thursday and was diagnosed as being underweight and suffering from malnutrition. He has since been released from hospital and is in the care of the Children's Aid Society. Officials said the child had access to a toilet and shower because the home's master bedroom had an en suite bathroom, but said the entire house was in squalid condition. 'It's a horrific case and everyone sees it like that,' said Heslop. 'Of course this is upsetting, it's upsetting to everyone.' Confined: Authorities say the boy was never allowed to leave the home and was fed fast food twice a day . His guardians, an uncle and aunt, were arrested Thursday. The couple was charged with forcible confinement and failing to provide basic necessities. One guardian living in the house also had a 9-year-old biological child who was living with the couple. That child, whose age and gender have not been released, is also now in the care of the Children's Aid Society. Police said there is no evidence that the couple's biological child was confined inside the house and that child attended school. Police are not releasing the name of the couple charged to protect the identity of the children. Police said it had no prior dealings with the couple. Rescue: Authorities say a neighbor saw the boy in the window of the home and called police, who then searched the residence and found him . Heslop said the boy's biological parents are not in Canada, and that he had lived with his aunt and uncle since he came to the country in 2010. Police have not yet been in contact with the parents and would not reveal where the parents are living or where the boy was born. Jane Fitzgerald, executive director of London Children Aid's Society, said she is grateful that a vulnerable child has been rescued. 'We're just getting to know this boy but what I can tell you is that among the first things he wanted was regular food and he wants to go to school,' said Fitzgerald.","Police in London, Ontario were tipped off by neighbors who saw the boy in the window of the home .

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Ap  Reporter . A California youth pastor has been charged with murder after a fight with a Las Vegas man last year ultimately led to his death. Robert Cox of Manteca, California was just passing through Sin City last June when he stopped for a late dinner with his church group en route to Texas. There he encountered 55-year-old Link Ellingson. A scuffle broke out in which Cox pushed Ellingson over, causing him to hit his head. After a six-month coma, Ellingson died from brain hemorrhaging. Scroll down for video . Charged: Pastor Robert Cox (at left with his wife Julie) has been accused of murder in the death of 55-year-old Link Ellingson after a June 15 altercation in Las Vegas . Dead: Link Ellingson slipped into a coma after falling and hitting his head in the June 13 altercation. He died from bleeding in the brain on December 15 . Now, police are holding the beloved pastor responsible for his death even as members of his family and congregation maintain he was acting in self defense. Cox, a pastor at The Place of Refuge church, was booked into the San Joaquin County Jail on Tuesday on murder and fugitive from justice charges. He's awaiting extradition to Nevada. An autopsy report said blunt head trauma from the fight was a significant contributing factor. Cox was on a ministry trip to Texas with his wife and some church interns when they stopped at the Four Kegs pub on June 13, 2013. Group members said they were in the parking lot when Ellingson approached, threatened them and assaulted them. Pastor: 35-year-old Cox is a youth pastor at the Place of Refuge church in Manteca, California. In Spanish, manteca means 'butter' Flock: Members of Cox's congregation, pictured, who were witnesses to the 2013 altercation maintain the pastor was acting in self defense . 'He said, ""Hey girlfriend, you want to 'F' with me?""' witness Kelli Lane told KTXL-TV. ""And Rob was immediately like, 'Oh my gosh, no,' backed up, 'I have kids here,' said no. And the man said, ""Well I'm coming to 'F' with you.""' According to the witnesses, Cox grabbed the man and fell with him to the ground. Ellingson hit his head on the pavement and went unconscious. When he died six months later at Summerlin Hospital, the coroner ruled the case a homicide. According to a Las Vegas police report, Cox initially said he punched Ellingson in the face, but later described grabbing Ellingson's waist and falling to the ground with him. Cox's left ring finger was broken in the confrontation. 'There was . no punch thrown. I can understand where that was implied because his . finger was broken, but from the get go we said that the police report is . false and we need to get it fixed,' Cox's wife, Julie, told the TV . station. Surveillance . video showed Ellingson getting into a fight, but he leaves the frame . for several seconds before he's seen stumbling back and falling, . according to the report. Detectives who reviewed the footage wrote that . it doesn't appear someone fell to the ground with him. Bigger: The late Ellingson was described by Cox's wife as 'huge' and as the aggressor in the fight . Police say Cox first claimed to have punched Ellingson (pictured) but later changed his story . 'My husband was acting (in) total self-defense,' Mrs. Cox told KTXL. 'The attacker was huge. He was assaulting people in the group who were trying to intervene and get him to stop but he wouldn't stop. And that's when my husband grabbed him by the waist.' One member of the church group claimed that five people were assaulted by Ellingson before Cox ever confronted him. Family members said they were told no charges would be filed in the case, but they said a warrant was issued for Cox's arrest without his or his attorney's knowledge. A letter posted on the church's website asks people to donate money to cover Cox's legal fees and to write letters vouching for his character. An aide to Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said he and a prosecutor assigned to the case were not available for comment Friday afternoon.","Robert Cox of Manteca, California was just passing though Sin City with his church group when he encountered Link Ellingson, 55 .

"By . Ap  Reporter . Six days after a family . of four found themselves helpless and adrift in a sailboat far into the . Pacific with a vomiting and feverish 1-year-old aboard, a Navy warship . delivered them safely to San Diego, where they had begun their attempted . around-the world voyage before the child was born. The . Rebel Heart, the 36-foot sailboat that had been their home for seven . years, is at the bottom of the ocean 900 miles off Mexico, sunk by the . rescuers because it was taking on water after losing its steering and . most of its communications. A . satellite phone ping from the boat Thursday set off a huge rescue . effort that began hours later with skydiving National Guardsmen and . involved three federal agencies, a plane, a frigate and scores of . personnel before it was through. Scroll down for video . Back on dry land: The Kaufman family are seen in this April 9 U.S. Navy photo deboarding the guided missile frigate USS Vandegrift after they were rescued with a sick baby nearly 2,000 miles out at sea in a sailboat . Eric and Charlotte Kaufman, with daughters, Lyra, 1, and Cora, 3, were rescued and returned to San Diego by a Navy warship . It also set off a serious debate . over parenting, and the propriety of hitting the high seas with two . kids young enough to be in diapers. The ship, the USS Vandegrift, docked at Naval Air Station North Island about 10 a.m., Navy spokeswoman Lt. Lenaya Rotklein said. In . a photo released by the Navy, the family looked like typical . vacationers, with father Eric dressed in shorts and a baseball cap while . lugging bags, and his wife, Charlotte, walking behind him, holding the . toddler in a strap-on carrier and grasping the hand of her 3-year-old . daughter. The happy . scene was a far cry from the miserable conditions described by Navy . sailors who spoke to reporters after the ship moved to the San Diego . mainland later in the day without the Kaufmans. It . was scheduled to move on to the San Diego mainland later in the day but . without the Kaufmans, who said they want to tend to their 1-year-old . daughter, Lyra, first and get some rest before talking publicly, . Charlotte Kaufman's sister, Sariah English, said. The . Kaufmans' decision to sail around the world with Lyra and her . 3-year-old sister Cora drew accusations of reckless foolishness from . some observers and praise from others for their courageous spirit. Sailors from the frigate USS Vandegrift assist in the rescue of the Kaufman family with a sick infant on the ship's small boat . 'They'll probably go on the 'Today' show to talk about this, and write a book about it, do a miniseries and . get 15 minutes of fame because that's how our country tends to reward . people who choose recklessly to put themselves and their children in . danger,' said Margaret Dilloway, a San Diego novelist who has three children. English doesn't question the decision of her sister's family. She said sailing is their passion. It's what defines them. 'Charlotte and Eric raise their children how they see fit,' English said. 'They . are very concerned about child safety. That's their No. 1 concern, and . they did not do this blindly. They are responsible, good parents.' But . they are aware of the criticism. Eric Kaufman, a Coast Guard-licensed . captain, and his wife sent a statement from the ship defending their . actions, saying 'when we departed on this journey more than a year ago, . we were then and remain today confident that we prepared as well as any . sailing crew could.' Others . said children benefit in many intangible ways from parents who show them . the world, even when they're too young to remember it. The Rebel Heart sailboat, carrying the Kaufman family, became the site of a U.S. Navy rescue Sunday . Ivan Alba said the Kaufmans should be commended. 'I . think it's a great thing, their decision to sail around the world, and . just because their children are 1 and 3 years old doesn't mean they . can't be on a boat,' said Alba, of San Diego, who is also planning a . world trip with his wife and two daughters, 8 and 10. 'It's just too bad . what happened, but that's also life. Anything can happen, anywhere.' Four . California Air National Guard members parachuted to the sailboat . Thursday and stabilized Lyra, who responded well to medication for . Salmonella-like symptoms until the warship arrived Sunday. She . had previously had salmonella in Mexico, where the family had stopped . their voyage for her birth, but her pediatrician assured them she was . recovered and could travel, English said. But shortly into the trip, the child started showing symptoms and did not respond to antibiotics.","Charlotte and Eric Kaufman deny they put their 1-year-old girl Lyra in danger by taking her on their round-the-world trip .

"By . Ap  Reporter . The Hershey company says a Maryland candidate is milking its classic chocolate bar for political gain. Hershey's is suing state Sen. Stephen S. Hershey Jr., accusing him of improperly using signs and other campaign materials that mimic the look of a Hershey's candy bar. The company says in the federal lawsuit filed Friday that the candidate's brown, rectangular campaign logo with white writing imitates the Hershey's bar packaging with its brown background and silver and white writing. The Hershey Company is suing Maryland state Senate candidate Stephen Hershey for what they say is an illegal appropriation of their classic lettering and colors . In the right? Mr. Hershey, who claims to be only very distantly related to the chocolate company's founding family, has used such campaign materials in the past and says it's his constitutional right to continue to do so . Both use similar lettering for the word 'Hershey,' which appears in all capital letters in the center of both designs, but where the chocolate bar says 'milk chocolate,' the politician's logo says 'state senate.' Unlike the chocolate bar, the candidate's logo has a two-tone brown background in the pattern of the state flag. But the candy company says in its lawsuit filed in Maryland that the combination of the light, block letter writing and brown background in a color the company calls 'Hershey maroon' is problematic. The company said in a statement Tuesday that it believes 'this is an unauthorized use of our distinctive and famous design' and that it may 'mislead consumers into believing that Steve Hershey is somehow affiliated with or endorsed by The Hershey Company.' But Hershey, the politician, said in a statement Tuesday that his campaign's actions were 'lawful and the exercise of my constitutional rights.' Hershey has been told his family tree intersects with that of Milton S. Hershey, the candy company's founder, but they are not close relatives. This isn't the first time the candy company and candidate have clashed. The company says in its lawsuit that the dispute dates to 2002 when Hershey was running to be a county commissioner and used similar campaign materials. The company says it wrote Hershey asking him to stop and he did for a time after the election. Classic look: The Hershey Company is asking a judge to force the politician to stop using the familiar look for his campaign materials and to force him to pay the cost of their lawsuit . But the company says he brought back the offending design during his 2010 campaign for state delegate, prompting renewed protests from the Pennsylvania chocolate company and a promise from candidate Hershey to change his campaign materials' font and color in the future. Hershey said in his statement that in the past he has used his name 'on brown background signs with the knowledge and permission' of the company. He said he'd been in discussions with the company over the last months but 'an understanding and agreement was unable to be reached this time.' Now, among other things, the company wants a judge to bar Hershey from using materials with his last name 'in block text or on a brown or maroon background' and to pay for the cost of the lawsuit. Hershey served in Maryland House of Delegates from 2011 to 2013, when he was appointed to a state senate seat. He is now running for re-election.","Maryland state Senator Stephen S.

"A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that the self-described architect of the September 11 attacks will not be allowed to testify in the terrorism trial of Osama bin Laden's son-in-law. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan firmly rejected a request by the lawyers to call Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as a witness at the trial of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith using live, closed-circuit video from Guantanamo Bay, where Mohammed is imprisoned. At a hearing during an off day at Abu Ghaith's trial, Kaplan told the defense that the testimony would be irrelevant because there was no evidence that Mohammed and Abu Ghaith had ever met or even been in the same country. Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama bin Laden's son-in-law and spokesman, is currently on trial in New York, but Khalid Sheikh Mohammed has said that Abu Ghaith had no role in planning al-Qaida operations . He also criticized Abu Ghaith's lawyers for making the request at such a late stage. 'I have considered this very carefully,' Kaplan said. 'This is much ado about nothing.' When defense attorney Stanley Cohen stood to try to argue further, Kaplan ordered him to sit down. 'Too little, too late,' the judge said in a stern tone. 'It's not here. It's denied.' Prosecutors had pointed to a recent written statement by Mohammed that he would refuse to testify in the case as another reason to deny the defense request to call him as a witness. Behind bars: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged Sept. 11 mastermind pictured shortly after his capture during a raid in Pakistan, is currently locked up at Guantanamo Bay . But shortly after the ruling, Cohen sent the judge a letter saying he had received word from Mohammed's lawyer that Mohammed had now 'agreed to be examined without limitation on all relevant topics.' In a letter to the judge late on Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin urged the judge to reject Cohen's latest request, saying nothing the lawyer said made Mohammed's testimony 'material, relevant, exculpatory, non-cumulative or admissible.' Lewin noted that Cohen had cited a 'dramatically changed circumstance.' 'It is not,' Lewin said. The judge did not immediately rule. Abu Ghaith has pleaded not guilty to charges he conspired to kill Americans and aided al-Qaida as the terror group's spokesman after the Sept. 11 attacks. The 48-year-old onetime imam at a Kuwaiti mosque was brought to New York from Turkey last year. Inside job: Abu Gaith is the son-in-law of al-Qaida founder Osama bin Laden . The judge's ruling also bars the jury from considering the 14-page statement Mohammed provided in response to 451 questions from Abu Ghaith's lawyers. In the statement, Mohammed said Abu Ghaith had no military role in al-Qaida - a claim possibly supporting defense arguments that Abu Ghaith had no knowledge of pending al-Qaida attacks when he warned on a widely circulated video after September 11, 2001, that 'the storm of airplanes will not abate.' At the same time, Mohammed's statement seemed to back the government's position that Abu Ghaith was a key player in al-Qaida, saying fighting one of the world's superpowers meant 'we would have to resort to a long war of attrition to which the military and media alike contribute.' Mohammed said he never personally spoke to Abu Ghaith about plots to blow up U.S. airplanes with shoe bombs in December 2001, when Mohammed headed al-Qaida's operations conducted outside of Afghanistan. Abu Ghaith is the highest-level al-Qaida figure to be tried in the U.S. since the September 11 attacks. His trial is scheduled to resume on Wednesday.","Abu Ghaith is charged with conspiring to kill Americans in his role as al-Qaida's spokesman after 9/11 .

"By . Joel Christie . and Ap  Reporter . A convicted pedophile and murderer who has been on death row for over 20 years has stopped a pharmacy from providing the drug that was to be used for his lethal injection - just one week out from his execution. Michael Anthony Taylor, 47, filed a federal lawsuit against The Apothecary Shoppe - a compounding pharmacy in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that provides a made-to-order drug to the Missouri Department of Corrections, where Taylor will be put to death. The claim argued that the drug would cause Taylor 'inhumane pain and suffering'. Taylor - who pleaded guilty to abducting, raping and stabbing to death a 15-year-old Kansas City girl in 1989 at the age of 22 - was scheduled to be executed on February 26. Execution drugs have become increasingly difficult to obtain because most major licensed drug makers have stopped selling pharmaceuticals for use in the death penalty. Michael Anthony Taylor, 47, has been on death row in Missouri for over 20 years for abducting, raping and stabbing to death a 15-year-old girl, but has stopped an Oklahoma pharmacy from providing the drugs for his lethal injection on the grounds they would cause him 'inhumane pain' The Apothecary Shoppe in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has agreed not to provide any drugs that would be used in the execution of Michael Taylor following a federal lawsuit. The Missouri Department of Corrections are said to use the compound pharmacy to source drugs for their lethal injections, after many pharmaceutical companies stopped providing drugs that would be used in lethal injections . Many states, like Missouri, have turned to compounding pharmacies, which manufacture drugs for individual clients. Unlike major drug companies, compounding pharmacies are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In his lawsuit, Taylor alleged that Missouri turned to The Apothecary Shoppe to supply compounded pentobarbital - a powerful prescription barbiturate, or sedative - because the only licensed manufacturer of the drug, Illinois-based Akorn Inc., refuses to provide it for lethal injections. Taylor contends that several recent executions in which compounded pentobarbital was used showed it would likely cause 'severe, unnecessary, lingering and ultimately inhumane pain'. His attorneys used the instance of Michael Lee Wilson, 38, who was executed at Oklahoma State Penitentiary on January 9. Within 20 seconds of receiving the drug, Wilson is said to have said: 'I feel my whole body burning.' Taylor's attorneys alleged the statement was consistent with the receipt of 'contaminated' pentobarbital. Now, according to court documents filed late Monday, Wilson's lawyers have asked a judge to dismiss the case because The Apothecary Shoppe had 'agreed' not to prepare or provide any drug for use in Taylor's lethal injection. The pharmacy also acknowledged it had not already provided any drug to the Missouri Department of Corrections for the execution, according to Taylor's attorney, Matt Hellman. The only licensed manufacturer of the drug pentobarbital, Akorn Inc., which distributes it under the name Nembutal, refused to supply it for the means of lethal injection. The drug is a prescription sedative . The linchpin of Taylor's lawsuit was the January execution of Michael Lee Wilson, 38 (pictured), who is said to have screamed out in pain after being administered compounded pentobarbital . What remains unclear, however, is how the result will affect Taylor's planned execution. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon suggested last week the state had enough drugs for the lethal injection. While refusing to say 'yes' or 'no', he twice said the Department of Corrections was prepared. The Department of Corrections has refused to comment on the case or their use of pentobarbital, saying the ways in which prisoners are executed are not for public knowledge. The Apothecary Shoppe has also declined to comment, saying that the orders they produce are confidential. This is not the first time Taylor has contested the drugs used in his execution. He was hours away from undergoing a lethal injection in 2006 when the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of execution over concerns about whether the state's . three-drug method could violate the constitutional guarantee against . cruel and unusual punishment. Missouri has executed three men in the past three months, all of them using pentobarbital. Missouri had previously used a three-drug execution protocol.","Michael Anthony Taylor pleaded guilty to the 1989 rape and stabbing murder of a 15-year-old Kansas City girl he and an accomplice abducted from a bus station under the influence of crack cocaine .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap  Reporter . One of two people charged with enslaving a mentally disabled woman for two years with her child denied on Wednesday that she hurt the woman or locked her inside a filthy basement room. Jessica Hunt told jurors that she tried to help the woman care for her daughter and blamed two others who already pleaded guilty and testified against her and her boyfriend. 'I was not doing bad things to her,' Hunt said in federal court. Scroll down for video . An FBI affidavit says Dezerah Silsby, 21, admitted she used ice cream to lure the woman and her daughter from their relative's house to captivity . Jessica Hunt, 31, and Jordie Callahan, 26 are accused of keeping Shannon Eckley as a slave for two years - threatening her and milking her of government benefits . Hunt and Jordie Callahan have pleaded . not guilty to charges accusing them of raiding the woman's bank account . and public assistance and forcing her to cooperate through sexual and . physical abuse. Prosecutors said Mentally-disabled Shannon Eckley and . her five-year-old daughter were held in modern-day slavery - they allegedly were threatened with a python and pit bulls while being forced . to live in a damp, dark basement with a lock on the door and no bathroom . in the northern Ohio town of Ashland. They said the ordeal lasted from . early 2011 to late 2012. The two victims were kept her in a . room with a free-ranging iguana and were ordered to feed the reptile . fruits and vegetables her daughter was denied, according to court . papers. 'The living conditions were simply subhuman,' said Steven Dettelbach, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. Threats: The suspects are accused of threatening to make their snakes and their pit bulls attack Eckley and her daughter if she didn't do their bidding . Callahan is seen with one of the massive pythons he owned and used to threaten Shannon Eckley . The . mother and daughter were sometimes forced to eat dog food, according to . a law enforcement source with first-hand knowledge of the . investigation. They were also frequently denied access to the bathroom. The two people who pleaded guilty earlier in the forced-labor case are scheduled for sentencing this month. Dezerah . Silsby, who was accused of using ice cream to lure the woman and her . child to captivity, entered a plea under the terms of a sealed . agreement. She earlier testified that she drove the woman and Hunt to an . ATM to get money using the woman's government funds debit card. Hunt . said that the woman gave her the debit card because she didn't have a . purse to keep it and that she never ordered her to give it up. The . woman volunteered to injure herself, Hunt said, to help the defendants . obtain pain pills. Hunt said Silsby slammed the woman's hand in a door . and then smashed her hand with a rock before she went to a hospital to . get the medicine. 'I didn't tell her to do that, and she offered me the pills,' Hunt said. Hunt also said she told the woman that she could leave any time. The Ashland case has dark similarities to last month's revelation in Cleveland that three women had been keep captive for a decade . Daniel Brown is accused of aiding Hunt and Callahan . Police . first got involved when the woman was arrested on a candy bar . shoplifting case and asked to be jailed because people had been mean to . her. Authorities said . the abuse allegation was a ruse complete with a video staged by the . suspects. They said the suspects had forced the woman to act as if she . were mistreating her child. The . woman later pleaded guilty to child endangering and was sentenced in . February to about five months in jail. She served only part of that . sentence. Between May . 2011 and October 2012, Eckley and her daughter were locked in the . basement of an apartment in Ashland, Ohio, and forced to do housework . and look after Hunt's four children. All the while, Callahan and Hunt stole her government benefits and used the money on themselves, authorities say. Eckley's enslavement bears chilling . similarity to the case of Ariel Castro, the man who was charged last . month with kidnapping three woman and keeping them against their will in . his house for ten years while he repeatedly raped, beat and emotionally . tortured them. Castro's house of horrors is located in Cleveland, Ohio, 65miles northeast of Ashland. Federal charges allege Callahan and Hunt also repeatedly beat Eckley and her toddler daughter. When they were not beating them to keep them in line, they used their pets. The pair kept a poisonous coral snake, a ball python and a Burmese python that weighed 130 pounds as well as lizards, spiders, scorpions and 'numerous' dogs - including pit bulls. The pair used these pets to terrify and menage Eckley and her young daughter - threatening to turn them loose on the captives if they didn't behave.

Callahan also allegedly used a gun to threaten Eckley on one occasion, as well. Callahan . and Hunt invited Eckley and her daughter to come live with them in May . 2011. Authorities allege she arrived in a living hell. Once she moved . in, the pair began treating her as a slave. They . initially locked her in the basement and forced her to sleep on the . concrete floor without a mattress. They deprived her of food - while . lavishing attention on their animals. The pair allegedly harvested the money Eckley received from government benefits and used the money for themselves. They also used her to get drugs. In December 2011, Callahan allegedly bashed Eckley's hand with a rock. He then took her to a doctor - leaving her child at the apartment - and told her to request a prescription for Valium. Once she got the narcotics, Callahan and Hunt used them for themselves. Callahan and Hunt invited Eckley and her daughter to come live with them in May 2011 . They executed the stunt a second time, as well. On that occasion, Callahan kicked Eckley in the hip.

"By . Ap  Reporter . 'America's most patriotic rock band' performed America's most patriotic song at Daytona International Speedway on Saturday - and the reviews were far from proud. Madison Rising's heavy rock rendition of the American national anthem had a few drivers chuckling and some fans shaking their heads before the Nationwide Series season opener. U.S. sports website Larry Brown Sports labelled it 'a joke' and 'the worst rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner we have ever seen at a sporting event'. Some of the athletes were not much nicer.

'Yes, we took some liberties,' lead singer Dave Bray said before the performance. 'But we were already taking some liberties with it musically and melodically. 'We wanted to make it a rock song people could sing and enjoy. 'The reverence is still there, but it has sort of taken on the death march in a way. 'It's very sullen and sung in a very sullen way.

"By . Ap  Reporter . A group of art collectors filed a lawsuit against the Keith Haring foundation on Friday, claiming it has cost them at least $40 million by publicly labeling about 90 paintings by the late artist as 'counterfeit' and 'fake' as it refuses to fully evaluate them. The lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan portrayed the Keith Haring Foundation Inc.'s approach to authentication as irrational and irresponsible, saying its authentication committee operated for many years 'in secret, with little or no explanation, and often without ever physically inspecting the works'. It said the foundation Haring started shortly before he died of AIDS in 1990 disbanded the committee in 2012 to shield itself from litigation over its decisions but continued to obstruct the emergence of new Haring works through 'malicious and wrongful tactics', including shutting down the display of Haring art at a Miami show in March. The work of Keith Haring is among the most iconic of the twentieth century. His catoonish paintings focused on 1980's New York street culture and often featured social messages . Keith Harding died of AIDS in 1990. He was 31. His art is worth between $500,000 to $1 million a piece . Several collectors filed a $40 million defamation lawsuit on Friday against the foundation of late New York City painter Keith Haring, which has publicly stated roughly 80 works owned by the dealers are fakes . The foundation last year sued organizers of the 'Haring Miami' show, saying it was intended to defraud the public by exhibiting 200 purported works of art by Haring that were mostly fakes. The foundation said the paintings, mostly acrylic on canvas, would be worth about $40 million if they were authentic. 'Putting all these cheap Haring fakes into the market will depress the market and irreparably destroy the value of the authentic art and the reputation of the artist and the artwork,' foundation lawyers wrote. In legal papers, they said a foundation director who visited the Miami show was 'shocked at the blatant fraud involved' and saw only about eight authentic Haring works there. Attorneys for the Haring foundation did not immediately comment on the New York lawsuit. Visitors walk past an untitled art creation by Keith Haring during an exhibition retrospective in Paris in 2013 . Haring, whose work focused on New York City's 1980s street culture, often with political or social messages, died in 1990. Authenticated works by the artist can fetch between $500,000 and $1 million each . Keith Haring pictured here in 1985 . Nine art collectors maintained in their lawsuit Friday that the foundation was motivated to restrict the discovery of new Haring art in part to boost the value of paintings already on the market, including some pieces that the foundation itself sold between 2008 and 2011 for $4.6 million, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit said a certificate of authenticity greatly increases the value of a piece of art, making it available for sale through major auction houses as well as through private buyers. The lawsuit was brought by collectors who it said began buying works in 2007 from two of Haring's friends. One of them was Haring's former lover, a DJ who was introduced to Haring in 1982 and says the prolific artist gave him numerous pieces in the 1980s. The others were obtained from a graffiti artist, Delta Cortez. Keith Haring's artwork is among the most recognizable of the 20th century -- but the authenticity of roughly 90 paintings has been called into question . Pictures of the artwork, attached to the lawsuit as an exhibit, had titles such as 'Blue Baby', 'Baseball Mitt', 'Angel Winged TV' and 'Green Man Holding Red Baby' and were in Haring's cartoonish sketching style. Because many buyers wanted paperwork certifying the art as authentic, Cortez sometime after 1999 contacted the foundation, the lawsuit said. A representative initially expressed strong interest and asked for pictures and descriptions of the art, but the foundation eventually told him it would authenticate one or two of the pieces if he gave the foundation 10 pieces, according to the lawsuit. Cortez again contacted the foundation in 2006 but was told that the foundation was not certifying artworks like the ones he wished to submit at that time and further conversations and inquiries 'proved fruitless', the lawsuit said.","Keith Haring is an iconic New York artist famous for his cartoon-style street culture paintings .

"By . Ap  Reporter . Alex Rodriguez ended his extended and acrimonious fight with Major League Baseball on Friday, withdrawing a pair of lawsuits and accepting a season-long suspension that marks the longest penalty in the sport's history related to performance-enhancing drugs. Rodriguez, who has steadfastly denied using banned substances while with the New York Yankees, made the decision nearly four weeks after arbitrator Fredric Horowitz largely upheld the discipline issued last summer by baseball Commissioner Bud Selig. 'I think it's a good move for him,' former Commissioner Fay Vincent said. 'A-Rod had no chance legally, and the commissioner got his authority validated.' Outta there: Suspended New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez abandoned his fight against Major League Baseball on Friday, dropping his lawsuit for tortious interference in U.S. District Court in Manhattan . Rodriguez was among 14 players suspended last summer following MLB's investigation of a Florida anti-aging clinic accused of distributing banned substances. Given the harshest punishment, A-Rod was the only player to contest his penalty. The Major League Baseball Players Association filed a grievance, arguing Rodriguez's 211-game ban was unwarranted or at the very least excessive. Rodriguez also sued MLB and Selig in October, accusing them of 'vigilante justice' as part of a 'witch hunt' against him. Horowitz presided over 12 days of hearings last fall highlighted by Rodriguez's decision not to testify. Horowitz concluded on Jan. 11 there was 'clear and convincing evidence' Rodriguez used three banned substances over the course of three years — human growth hormone, testosterone and Insulin-like growth factor 1. Horowitz also ruled A-Rod twice tried to obstruct baseball's investigation, but he nonetheless reduced the suspension to 162 games plus the 2014 postseason after weighing it against baseball's 'just cause' standard. Alex Rodriguez leaves the offices of Major League Baseball in New York on September 30, 2013. Rodriguez accepted his season-long suspension from Major League Baseball, the longest penalty in the sport's history related to performance-enhancing drugs . Rodriguez sued MLB and the union two days later in federal court in Manhattan. But the Supreme Court has established narrow grounds for overturning arbitration decisions, and legal experts said Rodriguez had virtually no chance of succeeding in his attempt to have Horowitz's decision vacated. Without making any admissions, Rodriguez's lawyers filed notices of dismissal in both cases Friday. MLB issued a low-key statement calling the decision to end the litigation 'prudent'. 'We believe that Mr. Rodriguez's actions show his desire to return the focus to the play of our great game on the field and to all of the positive attributes and actions of his fellow major league players,' the sport said. 'We share that desire.' Rodriguez had angered many of his fellow players by suing his own union in an attempt to avoid a suspension. Withdrawing the lawsuits was perhaps the start of mending relationships with fellow players. 'Alex Rodriguez has done the right thing by withdrawing his lawsuit,' the union said in a statement. 'His decision to move forward is in everyone's best interest.' Alex Rodriguez (right) runs sprints with fellow Yankee Derek Jeter. A-Rod has accepted a 162-game ban for using controlled substances, which he has long denied . Rodriguez in 2009 admitted he used banned substances from 2001-03 while with Texas, before baseball had penalties in place for PEDs. After MLB's investigation was sparked 13 months ago by a report in Miami New Times, Rodriguez repeatedly said he had not failed any drug test and claimed evidence provided to MLB by Anthony Bosch, founder of the Biogenesis of America clinic, was not trustworthy. When Horowitz issued his decision, the three-time AL MVP defiantly proclaimed, 'No player should have to go through what I have been dealing with'. He announced: 'I am exhausting all options to ensure not only that I get justice, but that players' contracts and rights are protected.' But a few hours after the Arizona Diamondbacks became the first team this year to start spring training workouts, and with the Yankees a week from opening camp, Rodriguez folded quietly. He was in Miami on Friday and made no public remarks. 'The statements that were issued say everything that needs to be said. We have no further comments on this matter,' Joseph Tacopina, one of Rodriguez's nine attorneys, said in an email. Tacopina said Rodriguez no longer intended to report this month to the Yankees' training camp in Tampa, Fla. New York Yankees' Alex Rodriguez heads to the dugout during the Yankees' 5-1 loss to the Boston Red Sox in a baseball game at Fenway Park in Boston on September 14, 2013 . Suspensions only cover regular-season games and the postseason, with exhibitions specifically exempted. Rodriguez will lose most of his $25 million salary — Horowitz ruled he is entitled to 21-183rds, which comes to $2,868,852.46. The third baseman will be 39 when he is eligible to return in a year, and he has incentive to play during the final three seasons of his contract. The Yankees owe him $21 million in 2015 and $20 million in each of the final two seasons of the record $275 million, 10-year deal. But the 14-time All-Star has been hobbled by injuries in recent years and has not played a full season since 2007. The timing of Rodriguez's decision was set in motion by U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos, who on Jan. 30 told the player's lawyers to respond by Friday to arguments from MLB and the union that the case should be dismissed. Rodriguez does have one lawsuit remaining. He sued Yankees physician Dr. Christopher Ahmad and New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York State Supreme Court in October, claiming they mishandled his medical care during the 2012 AL playoffs. Rodriguez later was diagnosed with a hip injury that required surgery and did not return to the Yankees until Aug. 5 — hours after his suspension was announced by Selig.","A-Rod appears ready to accept the penalty for using performance-enhancing drugs .

"By . Will Stewart . Female football fans in Russia are being forced to strip completely naked by police as an alleged security measure before being allowed into a match, it emerged today. Supporter Ekaterina Stepanova, 26, denounced the searches which some reports say were carried out by male police officers - though she talks of female cops - as 'humiliation'. The alarming treatment for women fans came ahead of a match in Kazan, a host city for the 2018 football World Cup. Police tried to strip search Spartak Moscow fan Ekaterina Stepanova, 26, before a match in Kazan, a host city for the 2018 football World Cup . Stepanova, 26, denounced the searches which some reports say were carried out by male police officers - though she talks of female cops - as 'humiliation' Police in the city today  refused to apologise claiming officers were acting properly in conducting the strip searches. It was unclear whether officers will force foreign women to undergo similar strip searches during the World Cup. Fans of Spartak Moscow complained of the treatment at an away game with Rubin Kazan. The allegations were aired by Stepanova in a blog which has gone viral. A former beauty queen for the Moscow club - Miss Spartak 2013 - she claimed fans were singled out and 'required to strip, and that includes being demanded to remove their underwear'. The intimate searches lasted for up to ten minutes, she said. Stepanova indicates in her blog that female police officers rather than male were involved. The seaches happened during a match between Rubin Kazan and Spartak Moscow at the Tsentraliniy Stadium in Kazan, Russia. This is a file picture form a match between the two clubs in 2010 . Stepanova said the intimate searches lasted for up to ten minutes . The Russian premier league has condemned the 'rough treatment' of female fans over the strip searches . 'Before the game there were problems with the inspection of the girls. Girls were forced to strip, including taking off the underwear,' she wrote. 'I encourage all the girls who were forced to undress, which violates their constitutional rights, offends their honour and dignity, to apply to the official fan club for legal help. 'The more statements made by us, the more likely it is that the police will start treating us with respect. Do not stay indifferent. This concerns us all.' Stepanova is a former beauty queen for the Moscow club, and named Miss Spartak in 2013 . Stepanova said women were waiting in line to be searched when she arrived at the stadium . Police did not say if male fans were forced to undergo the same treatment . She said that on reaching the stadium in Kazan - the capital of the mainly Muslim republic of Tatarstan: 'Women were waiting in line to enter the room located under the stand. 'The line was growing rapidly, as the search of each girl took seven to 10 minutes. The search was conducted by three to four police officers. 'A girl that left the room said that the police forced her to undress. I went into the room, and was led into a cage. 'I was offer to sit down on a chair and take off my shoes. I took them off and then put on. 'A police officer said that I shouldn't put the shoes on because I have to stand barefoot on the mat and undress. 'Our conversation went like this: . - I will not undress. - So you will not enter the stadium. - I'm at the stadium already, the ticket was scanned, I'm doing nothing illegal. - We have an order. - Show me a document that specifies exactly how you should carry out the search. You can search me while I'm in my clothes, but I will not undress. 'A police officer then inspected me as usual, feeling my shorts and T-shirt with dirty gloves.' - You are free, she muttered. 'I breathe out, and started heading for the exit of the cell when I was stopped by a dark-haired, short, thin woman police boss, as signified by the uniform. - You were not inspected properly, so you will not enter the stadium. 'I turned to the young lady, who let me go and asked: 'Have you inspected me?' 'She nodded. 'I decided to ignoring the 'boss' but she stopped me saying that she wouldn't allow me to enter the stadium. I answered that I wouldn't talk to her and will to talk to a more competent supervisor. 'I felt uneasy. To the left of me there were all the girls who were waiting for a search. On my right, the girls who were searched. They were completely undressed. Including their underwear. 'I was shocked. I told the policewoman about humiliation, about the Constitution of the Russian Federation, about the violation of human rights, about the law, about the order, that should have the description of carrying out the search. A source at the Interior Ministry which is responsible for police matters said that there was no problem in the naked searches . 'I was taken out of the room to a metal detector, through which people were entering all sectors. 'There was an employee standing by the metal detector who was letting the girls who have gone through this humiliation pass. I was asked to stay there and wait for some boss. ' A Tatarstan police officer assured me that it's all done for our own safety. 'What if you have a bomb somewhere!' she said to me. 'I looked at her with eyes open wide, saying it would have exploded long time ago because of them. 'You go to the event, and we must inspect everyone carefully' - she continued. 'I explained to her that I go to different public events, including non-sporting ones, and have never faced such a humiliating treatment. 'Visiting a play, concert or show is considered going to events. Are there such inspections? I doubt it. Perhaps only in the Republic of Tatarstan they have such rules? 'By the way, at my request, none of the police officers introduced themselves. No documents were shown. 'All this lasted for an hour and a half. As a result, the police officer received a phone call and I was silently allowed to the sector. That was my victory. 'I am sincerely sorry for all the girls that were not standing for their identity and dignity and silently took off their underwear. In this case, the law was on our side. Never allow to humiliate yourself.' The Russian premier league has condemned the 'rough treatment' of female fans over the strip searches. But a source at the Interior Ministry which is responsible for police matters said that there was no problem in the naked searches. 'The fans have a right to complain if they are not happy with the police. Police officers were acting within the law while conducting the searches,' he said. 'Before the match, every officer was instructed that if the police had any suspicions that the fans are trying to smuggle prohibited items into the stadium, they could ask a person to take off some clothes in a special room.' The police did not say if male fans were forced to undergo the same treatment. Nor did they argue that there any special warning of threats to the stadium at the time of this game.","Spartak Moscow fan Ekaterina Stepanova denounced the searches .

"By . Will Stewart . British medical student Mohammed Yahia Abu El Gasim is stranded in Donetsk region after a terrifying ordeal as a captive of pro-Russian rebels, it was revealed today . A British medical student is stranded in Donetsk region after a terrifying ordeal as a captive of pro-Russian rebels, it was revealed today. His parents and friends are 'desperate' over his fate in eastern Ukraine after he was earlier wrongly reported to be dead by a rebel leader, and separately accused of being a 'spy'. In fact, he was held for around two weeks as a 'slave' before being released from captivity yesterday, it is understood. Aged 21, Mohammed Yahia Abu El Gasim is British born, of Sudanese parents, living in Hounslow, and is a medical student at Donetsk University. He today called his parents in London after being released in Amrosievka, 40 miles from Donetsk, but concerns remain about his welfare. A rescue effort was underway today to locate him and bring him out of rebel-held territory. He is now believed to be in Donetsk city which is under siege from the Ukrainian army. A family friend said: 'He got into an argument because he wasn't speaking Russian. A rebel patrol picked him up. 'Then the rebels blogged that his was among the bodies of several ""black mercenaries"" fighting for the government. 'The blog showed his passport and said he and the others were all in Ukraine uniforms. 'But in fact he was alive and was put to work digging trenches. 'Apparently he was released yesterday morning. But as of late last night, we still had not heard from him.' It is understood he called his parents early today. Russia has said more than 430 Ukrainian government troops have crossed the border to Russia and officially requested asylum. Pictured are Ukrainian forces at a tent camp yesterday in Rostov-On-Don, Russia . In a post on July 28 by rebel commander Igor Strelkov he spoke of 'mercenaries of the Negro race' being killed after a battle with Ukrainian forces. The rebels have made several efforts to prove that U.S. or British mercenaries were deployed by Kiev, and this appeared to be the latest ploy to convince the media this was the case. Strelkov - accused by Kiev of being a Russian intelligence colonel - in a note to journalists wrote: 'The commander of the local unit of the Militia is prepared to provide to you, for the purpose of shooting video, the corpses of the killed [mercenaries]. They still lie untouched on the battlefield - specifically so that they can be captured on video. How you manage to make it there is your own concern; however, in this case, I'm providing you with the information.' However, no images of such corpses were seen and university sources insisted that as of yesterday the student was alive though 'lost' in Donetsk. A separate site earlier alleged he and another 'Sudanese' arrested in the rebel region 'could be spies' and were in control of local security officials. A university official in charge of the welfare of foreign students said today: 'We have not had problems with our students before this case, even those with a darker skin were walking in Donetsk without trouble. An armed guard seen in a tent camp for soldiers of the Ukrainian government's forces yesterday in Rostov-On-Don, Russia . 'This student happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. 'I spoke to the young girl who witnessed it. It was in the street near a shop when one Russian man did not like it that our student spoke English. 'He said something like - ""this is Russian area, it is only allowed to speak Russian here, no English"". 'Our students are normally very quiet and hate conflicts. I am sure he was not the first who attacked, but at the end it there was a small fight, and somebody called the Donetsk People's Republic (as the self-styled rebels call their region) people to sort it out. 'They took away our student and later called to say that he was arrested for two weeks for hooliganism. 'I know that he spent these two weeks somewhere outside Donetsk, doing some digging work for the DPR. A pro-Russian separatist looks through binoculars as Dutch and Australian forensic experts continue recovery work at the site of the downed Malaysian airliner MH17 . 'On Monday, we got a phone call from DPR that he was released. 'This is all we know, our boy is somewhere there in the streets, and he does not have a mobile to call us. 'We have told about him to all who can help.' The university official said she is desperately trying to get back to the city to help find him. 'There is no safe route now. I must find a way to get there. I hope our boy will get help from somebody.' The Foreign Office is understood to be aware of the case.","Mohammed Yahia Abu El Gasim was held for two weeks as a 'slave' before being released from captivity yesterday, it is understood .

"By . Will Stewart . Karina Chikitova survived 11 nights and days in the Siberian taiga which is infested with wolves and bears . A three-year-old girl has survived 11 days and nights on her own in the Siberian taiga which is infested with wild bears and wolves. Karina Chikitova was saved by her puppy who kept her warm for more than a week before leaving her to return home to summon help. The girl survived eating wild berries and drinking river water in territory roamed by bears and wolves, according to The Siberian Times. 'Rescuers searching for her confronted a bear highlighting the extraordinary danger she faced', it said. Yet the worst she suffered were mosquito bites and scratches to her feet. Karina wandered away from her home in a remote village accompanied by her puppy whose name has not been revealed despite its heroism. The small girl made herself beds in the long grasses, which are common in the summer in the south-west of the Sakha Republic, Russia's largest region. However, the tall grasses made it impossible for search helicopters and drones to spot Karina who wore only a red undershirt and purple stockings when she was found. Sakha is also Siberia's coldest region in winter but at this time of year the nighttime temperatures were slightly above zero, around 6C. Karina's mother, who has not yet been named, believed her daughter had accompanied her father Rodion when he left on a trip on July 27 to his distant native village. In fact, the father did not realise his daughter had followed him with her puppy and she became lost in the taiga. Experts say her chances of survival for such a long period were minimal. Four days after Karina had gone her mother finally got hold of her husband and realised that her daughter was lost and a massive search was launched. Initially, Karina's family and the rescue teams were distraught when the dog - which has not been named despite its heroic role - returned to the girl's village of Olom in Olyokminsky district, some nine days after Karina had been missing. In fact the animal's instinct to seek help was vital to saving Karina. Lucky: Rescuers hold little Karina Chikitova who survived eating wild berries and drinking river water . 'Two days before we found Karina her puppy came back home,' said Afanasiy Nikolayev, spokesman for the Sakha Republic Rescue Service. 'That was the moment when our hearts sank, because we thought at least with her dog Karina had chances to survive - night in Yakutia are cold and some areas have already gone into minus temperatures. 'If she was to hug her puppy, we thought, this would have given her a chance to stay warm during nights and survive. Found: The small girl is found sitting in the long grasses which are common in the south-west of the Sakha Republic . The little girl's face peers out from the long grasses in the Siberian taiga where she was found . Survivor: Experts say her chances of survival for such a long period were minimal . 'So when her dog came back we thought that's it - even if she was alive - and chances were slim - now she would have definitely have lost all hopes. Our hearts truly and deeply sank.' However, the dog guided the rescuers to the stranded girl. 'It was Karina's puppy that helped the adults find the girl,' said a report by NTV news. 'When it came back home two days ago her family had lost hope, thinking this definitely meant Karina had no chance. A psychologist with the rescue team said the girl's mind had not been hurt and that she was acting normally . 'But then it was the puppy that showed rescuers the way to Karina, and in the morning  she was found.' The television report said Karina 'was conscious and looked surprisingly well. 'She was given food and drinks, and then with her mother she was first sent to the district hospital and then to Yakutsk, the regional capital. 'She doesn't want to speak about the time she spent in taiga, or not yet. The only thing she said that she was eating berries and drank water from rivers.' Rescuers spent days looking for the child who was lost in the Siberian taiga which is infested with wild bears . The taiga forests of eastern Siberia cover more than a quarter of Russia's territory and is infested with wolves . The taiga is home to Russia's largest populations of brown bear, moose, wolf, red fox and reindeer . Nikolayev said the rescuers guided by the dog spotted traces of her bare feet and this helped them find her. 'We began searches, thinking that if she had lost her shoes she would try and stay away from the deep forest, because there are a lot of sharp sticks there,' he said. Suddenly with the dog's help 'we saw Karina siting in the grass', he said. 'We rushed to her, got her a little tea and grabbed her to run back to the car and doctors.' Nikolayev said the rescuers guided by the dog spotted traces of her bare feet . It took four days to realise that Karina was missing and a massive search was launched . Nikolayev said: 'I carried Karina myself to the car, and she was light as a bird. 'She weighed hardly ten kilograms - but amazingly she was fully conscious.' Ekaterina Andreeva, a psychologist with the rescue team, said: 'We can say that the girl's mind was not hurt. She is talking, she reacts normally to everything around her. 'She recalls what happened to her.' Amazingly she suffered no major physical injury though she has scratches on her feet. She had been badly bitten by mosquitoes and other insects. The taiga is home to Russia's largest populations of brown bear, moose, wolf, red fox and reindeer. It is one of the most extensive natural forests left in the world.","Karina Chikitova saved by puppy who kept her warm for more than a week .

"By . Will Stewart . New mystery surrounds Vladimir Putin's elder daughter Maria after the Russia embassy in London strongly denied a widely-used picture was her. The diplomatic intervention came after stories appeared that she and her Dutch partner had fled their home near The Hague after criticism of her father over his support for pro-Moscow rebels in Ukraine accused of the shooting down of flight MH17. Earlier there was a call for her to be deported from the Netherlands where she is reported to live with her Dutch partner Jorrit Faassen, 34, an executive for a Russian consultancy firm. A picture purporting to be Maria, 29, showed her walking next to her parents in Moscow but embassy press secretary Alexei Dobrinsky has strongly denied it was her . A picture purporting to be Maria, 29, showed her walking next to her parents in Moscow but embassy press secretary Alexei Dobrinsky accused the media of a lack of professionalism, and insisted the image showed a participant of a Putin meeting with young people during an election campaign. Bloggers in Moscow yesterday identified the woman as lawyer Daria  Zakharova, 34, the head of a department at RozMolodezh, a state youth agency. One said that Zakharova would be 'very surprised to find out whose daughter she has suddenly become'. She was currently on maternity leave after giving birth in January, it was claimed. Questions were also raised in Moscow in recent days over another picture of a woman in a park who it was claimed was Maria Putin amid some claims this image showed a model . While the picture has been used all around the world, blogger Teh-Nomad insisted she 'is not at all Putin's daughter'. Denying . the image showed the president's elder child, the Russian envoy neither . provided a correct picture nor challenged that she lived in Holland . with her partner.

Putin - who is divorced from Maria's mother Lyudmila - jealously guards his family's private life. The couple have another daughter, Ekaterina, 28. The Kremlin leader has not allowed his daughters to be photographed in public since becoming president for the first time 14 years ago. Police last week stepped up surveillance outside the Dutch apartment after she became the target of threats on Twitter and messages on web forums called on people to protest outside the luxury riverside penthouse in Voorschoten. Of the 298 deaths on the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, 193 were from Holland. Locals said the couple had not been seen in the area since Flight MH17 was brought down ten days ago. The mayor of the city of Hilversum, Pieter Broertjes, called for Ms Putin to be deported from the country in a radio interview. He later apologised for his comments, saying the demands were 'not wise' but 'stemmed from a feeling of helplessness that many will recognise'.","Embassy press secretary says picture purporting to show Maria is not her .

"By . Will Stewart . The Russian airline pilots who dramatically avoided a high-speed collision with a grounded plane as they came in to land have criticised their opposite numbers for pulling out in front of them. Shocking footage of the near-miss, which took place at Barcelona Airport on Saturday, shows a Boeing 767, flown by Russian airline UTair, swooping in over the runway. But as the plane bears down on the tarmac, a seemingly oblivious Aerolineas Argentineas Airbus A340 taxis in front of the incoming jet, which pulls up sharply to avoid disaster. Scroll down for video . Dramatic footage: The video shows the moment a aircraft was forced to abort its landing after another plane taxis across its path at Barcelona airport . The pilots then perform a 'go-around' emergency procedure, and manage safely to land their craft, carrying 260 tourists, on their second attempt. Commenting on the dramatic procedure to the Siberian Times, the plane's co-pilot Kirill Kuzmin also criticsed the Spanish airport's traffic controllers for falling silent during the disaster, leaving them to handle the dangerous situation themselves. He said: 'Before getting close to the runway we heard the air traffic controller's command allowing Argentinians to cross the runway after we had landed'. 'The Argentinians repeated the comment which meant that they heard and accepted it. But then suddenly - and without a clear reason - the Argentinians got onto the runway just as our altitude was going below 100 metres. 'The air traffic controller clearly got confused. He went silent... We had nothing else to do than go on a second round. 'We have worked on this situation many times during training.' Nikolay . Limarev, the captain of the plane, said the incident 'could have been . serious if the weather was not clear as it was on that day'. He . also criticsed traffic controllers, saying: 'As we were getting ready . to land, about 10, 15 seconds prior to reaching the rear end of the . runway, we noticed the Argentinian Airbus A340-300 moving at 60 degrees . towards the runway we were approaching.' 'Worst experiences ever': The Boeing 767 comes into land at the airport as the Airbus taxis across the runway . 'Go-around': The Boeing pilot is forced to abort the landing, pulling up and going around the other plane . 'The weather was fine, so after the Argentinian plane reached the runway and got onto it, we went onto a second round, not waiting for the air traffic controller's command. 'It took us about 15 minutes to complete the second round. When we finished it we approached the airport again and successfully landed at El Prat. 'As we were taxiing the airport's controller apologised on the radio for the situation.' UTair - one of Russia's largest airlines, based at Khanty-Mansiysk in Siberia - praised the captain for his 'composure and professional excellence' after 'appropriately' assessing the situation. The airline said that the matter was under 'investigation'. Spanish airport authority AENA announced a request for the country's civil aviation safety commission, CIAIAC, to examine the near miss and its causes. David Guillamon, spokesman for the Spanish air-traffic controller association, Aprocta, said the incident was a 'serious case', but said that - despite appearances -  there was 'no danger of a collision.' Aerolineas Argentinas also insisted that nothing was amiss during the incident. A spokesman said: 'Aerolineas Argentinas affirms there was never a situation of risk in the supposed incident registered on Saturday at Barcelona Airport between a Russian UTair plane and an Aerolineas Argentinas plane. 'A spokesman for the Spanish airports authority AENA stated the UTair landing could have taken place without any risk as both planes were in the places they should have been with sufficient distance between each other.' Safe landing: The Boeing 767 from Russian airline Utair lands after the near-miss at Barcelona airport . As the Boeing approached the runway, the Airbus had already taxied clear of the location on the way to its own runway for takeoff, he said. The heart-stopping incident, which occurred on Saturday, was caught on camera by Miguel Angel, who posted the video to YouTube, where it has already been viewed more than one million times. Mr Angel, who has posted hundreds of plane videos online, said seeing the near-miss was 'one of the worst experiences I have ever had'. He said: 'An Utair Boeing 767-300 (VQ-BSX) incoming from Moscow as UT5187 and Aerolíneas Argentinas Airbus A340-300 (LV-FPV) were involved into what could be the bigger disaster of Barcelona Airport. 'The Utair 767 was about to land on Runway 02 while the Argentinas was crossing the runway. 'By the time Russian pilots sight Argentinas (they were taxiing to Holding point of RW25R for take-off) on runway while they were on final approach, they did their best making an impressive and close go around.

Graham Phillips, a stringer for Russian English-language channel RT, was with a group of journalists covering battles for Donetsk Airport. One account said:  ‘Journalists who were with him refused to go further because it was extremely dangerous.’ There was an unconfirmed claim that the 35-year-old reporter had been ‘taken prisoner’. A journalist who expected to work with him today, Vsevolod Petrovskiy, said: ‘I got a phone call this night and I was told he was missing. ‘He got close to the Ukrainian army position at Donetsk airport. He went with a friend of mine.’ Colleagues had previously warned Mr Phillips against taking undue risks in covering the conflict. An RT source said: ‘We have been trying to reach our stringer Graham Phillips but failed so far. 'Yesterday he warned us that he was going to go to the airport of Donetsk where there was active shooting. We asked him not to do it because it was extremely dangerous.

"By . Will Stewart . Vladimir Putin today plunged Russia into permanent wintertime - just as the West accused him of bringing back the Cold War. The Kremlin leader signed a new law which means the country will abandon an experiment of having 'summer time' all year round. Most Russians will switch their clocks back on 26 October - but then not move them forward one hour next spring. Dark days ahead: Russia's President Vladimir Putin chairs a Security Council meeting in Moscow as it emerged he has signed a new law scrapping an experiment of having 'summer time' all year round . His move follows criticism by his people of the 'permanent summertime' law imposed by Putin's prime minister Dmitry Medvedev in 2011 when he was president. As one diplomat said: 'It is a fitting change right now when Putin is bringing us back to the chill of the Cold War.' The new law also emphasises the sheer size of Russia by adding two new time zones to the map with a stroke of the president's pen. In future, Russia will have 11 time zones between the Baltic and the Pacific instead of the current nine. A new time zone one hour ahead of Moscow will be created for the Udmurtian Republic and Samara Region. 'Chill of the Cold War': Putin's move follows criticism by his people of the 'permanent summertime' law imposed by Putin's prime minister Dmitry Medvedev in 2011 when he was president . The 11th time zone, nine hours ahead . of Moscow, is for the Kamchatka region and the Chukotka Autonomous Area, . where football tycoon Roman Abramovich was once governor. Currently the time difference between Moscow and Kamchatka and Chukotka is eight hours. Meanwhile, . the time in the Siberian region of Kemerovo, currently three hours . ahead of Moscow, will be moved into an existing zone four hours . ahead of the capital. It means the 26 October will involve some complicated changes for Russians. Some regions will have to put the clock two hours back. Five regions, including the republic of Udmurtia, and the Samara and Kemerovo regions, will make no switches.

Russia abducted a glamorous Ukrainian military pilot before charging her with involvement in the 'murder' of two Moscow journalists, Kiev claimed yesterday. Nadiya Savchenko, 31, was seized inside Ukraine and smuggled across the border for prosecution, alleged the country's Foreign Ministry in the latest dispute between the ex-Soviet countries. She has been charged in connection with the deaths of journalists Igor Kornelyuk and Anton . Voloshin, from state television channel Rossiya. The pair were killed on June 18 . after being hit with shrapnel during an attack by Ukrainian forces near . the city of Lugansk. The Moscow Investigative Committee, the equivalent of America's FBI, said Savchenko was detained after posing as a refugee on the frontier without any identity documents. 'Having . gained the coordinates of a group of Russian journalists and other . civilians near Lugansk, Savchenko passed them on to the combatants,' it said. But yesterday, Kiev pointed out that the pilot had been interviewed as a prisoner of pro-Russian . separatists in eastern Ukraine in late June. This suggests she was in captivity when she supposedly freely crossed the border, it claimed. The Foreign Ministry, which has issued a 'categorical protest' demanding Savchenko's 'unconditional release', alleged the pilot was kidnapped in Ukraine and smuggled into Russia, before being held in detention in Voronezh. It said the case 'is further proof that . terrorists plan and carry out their crimes in Ukraine in close . cooperation with Russian security services'. Interview: Savchenko is pictured talking to journalists from jail shortly after her capture in Luhansk, Ukraine . Charged: The pilot has been charged over the deaths of Rossiya journalists Igor Kornelyuk and Anton Voloshin . It added: 'By openly abducting citizens of Ukraine on the territory of their state, the Russian authorities not only violate all international norms but also exceed basic norms of decency and morality.' Savchenko is regarded as a role model for women in Ukraine, having earlier served in Iraq in a peacekeeping mission. It is believed she was wounded in fighting before her alleged seizure by pro-Moscow fighters.

He questioned whether she was seeking a retirement deal working for Gazprom .

The attack on the German leader came as the EU was on Wednesday deciding whether to impose new sanctions on Moscow. It came as Kiev warned of a new build-up of Kremlin troops on its borders and making fresh claims that Moscow is striking targets in Ukraine from inside Russia, tantamount to the start of war. The allegations come as the EU and US decide on new sanctions, accusing  Putin of ignoring demands to reduce tension and instead stoking unrest on his neighbour's territory. Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council Deputy Secretary Mykhaylo Koval has issued a blunt warning of a renewed threat of invasion from swelling troop numbers. 'Ukraine, like never before, stands on the cusp of a wide-scale aggression from our current northern border,' said the ex-defence minister, claiming a troop build up extends from north-central region of Chernigiv to the southeastern edge of the Russian-Ukrainian border on the Sea of Azov.

'I don't know why we are so stubbornly ashamed to call a spade a spade and officially state that there is a war by Russia against Ukraine,' he said. He insisted that an air strike on the town of Snizhne - killing 11 civilians - as well as a hit that downed a Ukrainian An-26 transport plane could only have been made by the Russian military as opposed to either rebel fighters or Kiev's armed forces. 'Until we call black, black, and the war a war, the theatre of the absurd will continue,' he said.

"By . Allan Hall . The former chief doctor of Formula One says he has learned of 'serious lapses of judgement' in Michael Schumacher's care . Stricken former F1 driver Michael Schumacher has reportedly lost 25 per cent of his body weight while in his artificially induced coma and now weighs just a little under eight and-a-half stone. Today he is 83 days into the coma he was placed in on December 29 last year after suffering serious brain injuries during a low-speed ski run on the slopes of the French resort of Meribel. Helicoptered to the University Hospital of Grenoble, he was placed in the coma and has undergone two operations. Although his family, manager Sabine Kehm and close friend Jean Todt insist they have not given up on the hope of full recovery there is still no concrete news about how optimistic his medical team are about him coming around from the coma. Doctors began decreasing the anaesthetics keeping him under a month ago but still he is unconscious with no signs that he recognises his external environment. Italy's La Gazzetta dello Sport and the major German daily Bild-Zeitung are now reporting Schumacher's drastic weight loss. 'While a weight loss in coma patients is normal, 20 kilos is a lot for people with normal body weights,' said Prof Dr Curt Diehm, of the Karlsbad teaching hospital in Germany. 'One must assume that his muscles have degraded greatly due to the immobility,' he surmised. Although Schumacher, 45, has his muscles and joints massaged on a daily basis while lying prone in intensive care, professor Diehm said this was not enough to stop muscle shrinkage. Schumacher carving a turn while skiing at the Italian resort of Madonna di Campiglio, Italy in 2000 . Schumacher's wife Corinna, his daughter Gina-Marie, 17, and son Mick, 14, spend up to eight hours a day at his bedside, talking with him and praying for signs of a recovery. It is understood the family have been told that only a miracle can bring about a full recovery. Doctors believe that if he does wake up, he will need many years of intensive therapy to regain full limb movement and speech. The worst-case scenario for the seven-times Formula One champion is being in a 'waking coma' - otherwise known as a permanent vegative state - where he is conscious but unable to move or speak. Doctors believe that if he does wake up, he will need many years of intensive therapy to regain full limb movement and speech . Schumacher remains in the thoughts of Formula One's management and its fans worldwide since the start of the 2014 racing season, with Bahrain renaming the first corner after the F1 legend, while winner of the Melbourne Grand Prix Nico Rosberg dedicated his victory to him. Mercedes’ executive director Toto Wolff  said: 'This victory has a very special meaning for us. 'I would like to dedicate it to Michael, who has been in all our thoughts this weekend.

Gerd Paulus, 52, told a court in Bonn that he murdered wife Sigrid, 40, as they showered together - in cold water because she said they had to save money - as she moaned at him to get a job. Speaking soberly and calmly, he told the courtroom: 'I could bear the continuous nagging no longer. No man could. She was violently yelling at me to find a new job. She could win a gold medal for nagging.' Crime scene: Gerd Paulus, 52, said he murdered wife Sigrid, 40, as they showered together as she moaned at him to get a job before burying her behind a wine rack at their home in Königswinter, western Germany . 'At that moment I remember I only wanted peace. I hit her on the head and she began bleeding.  I put my hands around her throat.  I had a kind of a blackout.  When I came to I had a noise in my head. I had strangled her. She had no pulse.' That was six years ago. He then told the court how he reported her missing to police and burst into tears when reporters visited him at his home in the ritzy Bonn suburb of Konigswinter saying he 'missed' his wife and didn't know where she had gone. Last September he remarried. The new wife moved into his home, unaware that bride number one, and mother to his two children, was sealed in concrete behind a wine rack in the cellar. He went on: 'Before my children came home on the day of her death I cleaned away the blood in the bathroom and hid her corpse in the cellar.  I gave the kids money to go to McDonalds.' He then used building materials in the garden to build the concrete tomb. In December 2012 the daughter of Sigrid contacted a journalist to help her find her missing mother.  The journalist discovered that in all the time she was missing she drew no money from her bank account and never once used her insurance card for medical treatment. He went to the German show - Aktenzeichen XY - a Crimewatch-style programme - which aired a segment on her.  It sparked a new police probe which saw officers rip up the garden and the cellar....leading to the discovery of the mummified Sigrid.

"By . Allan Hall . German footballing legend Uli Hoeness - boss of European superclub Bayern Munich - goes on trial on Monday accused of stashing millions of pounds in undeclared bank accounts in Switzerland. Hoeness could face jail as well as a mammoth fine on tax evasion charges in a case that has riveted the nation. Germany has cracked down hard on revenue cheats in recent years, many of them caught through bank whistleblowers who sold stolen bank computer discs to tax authorities for small fortunes with names, addresses and amounts stored on them. Facing jail: Bayern Munich President Uli Hoeness  is facing a high-profile tax evasion trial . The courtroom at the Palace of Justice in Munich, Germany, where Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness goes on trial . Hoeness, president of Germany's richest and most successful football club, turned himself into the taxman a year ago hoping for leniency. Instead the revenue's lawyers are throwing the book at the 62-year-old, charging him with seven counts of evading £2.9 million euros in taxes. The full details of the prosecution case against him have still not been revealed. Hoeness has so far clung to his job amid expressions of loyalty from fans, players and corporate sponsors such as Adidas, Audi, VW and Deutsche Telekom. Hoeness has spent more than 40 years with the Bavarian sporting giants - first as player, helping win then West Germany the 1974 World Cup, then as team manager and, since 2009, as club president. Hoeness said he was a compulsive stock market gambler, in a bid to explain his black money abroad. He said he received a £8.4 million loan 'for gambling' in his Swiss bank account in 2001 from the late Robert Louis-Dreyfuss, then chief of club supplier and shareholder Adidas.

Such stock market speculation ended, he said, amid heavy losses in 2006 and the recession which followed in 2007. Hoeness, worried about the heat being turned up on wealthy Germans like himself,  went to the tax authorities on January 17 last year over an unspecified amount of unpaid taxes. It is understood he had been informed that the taxman was on his case. The Palace of Justice in Munich, Germany where Uli Hoeness goes on trial . On March 20, 2013, police raided his lakeside villa near Munich and presented him with an arrest warrant but released him on five million euros' bail. Despite widespread criticism  -- including from Chancellor Angela Merkel who voiced 'disappointment' - his initial offer to resign in May was rejected by the supervisory board of the club. Charges were laid in July but not publicly released. Under German tax law, they remain secret until they are read out in court. The trial is scheduled to last four days, with a verdict expected as early as Thursday.  Speculation is that he might get up to a year in jail but this might be suspended. Hoeness has said he will seek to convince the judge of his innocence. 'I am still of the opinion that my tax advisor's work was okay and the verdict must reflect that,' he said in a  recent interview. Early this year he told Bayern fans: 'I don't want to make myself into some sort of a saint, everyone knows that I made a big mistake. But I don't think that I have become a bad person.'","Hoeness could face mammoth fine in a case which has riveted Germany .

"By . Allan Hall . Good luck: The Shamballa bracelet (pictured) is used by Buddhists and Hindus for meditation and as a sign of good luck in the Western world . A good luck bracelet worn by  Formula 1 legend Michael Schumacher throughout his racing career has been found in the snow where he suffered his catastrophic ski accident three weeks ago. The Shamballa wooden bead bracelet was found at the accident site by mountain rescue workers and has now been placed by the racing driver’s hospital bed. Schumacher, 45, has remained in an artificial coma at the University Hospital in Grenoble, France, since his accident at the ski resort of Meribel on December 29. He has since undergone two operations in an attempt to reduce the swelling on his brain. Bracelets such as his, worn by Buddhists and Hindus, were historically used to aid meditation, and have become a symbol of good luck in the West. The find comes as fears grow in Schumacher’s homeland that he might never be woken from the coma. A number of German publications quoted neurological experts voicing concerns the injuries he suffered were far worse than the media were led to believe. But a statement from his manager said his family had the utmost faith in the medical team treating him, and anything about his condition that did not emanate from those doctors was pure speculation. ‘Michael’s family is very satisfied with  the work of the team of doctors treating him and trusts them absolutely,’ said manager Sabine Kehm. ‘Michael’s condition is stable.’ Schumacher’s wife Corinne, 44, visits him every day and there are no plans yet to awaken him. But the prolonged coma is fuelling concerns that his injuries were so severe that he has not recovered anywhere near enough to be brought out of it. Returned: The piece of jewellery, found by mountain rescue workers at the scene of his crash, is now by the Formula 1 champion's beside in Grenoble hospital where he remains in an artificial coma . The coma means that oxygen to his brain is reduced, so that it works less and is better placed to recover from the injuries sustained during a low-speed ski accident. Patients put in such comas are usually brought out of them after a week or two. Neurosurgeon Andreas Zieger, of the University Clinic for neurosurgery in Oldenburg, told Germany’s Focus magazine: ‘There may have been complications. We should not speculate here. 'Ultimately we are talking about life and death. A coma can in theory be maintained for a lifetime. It won’t hurt the human brain.’","Shamballa wooden bead bracelet found by mountain rescue workers .

"By . Allan Hall . German scientists have invented a device allowing disabled people to steer their wheelchairs using their ears. Patients are fitted with chips that pick up the pulses of muscular movements in the human ear. Those tiny transmissions are converted into a signal to a computer attached to the wheelchair which propels it into motion. David Liebetanz, who led the researchers from three top German universities, said; 'The advantage this has over breathing or eye movement to make wheelchairs move is that people do not have to give up looking or speaking to use it. Scroll down for video . Scientists at three German universities have invented a chip which uses muscular movements in a person's ear to propel a wheelchair forwards . 'Ten study participants spent five days learning how to use their ear muscles to communicate with the software, which adapts to each individual user and provides feedback based on the signals received from the muscles. 'By day five, all ten participants had managed to navigate their wheelchairs around the main building of a hospital in Goettingen - because they learned to wiggle their ears.' Psychologist Leonie Schmalfuss told a German website: 'Clearly we are talking about an ability which can be learnt in a short space of time, like learning to juggle three balls.' Liebetanz added: 'We were really baffled by this because half of our participants went into the study claiming that they could not wiggle their ears. 'The results from our clinical trial have exceeded our expectations. 'This new technology is intended in particular for people with serious spinal cord injuries, that is for patients who can no longer use their arms and legs.' Ten participants took part in the study, spending five days learning to navigate through Goettingen hospital, wiggling their ears to move the wheelchairs .

"By . Allan Hall . Waking Michael Schumacher from his artificially-induced coma could plunge him into a natural one, a top German professor has warned. The seven-times Formula 1 champion is currently being kept under anaesthetic at the University Hospital in France. But Professor Heinzpeter Moecke says waking him may leave him in a 'permanent vegetative state'. Devoted: Michael Schumacher has been at University Hospital in Grenoble since December. Above, Schumacher is pictured with his wife Corinna in Italy . Schumacher, the seven-times Formula 1 champion, is being kept under constant scrutiny to detect any movement at all . 'There is unfortunately the risk that in sneaking out of a deep artificial sleep the patient is then in a waking coma,' said Professor Moecke, director of the Institute for Emergency Medicine at the Asklepios Clinic in Hamburg. 'This would mean a permanent vegetative state where Schumacher would effectively be paralysed.' However, he said that even if the F1 legend does not plunge into another coma, doctors may be forced to send him into a 'light sleep'. 'Waking up from an artificial sleep can leave the patient initially confused, not sure of who he is or where he is,' he said. Treatment: Schumacher is currently being kept under anaesthetic at the University Hospital (above) in France . 'If he is so agitated and attempted to remove tubes from his body, the doctors could induce him into another light sleep.' Schumacher, 45, has been at the hospital in Grenoble since he fell and hit his head on a rock while skiing in the French resort of Meribel on December 29. However, doctors believe that the toughest phase in his recovery is yet to come. They have warned his wife Corinna, and children Gina Marie, 16, and son Mick, 14, that it could take weeks for all of the sleeping drugs to be out of his body. During this time, Schumacher will be under constant scrutiny to detect any movement at all. And even if he does come around, he may require intensive physical and speech therapy over a series of months, if not, years.","Heinzpeter Moecke warns Schumacher may plunge into natural coma .

"By . Allan Hall . Romanians seeking better lives in Britain know they come with the baggage of suspicion and mistrust. But they were the cheated and not the cheats while aboard one of the first coaches heading from Bucharest to London after job restrictions weres lifted. Predatory Hungarian border guards threatened to hold them up for 12 hours searching luggage and examining vehicle documents unless a fee of €300 (£250) was paid. One of the drivers told me: ‘It  happens all the time – they see that we are Romanians and that’s a green light to rip us off. Predatory Hungarian border guards threatened to hold up the Romanians travelling on this coach to Britain for 12 hours, searching luggage and examining vehicle documents unless a fee of 300 euros (£250) was paid . Travellers familiar with this tortuous journey - 1,200 miles through six nations - had experienced it before. So when the hat was passed around the 65 passengers on the Tudan tour bus to pay the kickback, no one complained . ‘If we don’t pay, they would have had every scrap of luggage opened, every document examined, items confiscated. It is corruption but we pay because we have to.’ Travellers familiar with this tortuous journey – 1,200 miles through six nations – had experienced it before. So when the hat was passed around the 65 passengers on the Tudan tour bus to pay the kickback, no one complained. ‘It is because we are Romanians, simple as that,’ said Alex Prodan, a 37-year-old who has been in the UK for two years running a commercial cleaning company and removals business in West London. ‘It is the gipsy thing; you come from Romania, you are instantly a Roma and not to be trusted. I wouldn’t blame the British for keeping out those who want to scrounge, but everyone on this bus is a working man or woman looking to get on. There was no lavatory on board and for the most part passengers baked, unable to see out of windows streaming with condensation . A couple kiss before they head off on their journey to a new life in Britain . ‘You don’t put up with these sorts of travel conditions if you think you are going to a country for it to be a soft touch. ‘The Hungarians do this routinely – as if the journey wasn’t bad enough already.’ The trip was indeed hellish for the nannies, waitresses, carpenters and clerks on board. Having paid around £80 for a one-way ticket, no one expected club class – which was just as well. There was no lavatory on board and for the most part passengers baked, unable to see out of windows streaming with condensation. The only entertainment on board was a radio, and conditions at roadside stops in Romania and Hungary were beyond primitive. Undoubtedly Britain will receive its share of workshy welfare scroungers, people who want to milk the system instead of enabling it. But they were not apparent among my fellow travellers. One was 29-year-old carpenter Octavia Kessler from Ploesti. Out of work for six months, he has no job to welcome him, just the will to do it. Unclear picture: The Government has not revealed estimates about how many Romanians or Bulgarians would arrive in the UK from now onwards . ‘I didn’t say goodbye to my woman or my daughter, who is only five, face-to-face – that would have broken my heart. I knew they would cry and it would break my spirit and I might lose the resolve to go,’ he said. ‘I said goodbye by phone instead. ‘There’s no question of me doing this to get benefits. I want to succeed. Benefits are for losers.’ Mary Varga, 31, from Constanta, has left behind her six-year-old son and daughter, aged 12, to return to London as a waitress where she has been working for two years. ‘I want people to know that I am on the books, paying National Insurance and tax,’ said Mary in flawless English. ‘Everyone on this bus wants to work, not work the system. ‘Why else would people leave loved ones behind? Do you think I am happy to leave my children behind, not see them for a year, to work  11 hours a day, five days a week  for a little over £1,000 a month? 'I do it because I have to. We all do.’ Labour MP Keith Vaz turned up at Luton Airport this week to greet Romanians in the arrivals lounge . Shipping clerk Georghe Reiscu, 37, a father of two from Constanta, has also left behind his wife and children for a job in Cardiff. He said: ‘Every day away from home is painful, but the money goes towards a future when we will be together and hopefully living better than we can in Romania.’ Christian Ciornia, 27, from Bucharest, was returning to the UK where he has worked as an electrician for the past two years, after spending Christmas with his family. ‘You will find that 99 per cent of Romanians who go to the UK are self-employed like me,’ he said. ‘We’re not into benefit scrounging. I would get around £600 a month for the job I do in Romania, sometimes over £2,000 a month in Britain.’ And Donna, a middle-aged au pair for a professional couple in South London, added: ‘I would be living on the breadline in my own country. ‘As it is, I am grateful for the kindness of British people. When I was fixing up this job, they all showed me nothing but kindness.’","Hungarian border guards threatened to .

French national, who asked not to be named, said: ‘We arrived within . two minutes of the accident. The man lost control after hitting a rock . that was lightly covered with snow. 'He . went into the air and he fell and hit three more rocks on the way down. There was a lot of blood  around the last rock where he hit his head. 'The helicopter, which was able to land within 30 metres of the accident, came within minutes.’ He added: ‘Everyone in the resort is extremely sad  and we’re praying he comes through this.' Rescue scene: A picture shows a helicopter waiting to fly Schumacher to hospital after the accident .

"By . Allan Hall . The photo that sealed his fate: 24 hours after . German police circulated this photo of Robin van Helsum they discovered . that he was a fantasist . Germany's 'forest boy' paid the price for his web of deceit in a Berlin court today as he admitted fraud. Robin van Helsum tried to hoodwink the world by masquerading as an English-speaking orphan called Ray who was brought up in the wilderness of central Europe. The 21-year-old was today ordered to perform 150 hours of community service after a hearing in Berlin held behind closed doors. The Amstsgericht Berlin-Tiergarten took less than an hour to deal with Dutch-born Van Helsum, who stayed on in the German capital after his hoax was exposed last year. The Dutchman's story story began in September 2011 when he pitched up at a Berlin town hall speaking broken English and claiming to be an orphan. He said his mother Doreen had died in a car crash five years previously and that he had lived since then with his father, also called Ray, in woodland. He said his father had died in the woods and that he had buried him and then 'walked to Berlin.' The fact that his clothes were clean and he looked as if he had survived on more than foraged berries and nuts for half-a-decade did not stop authorities from providing him with shelter - particularly as he said he was underage. Van Helsum soon became a sensation across Europe, hailed as the the boy with no memory who had lived like a modern-day Mowgli. People from across the world claimed him as their own. For eight months he lived at the expense of the German taxpayer, racking up a bill of £25,000 for benefits including pocket money, clothes and dental treatment. Then in June last year the charade fell apart when German police took a photo of him, circulated it and discovered within 24 hours that he was a liar. The forest boy had morphed into a lying Dutchman overnight. 'You got me,' Van Helsum said to police who came to evict him from the children's home where he had stayed. It turned out he was a disaffected Dutch youth with a complicated home life and an illegitimate child in his home town of Hengelo. He simply wanted to disappear off the radar and start a new life. Possessions: . The bag Van Helsum was carrying when he 'emerged from the woods' and . appeared at a Berlin town hall. He said his mother had died when he was . 12 and he had lived in the wilderness with his father . Left without a word: The house of the Van Helsum's father in Hengelo, the Netherlands. A court spokesman said today that the 21-year-old had made reference to a difficult home life, but did not elaborate further . Court spokesman Tobias Kaehne said he will avoid a criminal record if he agrees to the community service order. He said that Van Helsum had made references in court to the 'difficult home life' that had lead him to concoct his fantasy world, but did not elaborate further. 'There was no conviction, as all parties in the hearing agreed. He admitted his guilt, and agreed to the 150 hours of community service,' said Mr Kaehne. 'If he fails to carry out the work it will come to a trial and probably a conviction. But as it stands now he will not have a record going into the future. This kind of agreement is made in the interests of young people's future.' Last year, after he was booted out of care, he was pictured flipping hamburgers at a Burger King restaurant in Berlin but he has since quit his job. 'This is the price for Ray's lies,' crowed Berlin's BZ paper after Van Helsum was handed down the community service order. But in the end he got away without having to pay back a penny to local authorities.","Robin van Helsum arrived in Berlin in 2011 speaking broken English .

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . A girl bullied so severely she developed selective mutism has overcome her fear of speaking by taking part in a beauty pageant. Lucy Hammond, 12, was bullied at school and was almost completely unable to speak for three years. But since entering Miss Junior Teen Great Britain last year she’s gradually regained her voice and will take to the catwalk and be interviewed by judges to in a bid to win the title. Since entering Miss Junior Teen Great Britain last year she's gradually regained her voice . Lucy, here in her school photograph, was so severely bullied she developed selective mutism - an anxiety disorder that stopped her talking almost totally . Lucy’s mother Liz said: 'We never thought that she’d come out of it . 'But the pageant has given her a voice back.' Lucy’s family noticed the change in her behaviour when she was just eight and she was so unhappy they thought she was physically ill. Selective mutism is an anxiety disorder that prevents children speaking in certain social situations, such as school lessons or in public. A child with selective mutism is not voluntarily refusing to speak but is literally unable to speak, feeling frozen. In time, they may begin actively avoiding situations where they find it hard to speak. Lucy, pictured here age 9, was almost completely unable to speak for three years, only uttering answers to questions from her mother and father . Lucy (centre), with her mother Liz, father Philip, brother Tom and sister Katherine . She was . unable to talk to anyone, including her own grandparents, and uttered . only answers to questions from her mother and father. When . her mutism became so severe she refused to return to school her mother . Liz realised it was due to bullying and found a new school place Lucy. But . since her photos were accepted for the pageant and she was asked to . represent the Coventry region her transformation has been incredible. At . the national finals in Blackpool on August 30, Lucy will be one of 30 . girls strutting the catwalk in fashion and evening wear rounds, . dancing in a group and being interviewed by a panel of judges. Lucy said: 'I wanted to do the pageant to give me more confidence in everyday life and that’s what happened. 'It’s been really great and I’ve got a really a lot more confident already.' As . part of her campaign to become Miss Junior Teen Great Britain Lucy has . been organising fundraising events for Claire House Children’s Hospice. Having changed school and entered Miss Junior Teen Great Britain, Lucy has managed to slowly overcome her selective mutism and has been organising fundraising events for Claire House Children’s Hospice . Liz said: 'When it first started, we didn’t know what was wrong for a year and we thought she was physically ill. 'She became more withdrawn and it was like she was different girl. 'Lucy wouldn’t even speak to her grandparents let alone a stranger. 'It’s been four very hard years but in the last year, ever since she entered the pageant and she was chosen to represent the region, the change has been remarkable. 'It’s a family atmosphere - there’s no throwing fake eyelashes and cat fighting behind the scenes. 'A lot of the girls are very similar to Lucy and have overcome something difficult too. 'It’s all just fun and giggles and we’re so grateful she’s found something to boost her confidence.' Speaking to the MailOnline Professor David Messer from the Open University commented: 'The precise reasons for selective mutism are not fully understood as there are a range of circumstances associated with this condition. 'It is important to bear in mind that there also are a range of events which can result in a child or young person regaining their speech.' Selective mutism (SM) is relatively rare, affecting one in 150 children. Most primary schools will know of at least one child with SM. It's more common in girls and children of ethnic minority populations, or in those who have recently migrated from their country of birth. SM usually occurs in early childhood and is first noticed when the child begins to interact outside the family circle – for example, when they start nursery or school. It can last a few months but, if left untreated, can continue into adulthood. Children with SM often have other fears and social anxieties and may have additional speech and language difficulties. There is no evidence to suggest that children with SM are more likely to have suffered abuse, neglect or trauma than any other child. When mutism occurs as a symptom of post-traumatic stress it follows a very different pattern and the child suddenly stops talking in environments where they previously had no difficulty. However, this type of speech withdrawal may lead to SM if the triggers are not addressed and the child develops a more general anxiety about communication. Another common misconception is that a selectively mute child is controlling or manipulative, or that the child has autism. There is no relationship between SM and autism, although the two conditions can occur in the same child. If left untreated, SM can lead to isolation, low self-esteem and social anxiety disorder. It can persist into adolescence and even adulthood if not tackled. With diagnosis at a young age and appropriate management, children can successfully overcome this disorder. If you suspect your child has SM and help is not available, or if there are additional concerns, for example if your child struggles to understand instructions or follow routines, seek a formal diagnosis.

Users can share tips and tricks that help them with their babies, and dedicated Dave has even set up a photography studio in his home to take pictures of the dads in action. Dave, from Chalfont St Peter, Bucks., said: 'If I’m honest, I was absolutely terrified. 'When your baby is born, you suddenly feel a huge weight of responsibility and quickly realise that this tiny bundle of life is completely dependent on you. 'The thing about pregnancy is that, from a male perspective at least, the fun bit happens at the start. Users can share tips and tricks that help them with their babies, and dedicated Dave has even set up a photography studio in his home to take pictures of the dads in action . 'Then you get the boring bit, where nothing much happens. 'And then you get moaned at and have to be supportive and do the odd back rub or foot massage. 'When the contractions started Sam turned to me and said, ‘Shall we go to hospital?’ 'In my head I am thinking, ‘I don’t know!’ Then you go through labour and I think we all know it is pretty bad. 'I was really shell shocked from a bloke’s point of view at how long it took and how much pain she was in, and how little I could do about it. 'Then we got the baby and we didn’t have a clue what to do with it. Parenting groups talk about labour but there isn’t much about what happens afterwards.' Within the first three weeks of it being on the iTunes store, the £1.50 app was downloaded more than a thousand times by floundering fathers . He added: 'About a week after birth, I went for a quick pint with some other dads I’d met through our local parenting group.

"By . Allan Hall . Cornelius Gurlitt, son of Hildebrand Gurlitt, said his father had acquired the priceless works legally . Art recluse Cornelius Gurlitt has said he wants the £1billion of art treasures taken from his flat by German customs officials returned to him – despite the fact at least some of the haul is Nazi loot strong-armed from Jewish people at knock-down prices. Gurlitt, 80, told Der Spiegel news magazine in a rambling interview laced with an overriding sense of victim-hood that his father Hildebrand – a powerful Nazi-era art dealer once tasked to sell modern art abroad for the regime to buy weapons – had acquired the priceless works legally and that he as his heir sees himself as their rightful owner. He is a man consumed with anger – at the state, at the media – even towards his sister Benita for dying of cancer. ‘She was two years younger than me and married. She should have outlived me,’ he said. ‘Then she would have inherited everything, and she would have known how to deal with this. Now, everything is so miserable. ‘I will not give anything back voluntarily,’ said the eccentric loner who has not been charged with any crimes. ‘I hope this gets resolved soon and I finally get my pictures back. ‘I’ve never committed a crime, and even if I had, it would fall under the statute of limitations. If I were guilty, they would put me in prison.’ Gurlitt, who suffers from a heart condition, said he had given state prosecutors investigating him on charges of tax evasion and misappropriation of assets ‘enough’ documents to prove his innocence. The art was seized in February last year but the existence of the collection only became known a fortnight ago, subjecting Gurlitt to a media firestorm which he detests. The flat was raided by customs officials who had stopped him in 2010 on a train back from Switzerland with 9,000 euros in cash and empty envelopes stamped with the name of a Swiss bank. Scroll down for video . Breathtaking: A montage of some of the works which have already been released by German authorities . Customs launched a probe into him thinking he was a tax fiddler. They entered his apartment expecting to find undeclared cash – and instead stumbled on the most breathtaking haul of art seen since the war ended in 1945. ‘I am not Boris Becker, what do these people want from me?’ he said, referring to the former Wimbledon legend and the legions of journalists who camped outside the Munich flat where the 1,406 paintings by such greats as Picasso, Matisse and Renoir were found. ‘I just wanted to live with my paintings,’ he added. While his father sold many of the works he purchased on behalf of the Nazis, he kept a vast trove for himself. Most of the collection was believed lost or destroyed but was found behind tins of rotten food in his apartment. Gurlitt's Munich flat was home to 1,406 paintings by such greats as Picasso, Matisse and Renoir . At least 500 of the pictures have been identifed as being bought at rock-bottom prices from Jews seeking to raise the necessary cash to buy exit visas from Hitler’s Germany. Gurlitt told Spiegel: ‘I never had anything to do with acquiring the pictures, only with saving them,’ he says. He added people should be thankful to him because he helped his father back in Dresden when they saved the works of art from the advancing Russians in 1945. 'My father knew the Russians were getting closer and closer,’ he said. Gurlitt Jr. lives in denial that his father bought collections at rock bottom prices from Jews seeking to escape the wrath of the Nazi regime, even though cursory checks thus far have shown that to be the case for some of the art. At least 500 pictures have been identified as being bought at low prices from Jews seeking to raise cash to buy exit visas from Hitler's Germany . ‘The pictures came from German museums or art dealers,’ Gurlitt says, adding that his father only co-operated with the Nazis because he wanted to save the paintings from being burned. He added: ‘It’s possible that my father may have been offered something privately, but he certainly didn’t accept it. He would have found that unsavoury.’ But that denies the truth of Hildebrand Gurlitt’s role in the Third Reich: he was one of just four art experts hired by the regime to find modern art Hitler classified as ‘degenerate’, buy it for knock-down prices and sell it on abroad. Post-war records show that Hildebrand lied to the Americans after Hitler fell saying that his collection was destroyed in the Allied bombing of Dresden in February 1945. Cornelius says he has received a letter informing him that a number of works of art are going to be returned to him. He doesn’t know which ones – but he believes he is entitled to receive the collection in its entirety. He clearly displays a deep sense of persecution in his interview, Munich is the ‘source of all evil, this is where the movement was founded’, he says, referring to the Nazi party founded in the city. According to the reporter who interviewed him ‘he keeps repeating the same sentence, and when he does his quivering voice becomes louder’. Gurlitt talks about the beginnings of the Nazi Party in 1920, and about the speech Adolf Hitler gave in the Munich Hofbräuhaus, in which he announced the party’s manifesto. In Gurlitt’s opinion, evil still appears to reside in the city.” He admits he has never loved another human being - either a woman or a man - and says that the art that was taken from him is “everything.” He added: ‘There are people who are still climbing mountains at 97, but I won’t live to be that old.  At least they could have waited until I was dead to take away the pictures.   There is nothing I have loved more in my life than my pictures.’ Spiegel added: ‘When asked whether he has ever been in love with a human being, he giggles and says, “Oh, no”.’ Gurlitt has experienced many goodbyes in his lifetime: his father’s death in a car accident, his mother’s death, his sister’s cancer. ‘Saying goodbye to my pictures was the most painful of all,’ he says. ‘I hope everything will be cleared up quickly, so I can finally have my pictures back.’","Cornelius Gurlitt hoarded a cache of 1,401 paintings in his Munich home .

"By . Allan Hall . Natascha Kampusch vanished on her way to school when she was ten and was held captive for eight years . A top policeman assigned to probe the murky Natascha Kampusch kidnapping case in Austria - who was ruled to have killed himself because of personal problems - did not commit suicide, it was revealed in Vienna. The findings on Oberst Franz Kroell, 59, once again cast doubt on the theory that the Kampusch kidnapper Wolfgang Priklopil acted alone. Miss Kampusch vanished on her way to school in Vienna in 1998 when she was ten. Wolfgang Priklopil carved a secret, sound-proof cellar beneath his home in a suburb of the city in which to keep her captive for eight years. Long considered the victim of a paedophile who had murdered her, Miss Kampusch finally escaped in August 2006. Kroell was a career officer who never worked on the original investigation but was dragged into the toxic soup of allegation and counter-allegation following the setting-up of the Adamovich Commission - a body tasked to see if others were involved in her vanishing in 1998. Six months after the probe ended, in June 2010, he was found shot dead in on the terrace of his home in Graz. Wolfgang Priklopil (pictured left) held Natascha . Kampusch captive for eight years. Miss Kampusch vanished on her way to school in Vienna in 1998 when she was ten . His service pistol was found near his body with a bullet missing from the chamber and police ruled a suicide. But his brother Karl never believed it and hired forensic expert Peter Leinzinger to investigate the case. Karl . Kroell always maintained his brother was murdered because he carried on . investigating the case and was convinced there had been a high level . establishment cover up to protect the identity of Prikloil's accomplice. Leinzinget's report shows clearly how poorly the original investigation into his death was carried out. Natascha was held prisoner at this house in Strasshof. Wolfgang Priklopil carved a secret, sound-proof cellar beneath his home in a suburb of the city in which to keep her captive for eight years . Natascha Kampusch, pictured in February at the premiere of 3,096 Days, the film based on her book . A . bullet hole in Kroell's wall which is supposed to have been from the . gun he used to kill himself turned out to have been a hole made from a . screw where a washing line had been fitted. Police claimed that the bullet had probably passed through the wall - but there was no exit hole. In addition there were traces of gunpowder from the shot on both of the . dead man's hands – as if he had been trying to hold the gun in what . would have been a typical defensive move. If . he had simply shot himself with his right hand this would have meant . the traces from the shot would have been only on one hand. In fact there . were more traces on his left hand than his shooting hand. Prior . to that there were many other indications that the death was not . suicide, including the fact that his brother insists that the . handwriting on the farewell note was not his brother's. A . handwriting expert that examined the dead man's signature on his police . expenses claims confirmed that the was no way the two handwriting . styles had been written by the same person. Before his death he had pleaded for the Kampusch case to be reopened - without success. The case was closed according to the official announcement on 8 January 2010. But privately he continued to work on it, including a number of interviews that he carried out which he had been forbidden to do as a police officer. One of the key areas Kroell looked at was that the suicide of Wolfgang Priklopil in the hours after she escaped from his lair outside Vienna in August 2006 after over eight years in captivity. Found dead under the wheels of a train, he always believed he was pushed to his death.","Oberst Franz Kroell, 59, was ruled to have killed himself .

"By . Michael Zennie . and Associated  Press Reporter . Nancy Writebol, the last American Ebola patient in Liberia, is in stable condition after receiving a second dose of an experimental antiviral serum, her son revealed today. It's important news for the U.S. missionary. The private air ambulance jet that will ferry her to Atlanta landed in Monrovia, Liberia, on Monday. On Tuesday, she is expected to join fellow missionary and Ebola patient Dr Kent Brantly in a special quarantine wing at Emory University Hospital. Ms Writebol, a 59-year-old mother from North Carolina, has shown some improvement over the weekend. She can walk with assistance and asked for Liberian potato soup - her favorite meal, family and friends said. However, her case remains grave. She is in serious condition with a disease that has no known cure and proves fatal for up to 90percent of patients. Devoted: Nancy Writebol, 59, is a devoted missionary who knowingly risked her safety to help battle the Ebola virus outbreak . Nancy and her husband David were being sponsored to work in Africa by their church in Charlotte, North Carolina . Jeremy Writebol, Ms Writebol's son, believes his mother can yield a greater good from her impending return to the United States amid West Africa's worst-ever outbreak of the virus. The attention focused on her case 'might help develop a cure and resources to help those who are suffering,' Mr Writebol said. 'I am sure hopeful for that.' Dr Brantly and Ms Writebol contracted Ebola . after working on the same medical mission team treating victims of the . virus around Monrovia, Liberia. More than 1,300 people have been . stricken, killing at least 729 of them in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra . Leone. Ebola has no vaccine . or antidote. However, both Dr Brantly and Ms Writebol were given an . experimental treatment last week, according to international relief . group Samaritan's Purse. The group originally said that only . Writebol got the treatment. Dr Brantly also received a unit of blood from a . 14-year-old boy, an Ebola survivor, who had been under his care, . according to the organization. Quarantine: This is the specially-designed tent that was set up to quarantine the Ebola patients while they fly home aboard the GulfStream air ambulance . The specially-designed air ambulance, seen here taking off from Dobbin Air Reserve Base in Georgia to picked up the second American patient, landed in Liberia on Monday . Emory, where Brantly already is quarantined, boasts one of the nation's most sophisticated infectious disease units. Patients are sealed off from anyone not in protective gear. Lab tests are conducted inside the unit, ensuring that viruses don't leave the quarantined area. Family members see and communicate with patients through barriers. Writebol and her husband, David, had been in Liberia since August 2013, sent there by the Christian organization SIM USA and sponsored by their home congregation at Calvary Church in Charlotte, North Carolina. At the hospital where Brantly treated patients, Nancy Writebol worked as a hygienist whose role included decontaminating those entering or leaving the Ebola treatment area. Their pastor, the Reverend John Munro, said David Writebol fulfilled administrative and technical duties. A few weeks before she was diagnosed, Jeremy Writebol said, a doctor visited the Monrovia hospital where she worked and praised the decontamination procedures as the best he'd seen. Jeremy Writebol said she was 'really pleased by knowing that' and never thought she would be infected, despite her proximity to the virus. Recovering: Dr Brantly, seen here with his wife Amber, is improving at Emory University Hospital, after receiving a dose of an experimental serum . Hero: Brantly was working with Christian missions groups to fight the Ebola outbreat . David and Nancy Writebol have engaged in foreign missions for 15 years, spending five years in Ecuador and nine years in Zambia, where Munro said they worked in a home for widows and orphans. After talking with his father Sunday, the younger Writebol said it's clear his mother 'is still suffering,' but said the family remains optimistic. Writebol has now received two doses of an experimental treatment and is showing marked improvement, said Palmer Holt, a spokesman for SIM, the aid organization for which she works. On Sunday, she was in stable but serious condition. On Monday, she was walking with assistance, Holt said. 'Her husband, David, told me Sunday her appetite has improved and she requested one of her favorite dishes - Liberian potato soup - and coffee,' Bruce Johnson, president of SIM USA, said in a statement Monday. Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention, also in Atlanta, say they've gotten some blowback for bringing Ebola cases to an American hospital. But Dr. Tom Frieden, CDC director, emphasized again Sunday that there is no threat to the public in the United States. Some airlines that serve those nations have suspended flights, while international groups, including the Peace Corps, have evacuated some or all representatives in the region. But the Writebols, their pastor predicted, won't be away from the stricken land for any longer than they have to be. 'They knew that Liberia was a tough assignment,' he said, comparing their vocation to the Bible's stories of leper colonies. 'Followers of Christ went into those colonies, knowing they would die,' Munro said. 'I certainly wouldn't judge them if they didn't go back, but I don't think this will deter them.'","Nancy Writebol is in stable, but serious condition after getting the second dose of the drug .

"By . Michael Zennie . The house at 1600 Commonwealth Boulevard in Kenthorst, Pennsylvania, would make Martha Stewart - or any interior decorator - cringe. But Don Draper would feel right at home. The two bedroom, two bathroom house is a Mad Men time capsule, preserved almost perfectly since its initial construction and design in 1965 - right down to the  tacky floral wallpaper in the kitchen and the sickening green bar with orange accents. Today, thanks in part to the hit AMC show about a 1960s ad agency, vintage is back in style. And 'time capsule houses' like the one on Commonwealth Boulevard are in demand. A trip back in time: The orange-cream-yellow-and-green color scheme in the bar area of this home offers a trip back in time. It hasn't been updated since the house was built in 1965 . Right at home: Don Draper, seen here on the first season of Mad Men, could very well have lived in the 1965 home . Sold: The two-bedroom, two bathroom home at 1600 Commonwealth Boulevard in Kenthorst, Pennsylvania, sold last year for $134,000 . The home was purchased by a woman in her 40s who plans to preserve it as it is . This particular home was bought last September by a woman in her 40s. She paid $134,000 for the house - and plans to keep it exactly as it is, CNN reports. 'She was very artsy; she fell in love with it as soon as she saw it,' realtor Jeffrey Hogue, who specializes in selling vintage homes, told CNN. The 1,600-square-foot house features a full bar with a color scheme that looks right out of any suburban refuge shown on Mad Men. With striped cream-and-orange wallpaper, yellow shelves, a green bar and red stools, the design is unmistakable 1960s. The home went on the market after an estate sale. Most 'time capsule homes' have had just one owner who never changed the interior design .

The kitchen features dark brown laminate flooring, floral-printed wallpaper on the ceiling and cream-and-brown cabinets. Mr Hogue said homes like the house on Commonwealth Boulevard often have just one owner, who preserves the original look. They usually don't go on the market until the original owner dies or goes into a nursing home. Mr Hogue offered advice for owners of homes with out-dated design and interior: don't change them. Vintage homes are only attractive if they remain close to their original style. 'Leave it as it is. If it is not broken or completely worn out, leave it alone. Sell what you have, not what everyone thinks it should be,' he says. He adds: 'Many purists want the property with all the original fixtures. Once they are remodeled to later standards, the purist is done.' Mr Hogue recommends that owners of homes with a vintage look refrain from updating anything that isn't broken - an untouched time capsule home can actually sell faster than one that has new wallpaper . The home even includes a beauty salon, which was run by the former owner of the house. It comes with original styling chairs . The home is also furnished with mostly original furniture - adding to the vintage flair .

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . A teacher who bravely came out to his entire school during an assembly said today he was ’overwhelmed’ after a letter he received from a former pupil went viral. David Weston was working at Watford Grammar School in 2010 when he decided to use a school assembly to tell the entire student body he was homosexual. Two days ago, four years after the event, David, received a message from a former pupil Richard Miah via LinkedIn, thanking him and telling him that by his simple act of courage he had ‘challenged the ignorance of so many people.’ David Weston used a school assembly to come out to Watford Grammar School in 2010 . David tweeted the email on his personal account two days ago and it has been retweeted an astonishing 4000 times since then . David, who now works for the Teacher Development Trust, tweeted the email on his personal account saying ‘I came out as a gay teacher in a whole-school assembly in 2010. Today, four years later, I just received this email. Wow’, . It has since spread across the web, being retweeted over 3,600 times and favourited 4,800 times, prompting a slew of responses on Twitter praising David and being picked up by national media. Speaking to MailOnline, David said: 'In 2005 as my mum was dying of lung cancer, I was diagnosed with a rare liver condition which made me very ill for four years. I was in work only on and off, and finally had to have a life-saving liver transplant in 2009. 'As I recovered from that I realised that I'd been so lucky to have a second chance and I knew I wanted to make a difference. 'I decided to do an assembly on homophobic language and why some people are gay. That was the moment where I said ""as some of you already know, I'm due to be civil partnered to my boyfriend later this year. I want to talk to you about what a Civil Partnership is, how legislation has changed, and about the words we use to talk about LGBT issues' David began working at Watford Grammar in 2003 and says that he received a positive, if quiet, reaction to his assembly. 'A couple of teachers and students told me how much they'd enjoy it and appreciated me 'being brave'. Most students had no reaction at all, or maybe occasionally asked about how my partner was. There was no negative reaction at all from anyone, including parents.' This low-key response at the time has meant the vast national interest in the letter has come as a total shock to David. Former pupil Richard Miah (left) told BBC 5 live he sent the letter because David (right) should get the recognition he deserves . David . says: 'I'm blown away by the reaction. People have been so, so . supportive and lovely. I'm humbled by the lovely messages and slightly . shaken at the way it has gone viral - this is the sort of thing that . happens to other people. 'The last 48 hours have been some of the . strangest of my life, with so much radio, TV and newspaper interviews. I'm looking forward to getting back to normality, to be honest, to work . on my charity with my amazing colleagues.' The . touching and simply worded email, which Richard told BBC 5 Live he sent . because ""David should get the recognition he deserves"", says: ‘I just . wanted you to know how inspirational your assembly was, and how much of a . positive impact it had on the school.' 'I am a heterosexual man myself but have always been proactive in the fight against homophobia. ‘I . know this message may seem a little pointless but I really felt you . should know that you challenged the ignorance of so many people that . day, and if every gay teacher shared your courage, then the world would . be a much better place - not just for gay men – but for all of us. For . that, I thank you. Watford Boys School where David worked when he gave an assembly about homosexuality and announced that he himself was gay . ‘They may not quite have had the wherewithal to tell you so, but so many of the students had so much respect for you for what you did - never had we witnessed a teacher perform so honestly the act for which they were employed - the act of teaching . ‘I will carry the memory with me for the rest of my life. Thank you.’ Commenting on the unprecedented national response to this moving story Andrew Gilliver, from the Gay and Lesbian Foundation told the MailOnline: 'David’s experience shows us the courage it can take to come out in the workplace and also the importance of positive role models for young people. 'It is wonderful to hear that all these years later, one of his pupils still remembers the positive effect David Weston’s honesty had on them. 'We hope this sends out a message of support to all those people who are worried about coming out, whether they are a young person or an adult. 'David’s story demonstrates how important it is to live in a society where we can discuss things such as sexual orientation openly without fear or prejudice, but also how important it is for young people to have positive support and guidance. 'Everyone at The Lesbian & Gay Foundation would like to wish David all the best and if anyone reading this needs to talk about their own situation they can contact us in total confidence.'","David Weston started teaching Watford Grammar School in 2003 .

Jerad Miller, 31, posed as the Joker in a video where he is seen ranting and raving about the One World Order and other political conspiracy theories . Killers: Jerad and Amanda Miller have been identified as the couple who killed three in Las Vegas on Sunday . Miller is made up in full costume - a practice that was something of a past time for him and his wife - while he delivers a monologue apparently meant to mock President Barack Obama, who he believed was setting up concentration camps and planning to take away American citizens' guns. Miller, 31, and his wife Amanda, 22, ambushed and killed two Las Vegas police officers on Sunday before fleeing to a Walmart, where they shot dead a civilian who pulled a gun on them. Amanda Miller then shot her husband in the head before committing suicide as SWAT officers closed in. Jerad Miller, an avowed white supremacist and neo-Nazi, is said to have shouted 'The revolution is coming!' during the rampage. He also draped one of the dead officers with a swastika. It is believed that Miller was motivated by a raft of conspiracy theories about the 'New World Order' - including the belief that a United Nations-controlled government was planning to round up citizens and take away their weapons and ship them to concentration camps. Villains: The couple regularly dressed as Batman villains The Joker and Harley Quinn, neighbors said . These are all on full display in the Inside Edition video. 'Vote for me, America.

The ex-wife of a Los Angeles publishing heir will be getting just $2,000 a month in spousal support, despite living for 20 years in the lap of luxury, that included multimillion-dollar homes, private jets and purchases of art, designer jewelry and fine wine. Before their marriage ended, Frederick and Mary Kate Williamson were spending up to $50,000 a month living in and renovating a $2.75million estate outside Santa Barbara, California. Neither Mr or Mrs Williamson were working, but were living off gifts - including a one-time lump sum of $900,000 - given to Mr Williamson by his parents, Courthouse News Service reports. Mr Williamson's great-grandfather was Harry Chandler, the second publisher of the Los Angeles Times and a Los Angeles real estate mogul. Split: Frederick and Mary Kate Williamson, age 51 and 50, had access to seemingly unlimited funds for the 20 years they were married. When they split, the spigot dried up and Mrs Williamson was left receiving $2,000 a month in support payments . The couple's second home was on the grounds of the Ritz Carlton Huntington Hotel in Pasadena and included full access to the property's swimming pool, spas and gyms . However, when the marriage ended in 2006, Mrs Williamson found that the spigot had been shut off. Mr Williamson's parents who had generously given 'loans' and 'advances' on his inheritance, now said he was all but cut off. A judge, therefore, ruled that the only income Mrs Williamson was entitled to was $99,000 a year a made from his trust fund and working as a classified sales manager for the Santa Barbara News Press. Based on that figure, she was granted spousal support of $2,000 a month - less than a tenth of the $26,000 she requested, according to court documents. Mrs Williamson appealed. She protested that Mr Williamson's potential assets and income was much higher. 'Everybody in the family just gets money when they need it,' she wrote. Starter home: The couple bought this estate on the Ritz Carlton grounds for $900,000 and sold it years later for nearly $3.5million . Mrs Williamson, a former Ann Taylor sales clerk who never finished college, met and married Mr Williamson in 1986. They had three children, all of whom are now over 18. In court documents, she listed a long history of Mr Williamson's parents giving the couple money for homes and other expenses. Each year, the family received $130,000 in 'gifts' from his parents - $26,000 each for Mr and Mrs Williamson and their three children. In 1991, Mr Williamson's father 'loaned' his son $395,000 to buy their first home. The loan was later forgiven. A few years later, the family received $1.2million to buy and renovate the historic Harton Hall home on the grounds of the Ritz Carlton Huntington Hotel. The purchase of the $900,000, 7,000-square-foot home gave them access to the grounds of the Ritz Carlton and its pools, gym, tennis courts and spas. The couple also had a full-time housekeeper. The last home was a a 2.2-acre estate in Santa Barbara that cost $2.75million and millions more to renovate. In the end, the couple sold it for a massive loss when they divorced . Furthermore, account to court documents: 'Frederick and Mary Kate drove luxury automobiles and had a full-time housekeeper. They belonged to several exclusive private clubs, including The California Club, The Valley Hunt Club and The Pasadena Athletic Club. 'They traveled frequently, both internationally and domestically, sometimes by private jet. During ski season, the family spent most weekends at Mammoth Mountain. Mary Kate shopped at high-end stores, purchasing designer jewelry, clothes, handbags and shoes. Frederick collected fine wine.' Then, in 2003, the couple sold their home for $3.4million and purchased a $575,000 ski lodge in Mammoth, Colorado, as well as $2.75million, 2.2-acre estate in a private community in Santa Barbara. Mr Williamson received a $340,000 advance for that transaction, as well. The couple then undertook a lengthy renovation of the new property. Mr Williamson quit his $120,000-a-year job at the Los Angeles Times to work on the renovation fulltime, court documents say. During this time, the court had no income from jobs but were spending $45,000 to $50,000 a month. Last week a state appeals court upheld nearly all of the lower court's ruling after the bitter divorce - including the $2,000 a month payment. Judges found that no matter how wealthy Mr Williamson's parents were or how willing to give him money they were, they could not be forced to pay for his ex-wife's support.","Frederick and Mary Kate Williamson were living on $50,000 a month when they divorce - despite neither of them having jobs .

"By . Michael Zennie . and Associated  Press Reporter . Special Forces Green Beret Staff Sergeant Scott Studenmund is the latest casualty to be identified . The heartbreaking cost of a friendly-fire airstrike that killed five U.S. soldiers is becoming more and more clear as one-by-one, the names of the dead emerge publicly. On Wednesday, the family of a Pasadena, California, Special Forces Green Beret Staff Sergeant Scott Studenmund, 24, identified him as one of the casualties of the bombing. He is the third serviceman from the deadly strike to be named. Identified on Tuesday were: 19-year-old Aaron Toppen from Illinois and 25-year-old Juston Helton from Ohio. Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said the five American troops were killed Monday 'during a security operation in southern Afghanistan. Officials said an airstrike was called in after the unit was ambushed by the Taliban. It is one of the deadliest friendly fire incidents in nearly 13 years of war. Studenmund attended the prestigious Flintridge Preparatory School, where he was star quarterback on the football team. Friends and neighbors say he always wanted to be in the military. Scroll down for videos . Tragic: Justin Helton, 25, of Ohio, (left) and Aaron Toppen, 19, of Illinois, (right) are among the five American servicemen who were killed in a friendly fire airstrike . Helton's family says he was engaged to be married when he was killed. He had been in Afghanistan for just two months . Toppen, pictured here with his girlfriend, always wanted to be a soldier, his sister said: 'My brother lost his life doing what he always wanted to do since he was a little boy' 'He was tenacious. He was fierce. From a very early age, he knew he wanted to serve this country,' Mary Lyon, a family friend, told KABC-TV. After graduating from the $31,000-a-year private academy, Studenmund joined the army, where he worked hard to rise through the ranks and join the Special Forces - one of the most elite units in the U.S. military. A Toppen family spokesman said representatives from the U.S. Army came to the door of Toppen's . mother, Pam Toppen, in the middle of the night to deliver the news. Military . representatives also went to the home of Justin Helton's parents in . Beaver, Ohio, early Tuesday to inform them of their son's death, a . relative said. Mindy Helton said her cousin specialized in dealing with explosives and was based out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Helton had been in Afghanistan about two months and was engaged to be married, she said. He had been in the Army since 2010. Toppen was the youngest of three children. 'At midnight last night my moms . doorbell rang and we received the news that my little brother was one of . the five involved in friendly fire in Afghanistan,' his sister Amanda . Gralewski wrote on Facebook. 'My brother lost his life doing what he always wanted to do since he was a little boy.' Toppen's family says they were informed Monday night that he had been killed in a friendly-fire incident in Afghanistan . Toppen was from Mokena, a suburb 35 miles southwest of downtown Chicago. As . Toppen's family and friends gathered at the home, painted a light blue, . his uncle, Jack Winter, described the high school graduate as a caring . and funny man who had aspired to a career in the military or law . enforcement. 'Aaron was predisposed to serve. He was very keen to be in the military,' Winter said. 'He was quite proud to be there.' 'He . was something somewhat rare in youth culture today. ... In a word, I . would summarize what he had as ""class,""' Winter added. 'So rarely now do . you see somebody like that who truly does have class who's polite, . humble, loyal, who's a kind-hearted soul, generous.' It . was the second death of a loved one for the family this year. Toppen . was set to leave for Afghanistan in February, but his gravely ill father . died that month and he stayed for the funeral. He deployed in March. Toppen . was a graduate of Lincoln-Way East High in Frankfort, Illinois, and . loved the outdoors, especially fishing. Family members at the home — . where friends continued to stop by and bring food Tuesday evening — . circulated a picture of Toppen as a young child sitting next to his . father in a fishing boat. Military members provided few details of the attack to the family, Winter said. Helton was an explosives disposal technician based out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He had been in the Army since 2010 . 'A . military representative came to my sister's home ... and broke her . heart,' Winter said. 'It just tears your world apart. That's the . situation my sister is in.' The Taliban claimed responsibility for Monday's ambush in Zabul. A . Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousef Ahmadi, said a battle took place between . foreign troops and Taliban fighters in the Arghandab district, and a . ""huge number"" of NATO soldiers were killed or wounded in the fighting. The Taliban often exaggerate their claims. Pentagon reports say the troops were all . special operations, though Toppen's Facebook page says he is in the . regular U.S. Army infantry. Fox News . reported that the aircraft in question is a B-1 Lancer, a strategic . Cold War-era bomber that can carry a payload of up to 125,000 pounds of . explosives. 'Five American . troops were killed yesterday during a security operation in southern . Afghanistan. Investigators are looking into the likelihood that friendly . fire was the cause. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of . these fallen,' Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said. If confirmed, it would be one of the most serious cases involving coalition-on-coalition friendly fire during the war. 'The casualties occurred during a security operation when their unit came into contact with enemy forces. Tragically, there is the possibility that fratricide may have been involved. The incident is under investigation,' the coalition said in an earlier announcement. One of the worst such incidents came in April 2002 when four Canadian soldiers were killed by an American F-16 jet fighter which dropped a bomb on a group of troops during night firing exercise in southern Kandahar. A senior police official in southern Zabul said the coalition soldiers were killed when they called for close air support. The deadly airstrike happened in southern Zabul Province as American troops were leading security missions in the run-up to the Afghan elections . Provincial police chief Gen. Ghulam Sakhi Rooghlawanay said there was a joint operation by Afghan and NATO troops in the area's Arghandab district early Monday. After that operation was over, the troops came under attack from the Taliban and called in air support, he said. 'After the operation was over on the way back, the joint forces came under the attack of insurgents, and then foreign forces called for air support. Unfortunately five NATO soldiers and one Afghan army officer were killed mistakenly by NATO air strike,' Rooghlawanay said. There was no way to independently confirm Rooghlawanay's comments. The coalition would not comment and NATO headquarters in Brussels also declined to comment. The only U.S. troops now involved in combat operations are usually Special Operations Forces that mentor their Afghan counterparts. They often come under fire and are responsible for calling in air support when needed. Because of constraints placed by outgoing Afghan President Hamid Karzai, such air strikes are usually called 'in extremis,' or when troops fear they are about to be killed. Karzai blamed a similar airstrike called in by special forces mentoring an Afghan operation for killing a dozen civilians during an operation in northern Parwan province. The U.S. military vehemently denied the charge, saying that two civilians were killed in crossfire with Taliban militants and that airstrike was called in when forces thought they were about to be killed by insurgents. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack against the joint force in Zabul. Deadly airstrike: A U.S. Air Force B-1 Lancer bomber (like the one pictured) reportedly dropped the bombs that killed the U.S. troops Monday night . A Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousef Ahmadi, said a battle took place on Monday night between foreign troops and Taliban fighters in the Arghandab district. Ahmadi claimed a 'huge number' of NATO soldiers were killed or wounded in the fighting. The Taliban often exaggerate their claims. Separately, a NATO statement said a service member died Monday as a result of a non-battle injury in eastern Afghanistan. The deaths bring to 36 the number of NATO soldiers killed so far this year in Afghanistan, with eight service members killed in June. The insurgents have intensified attacks on Afghan and foreign forces ahead of the country's presidential election runoff Saturday. Officials are concerned there could be more violence around the time of the vote, although the first round in April passed relatively peacefully. Casualties have been falling in the U.S.-led military coalition as its forces pull back to allow the Afghan army and police to fight the Taliban insurgency. All combat troops are scheduled to be withdrawn from the country by the end of this year.","Deaths on Monday worst single most deadly incident since helicopter crash on April 26 .

"By . Michael Zennie . and Associated Press Reporter . A Virginia dad has massacred his family on Father's Day - shooting dead his wife, his 9-year-old step-daughter and a 2-year-old son in his crib before turning the gun on himself, police say. Police say Barry C. Jernigan, a 35-year-old electrician, called his employer and made disturbing and suicidal comments before the shooting Sunday night. The employer called officers, who arrived at the home in Chesterfield, Virginia, outside Richmond, in time to heard gunfire inside, but too late to save the family. Officers say Jernigan shot dead his 30-year-old wife Renotta, her daughter from a previous relationship Alexis Kellas, 9, and the couple's son Seth, 2, before committing suicide. Neighbors described heroically running toward the sound of gunfire in the quiet neighborhood and finding toddler Seth dying of a gunshot wound in his bloody crib. Tragic: Barry C. Jernigan, 35 (right) shot dead his wife Renotta (left), step-daughter Alexis Kellas, 9, (lower right) and baby son Seth (left) before killing himself . Tragic: Medical examiners wheeled a stretcher in the Chesterfield, Virginia, home where a Father's Day massacre left a family of four dead . Gary Nguyen, a retired U.S. Marine, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch he and a nurse pulled the child out and performed CPR. The little boy died after being rush to the hospital. Barry Jernigan and Alexis were found inside the small, white, ranch-style home with a plastic play set on the front porch and trampoline in the backyard. They and the mother died at the scene. A police spokeswoman Elizabeth Caroon told MailOnline Barry Jernigan legally owned the gun he used used in the shootings. Police had never been called to the house for domestic violence reports. However, court records show Jernigan was found guilty in 1999 of reckless driving and involuntary manslaughter. The details of that case were not immediately clear. On Monday morning, neighbors tried to cope with the tragedy while standing near the house with two cars in the driveway that was surrounded by yellow police tape. 'It saddens me to think, Father's Day, of all days.You go home and shoot your kids, really?' said next-door neighbor Cindy Nguyen, 29, whose husband tried to save Renotta and little Seth. Mrs Nguyen said Renotta had stumbled out of the front door Sunday before collapsing on the lawn. Nguyen said that she didn't know the family too well but that the father worked nights, 'seemed fine,' and typically made small talk with neighbors since the Jernigans moved into the home about two years ago. Tragic: Neighbors say Renotta, pictured here with her two children, stumbled outside and collapsed on the lawn after the shooting . Neighbors say they had no indication that anything was wrong on Sunday - Jernigan even wished them a happy Father's Day . Barry Jernigan even wished her husband, 30-year-old Harry, a happy Father's Day as he walked along the street Sunday afternoon. The Jernigans recently installed a fence after complaining about items being stolen from their backyard, she said. Nguyen called the youngest of the victims a 'sweet baby boy' and said her son played with the 9-year-old, who was known by her nickname, Lexi. Jernigan's 67-year-old father, Barry, said he last spoke with his son - who went by Chris - on the phone shortly after 1pm Sunday. He said his son wished him a happy Father's Day and told him he planned to hang around the house until he left for work that evening. While he had helped the family financially, Mr Jernigan said his son didn't talk to him much about family business, adding that he had been in and out of jobs since graduating from Dinwiddie High School in 1997. 'He was the type of person that he figured he could do everything ...  he could deal with it. Over the years, that was his attitude,' Mr Jernigan said. 'I just wish he would have called me.' Jernigan said he couldn't understand what would've led his son to kill his family and then himself, saying he sounded normal when they last spoke. 'I don't know why he took that little baby, that little baby was the world to me,' he said. 'Seems like something you'd seen on TV, you'd never think it would happen personally.' Police continued their investigation Monday, with investigators carrying paper bags out of the home. Officers on the scene declined to comment.

"By . Michael Zennie . Updated: . 12:17 EST, 8 June 2014 . A Florida model who admitted to burning down a 3,500-year-old tree so she could see the methamphetamine she was trying to smoke has avoided jail time. Sara Barnes, 28, who claimed on her modeling web page that she was a nature enthusiast, must perform 250 hours of labor and pay more than $12,000 in restitution for starting the January 2012 fire that claimed the tree, called The Senator in Seminole County, Florida. The Senator stood 125 feet high and was 17 and a half feet in diameter was a sapling when the Pharaohs ruled Ancient Egypt in the 14th century BC. By the time Jesus Christ was born, it was nearly 1,500 years old. Too late: Seminole County and Longwood firemen watched helplessly as the 3,500-year-old tree burned . Not one with nature: Authorities found methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia at Barnes's home in Florida .

"By . David Mccormack . and Michael Zennie . A woman in Florida has received a $25,000 settlement after a police officer forced her to lift her shirt and shake out her bra during a routine traffic stop. Zoe Brugger, 29, was pulled over by Lakeland police officer Dustin Fetz on May 21 for a broken headlight. Silent video taken from the patrol car shows a humiliated Brugger being forced to shake out her bra multiple times in a search for drugs. None were found. Scroll down for video . Zoe Brugger, 29, has received a $25,000 settlement from the city of Lakeland, Florida, after a police officer forced her to lift her shirt and shake out her bra during a routine traffic stop . The video went viral and sparked national outrage. Despite search tactics that the State's Attorney called 'highly questionable' and 'demeaning,' a Lakeland police investigation found that Fetz hadn't violated the department's strip-search policy. He served just a one-day suspension for not having his microphone on. The $25,000 was approved by city officials July 1 and a check was issued to Brugger on July 7, reports The Ledger Lakeland. The dashcam video shows Miss Brugger, who had given birth to a . baby boy just days earlier, crying as she lifts her shirt. Pulled over: Lakeland Police Officer Dustin Fetz pulled over Zoe Brugger for a broken headlight, and was convinced that she was hiding drugs - which prompted the strange search . Contraband: After being pulled over for a broken headlight in Lakeland, Florida, Zoe Brugger had to shake out her bra twice while the police officer searched for drugs - an action that State Attorney Jerry Hill called 'highly questionable' and 'demeaning' Officers found no evidence of . drugs or any other illegal substances when they pulled her and . boyfriend Larry Fields over for having only one working . headlight. Brugger told ABC Action News that Fetz 'made me go through the whole humiliating ordeal with shaking my bra out, right there in the middle of this parking lot on Beacon Road.' When no drugs appeared, Fetz 'told me that he was taking me to Bartow jail for driving on a suspended license and that they had an x-ray machine there and they were definitely going to find what I had hidden inside of me,' Brugger said. Brugger was driving on an invalid license, which was enough reason to arrest her. But Fetz didn't. Instead he asked to search the vehicle, and when the couple relented, he searched it anyway. Another office who showed up as backup considered the search improper. Shake down: Officer Fetz didn't find any drugs on Brugger, or in the car . Fetz broke another rule during the stop by leaving the audio off in the dash camera. If the audio had been turned on, 'there would be little to no speculation as to what occurred during that traffic stop,' said State Attorney Investigator Mike Brown. At the end of the stop, Fetz told Brugger 'I'm done scaring you, and now you can do home,' she told The News Herald. After the incident, she filed a complaint and notified the State Attorney's Office. Bold: Brugger, left, had just returned from picking up her boyfriend from work. He was in the car the whole time Officer Fetz searched Brugger . State Attorney Jerry Hill called for an investigation and wrote a critical letter to the Lakeland Police Department saying that the search was 'highly questionable' and not only 'demeaning' but 'ineffective and possibly dangerous.' He cited the fact that, if Brugger had been concealing a weapon, asking her to shake out her bra would have just given her access to that weapon. Fetz, on the other hand, told investigators that the search method 'is a known technique that is used by some LPD officers though he can't recall formally being trained to use it. 'Looking back on the incident (Fetz) recognizes that he was overzealous in his attempt to locate illegal drugs or contraband in the car,' Brown said.","Zoe Brugger was pulled over for a broken headlight, when the officer suspected there were drugs in the vehicle .

"By . Michael Zennie . A 21-year-old college student who says she is pregnant with the love child of married NFL star Arian Foster is due any day now. Brittany Norwood is suing Foster, 27, to determine paternity of the child and claiming emotional distress - but the Houston Texans star is reportedly already paying child support to the single mother. Norwood went public in January with claims that she got pregnant during an affair last year with Foster and that he and his brother tried to pressure her to have an abortion. He denies those allegations. Foster has been married to German-born model and singer Romina Reinhart since 2011. They have two children together. The three-time Pro Bowl running back signed a five-year, $43.5million contract in 2012. He made $5.25million last season.

Norwood, who was a senior at the University of Houston before she got pregnant, shared a picture of her blossoming baby bump on her Twitter account last week. She revealed she would be due in two to four weeks. She has also written about the challenges of enduring her pregnancy as a single mother-to-be. 'Trying so hard not to have a break down putting together this baby bassinet. Doing everything on your own is tough,' she writes. She revealed that she plans to name the child Gatsby Alexander. However, she also takes thinly-veiled swipes at Foster, who ended his relationship with her. 'Men these days are real quick to lie and say what they can to get what . they want but they say peace real quick when a baby is involved,' she tweeted.

Earlier this month, she tweeted about Chanel designer handbags with the hastag 'noknockoffs.' In another post she wrote: 'Taking my Herve out of the closet so I can admire it. I can't wait to have my body back with my baby boy accessory,' referring to the famous 'bandage' dress by designer Herve Leger. She also wrote: 'Baby chino and linen. I love dressing my little baby doll already!' In April, she tweeted: 'I can't wait to order a Shirley Temple in a few short hours and be like ""No please check my I.D."" #finafreakinly21.'

"By . Associated Press . and Michael Zennie . A friend of Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev wired more than $71,000 to people in six countries and used fake names several times for the transactions - including while Tsarnaev was on a pilgrimage in Russia, according to prosecutors. Khairullozhon Matanov, 23, is accused of . deleting computer files and lying to agents investigating the 2013 . bombings, which killed three and injured more than 260. Prosecutors accuse the immigrant from Kyrgyzstan of a 'pattern of deceit' in dealing with authorities as they investigated the bomb attacks. At a detention hearing, Matanov waived his right to seek release on bail. His lawyer said Matanov has no family here, lost his job as a cab driver after his indictment last week and has nowhere to go if he were released. Khairullozhon Matanov, right, appeared in a Boston courtroom on Wednesday to answer charges he hindered the federal investigation of his friends, the Tsarnaev brothers . Prosecutors portrayed Matanov as a close friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev and an acquaintance of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the two brothers authorities say planted two bombs near the marathon's finish line. Through the testimony of an FBI agent, they also described a series of money transfers in which they said Matanov often used fake names. Agent Timothy McElroy said that between 2010 and 2013, Matanov sent more than $71,000 to 15 people in six countries. McElroy said agents determined that most of the money — about $56,590 — was sent to Matanov's family, while the rest — about $14,800 — went to non-family. Matanov's lawyer, Edward Hayden, said the money transfers 'had nothing to do with terrorism.' 'He was uncomfortable sending all the money in his own name,' he said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Garland said Matanov had repeatedly deceived authorities when questioned about his relationship with Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the days after the bombings. Garland said his ""pattern of deceit"" was also shown through Matanov's use of aliases when sending money. He also argued Matanov was a flight risk. Khairullozhon Matanov was arrested Friday morning on obstruction charges related to the Boston Marathon bombing . Prosecutors portrayed Matanov as a close friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev and an acquaintance of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the two brothers authorities say planted two bombs near the marathon's finish line . Hayden attempted to show that Matanov cooperated with police. McElroy acknowledged that Matanov went to police in the Boston suburb of Braintree the morning after the FBI released photographs of the Tsarnaevs and gave them the brothers' address and phone numbers. That was hours before Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured hiding in a boat in Watertown. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police earlier that day. Hayden said Matanov was angry when he learned the Tsarnaevs were suspects in the bombings. ""He calls them names that you can't put on TV,"" he told reporters. McElroy said the FBI began following Matanov after he came forward. McElroy also said that federal prosecutors told Matanov's attorney to urge his client to stay away from Boston's July Fourth celebration because ""the city was on edge following the marathon bombings.""

"By . Michael Zennie . and Reuters . and Associated Press . The winter Games have opened in Sochi, Russia, to the sound of deafening silence. The Olympic debut of slopestyle - a snowboarding event that has competitors performing breathtaking tricks - kicked off today in front of a nearly empty stadium. The spectators who did attend were nearly all Russian - raising questions over whether security threats, human rights questions and the trickle of Sochi horror stories will keep the world away from the Olympics. There were large pockets of empty seats during portions of men's and women's qualifying on Thursday, particularly near the beginning and end of the seven-hour session. Scroll down for video . Anybody there? The stadium for the Sochi Olympics' debut event was almost entirely empty on Thursday - a discouraging start to a Winter Games already plagued with problems . The event was before the official opening ceremony on Friday, but the turnout was nonetheless discouraging for athletes . The weather wasn't to blame. Conditions were perfect with sunny skies, warm temperatures and not even the hint of a breeze. And, despite controversy after two competitors were injured, on jumps that were deemed 'too dangerous,' the course wasn't to blame, either. After days of tweaks, the jumps were tame enough for eight riders to post scores in the 90s - very strong performances. Thursday's slopestyle qualifying courses marked the first Olympic competition has been held before the winter Games opening ceremony in 30 years. The crowd appeared to be largely Russian. The biggest cheers were reserved for Russian Alexey Sobolev even though he finished 10th out of 15 riders during his qualifying heat. As the competition began, much of the focus had been on athlete safety. However, most athletes came away unscathed at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park. All eyes were on the course following Wednesday's withdrawal of American Shaun White, citing safety concerns, and the frightening crash that left Norway medal hope Torstein Horgmo with a broken collarbone. But if any of the snowboarders were holding anything back on the sport's Olympic debut they did not show it, as they launched themselves spinning through the air to impress the judges. Australian Scotty James was left clutching his ribs after a heavy fall, and Norway's Kjersti Buaas had to seek medical attention following a wipeout on her final run in the womens second heat. Thursday marked the Olympic debut of the sport - slopestyle - though some of snowboarding's biggest stars have pulled out after deeming the course 'too dangerous.' American Karly Shorr is pictured . Safer? Austria's Mathias Weissenbacher wiped out Thursday during the qualifications - though he was not seriously hurt . Big air: Jan Scherrer of Switzerland grabbed his board during a big jump in the qualifications for the Men's Slopestyle competition . But overall, competitors were pleased with the course. 'It's demanding, but it works. It's not a bad course,' Norway's Torgeir Bergrem, who slipped in both runs, told Reuters in the finish zone . 'They're not the most ""poppy"" jumps - we're used to getting a little help with our tricks - but you have to do everything on your own here, so I guess that's the main difference that people are struggling with.' Bergrem said that doubts over course safety expressed earlier in the week had been dealt with after organizers trimmed the height of some of the jumps. 'It's not dangerous at all, it's a regular course,' he said. 'The jumps are regular size, the rails are good, it's fine.' Games officials had been racing to complete preparations in time but as Britain's Billy Morgan took off to give slopestyle its official debut, volunteers were still hammering poles into the ground to secure crash barriers. Morgan was so focused on his run that he was not even aware he was about to make snowboarding history. Nearly everyone in the stands was Russian, according to reports - raising questions about whether the world is willing to come to Sochi . The opening ceremony is not until Friday, but the sparse attendance does not bode well for the Sochi games . 'It was pretty cool, I didn't realize until one of the other athletes told me at the top,' he told reporters. 'I didn't think about it until the last minute. I had fun and it was really good.' Cheered on by a crowd well short of capacity, the riders grabbed the sport's Olympic opportunity with both hands, posing for photographs and signing autographs for fans. Eight automatic spots in both the men's and women's final were up for grabs on Thursday, with the second heats delivering the day's most breathtaking action. Austria's Anna Gasser showed no signs of nerves as she put in a sizzling run to score 95.50 to book her place in the final. 'I was so nervous, I've never been that nervous in my life before. I'm straight to the finals, that's the best thing I could wish for,' she said with a beaming smile. 'It's the Olympics, and back home it's the first time it (slopestyle) is on TV back home, so I knew all my friends were watching.' In the second heat of the men's competition, Canada's Maxence Parrot came out on top after a frenzied second run which saw the lead change hands several times. The men's final is on Saturday and the women's the following day.","Thursday marked the Olympic debut of slopestyle - a snowboarding event .

"By . Michael Zennie . and Associated  Press Reporter . The father of a teenager who was allegedly shot dead at a Florida gas station over his loud rap music has testified about his shock and horror after learning of the fatal shooting. Ronald Davis took the witness stand today against Michael Dunn, 47, who is claiming self defense in the shooting of 17-year-old Jordan Davis. Jurors also learned that Jordan died from a single bullet wound to his chest that severed his aorta. Dunn fired nine times after getting into an argument with Jordan and his friends over the rap music the teen was blasting from his SUV at a Jacksonville, Florida, gas station in November 2012. The racially-charged case has sparked comparisons to the killing of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Jordan was black; Dunn is white. Dunn is charged with first degree murder. Shocked: Ronald Davis, the father of 17-year-old Jordan Davis, testified Monday that he was horrified to learn his son had been gunned down . Too loud: Michael Dunn (left) is facing a . first-degree murder charge for fatally shooting 17-year-old Jordan Davis . (right) in an argument about speaker volume in November 2012 . Mr Davis, Jordan's father, said he told detectives days after his son's death that he was horrified to learn of how the boy had died. 'I think I said at the time that I was shocked that my son was killed,' Mr Davis said. Prosecutors had hoped Mr Davis could testify about a conversation he had with the three other teens who were in his son's SUV at the time of the shooting. However, legal wrangling by Dunn's defense meant Mr Davis was able to make only that statement. Prosecutors rested their case on Monday. Their last witness was an associate medical examiner as their last witness in direct testimony in the first-degree murder trial of Michael Dunn, who is pleading not guilty. He said he acted in self-defense when he fatally shot Jordan Davis, 17, of Marietta, Ga., outside the store in Jacksonville in November 2012. According to authorities, an argument began after the 47-year-old Dunn told Davis and his friends to turn the music down they were listening to in an SUV outside the store. One of Davis' friends lowered the volume, but Davis then told him to turn it back up. Officials say Dunn became enraged and he and Davis began arguing. Dunn, who had a concealed weapons permit, pulled a 9 mm handgun from the glove compartment of his car, according to an affidavit, and fired shots into the SUV. Nine bullet holes were found in the car. Dunn grinned slightly in court on Monday as his legal team began its case by calling character witnesses . Riddled with bullets: Evidence markers on the shot up SUV show where nine bullets entered the vehicle . Associate medical examiner Stacey Simons testified Monday that the first bullet that hit Davis in the abdomen likely killed him. The bullet went from his lower right abdomen, into his diaphragm, through his liver and hit his aorta, she said. 'I believe it would have been fatal within a matter of minutes,' Simons said. Under cross-examination, Simons said it was unlikely Davis was standing up when he was shot. Dunn's defense attorney, Cory Strolla, had argued in opening statements that Davis had threatened Dunn with a 4-inch knife. Simons said the bullet appeared to have struck something hard, like a car door, before hitting Davis. Florida Department of Law Enforcement analyst Sukhan Warf said toxicology tests on Davis showed no signs of drugs or alcohol in his body. No gun was found in the SUV. Another law enforcement department analyst, Maria Pagan, testified earlier in the day about the steps Dunn took before shooting the teen, bolstering prosecutors' contention that he acted with premeditations. Florida Department of Law Enforcement firearms analyst Marie Pagan shows the 9mm pistol Dunn used to kill Jordan Davis. He fired nine shots . Dunn would have had to remove the gun from its holster, load the chamber with a bullet and then apply six pounds of pressure to fire it, Pagan said. Dunn fired the gun 10 times, hitting the SUV nine times, and he would have had to pull the trigger every time using more than six pounds of pressure each time, Pagan said. Pagan answered affirmatively when prosecutor Angela Corey asked, 'Does that take a conscious effort of the shooter to have a second-round come out?' The first witness to testify for the defense was Randy Berry, a friend of Dunn. He said he never knew Dunn to be violent. Berry's wife, Beverly Berry, also testified that she had never seen Dunn with anything but a calm demeanor. Dunn had been at his son's wedding before the shooting. Dunn's ex-wife, Phyllis Molinaro, and son, Chris Dunn, told jurors that Dunn didn't appear drunk and was in good spirits at the wedding. The defense attorney also called Davis' father to ask him what he recalled in the days after the shooting. 'I think I said at the time that I was shocked that my son was killed,' Ronald Davis said. At the end of the day, Strolla told the judge he expected to call only one or two more witnesses on Tuesday before wrapping up the defense presentation.","Ronald Davis says he was 'shocked' to learn his son Jordan Davis has been killed .

"By . Michael Zennie . A top Indian diplomat has been arrested in New York after she paid her house-keeper only $3.13 an hour and lied to get her into the country, federal prosecutors said Thursday. Deputy Consul General Devyani Khobragade, 39, has publicly campaigned for women's rights and gender equality. But the woman she hired to clean her house and look after he two young daughters says Khobragade paid her less than $600 a month - $3.31 an hour - despite telling U.S. immigration officials the staffer would be paid $4,500 a month. Deputy Consul General Devyani Khobragade, 39, has publicly campaigned for women's rights and gender equality but allegedly paid her housekeeper $3.31 an hour . Khobragade is a prominent diplomat who has been posted in Pakistan, Italy and Germany before being given an assignment in Manhattan . Khobragade's lawyer on Thursday said that his client enjoys diplomatic immunity and said he would moved to have the charges dismissed on those grounds. But U.S. Attorney for Manhattan  Preet Bharara was adamant. 'Foreign nationals brought to the United States to serve as domestic workers are entitled to the same protections against exploitation as those afforded to United States citizens,' he told the New York Daily News. 'The false statements and fraud were designed to circumvent those protections.' Prosecutors allege that Khobragade falsely signed visa documents for the worker saying that she would be paid $4,500 a month. Then, when the housekeeper came to the United States, Khobragade told her that she would be making only 30,000 rupees a month - less than $600, according to prosecutors. Khobragade works at the Indian Consulate General in Manhattan. She was arrested Thursday and released on $250,000 bail . Khobragade faces one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements. If convicted, the charges carry a total maximum penalty of 15 years in prison . Khobragade had the worker sign the second contract, which she kept, the charges state. She was arrested Thursday and released on $250,000 bail after surrendering her passport so she can't flee the country. She faces one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements. If convicted, the charges carry a total maximum penalty of 15 years in prison. However, the Indian embassy is already fighting the charges, asking the American government to have the case dropped on the grounds of diplomatic immunity. 'The US side have been urged to resolve the matter with due sensitivity, taking into account... the diplomatic status of the officer concerned,' said a statement from the Indian embassy in Washington DC. Further, when the allegations against Khobragade first surfaced, an Indian court issued an order against the housekeeper, ordering her not to take legal action against the diplomat, according to the Hindustan Times. When it became apparent that the woman was cooperating with American authorities, the court issued an arrest warrant for the housekeeper and requested the U.S. officials have her detained and extradited back to India. Before being posted in New York, Khobragade service with the Foreign Service in Germany, Italy and Pakistan.","Deputy Consul General Devyani Khobragade, 39, has publicly campaigned for women's rights and gender equality .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Michael Zennie . A 35-year-old threw his three-year-old son to his death from the roof of a 52-story skyscraper and then jumped killing himself, after a judge ordered him to hand over the boy to his estranged wife. The killer dad has been identified as Dmitriy Kanarikov, a systems analyst from Brooklyn. His son Kirill plunged 46 stories after being pushed from a ledge on the roof of the building. He landed on a sixth floor landing before crashing down onto a John Jay College building next door to the highrise. He was alive when paramedics arrived on scene, but died minutes later at St. Luke’s Roosevelt Hospital. Kanarikov is a native of Ukraine and worked as a systems analyst for TIAA-CREF in New York. He lived in Brooklyn, but was selling the family home . Tragedy: A 35-year-old man and a three-year-old boy are dead after reportedly jumping from this midtown building . Kanarikov was found on a fourth floor landing of the Midtown Medical Pavilion next door. He died at the scene. He lives in Brooklyn, but reportedly accessed the South Park Tower at West 60th Street and Eighth Avenue because a friend lives there, according to the New York Post. The Post reports that investigators believe little Kirill was thrown or pushed from the tower because he was found farther from the roof deck than his father's body - who likely plunged straight down after jumping. Kanarikov was supposed to hand his son off to his estranged wife Svetlana Bukharina at a police precinct today after a messy custody dispute. He and Kirill never showed up. The Ukrainian immigrant left no note explaining his actions. In September, Kanarikov wrote on his Facebook page, 'I want to be the best dad and husband - nothing is more important to me right now' Horrific: Dmitriy Kanarikov, center, is seen here with his estranged wife Svetlana Bukharina, left, and their three-year-old son Kirill just three months ago in September . Tragic: The NYPD is investigating the horrific murder-suicide. The four-year-old child died at a local hospital. The father died at the scene . A family member who answered the phone at a relative's house sounded distraught before telling MailOnline she could answer no questions. Kanarikov wrote on his Facebook page in September: 'I want to be the best dad and husband. Nothing is more important to me right now.' Investigators have constructed an opaque bubble at the place the two are believed to have been found and are now focusing their investigation on an alleyway between the tower and a school next door. 'They were pumping his chest and doing working on him, and nothing,' Luis Ortiz told NY1. 'You could tell that he was already slipping away.' Another witness told the station the boy was wearing Christmas pajamas as he was wheeled away with paramedics trying to keep him alive. Unthinkable: Their son Kirill, 3, was having his first unsupervised visit with his father on Sunday when Kanarikov did the unthinkable and shoved his little boy off a New York City skyscraper . Crime scene: Investigators walk out of the lobby of the midtown building where a 35-year-old man and a three-year-old boy plunged to their deaths Sunday afternoon . Where they landed: The father and son landed on the roof of the building's lower base, at left . On the scene: Police are still investigating the apparent suicide . Kanarikov's body is wheeled away by the Medical Examiner's office after detectives finished examining the crime scene Sunday. Police say Kanarikov died instantly when he landed on a nearby building . 'Being a parent of two kids myself, it’s just heartbreaking,' another witness told NY1. The 500-unit West 60th Street building is 52-stories high. It is only blocks from both Lincoln Center and the Time Warner Center.","Father was in the midst of a messy custody dispute with his estranged wife .

"By . Michael Zennie . A Blackwater security contractor threatened to kill a State Department investigator in Iraq who was looking into allegations of the company's cost over-runs, boozy parties, mistreatment of migrant workers and violence against civilians, according to a newly-released report. Daniel Carroll, Blackwater’s project manager in Iraq, allegedly told Jean C. Richter that 'he could kill me at that very moment and no one could or would do anything about it as we were in Iraq,' in August 31, 2007, Richter claimed in an official report he filed after the fact. But instead of Mr Carroll, a former member of the elite Navy SEAL Team Six, being disciplined, Mr Richter was the one sent home. U.S. Embassy officials in Baghdad told him he had to end his investigation and leave Iraq because he was disrupting the security options Blackwater was providing for diplomatic staff, the New York Times reports. Blackwater security contractors, seen here guarding U.S. Administrator L. Paul Bremer, were paid $1billion to protect Americans diplomats in Iraq . Just over two weeks later, Blackwater contractors opened fire in Baghdad's Nisour Square, allegedly killing 17 civilians and wounding 20 others. The incident caused massive outrage among the Iraqi public and is believed to be one reason Iraqi leaders refused to agree to allow U.S. troops to stay in the country past 2011. Mr Richter claims: 'Mr. Carroll’s statement was made in a low, even tone of voice, his head was slightly lowered; his eyes were fixed on mine. I took Mr. Carroll’s threat seriously. We were in a combat zone where things can happen quite unexpectedly, especially when issues involve potentially negative impacts on a lucrative security contract.' Mr Carroll has not commented publicly on the allegations. Despite his abbreviated visit to Iraq, Mr Richter's report paints a damning picture of Blackwater, which was paid more than $1billion to guard American diplomats. Blackwater contractors, most of whom are former U.S. special operations soldiers, allegedly acted like they 'had the run of the place' in Iraq and were 'above the law' Blackwater was founded in 1997 by Erik Prince, a former Navy SEAL. The initial mission was to provide training to military and policy units at a massive facility in the Great Dismal Swamp in North Carolina. In 2002, the company launched Blackwater Security, which provided private soldiers to government clients. Most employees were former Navy SEALs or other special operations soldiers. During the Iraq War, the company proved a major force - providing protection for the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and for U.S. State Department staff throughout Iraq. At the height of the war, tens of thousands of private soldiers were scattered across the country. Some estimates indicate up to 100,000 Blackwater contractors were in Iraq at one time. They guarded American compounds and Iraqi assets, freeing up U.S. soldiers to go on the offensive. Most estimates are that Blackwater collected $1billion in U.S. government contracts. According to one report, Blackwater charged $445,000 per contractor per year - six times the cost of fielding a U.S. solider. In September 2007, the Iraqi government revoked the company's license to operate in the country after Blackwater employees allegedly killed 17 civilians when they opened fire in Nisour Square in Baghdad. The government demanded that the Blackwater contractors involved be tried in Iraqi courts. Both the U.S. government and the company said the men were immune from prosecution under Iraqi law. In 2009, after several Blackwater contractors were charged with manslaughter by the federal government, the company changed its name to XE Services LLC and Pricne stepped down as CEO. In 2010, a group of private investors bought the company and changed its name again to Academi - as well as instituting organizational changes. Earlier this year, Constellis Holdings - which owns several other private security companies, bought Academi. He comments in his report that . 'Blackwater contractors saw themselves as ""above the law"" and actually . believed that they ""ran the place.""' Mr Ritcher details a pattern of drunken partying by Blackwater contractors, including with female visitors. In . one incident, he describes four guards drunkenly commandeered a . $180,000 armored vehicle to drive to a party and then crashed it into a . blast barrier. Contractors kept their weapons in their . personal quarters, despite rules against it, and carried all manner of . automatic weapons, machine guns and rocket launchers - even when the . contractors were not certified to use them, according to the report. Blackwater guards were also alleged to frequently run Iraqi civilian cars off the road and fire into neighborhoods, sometimes even killing civilians, Mr Richter alleges. Mr Richter's review also found the company's security operations lacking. The contractor often reduced or otherwise changed the number of men assigned to a protective detail without getting permission from the State Department. They also over-billed the State Department and falsified records, Richter alleges. A Blackwater-affiliated contractor also allegedly mistreated migrants it hired to work in its security compound, offering them low wages and squalid conditions for housing - including packing three men in a tiny room with no bed. The company was also accused of badly mismanaging a cafeteria on its compound, providing unsanitary and substandard food. Conditions were so bad, a U.S. military officer wrote a letter to the State Department saying it should be shut down. Blackwater was sold in 2010 and the new owners changed its name to Academi. A spokeswoman for Academi, based in Virginia, declined to comment. Iraqi officials had demanded to try to Blackwater guards alleged to have committed the 2007 Nisour Square massacre in Iraqi courts. However, in 2008, the U.S. government indicted 14 security contractors on charges related to the shooting. In 2009, a federal judge threw out all charges.  However, an appeals court allowed the charges to go forward. The case is still pending.","Jean C.

"By . Michael Zennie . and Associated  Press Reporter . Immigration activist and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas, who has lived and worked in the U.S. illegally for years, was released by U.S. Border Patrol agents on Tuesday after they detained him at a South Texas airport. Vargas, who became an immigration activist after revealing that he was himself an illegal alien, was detained by U.S. Customs officials today after visiting a Texas border town. Vargas founded the pro-immigration group Define American. He was pictured being handcuffed by Border Patrol officers as he tried to board a plane in McAllen, Texas. Scroll down for video . Caught and released: This image, provided to the Huffington Post, shows Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas being handcuffed as he tried to fly out of McAllen International Airport on Tuesday. The Pulitzter Prize winner has lived and worked in the U.S. illegally for years. He was released by authorities later Tuesday evening . Border Patrol spokesman Omar Zamora said Vargas was stopped going through security at the airport in McAllen, only a few miles from the Mexico border. A spokeswoman for Define American, Vargas' advocacy group, confirmed his release Tuesday afternoon. It's common for the Border Patrol to release people on their own recognizances, with notices to appear in court later. With such notices, people can generally travel throughout the U.S. without being detained again. He had traveled to the border city to participate in a vigil for the thousands of unaccompanied minors who are crossing the border illegally. He said that it was not until he arrived in Southeast Texas that he realized people in the region were regularly stopped on the roads and at airports and asked for proof of legal residency. Vargas has been openly flouting the law since June 2011, when he revealed in a New York Times Magazine story that he had come to the U.S. illegally at age 12 . Moments before he was taken way by Border Patrol agents, he tweeted a picture of his Filipino passport and a pocket copy of the U.S. Constitution and wrote: 'About to go thru security at McAllen Airport. I don't know what's going to happen.' At the McAllen-Miller International Airport, only a few miles from the border, Border Patrol agents stand beside Transportation Security Administration agents to check documentation, even for domestic flights. Video taken by the McAllen Monitor newspaper shows him handing over his immigration documents to a TSA agent. He is then question by a Border Patrol agent, who asks him to remove his backpack. The video cuts out as the agent approaches Vargas from behind, presumably to handcuff him. The Huffington Post published a picture, given to the news site by one of Vargas' traveling companions, of the celebrity journalist in cuffs. His spokeswoman, Maria Cruz Lee, declined immediate comment. She said a statement would be issued later in the day. The security situation at the McAllen airport - and elsewhere in the city - is familiar to the thousands of people living illegally in the U.S. along the Texas-Mexico border. Along highways out of the city, drivers are stopped at Border Patrol checkpoints about an hour's drive north of the border. And it's not uncommon for children who entered the country illegally with their parents to grow up in the Rio Grande Valley to stay home when classmates go on field trips along those roadways to San Antonio. Vargas, a native of the Philippines, had flown to McAllen last Thursday to take part in a vigil. In an essay he wrote for Politico on Friday, Vargas said he has travelled in the U.S. for years without a problem but didn't realize that immigration checks are done on those driving or flying out of the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas. Vargas noted that he doesn't have any government-issued U.S. identification. His last tweet Tuesday morning was a photograph of his Philippines passport and a palm-size copy of the U.S. Constitution. Vargas went public about his immigration status in a 2011 piece for the New York Times Magazine. He was part of a team of reporters at the Washington Post that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2008. He also directed a documentary called 'Documented,' and founded the activist group 'Define American.'","Jose Antonio Vargas was arrested trying to board a flight in the Texas border town of McAllen .

"By . Michael Zennie . The U.S. Marine Corps has released harrowing video of a pilot skillfully performing a vertical landing on a stool aboard a ship after his fighter jet's front landing gear failed. The incredible landing was filmed aboard the deck of the USS Bataan, a U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship. On June 7, Captain William Mahoney was piloting an AV-8B Harrier jump jet, a Cold War-era fighter that is capable of taking off and landing vertically. Scroll down for video . Precise: Captain William Mahoney had to land his AV-8B Harrier jet on a stool after his front landing gear failed earlier this money . Capt Mahoney hit his mark exactly - but the nose of the jet bounced several feet off the stool on the final touchdown . Immediately after Capt Mahoney took off from the Bataan, he realized something was wrong with his landing gear. He flew past the ship's control tower and the officer on duty confirmed: the nose landing gear had not deployed. Fortunately, the Marine Corps keeps a piece of equipment on hand in the event of just such a malfunction. It's essentially a giant stool, capable of supporting the 22,000-pound fighter jet's nose. But Capt Mahoney had no room for error. If he missed the stool, the $30million piece of military hardware would smash into the deck of the ship - which could potentially ignite the fuel it was carrying. The pilot uses his plane's jump jets to lower from 300 feet to just 20 feet above the deck. Relief: Rescue crews rushed in after Capt Mahoney successfully touched down . Meanwhile, air controllers  and lights on the deck of the ship are guiding him in. 'So I'm at 20 feet stabilizing and I can't see the stool. I don't even know it's there. I didn't see it coming over the end of the ship, I remember looking for it, but I never saw the stool,' Capt Mahoney said in a U.S. Marine Corps video. Video shows Mahoney lowering to just a few feet above the deck when the Harrier jet sudden drops. The nose hits the stool and bounces. 'At that point, I was just sort of along for the ride,' Mahoney said.","Captain William Mahoney had just taken off from the USS Bataan in his AV-8B Harrier jet when he realized he had a problem .

"By . Michael Zennie . Chinese manufacturers are shipping thousands of pounds synthetic chemicals into the U.S. to make dangerous recreational drugs - and it's all legal. The Drug Enforcement Agency and U.S. lawmakers are struggling to keep up with the influx of new, completely untested, compounds that Chinese chemists offer up online. Websites for Chinese manufacturers advertise of host of chemical substances that can be bought legally by American citizens and shipped to the U.S. The drugs go by street names like Spice, Bath Salts, Molly, Smiles and N-bomb. They are meant to mimic the effects of marijuana, cocaine, LSD and other banned substances. Many forms of these drugs were legal until only very recently. Off the market: Spice or K2, synthetic marijuana, is now banned in nearly every part of the country  - but new, legal, drugs are popping up . This Hong Kong-based company offers long lists of synthetic drugs for sale - including some available for import to the U.S. Any time one substance is outlawed, chemists churn out a new one. In June, the DEA seized 2,200 pounds of synthetic drugs in a sweep across 35 states. DEA Special Agent Doug Coleman told CBS News: 'For the most part China is the main source. They . were probably the first ones to start it. Once they saw there was a big . demand for it, they ramped it up. 'It's like whack-a-mole. They pop their head up, we hit them, they go down and then they pop their head up in another spot.' Health experts say that just because a substance isn't illegal - it doesn't mean it's safe to use. This Shanghai-based company offers the active ingredient in synthetic marijuana for sale online . Authorities often become aware of new synthetic drugs when users start turning up in emergency rooms. Synthetic drugs are responsible for tens of thousands of hospitalizations in the U.S. every year - 10,000 in 2011 for Molly, powdered Ecstasy, alone. And they have been linked to the deaths of dozens of users. Noah Carrasco, 18, of Scottsdale, Arizona, took N-Bomb - a new synthetic form of LSD - in January and died i minutes. His mother told CBS News that it took toxicologists three months to determine what had killed her son. And the drug was perfectly legal to import, buy and sell until November 15, when the DEA used its emergency powers to temporarily ban it. 'It's too risky. It's literally playing Russian roulette,' Noah's mother, Susan Wadsworth, told CBS.","Chinese manufacturers offer dozens of synthetic drugs for sale online for shipment to the U.S.

"Austin Sigg, the twisted teenager who confessed to abducting, raping and murdering 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway in 2012, practiced zip-tying and restraining people on his own mother and slept in her bed night before was arrested for the child's killing. Mindy Sigg seemed to laugh off her son's increasingly-troubling behavior, according to authorities. She joked to a friend about her his fixation on body decomposition and revealed that she helped the 17-year-old practice restraining people by letting him zip-tie her, police say. Sigg, who was sentenced last week to spend the rest of his life in prison, was obsessed with mortuary and forensic science and was convinced he could outsmart detectives who were searching for Jessica's killer. He wiped the child's torso clean of DNA . evidence after he strangled and dismembered her - then brazenly offered a . sample of his own DNA to police when they took swabs from all of the . men in Jessica's neighborhood in Westminster, Colorado. Sentencing: Austin Sigg was been sentenced to life in prison in district court in Golden, Colorado, on Tuesday, November 19, 2013 . Confession: Sigg speaks softly, slowly and calmly as he talks them through the abduction and murder of the ten-year-old . Police initially bungled the DNA test - . losing the sample he handed over that matched him to both Jessica's . murder and the attempted abduction of a jogger months earlier. Despite Sigg's bizarre behavior and morbid fascination - his parents sent him to a Christian counselor in an attempt to set him right - Sigg had a girlfriend, at whose house at spent at least one night a week, it was revealed. The Denver Post reveals a host of chilling new details about the crime that shocked the Denver suburb and horrified the nation last October. Sigg snatched Jessica off the street as she walked home from school after he happened to spot her while he was out 'hunting' for a victim to kidnap and kill, he admitted to detectives. Jessica had been told about the threat that ultimately cost her her life - she wrote two reminders in a journal found in her desk at school: 'Do not play at the park alone' and 'Watch out for strangers!' Despite Sigg's parents' initial concern about his fascination with decomposing bodies and violence, it soon became a laughing matter for his mother Mindy Sigg. A friend told police that Mindy joked about his strange habits. Ms Sigg even said that she had practiced zip-tying and restraining someone with her son, according to authorities. Jessica's disappearance on her way home from school caused panic among . parents across Denver, who feared their children were not safe . When Sigg snatched Jessica off the street, he immediately bound her hands and feet after throwing her into his SUV. Jessica was confused and scared and wet herself. She kept asking if Sigg knew her mother, Sigg later told police. 'I would tell her that everything was going to be OK. I would just lie to her,' he told detectives. He . told police he took Jessica back to his house and cut the ties that . bound her. He sat her in front of a TV and let her watch cartoons. He stripped her out of her wet clothes and made her change into a white t-shirt and black shorts from her closet. He then told her to turn away and he strangled her to death with plastic zip ties. He cut his hand in the process, as police photos show. Sadness: Jessica Ridgeway's aunt Becca Ridgeway, left, mother Sarah Ridgeway and grandmother Christine Ridgeway, right, testify in district court in Golden, Colorano, last week . Horror: Police discovered Jessica's body in a field off of a highway on October 19, 2012. It had been severely dismembered by Sigg, who admitted he killed her . He . dismembered her body and initially hid her remains in a pool house . behind his mother's home. He stashed some of Jessica's belongings in a . crawl space under the house. He . then dumped her remains in a garbage bag off a highway - but not before . he wiped down Jessica's torso. Investigators had to swab the remains . twice before they could even get a partial DNA sample. When . police came around to his house as part of a neighborhood-wide sweep to . collect DNA samples, Sigg brazenly offered his up - thinking that there . was nothing that could trace him back to the crime. What . he didn't know is that police had collected DNA from the attempted . abduction of a jogger four months earlier - and that they also had DNA . from the urine-soaked clothes that Sigg had stuffed in Jessica's . backpack and dumped in town. When . local media reported that police had linked the two cases, Sigg told . classmates at school that he felt 'tremendously' ill and 'wobbly,' the . Post reports. That night, he slept in his mother's bed. The next morning, he confessed his crime to Mindy Sigg - who called police. After his arrest, he led police to the crawl space, where he had kept some of Jessica's remains. A crime scene photo shows a black plastic garbage bag. Police found a broken black zip-tie in Sigg's Jeep SUV. They found bleach and black plastic trash bags on his porch - the same as Jessica's remains had been found in.

"By . Michael Zennie . The moment police gunned down a schizophrenic woman in a hail of bullets has been caught on shocking video. Police in Long Beach, California, say they had no choice but to open fire when Adeline Arroyo, 31, pointed BB gun at them Sunday afternoon. The weapon looked like nearly an exact replica of a Beretta semi-automatic pistol. Despite police firing numerous shots at her and hitting her twice, Miss Arroyo is expected to survive. She is currently recovering at a local hospital in serious condition. Her family says she has a long history of mental illness and suffers from schizophrenia. They say police never should have shot her and instead found a less violent way to subdue her. Scroll down for video . The moment: Adeline Arroyo, 31, can be seen walking toward officers with what appears to be a pistol. This shot was taken a split-second before officers opened fire . Shot: Miss Arroyo immediately recoils and falls to the ground as she is shot. Her family says she was hit twice, but police can be heard firing at least ten times . Sick: Miss Arroyo's family says the 31-year-old is schizophrenic and has a long history of mental illness . KCAL-TV cameras were rolling when Arroyo was gunned down in broad daylight in the middle of a popular street in Long Beach. Officers can be heard shouting at her over loudspeakers as she stumbles around the sidewalk in pajamas. At first she seems to conceal the pistol under a coat. Then she can be seen clearly holding what looks like a weapon in her hand. A video provided to KABC-TV from a witness shows a dozen officers barricaded behind their squad cars, pointing guns at her from all sides. Some have handguns, others are armed with rifles and shotguns. Realistic: This is the BB gun that Miss Arroyo was holding when she was shot. It looks nearly identical to a Beretta semi-automatic pistol . Miss Arroyo, right behind a car, was surrounded by officers on three sides. It is unknown how many of them opened fire on her . The camera captures the moment that police open fire, as she lunches toward the officers. Ten to 11 shots can be heard - including after she falls to the ground. It's unknown how many officers opened fire and exactly how many shots were fired. Miss Arroyo's family says she was hit twice. She was rushed to the hospital in critical condition and later upgraded to serious condition. 'I'm feeling distraught about the whole thing. This is something that shouldn't have happened,' Irene Ward, Miss Arroyo's aunt, told KABC. Police say they had no choice but to shoot Miss Arroyo because she refused to drop the pistol . 'I feel the Long Beach Police Department should be more trained when they're dealing with somebody with a mental illness.' But, the Long Beach police chief said his officers had no choice but to open fire when Miss Arroyo repeatedly refused to drop the pistol. 'If a person has a handgun and they point that in your direction, then at that point less lethal is not appropriate. You're facing a lethal threat,' Chief Jim McDonnell said. This is the 19th person shot by officers in the city of 460,000 so far this year.","Adeline Arroyo, 31, had BB that looked like Beretta semi-automatic pistol .

"By . Michael Zennie . and Daily Mail Reporter . New Mexico police have been accused of violating another man's rights after forcing a driver to undergo an anal probe. When Timothy Young was stopped on October 13, last year, for a minor traffic offense, a police dog with an expired license indicated that he had drugs on him. Mr Young, who was then subjected to a digital anal probe that found nothing, is bringing a lawsuit against Hidalgo County police. Traffic stop: Timothy Young pictured after he was pulled over last year. The driver was later subjected to a cavity search . He went public with his ordeal after details of the invasive procedures David Eckert, another New Mexico driver, had to endure after falsely being suspected of carrying drugs by the same dog, US News reported. Albuquerque civil rights attorney Shannon Kennedy, who is representing Mr Eckert, said she is also filing a lawsuit on Mr Young's behalf. After Mr Young was stopped last year for allegedly turning without a signal, a police dog named Leo that allegedly has an expired license, signaled that he had drugs on him, KOB-TV said. The driver was taken to Gila Regional Medical Center in Silver City where doctors performed and X-ray and digital anal probe. It is the same medical center Mr Eckert was taken after being pulled over on January 2, 2013. Mr Eckert claimed he was subjected to . three enemas, two rectal searches, two X-rays and even a colonoscopy - . all in pursuit of non-existent narcotics. After . it was done, the hospital that performed all the procedures against his . will billed him - and threatened to hire a collections agency if . he didn't pay, he alleged. Civil rights attorney Ms Kennedy, who is representing both men, claimed the training certificate for Leo the dog had expired and that it had given false alerts before. 'We have done public requests to find . anything that would show this dog has been trained, we have evidence . that this dog has had false alerts in the past,' she said. Three Deming policemen and three Hidalgo County officers were allegedly involved in Mr Eckert's case, which may be settled out of court. Lawsuit: David Eckert is also bringing legal action against Gila Regional Medical Center, where the medical procedures were carried out . Named defendants include the six . police officers, the medical center, two doctors and a deputy district . attorney who secured a warrant authorizing an anal probe. No drugs were found in the possession of either man. A . member of Hidalgo County Sheriff's office referred questions about the . case to their attorney's office, which did not immediately respond to a . request for a comment. In Mr Eckhert's case, the hospital in question and police have refused to comment on the lawsuit. KOB-TV reported that Mr Eckert was pulled over on January 2 as he was pulled out of the Walmart in Deming, New Mexico. Officers say he failed to make a complete stop at a stop sign. Law suit: Civil rights attorney Shannon Kennedy is representing both drivers . They asked Mr Eckert to get out of his car. When he stood, an officer claimed, he was clenching the cheeks of his buttocks - which the officer believed was a sign he was hiding drugs. That single observation kicked off the horrific cavity searches that kept Mr Eckert in captivity for 14 hours. 'If the officers in Hidalgo County and the City of Deming are seeking warrants for anal cavity searches based on how they're standing and the warrant allows doctors at the Gila Hospital of Horrors to go in and do enemas and colonoscopies without consent, then anyone can be seized and that's why the public needs to know about this,' Ms Kennedy, told the TV station. After officers noticed Mr Eckert's posture, they called a drug dog, which indicated a smell of narcotics on Mr Eckert's driver seat. A search of the car revealed no drugs. So, officers held him until a judge issued a warrant authorizing a body cavity search. First officers took him to Mimbres Memorial Hospital in Deming, but doctors there said the procedures police were requesting were 'unethical' for them to perform, according to court documents. Then, the officers him across county lines to Gila Regional Medical Center in Silver City. Kennedy argues in the lawsuit that transporting Mr Eckert to another county violated the terms of the search warrant and made the entire search illegal. Doctors performed a colonoscopy, which involves inserting a camera up his anus and all the way into his large intestine. He had to be sedated for the procedure . Once at Gila Medical Center, according to the lawsuit, doctors put Mr Eckert through several hours of invasive, humiliating searches. The lawsuit claims that Mr Eckert vocally objected to each search, but doctors performed the procedures anyway. At the hospital, doctors probed his rectum with their fingers. When they didn't find anything, he was given an X-ray. When the X-ray came up negative, he was probed again. Then, he was given an enema and forced to defecate in front of the doctors and police officers and watch as they sifted through his stool. Doctors then performed a second and third enema. None of the enemas discovered drugs. He was then X-rayed for a second time. After the final, X-ray he was sedated and given a colonoscopy, a complex medical procedure that involved the doctors inserting a camera into his anus, rectum, colon, and large intestines. Finally, after 2am, when the colonoscopy came up negative, he was released without charges, according to the lawsuit.","Timothy Young subjected to medical prodcedure after being stopped for minor traffic offense .

A drug-addled robber terrorized Miami during rush hour this morning after he took a hostage during a botched drug store heist, shot and wounded three police officers and stole a squad car before he was gunned down in the street with an accomplice. The mayhem began at 3.30am Tuesday when Adrian Montesano tried to rob a Walgreens in Little Havana and the crime went horribly wrong. Police say he took a hostage in an attempt to get what he wanted. Police released a surveillance camera image showing 27-year-old Montesano with his arm around a female hostage's throat while he points a semiautomatic pistol at her head. She was later released unharmed. Witnesses said Montesano was driving . pickup truck for his heating and air conditioning business that was . emblazoned with his own name. Scroll down for video . Horrifying: Police say this surveillance camera image shows Adrian Montesano, 27, after he took a hostage during a botched drug store robbery . Paramedics carry away a woman who needed medical attention from a nearby apartment complex after a police shoot-out that killed two suspects . A man who arrived at the crime scene and identified himself as Montesano's friend told the Miami Herald that Montesano robbed the pharmacy to support his drug addiction. He said that Montesano had been an upstanding citizen before he 'fell in with the wrong crowd.' About 5am, Miami Officer Saul Rodriguez spotted Montesano's truck at a trailer park about two miles from the robbery scene. Suspect: Adrian Montesano, 27, is a drug addict who was trying to get money for his addiction, a friend told reporters . When the 13-year police veteran approached the vehicle, Montesano shot him in the stomach. The fugitive then took the officer's pistol and sped off in his squad car. WSNV-TV reports that Rodriguez could be heard gasping for breath as he radioed in a description of the man who shot him. 'White male. Red shirt. Gray pants. Officer down.' That . set off a frantic manhunt across the city. Half an hour later, the . squad car was spotted near  the home of a family member of Montesano. Officers spotted him in his grandmother's blue Volvo, which witnesses later said he had taken from her home. A police pursuit ensued and Montesano, who was driving with another man, crashed. As officers approached, Montesano and his accomplice opened fire. Two officers were wounded in the arm. Police returned fire and riddled the luxury car with bullets. One of the suspects died at the scene. The other was mortally wounded and died at the hospital shortly after the gun battle. Three other officers were hospitalized with minor injuries from the gunfight, including an officer who was hit by flying glass. Witnesses say Montesano used his company pickup truck - which has his own name plastered all over it - as a getaway vehicle after the robbery . A body of one of the suspects can be seen at the scene of the police shootout where both men were killed by officers . Crime scene technicians collect evidence near the blue Volvo, left, that Montesano crashed during a police chase early Tuesday . Police said all six officers, including Officer Rodriguez, were expected to make full recoveries and that their wounds were not life threatening. Montesano had only one previous run-in with police, when he was arrested in 2007 for trespassing after he drove through a fence into a beach, the Herald reports. Officers found him trying to use beach signs to get his truck unstuck from the sand. When police approached him, he swore at them and claimed he a member of his family was a police officer.

The fan who mysteriously died after he was found in someone else's car in the parking lot outside Sunday's Kansas City Chief's game was viciously pummeled by tailgaters, it was revealed. The medical examiner's office has ruled Kyle Van Winkle's death a homicide - meaning he was killed by another person - though it has not made a decision on the cause of death. The Kansas City Star reports that police are focusing their investigation on a 24-year-old tailgater as Van Winkle's primary attacker. Tragic: Kyle Van Winkle, 30, was the father of a seven-week-old son. He died at the hospital . Van Winke's death was ruled a homicide - though the medical examiner's office has not yet ruled on what caused his death . Detectives searched the man's home and arrested him - though he has not been formally charged and his name has not been released. Van Winkle, the 30-year-old son of a Missouri police sergeant and a new father, died in the parking lot of Arrowhead Stadium Sunday after he left the Chiefs-Denver Brocos game. His family says he got into an unlocked dark-colored Jeep in the parking lot that looked nearly identical to one of the vehicles his friend drove to the game. It was in the same row as his friend's vehicle - but 10 cars away. When the owner of the Jeep arrived at his car with his 10-year-old son and found Van Winkle inside, he called for help - believing he had broken into the vehicle, according to police. The Star reports that tailgaters who were watching the game on TV from the parking lot ran over and began beating Van Winkle. Deadly struggle: Three men were taken in custody after a man died during a vicious parking lot brawl near this Jeep on Sunday night . The men reportedly brawled in the parking lot at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City (pictured) last night . One witness tried to stop the assault, but the tailgaters pushed him away. One tailgater in particular, the 24-year-old who is now a suspect, showered Van Winkle with blows until he was unconscious, according to police. Someone propped him up, unconscious against a bus. The 24-year-old assailant and his friends went back to their tailgate party. The Jeep owner and his son left. An unknown amount of time later, a bystander noticed that Van Winkle was turning blue. Witnesses called paramedics - but it was too late. He died at the hospital.","Kyle Van Winkle, 30, was beaten by tailgaters until he was unconscious and then left for dead .

"By . David Mccormack . and Sam Webb for MailOnline . Robin Williams once chartered a private plane to pay a surprise visit to meet a terminally ill girl after she became too sick to visit him on set. Following the actor’s sad death on Monday, a number of people have come forward with inspiring stories about how he touched their lives and the latest is Mark Cole from Greensboro, North Carolina. He recalls Williams’ kindness and warmth when he paid a special visit to meet his daughter Jessica, age 5, as she lay dying with brain cancer in 2004. Scroll down for video . The father of Jessica Cole, who died of brain cancer in 2004, has recalled how Robin Williams chartered a private plane to visit his dying daughter in North Carolina and spend several hours cheering her up . The meeting was arranged through the Make-A-Wish Foundation and Jessica’s final wish was to meet her ‘hero’. ‘Robin Williams was her hero,’ Mark Cole told WFMY. ‘She was a huge fan and especially Ms. Doubtfire.’ Originally Jessica was supposed to travel to California to meet the actor on set, but her condition deteriorated and she was no longer fit to travel. 'In 2004, it became apparent that there was nothing doctors could do to reverse the process with the tumor growing,' said her father. The meeting in 2004 was arranged through the Make-A-Wish Foundation and Jessica's final wish had been to meet her 'hero' When the kind-hearted actor was informed about Jessica's condition he chartered a private plane to visit her at home the very next day. 'She was a little disoriented at that point with extra fluid on her brain, it was out of place for her also seeing Robin Williams walk into our home. She was confused when he first came in. Then he started his Mrs. Doubtfire imitation and then she figured it out pretty quickly.' The pair spent the day playing cards and watching football. ‘He acted like he had known her forever,’ said Mark Cole. ‘He was a lot of fun to be with.’ Jessica passed away on December 14, 2004. Loss: . Teenager Jessica Cole, who spent a day with Robin Williams two months . before she passed away. He chartered a private jet to go and see the . girl when she became too ill to travel . One of Williams' most notable film roles was Patch Adams, where he played a medical student who helped his patients by making them laugh with his zany antics. However, the actor, like the character he portrayed, also had a heart-warming dedication to helping patients after the cameras stopped rolling. Family members of those he comforted have paid tribute to the 63-year-old, who was found dead in his San Francisco mansion on Monday. Garry Kravit, whose nephew David Buist was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, called the star a 'comedic Mother Theresa'. The best medicine: Robin Williams in Patch Adams, where he played a doctor who helped patients by making them laugh. The actor showed extaordinary kindness to real-life child patients . David bravely decided that he wanted to see a new Ronald McDonald House - a charity that provides accommodation for families with children in hospital - built in New York before anything happened to him. Kravit met Williams at an event and asked him for autographed items for their fund-raising efforts. Williams went much farther and started calling David to help keep his spirits up as his condition deteriorated. 'When David was suffering at his worst, Robin would call him to perk him up. David treasured Robin's calls and it helped to push him forward,' Mr Kravit said. Williams even invited the pair to a filming of a comedy special in New York in 2004. Pictured, Robin Williams with his daughter Zelda Williams. Right, in his hit role as Mrs Doubtfire, the favorite film of cancer sufferer Jessica Cole, who spent the day with him just two months before she died . 'He hugged him and spent 20 minutes with him. He didn't care about anything but David,' Kravit told CNN. Buist eventually beat his cancer and is now married with children. Numerous stories about his kindness have emerged since his apparent suicide. Susan Jeffer was an extra hired to play golf in the background of Old Dogs, starring Robin Williams. After filming had finished, the strap on her golf bag broke and she had to carry it across the course in the hot sun. The only person to help her was the Oscar winner, who, knowing she would get in trouble if she was seen being helped by the star, carried the bag but handed it back just before they reached the rest of the actors and crew. She said: 'He really saved me that day. I'll never forget it.'","The father of Jessica Cole, who died of brain cancer in 2004, has recalled how Robin Williams chartered a private plane to visit his dying daughter .
The actor flew to Greensboro, North Carolina, and spent several hours entertaining the young girl, who died two months later .

"By . Lillian Radulova For Daily Mail Australia . Being a home owner and still living relatively close to your capital city is not something many Australian's consider an option. But new figures from RP Data have highlighted the cheapest five suburbs to buy a house or unit within 10 kilometres of each Australian city. In Sydney, Wolli Creek was revealed to be the cheapest suburb to buy a home, with a median value of $710,303, closely followed by Waterloo which has a media house price of $761,054. Scroll down for video . In Sydney, Wolli Creek was revealed to be the cheapest suburb to buy a home, with a median value of $710,303 . In Melbourne, the suburbs of Bellfield and Maidstone will see you secure a home for just over half a million dollars . Median house and unit prices for each capital city in Australia, up to the week ending August 17 . Eastlakes and Darlington were the cheapest Sydney suburbs close to the CBD to purchase a unit in, with median prices of  $452,776 and $453,413 respectively. Despite these prices still being quite expensive, RP Data's research analyst Cameron Kusher told Daily Mail Australia that out of 146 suburbs within 10 kilometres of Sydney's CBD, only 28 had a median price which fell below a million dollars. 'Those areas all tend to have a lot of industrial presence or commercial areas and are not largely residential suburbs,' Mr Kusher said. However, he added that despite this drawback, the areas have scope for urban renewal in the future due to their proximity to the city. Rocklea and Keperra were revealed to be the best suburbs to look for a home in Brisbane, with median house prices of $330,848 and $416,036 . Glendalough in Western Australia was revealed as the cheapest suburb to buy a house, with the median price of . $438,995 . Near Adelaide, Dry Creek and Gepps Cross were the cheapest suburbs within 10 kilometres of the CBD, at $255,349 and $313,467 respectively . 'Looking at Melbourne and even Perth and Canberra, your still paying a lot to get closer to the city but certainly nowhere near as much as you would in Sydney.' In Melbourne, the suburbs of Bellfield and Maidstone will see you secure a home for just over half a million dollars while Carlton was to found to be the cheapest suburb to purchase a unit close to the capital city, at less than $300,000. Rocklea and  Keperra were revealed to be the best suburbs  to look for a home in Brisbane, with median house prices of $330,848 and $416,036. Clarendon Vale near Hobart, with a median house price of $159,159, was found to be the cheapest suburb near Tasmania's CBD . In Darwin the suburb of Malak has a median house price of $585,478, while Alawa was the cheapest suburb for unit prices at around $366,947 . Page was the cheapest subrub in Canberra with a median house price of $445,417 . A unit close to Brisbane can also be secured for around $332,317 in Tingalpa or $335,633 in Kedron. According to Mr Kusher, the heightening of prices closer to the CBD reflect where all the amenities are. 'Inner city suburbs are generally better serviced by both essential and desirable amenities such as schools, medical services, shopping centres, social amenity, roads and public transport infrastructure,' he said. 'People don't want to be sitting in traffic or public transport for hours if they don't have to,' he said. 'The competition and desire to be so close to the city centre is what's pushing those values so high.'","RP Data has revealed the cheapest five suburbs to buy a house or unit within 10 kilometres of each Australian city .

"By . Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . A 'bloody ugly' house in Mona Vale on Sydney's northern beaches has sold for close to $2 million, almost $500,000 over the reserve price on Saturday. The four bedroom property on Narrabeen Park Parade, was described by the selling co-agent Michael King of Sothesby's as having 'no endearing features whatsoever. It was awful, it just had nothing.' 'Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But it's bloody ugly,' he told Daily Mail Australia. One of the selling agents described the property as 'bloody ugly' and having a 'dog smell' He added that the property even had a bad smell: 'It smelt like a dog had been living there for 20 years.' The bidding for the house opened at $1.2 million and soon passed the reserve price of $1.45 million, before it eventually sold for $1.91 million, $460,000 above the reserve price. 'It was ultimately about the spot. I put it down to supply and demand. They're generally generational properties. They're tightly held, you seldom see the same one come up again and again,' he said. The late-60's, brick veneer family home is a short walk from the beach and is in a low-density area, with no apartments around it. Mr King said the successful buyers were likely going to redevelop the property . 'It's all about location': The four-bedroom family home is in the desirable northern beaches suburb of Mona Vale . The property was last up for sale in 1990, when it was purchased for $367,500. Mr King also added that the northern beaches region has been 'dragging the chain' as property prices have skyrocketed across Sydney and prices in the region are finally catching up to the rest of the city. 'Inner-city markets have been doing well for a while, but the northern beaches have dragged behind it,' he said. Mr King said the buyers, a couple with adult children, are likely to redevelop the house at some point, although not speculatively. The property has a direct pathway to the beach nearby .","House in Mona Vale in Sydney's northern beaches sold for $1.9 million on Saturday, $460,000 higher than the reserve .

"By . David Mccormack . A woman who had both hands and feet amputated in her battle to survive a rare form of septic shock has said she is 'filled with joy' for the future after learning to walk again using prosthetics. Pam Buschle, a 53-year-old social worker and mother from Grand Rapids, Michigan, had gone into hospital for routine abdominal surgery last December. But days after the operation she went into septic shock, a condition in which the body’s response to an infection damages tissues and organs. Scroll down for video . Pam Buschle, a 53-year-old social worker and mother from Grand Rapids, Michigan, who had both hands and feet amputated in her battle to survive septic shock has said she is 'filled with joy' for the future after learning to walk again using prosthetics . With her liver, heart and kidneys failing, she was put into an induced coma and given medication to restrict blood flow to her limbs and redirect it to her vital organs. Doctors told her husband Martin that the process carried a risk that part or all of her hands and feet would have to be amputated, but with odds of less than one per cent that his wife was going to survive there was little alternative. Miraculously Pam responded to the treatment, but with her limbs no longer able to function she had them amputated below the knees and elbows. Now months later she has learned to walking again, to use prosthetic arms and is looking forward to regaining her independence. Doctors told Pam's husband Martin that his wife's odds of surviving the rare form of septic shock she had contracted was less than one per cent . ‘I just want people to know that when they are going through something like an amputation or disabling condition, that there really is hope at the end of it – however dark it may seem in those moments,’ she told Michigan Live. ‘I’m a person who came through those darkest moments. And my life is filled with joy.’ She attributes her positive outlook to the help she has received at Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital in Grand Rapids. After nearly two months in hospital, Pam was transferred to Mary Free Bed where she spent four months as an inpatient slowly regaining strength and learning to use prosthetic legs and arms. ‘She was extremely inspirational, both on a therapy level and the personal level,’ said Britney Rauch, a physical therapist who helped Pam. Eight months after her ordeal, Pam has learned to walking again, to use prosthetic arms and is looking forward to regaining her independence . ‘Any challenge I would give her, she would not only do but succeed so well. She had the most positive attitude and outlook on everything.’ When Pam left inpatient care on May 30, she walked out of Mary Free Bed on her prosthetic legs with the assistance of a walker, while friends and family cheered her on. Pam continues to undergo outpatient therapy at Mary Free Bed and they have helped her and her husband learn about the many opportunities and equipment available to help people regain mobility. Later this year she hopes to return to her job as a social worker.. 'I have so much gratitude for still being in this world and being able to enjoy the things I enjoyed before,' she said.","Pam Buschle, 53, from Grand Rapids, Michigan, contracted septic shock last December after a routine operation .

According to the researchers, 13 percent or just over 1 in 8 of residents in the country's smallest state - also known as The Ocean State - smoke marijuana monthly. The rate of toking in Rhode Island is more than three times the rate in Kansas, where only 4 percent of residents regularly indulge, while the national average was about 7 percent. Rhode Island is the marijuana capital of the U.S. according to new state-level research compiled in the latest National Survey on Drug Use and Health . Other states where pot smoking is very popular included some more obvious candidates such as Colorado and Washington which have both legalized the recreational use of marijuana this year. Western states tended to have the highest rate of usage, at 9 percent, while the South has the lowest overall rate at 5.83 percent, reports The Washington Post. States in the highest group included were Alaska, Colorado, Montana and New Mexico, while states that partook least when the joint was being passed included Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia. The most popular age group using marijuana on a regular basis was unsurprisingly those aged between 18- to 25-year-olds. Almost 19 percent of this age group has used marijuana in the past month, according to the NSDUH. However the state-by-state variations in those numbers could be considerable. In Vermont, more than one third of 18-25-year-olds regularly used marijuana, but the figure was less than 10 percent of the same age group in Utah. Usage rates drop off considerably amongst people aged 26 and over and only 5 percent of people over that age said they still smoked marijuana on a regular basis. Alaska was the state with the largest number of people aged 26-and-over who continued to regularly use marijuana, at 11.18 percent.

"By . David Mccormack . Police have released security camera footage showing the thief who robbed former Mrs. Texas United America of nearly $1 million in jewelry, bags, and valuables from her luxurious 'she cave'. Theresa Roemer said she and her husband were only gone 90 minutes for dinner at a country club just two blocks away, but they came home to broken glass and empty shelves. The robbery bears all the markings of being perpetrated by a professional thief. In the video footage, released on Tuesday, the burglar is seen wearing a light-colored, hooded jump suit with a baseball cap which helps him blend into the background as he expertly picks through items in Roemer's astonishing three-story, 3,000-square-foot closet. Scroll down for video . Police have released security camera footage showing the thief who robbed former Mrs. Texas United America of nearly $1 million in jewelry, bags, and valuables from her luxurious 'she cave' Surveillance footage recorded a small man dressed entirely in white and wearing gloves in the house, taking four trips to move all the goods outside . Deputies have determined that the intruder forced his way into the Roemers' home through a bathroom window. Surveillance footage recorded a small . man dressed entirely in white and wearing gloves in the house, taking . four trips to move all the goods outside. The burglary occurred between 7 p.m. and . 11 p.m. on Friday and the suspect spent almost an hour inside, relaying . items back outside. Police have released the video in an attempt to generate leads about the theft, which happened less than two weeks after Roemer's closset had been featured on Good Morning America. Happier times: Theresa Roemer's massive 'she-cave' housed a fortune's worth of expensive handbags, watches, shoes and other baubles . Cleaned out: What's likely a professional thief made off with nearly a million dollar's worth of Roemer's possessions . Roemer told the Houston Chronicle that the video was shot with an infrared camera, because the intruder worked in the dark and never turned on the light. 'That's why it is so unclear and we can't tell the exact color of his clothing,' she said. Roemer has admitted that she and her husband failed to turn on their home's security system before heading out to dinner on Friday night. She also didn't lock the glass door to her prized 'she-cave'. 'I don't think anybody can go through life without doing something careless when they're flustered and hurried before leaving,' she told the Chronicle. 'But now I lock all my doors and have lights on, inside and out. The alarm is set, and I'm having more lights and cameras installed.' Roemer said that because she was only away from her home a short while she did not arm the security system . Roemer said she and her husband were only away for 90 minutes to eat dinner at a nearby country club . Roemer said she used the space to host charity events and that it took her a whole 45 minutes to get ready . 'They took everything,' Roemer said. 'They took all my jewelry, all . my watch collections, my husband’s watch collections, my Birkin . collection. They literally walked out with between $800,000 and a . million dollars’ worth of stuff.' The most expensive items taken included 10 Rolex watches, up to a dozen Chanel watches, Cartier watches, and other expensive baubles and accessories. 'I feel violated… raped,' she said. 'To watch someone on film . take everything out of your house that means much to you – it’s just . wrong.' She may have been targeted due to the recent media attention on her  3,000sq ft closet, called her 'she-cave.' Theresa . Roemer, a former Miss Texas United America, enlisted designer Thom . Anderson to add the luxurious three-story space to her Woodlands, Texas, . home, which houses her handbags, shoes and other accoutrements. It cost . roughly $500,000 to build. 'It . started years ago when I had a closet party and all the girls came over . and they said, ""I just wish it was bigger,""' she told the Houston Chronicle, adding: 'Since then it's just been getting bigger and bigger and bigger, it's like a ''she cave.'' It appears the thief gained entrance by using a glass cutter to get into the bathroom . Violated: Roemer compared teh break in to feeling of being 'raped' 'The . third floor houses all my furs and big hats, you come down the spiral . staircase to the second floor which is where I get my hair and make up . done, it also houses all the shoes from Louis Vuitton and Gucci, to my tennis and work out gear,' she said. 'Then . you come down a floating staircase, which is just magical, and the . first floor is where you pick out your jewelry and bags,' she continued, . noting that it typically takes her 45 minutes to get ready. In fact, the closet even features a champagne bar - perfect for hosting events to benefit charitable causes. 'Yes, it’s full of amazing things,' Mrs Roemer she had told Houston’s KHOU, 'but this closet was built and intended for fundraising.' Roemer . has used the hot-ticket space to raise money for causes such as the . American Heart Foundation and Texas Children's Hospital. But it also serves the style needs of those close to Mrs Roemer. The thief target high-end items like Rolex and Cartier watches . 'My daughter always says that she doesn’t need to go to the store; she can just shop my closet!' she told Neiman Marcus's blog. 'And of course I do let a few, very special friends borrow my Birkin bags.' Upon learning her sanctum had been violated, she tried to put things in some perspective. June was the seventh anniversary of her son's death in a car accident. 'I need to count my blessings that no one was hurt or killed,' Roemer said. 'I’ve been through amazingly hard things in life, like burying . my son, and this is not anything compared to that.'

Texas teen Kendall Jones drew the ire of thousands last month with her Facebook photos showing her smiling alongside rare African beasts, but the cheerleader was the toast of the Texas Trophy Hunters Association Hunting Extravaganza in Houston at the weekend . Jones of Cleburne didn't speak to the media, but she was happy to pose with fans - many of them young girls - who attended the event on Saturday and Sunday . The majority of comments on the TTHA Facebook page were supportive of Jones, with one fan writing, 'We need more of . your kind. You are what makes America strong.' Another wrote, 'You have done a great job representing Texas and hunters everywhere,' reports EverythingLubbock. Last month Jones . posted Facebook pictures showing her posing beside dead animals such as a . lion, a leopard and other African big game that she had allegedly killed. Jones . received death threats and the Texas Tech cheerleader's dad Cody Jones demanded the removal of the page 'Kill Kendall Jones' that featured posts condemning the huntress as well as a picture of a lion smiling atop a dead hunter. The majority of comments on the TTHA Facebook page were supportive of Jones, with one fan writing, 'We need more of your kind. You are what makes America strong' Fair game? A mock Facebook page called 'Kill Kendall Jones' cropped up in the wake of the controversy over a Texas teen college cheerleader's Facebook pictures featuring her rare African trophy kills . 'Credible threat': Facebook removed this page by Thursday despite initial claims from Kendall's supporters that their calls to have it taken down had been rebuffed . In . a statement, Facebook said it removes 'reported content that promotes . poaching of endangered species, the sale of animals for organized fight . or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse'. The decision sparked outrage from Jones' father, who sent to TMZ the response he got from Facebook saying the anti-Kendall page could stay. Facebook has since removed the page for representing a 'credible threat of violence' toward the teen. It came after more than a quarter of a million animal lovers signed a petition urging . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to take down the photos in which Jones smiles . proudly over the corpses of her prey she claims to be saving from . extinction. Removed: Facebook had taken down this photo of Kendall Jones, 19, with a lion that she hunted in Africa. The social networking site said that the image - and others - violate their standards . 'For the sake of all animals,' the petition against Jones reads as it implores . animal lovers to sign, 'especially the animals in the African region... where hunters are going for fun just to kill an animal!' After starting the social media firestorm, the cheerleader hit back at her attackers by saying she is actually protecting wildlife. In a typo-laden defense that invoked . the safari-loving 26th U.S. president Teddy Roosevelt, she claimed . killing rare rhinos and elephants helps to save them. 'This . is a conservation effort to assure [sic] that they never do become . extinct,' the teen from Cleburne, Texas posted to Facebook. Gone: Facebook has also removed this image of her with an elephant. It said it removes 'content that promotes poaching of endangered species... or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse' '[Roosevelt] . was a hunter too, right? He killed the same species that hunters now . chase today under a mound of anti-hunting pressure. 'Yet, . how can it be possible that someone can love the earth, and take from . the Earth in the name of conservation? For some folks, they'll never . understand. For the rest of us...we were born that way. God Bless . Teddy,' wrote Jones. Jones, whose Facebook indicates . she 'is looking to host a TV show in January 2015,' said here isn't . always space for threatened species like elephants or lions. 'Controlling the male lion population . is important within large fenced areas like these,' Jones writes. 'Funds . from a hunt like this goes partially to the government for permits but . also to the farm owner as an incentive to keep and raise lions on their . property.' 'This is a conservation effort!': The Texas Tech cheerleader said she is helping the animals by killing them . Big 5: Jones says her first kill was a rare African white rhino, part of her quest to bag the Big 5 African game animals (rhino, elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard and lion) Legal: The young hunter has many critics but also a lot of supporters who say what she's doing is fine, since she pays the governments of African countries to kill the animals .

She immediately began chest compressions and forced air into his mouth until the little creature opened his eyes and started moving again. Sherrie Dolezal, 62, of Salem, Oregon, poses with her beloved pet Del Sol, a bearded dragon, who is back in good health after almost dying last week . The grandmother, who calls herself the Reptile Rescuer, keeps 22 lizards – including 3-year-old Del Sol - at her home. She was having a crazy day Tuesday, running errands and caring for her pets when she took Del Sol out to clean and feed him and then put him back in a small swimming pool. She put Del Sol in his pool on Tuesday but forgot to put rocks in so he could climb about. When she came back she found him floating face up. ‘When I came back I was sure he was dead, which just killed me because Del belongs to my great-grandson, Roberto,’ Dolezal told the Statesman Journal. Sherrie Dolezal demonstrates how she used chest compression on Del Sol, her pet bearded dragon, which she brought one back to life using CPR . ‘I really couldn’t remember how many chest compressions should be given before a rescue breath, but he was blue so I just did it. I was really amazed it worked.’ Working for what she said felt like a half hour, she held the motionless Del and rubbed his belly, then hung him upside down to clear water from his mouth and breathed air past his teeth. Before long, he opened his eyes and started to move. The cold-blooded, golden-hued reptile lives in Dolezal's northeast Salem home with 21 other lizards, most rescued, some bought, along with one Russian tortoise and three dogs.

"By . David Mccormack . August is proving a very busy month for the family of former Utah Governor and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman, whose daughter Elizabeth tied the knot on Sunday and who is expected to give birth to her first child later this month. At eight and half months pregnant, 26-year-old Elizabeth looked positively glowing as she wed her boyfriend and the father of her unborn son, Eduardo Hernandez in Washington D.C. on Sunday evening. Elizabeth, the self-confessed ‘trouble maker’ in the Mormon family of seven children, certainly seemed to living up to that reputation with her non-traditional approach to starting a family. You may kiss the bride: Elizabeth Huntsman looked positively glowing as she wed her boyfriend and the father of her unborn son, Eduardo Hernandez, in Washington D.C. on Sunday evening . Not long to go: Libby Huntsman, who is expecting her first child later this month, poses on her wedding day with older sister Abby . Former Utah Governor and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman with his third eldest daughter Libby, far left . Older sister Abby, 28, who has been mentioned as a possible new anchor on The View, was happy to share several photos of the Huntsman clan’s big day on Instagram. Along with a photo of the happy couple kissing, the blushing bride was also pictured with flowers in her hair and her large baby bump fully on display. Other photos posted online over the last day or so showed the Huntsman clan happily posing together. The former ambassador to China and his wife Mary Kaye have seven children. Elizabeth (also known as Libby) has two older sisters, Mary Anne (Mame) and Abigail (Abby) plus two younger brothers Jon and William and two adopted sisters, Gracie who was born in China in 1999 and Asha who was born in India in 2006.

The Huntsman clan: Elizabeth, center, poses with her two older sisters, Mary Anne and Abigail plus her two younger brothers Jon and William and adopted sister Gracie, far left, who was born in China in 1999 . This is the family’s second wedding. Abby also married outside of the Mormon Church when she got wed her college sweetheart, Jeffrey Livington, in an Episcopal ceremony in 2010. Libby's wedding was originally supposed to be in March but got pushed back to this weekend. With the happy couple expecting a baby boy in August 28, it means the two big events have unusually fallen in the same calendar month. The weekend’s wedding comes two months after the couple’s baby shower. Back when Jon Huntsman was battling it out to become the Republican nominee for the 2012 Presidential Election, the three eldest daughters had joined their father on the campaign trail. In November 2011, the girls and their father sat down with Fox News host Sean Hannity for a cosy family interview in which they revealed that Elizabeth was the ‘trouble maker’ of the family. The family, including father Jon, third from left, pose for a family photo in Washington DC on Saturday . Abby Huntsman, left, a conservative anchor on MSNBC's The Cycle and possible new anchor on The View, poses in this July 4 snap along with pregnant sister Libby . The University of Pennsylvania student told the Fox host that she had aspirations to appear on Saturday Night Live - either in front of or behind the cameras. The budding comedian had then revealed how that she had embarrassed her father during one of the televised debates when she had tweeted that just because Mitt Romney had watched Panda Express didn’t mean he had foreign policy experience. Nowadays, Libby's Twitter handle describes her a 'self-proclaimed failed comedian who sometimes engages in the occasional political banter.' Her father's 2012 presidential run wasn't the first time she had embarrassed him. Her father revealed during the Fox interview that his troublesome daughter had even dated the son of his Democratic rival Scott Matheson when he was Utah Governor. ‘Why did I become a diplomat? It's the only way to get through this family. Are you kidding!’ he joked. In November 2011, Libby, left, and her two elder sisters, plus their father sat down with Fox News host Sean Hannity for a cosy family interview in which it was revealed that she was the 'trouble maker' in the family . ‘I think the fact that my dad is still alive, raising her is one reason he will be the best president of this country,’ said Abby, who is now a conservative anchor on MSNBC's The Cycle and is also currently in the running to join The View. Despite being a Republican, she appeared in a 2013 campaign in support of gay marriage and producers on the TV show are hopeful she could help increase its appeal with a younger demographic.","Elizabeth Huntsman, 26, the daughter of former Utah Governor and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Jon, got married on Sunday .

The daughter of former Republican presidential nominee John McCain is adamant she isn’t about to join daytime chat show The View and instead is too busy enjoying the new life she has made for herself in Los Angeles, including a new job and settling into a fabulous new apartment that she has just had decorated. Conservative pundit Meghan McCain, 29, impressed producers on the New York-based chat show that is currently down a couple of presenters after appearing as a guest co-host last month. However McCain, who only moved to L.A. in April after growing up in New York says she has no plans to move back east just yet. Particularly since McCain has landed herself a job as the cohost of Pivot's nightly show TakePart Live. ‘I . have the most utmost respect for everyone at The View. The show was . amazing for my career for a long time. But, right now, I really love my . job at TakePart Live,’ she told Refinery 29. Takepart . Live is a nightly, interactive news show aimed at millennials and . McCain says she much prefers it to working on the cable news channels. 'I don’t want to be part of making America more sided. It’s just not my personality; it’s not who I am and what I believe in,' she said. Another good reason to stay in L.A. for the time being is the amazing apartment which McCain has had specially decorated for her by a friend . 'I don’t want to think that just because you’re on the left you can’t find something in common with the right. Our country is still so divided in so many ways.' Despite initial fears that she might feel out of place as a Republican in L.A., McCain has no regrets about her move cross country. Another good reason to stay in L.A. for the time being is the amazing apartment which she has had specially decorated for her by a friend. ‘My best friend from high school is an interior designer, and I literally said, “I want my apartment to be a little Graceland and a little Scarface and a little Goldie Hawn in the ’70s, and you do whatever you want.""' McCain's best friend from high school is an interior designer and so she told her: 'I want my apartment to be a little Graceland and a little Scarface and a little Goldie Hawn in the '70s, and you do whatever you want' McCain says she absolutely loves it. 'I feel like I have a big-girl apartment now,’ she said. Since moving to L.A., McCain has also been appointed to GLAAD's national board of directors, a posting which she describes as an honor. ‘I’m . a straight Republican and to be a member of the board and to show my . people the fight for marriage equality and LGBT rights is universal and . it goes beyond politics,' she said. Politically, McCain describes herself as a ‘socially liberal Republican’ She defines that as someone who doesn't want to focus as much on social issues and what people do in their bedrooms and with their bodies. ‘I’m much more interested in what we’re doing fiscally as a country and national defense and how our government is run,' said the senator's daughter who has turned the blog she penned documenting her father’s 2008 presidential bid into a blossoming media career, which includes the campaign memoir Dirty Sexy Politics.

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated  Press Reporter . San Francisco’s out of control housing market passed an ominous new milestone last month when the median selling price for houses and condominiums hit seven figures for the first time. While a cool million can still fetch a sizable mansion on a few acres elsewhere in the U.S., in the souped-up world of San Francisco real estate it is now barely enough to cover the cost of an 800-square foot starter home that needs work and may or may not include private parking. Even San Francisco Association of Realtors President Betty Taisch, a veteran broker used to managing clients' expectations, has experienced first-hand the heartbreak and hair-pulling inherent to house-hunting in what she still considers one of the world's ‘most desirable, fabulous cities.’ Value for money? A cool million can still fetch a sizable mansion elsewhere, but in the souped-up world of San Francisco real estate it is now barely enough to cover the cost of an 800-square foot starter home that needs work . She put her professional skills to work this summer on behalf of her adult son and his family, who had outgrown their one-bedroom apartment. After three unsuccessful offers, they ended up paying $913,000 for a two-bedroom, one-bath house with an outdated kitchen, a yard that can charitably be called overgrown, and a big basement that Taisch counts as its most attractive feature. ‘It certainly is a milestone. It's like, “Wow!'”, she said of the city's new million-dollar median. ‘Everybody thinks San Francisco is all Pacific Heights Victorians, and it's not. There are many areas of the city that are just normal, single-family homes that are small and not posh at all.’ The technology industry's rapid growth coupled with 49-square-mile San Francisco's constrained supply of housing is a big part of the story behind the city's ascension to a rarified real estate bracket already occupied by New York City . The technology's industry's rapid growth coupled with 49-square-mile San Francisco's constrained supply of housing is a big part of the story behind the city's ascension to a rarified real estate bracket already occupied by New York City, but Silicon Valley wealth also is stoking the market in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, according to Andrew LePage, an analyst with CoreLogic DataQuick, a real estate research firm in Irvine, California. Between April and June, the Bay Area saw a record number of homes and condos going for $1 million and above, and they accounted for one-quarter of all sales in the region, CoreLogic DataQuick said in a report released on Thursday. During the same three-month period, six of the Bay Area's nine counties set records for the number of homes and condos selling for over $2 million, as did California as a whole, the report said. ‘The robust tech economy and the overall economy mean the Bay Area has been doing better than most for years now,’ LePage said. Located on a commercial street in San Francisco's Noe Valley neighborhood,  this home was listed for a little under $1.2 million, despite being in 'poor condition' ‘It already was expensive, and a lot of these high-end markets weren't hammered as hard during the downturn because they weren't exposed to subprime mortgages, so they had less ground to recover in the first place.’ George Limperis, an agent with Paragon Real Estate Group in San Francisco, agrees that freshly minted technology millionaires who can afford to bid up a property until they win it with an all-cash offer are helping to drive up demand. But unlike during the city's first tech boom in the late 1990s, the buyers prepared to lay down more than $1 million on a fixer-upper in a neighborhood within walking distance of shops and restaurants also include Asian investors and retirees from other major cities who already are accustomed to skyscraper prices for shoebox dwellings, Limperis said. ‘It feels like a very different city than it certainly did even 15 years ago. There is money coming from so many places now,’ he said. ‘So many of these buyers today, they have lived in London, they have lived in Hong Kong, they have lived in New York, and to them these prices are parallel. We can't compare San Francisco with median housing prices even elsewhere in California because this is an international level we are dealing with.’ Limperis this month represented the sellers of a 1,200-square-foot, two-bedroom home ‘in poor condition’ that had been in their family for generations. San Francisco Association of Realtors President Betty Taisch has experienced first-hand the heartbreak and hair-pulling inherent to house-hunting in what she still considers one of the world's 'most desirable, fabulous cities' Located on a commercial street in San Francisco's Noe Valley neighborhood, an area prized for its modest Victorians, the home was listed for a little under $1.2 million. By the end of its first week on the market, 10 people had submitted all-cash offers. The house sold for $1.8 million to a developer who plans to convert it into condos. ‘Everyone is aghast at what these things sell for, but as long as the economy keeps going it like it does, these numbers do make sense,’ Limperis said. Being prepared to go well over a home's asking price and willing to sacrifice style or a second bathroom are some of the pointers that Kelly Kang, a colleague of Limperis' at Paragon, gives to buyers. Kang just represented a young couple with a child who were interested in a 756-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath row house built in 1950 in a newly hot neighborhood near a park and public transit that was listed at a little more than $1 million after having sold for $710,000 five years ago. The couple offered $1.2 million and wrote a ‘love letter’ about the house explaining why it was just right for their family. They got the house. ‘People that want to stay in San Francisco really love the city, so what they are buying is the city more than the property,’ Kang said.","City's housing .

Gloria Baca-Lucero, right, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, was arrested on Monday and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon following the altercation at her home with cable guy Clifton Ratliff, left . Before getting started, he informed her that there would be a fee. Baca-Lucero said she thought the work would be free and refused to sign for the charges. Upset, she then called customer services who confirmed the fee. Baca-Lucero still refused to pay and so Ratliff started putting his tools away, reports the Albuquerque Journal. He told cops that his customers then grabbed one of his tool bags and took it into her home. When he went to get it back, she pulled out a black handgun and pointed it at his torso, the complaint states. Ratliff says he then called 911 and left because he 'didn't want to get shot.' The argument started after Baca-Lucero was informed that she would have to pay additional fees to receive Comcast services . When police arrived, they searched Baca-Lucero's home and found a black Glock, along with a Glock magazine and 11 rounds. They also found the tool bag - with a value of $400 - according to the court document. Baca-Lucero was arrested and charged on Monday, but released later the same day. She confirmed to officers that she told Ratliff that he couldn’t have his tools, but claimed to have told him that his supervisor would need to come pick them up.","Gloria Baca-Lucero, 48, of Albuquerque was arrested on Monday following the altercation at her home .

Frank, 41, and Yvonne Pivonka, 40, were returning from a concert in the early hours of Sunday morning when their SUV overturned near West Point. Investigators say the driver lost control, causing the vehicle to crash into a ditch and roll several times. Frank and Yvonne Pivonka were returning from a concert in the early hours of Sunday night when their SUV overturned near West Point, Omaha . According to the sheriff’s department, both victims were thrown from the vehicle and pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities have not said who was driving, but a local man found a dead deer on the highway and it is believed the couple may have swerved to avoid hitting it, reports Omaha.com. Police used the Pivonka’s cellphones to locate their whereabouts and their bodies were discovered at 5:20 a.m. on Monday. The couple were big music fans and regularly traveled to listen to friend's bands. Seven children, ranging in age from 20 to just three years old, have been left orphaned after the tragic car accident in Omaha at the weekend . On Saturday they had paid a visit to the Roadhouse Lounge in West Point, to see a local cover band called John Doe. Frank Pivonka also sang lead vocals for local cover bands The Grind, Sidecar 69, DoubleZero and Headspace. ‘They were just great people, great supporters of the music scene,' said Jason McClain, John Doe’s drummer. 'When they came out to see us Saturday, they were just so happy.' Wife Yvonne would join her husband's bands at practice when she wasn’t busy taking the couple’s seven kids to and from school. The Pivonkas’ two oldest daughters, 19-year-old Sabrina and 20-year-old Angel, had already left home, but son Frankie, 17, together with Abigail, 3, Sophia, 7, Isabelle, 13, and Jasmine, 15, will now live with Yvonne’s sister Cathy Cattlett. Police used the Pivonka's cellphones to locate their whereabouts and the bodies were discovered at 5:20 a.m. on Monday near West Point, Omaha . Frank and Yvonne Pivonka had started dating when they were in high school, although they went to different schools . 'They were all about their kids, they loved their kids,' she told WOWT. Cattlett already has a husband and two sons of her own. As well as being a jobbing musician, Frank Pivonka also worked as a mechanic. 'He was a good father - he loved his children,' Brenda Lessner, one of his sisters told Omaha.com. 'He wanted everything for them, no matter how hard they struggled; he did everything for them.' The couple had started dating when they were in high school, although they went to different schools. The family is currently trying to find a venue large enough to support the 500 to 600 people who want to attend the funeral. A Gofundme page had already raised more than $14,000 and the site says the goal is to raise $40,000. Fundraising concerts are also planned for this weekend.

"By . David Mccormack . Photo of Abraham Lincoln taken February 27, 1860 in New York City by Mathew Brady, the day of his famous Cooper Union speech . A previously unpublished letter written by Abraham Lincoln reveals the future president as a ‘nervous’ man not entirely comfortable with his then growing reputation rather than as the iconic American leader that he later became. The letter, dated March 6, 1860, was written soon after a historic turning point in Lincoln’s life as it was sent just a month after his famous Cooper Union address. The historic speech given on February 27, 1860, at Cooper Union, in New York City is a key moment that helped catapult Lincoln to the national stage and eventually to becoming the 16th president of the United States. Yet just a month later, the letter which is postmarked Hartford, Conn., shows Lincoln suffering from doubts and keen to return home to see his family. In the letter Lincoln declines an invitation to speak, saying that he feels ‘unfit’ to fulfill the obligations and wants to return home. ‘Yours of the 2nd was received late last evening,’ Lincoln writes. ‘I cannot speak in New Jersey this time. I have over staid my time - have heard something about sickness in my family - and really am nervous and unfit to fill my engagement already made here in Connecticut. Will you please excuse me?’ The letter which postmarked Hartford, Conn., finds Lincoln suffering from doubts and keen to return home to his family . Just four days prior to Lincoln’s letter, J.A. Freeman, secretary of the Republican Executive Committee of Orange, N.J., had written to Lincoln, saying his organization ‘most earnestly and cordially’ requested him to address the Republicans of Orange at his earliest convenience. ‘You have many warm political friends in this place who are very anxious to hear you, and as New Jersey is one of the doubtful states, we wish all the help that we can get from the eminent speakers of the Republican Party,’ Freeman wrote. ‘If you can comply with our request, please let me know upon what evening we may have the pleasure of hearing you, and where in New York you may be found so that some friends can meet and bring you out here.’ Until recently the letter had been in possession of descendants of the Freeman family. It is now up for sale by The Raab Collection, a Philadelphia-based dealer of historical documents, which has valued it as $40,000. Lincoln scholar, Harold Holzer, once called the Cooper Union address 'Lincoln's watershed, the event that transformed him from a regional leader into a national phenomenon' Until recently the letter, including the original envelope, had been in possession of descendants of the Freeman family . ‘It also allows us to see Lincoln at his moment of transition from local politician to national figure and to better understand his own story as a person, not a politician,’ Raab told FoxNews.com. Lincoln scholar, Harold Holzer, once called the Cooper Union address ‘Lincoln’s watershed, the event that transformed him from a regional leader into a national phenomenon. Here the politician known as frontier debater and chronic jokester introduced a new oratorical style: informed by history, suffused with moral certainty, and marked by lawyerly precision.’","The letter, dated March 6, 1860, was .

"By . Richard Shears In Bali for MailOnline . Spread out in the sun at Bali police headquarters is the gory evidence being studied by forensic officers investigating the shocking 'body in the suitcase' murder. And as police scientists sift through the bloodied sheets, pillows and other items of clothing stained with dark red blotches, The MailOnline has been able to confirm exclusively that 19-year-old Heather Mack's claims that she is pregnant are true. A report from the prison hospital in the Bali capital, Denpasar, has revealed that the young woman who will soon be officially charged with the murder of her mother, 62-year-old US socialite Sheila Mack, is expecting a child. Scroll down for video . Laid out in the sun at Bali Police Headquarters are pieces of evidence in the Bali suitcase murder - the taxi, the suitcase, bloodied sheets and pillows and other items from the room at the St Regis Hotel . Heather Mack, 19, and boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, (left) will  face death by firing squad if found guilty of murdering Heather's mother, Chicago socialite Sheila von Weise Mack (pictured with her daughter, right) As she and her 21-year-old boyfriend sit behind bars today eating local food, forensic officers, wearing white gloves, shifted through items collected from the initial crime scene at the plush St Regis Hotel, located beside the beach at Nusa Dua, some 10 miles away. With the sun beating down on the police yard, the scene was surreal, with the taxi into which the suitcase containing the body of Mrs Mack was loaded, parked there with two bloodied pillows lying on its roof. On the ground behind it was the silver coloured suitcase, it’s 'priority luggage' label stained with blood, in which the body had somehow been crammed. Items of clothing were spread out on the ground and many appeared to be stained with blood. Policeman from Nusa Dua on the Indonesian resort island of Bali, look through the suitcase where the body of Sheila von Weise Mack was found stuffed inside . A stone ornament was aslo found in the suitcase, but whether this was used as a murder weapon to batter Mrs Mack remains unclear, as a police  said earlier that a glass ashtray and a vase had been used to kill her . There was also what appeared to be a stone ornament, but whether this was used as a murder weapon to batter Mrs Mack remained unclear today, as a police source had said earlier that a glass ashtray and a vase had been used to kill the woman who was well known in social circles in the US, having once worked with Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Also on morbid display were what appeared to be two pairs of jeans and an unidentifiable yellow and red cloth item which appears to be the same item that Tommy Schaeffer is seen wearing in a still from a CCTV camera focused on the hotel lobby either before or after the murder. The grim task for forensic officers was being carried out today as Indonesians began celebrating tomorrow's (Sun) Independence celebrations. Ms Mack had claimed to police that she was pregnant and that it was ectopic, so she needed to be released to return to the US for specialist care. Shattered: Heather Mack, left, and boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, center, are seen in new CCTV footage on the holiday islandof Bali. Police have told MailOnline that Heather's mother was beaten so badly with an ashtray and vase that they smashed . Both Heather Mack (left) and Tommy Schaefer have been charged with the murder of Sheila von Wiese Mack. The 19-year-old American's claims that she is pregnant have been proven true by hospital tests . Police at headquarters arranged for her story to be checked out and she was taken to the nearby prison hospital for tests. Daily Mail Australia was told by an investigating officer today that a medical report confirmed that the young woman was indeed pregnant - but it is highly unlikely her request to be returned to the US will be granted. Senior officers said that like any other person charged with a crime in Bali they would be subjected to Indonesian law, penalties for serious offences being treated severely. Horror: . The blood-stained suitcase where the body of Mrs von Wiese-Mack was . found. It was left in a cab when Mack and Schaefer checked out of the . hotel, but they failed to return and the driver went to police . With little chance of receiving bail, Ms Mack (pictured) faces the prospect of giving birth behind bars in a prison hospital - and then facing many years in jail if convicted . With little chance of receiving bail, Ms Mack now faces the prospect of giving birth to her baby behind bars in a prison hospital - and then facing many years in jail, if not sentenced to death by firing squad, should she be convicted. Her baby will either spend its early years with her in prison if she is convicted, or be cared for by willing families, but one thing is certain - the baby will have no grandmother. It has not been revealed what arrangements have been made for the return of Mrs Mack's body to the US, but it is believed US officials are working with Indonesian authorities to have the body released as soon as possible. Police say Ms Mack, seen here surrounded by friends, used her mother's credit card to throw a party .","Key evidence from the Bali suitcase murder of Chicago socialite Sheila von Weise Mack, has been layed out in the sun at Bali Police Headquarters .

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated  Press Reporter . Mayflies have started to emerge from the Mississippi River in swarms so large that they show up on radar like thunderstorms. The insects emerge in large numbers to . mate, lay eggs and die, all in less than 48 hours. They leave behind a slimy mess which has been blamed for at least one car crash this week in Wisconsin. The National Weather Service captured a . massive swarm on radar on Sunday night as the flies came out of the . river and drifted north on the wind. The radar system picks up energy . reflected off the flies, with the image's intensity reflecting the . density of the bugs. A loop . recorded on Sunday shows yellow patches directly over the river that . morph into a green band as the flies drift north. The bugs become blue . dots as they disperse. A second, smaller swarm recorded on Thursday night starts as a green band before exploding like fireworks into blue dots. The flies hatch and then spend a year . burrowed into the sediment on the bottom of the river that serves as a . border between Wisconsin and Minnesota. They emerge the next summer to . mate, lay eggs and die, all in less than 48 hours. The mayflies emerge in large numbers to mate, lay eggs and die, all in less than 48 hours. They leave behind a slimy mess which has been blamed for at least one car crash this week in Wisconsin . 'Almost every night in the summer, there's some sense on the radar that there's something coming off the river,' said Dan Baumgardt, science and operations officer for the National Weather Service in La Crosse. 'We don't know what kind of bug it is ... until we have people calling or saying, ""Oh my gosh, there's mayflies all in the La Crosse area.""' The weather service typically records several swarms each year from June through August. Air and water temperatures have been usually cool this year, helping explain why Sunday's emergence was the first big one this summer, said Mark Steingraeber, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist. Attracted by light, mayflies congregate on roads, bridges and other surfaces in piles that can be nearly two feet high. Cars crush the flies, releasing liquid in the females' eggs and making roads slick. Two people were injured on Sunday in . Trenton Township in western Wisconsin when a car slid on a road covered . by flies, crashed into a second car and then struck a van. A massive swarm of mayflies is captured on radar as they emerge from the Mississippi River and drift north with the wind in this July 20 photo provided by the National Weather Service in LaCrosse, Wis. Flies that aren't crushed spend 24 hours shedding exoskeletons in a final stage of development before taking to the air again to mate. The females then seek water to lay their eggs. 'If they happen to come across a cup of beer, they will deposit them in a cup of beer,' said Steingraeber, who needs volunteers to help track the flies' appearance for his research. Adult flies die after laying their eggs. Within hours, their offspring hatch in the river, and the cycle begins again. The inserts are sensitive to oxygen levels . and pollutants in the river and serve as 'sentinels' for scientists and . others concerned about water quality, said Steingraeber. Mayflies disappeared from a 70-mile . area south of the Twin Cities in the 1920s and didn't reappear in . significant numbers again until 1978, when wastewater treatment and . others actions taken under the Clean Water Act began to have an impact.","Mayflies are emerging from the Mississippi River in swarms so large that they show up on radar like thunderstorms .

"By . Aap . A woman who was doused in petrol and set alight has screamed and cried outside a Sydney court after her attacker was sentenced to at least three years in jail for the 'ghastly' crime. The then 32-year-old woman, who only wants to be known as Miss K, was walking to work in Chippendale on the morning of March 22, 2012, when she was grabbed and forced to the ground. As she lay there, her assailant, a 17-year-old boy, poured a milk carton full of accelerant over her. The woman, who only wants to be known as Miss K, was walking to work in Chippendale (pictured) on the morning of March 22, 2012, when she was grabbed and forced to the ground by the 17-year-old assailant . Panic-stricken, she got up and ran, but the teen came up behind her and set her alight. She was engulfed in flames and suffered third-degree burns to 45 per cent of her body, on her face, neck, chest, arms and legs. In sentencing the teen, who can only be referred to as MF for legal reasons, Judge Andrew Haesler said what had happened to Miss K was a tragedy. 'She will continue to suffer physically and and mentally for the rest of her life,' he told the District Court on Monday. The court heard MF later told police his cousin, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had threatened violence against his mother and sister if he did not carry out the attack. While Judge Haesler accepted that MF acted under duress, he said the teenager could have sought police help or risked retribution rather than commit a crime that carried the 'absolute certainty' of causing Miss K gross harm. The boy then doused the woman in petrol and set alight to her in the 'ghastly' attack (file picture) Were it not for the element of duress, his assistance in the case against his cousin and his early guilty plea, Judge Haesler said he would have sentenced the teenager to 11 years. But due to the special circumstances he sentenced him to a minimum of three years and a maximum of six, setting his earliest date of release as August 2017. MF's mother cried and hugged her son as he was taken into custody. Outside court, Miss K screamed and cried after the sentence was handed down.","Woman, known only as Miss K was doused in petrol and set alight in .

"By . Candace Sutton For Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . It started off with an ashtray on a paper-filled desk and ended up with 11 members of one man's family perishing in the nation's worst house fire. A coronial inquest into the fierce blaze which tore through the Taufa family home at Slacks Creek, 25km south of Brisbane on August 24, 2011, began on Monday with evidence from one of the tragic survivors. Tau Taufa lost his wife, daughter and three grandchildren, and his wife's sister and her five children; the victims ranged in age from three to 57 years. Scroll down for video . Tragic loss: Tau Taufa, pictured with his daughter, Treicee Taufa, outside the Brisbane court where Mr Taufa has been giving evidence to a coroner's inquiry into the death of 11 members of their family. Mr Taufa lost his wife, a daughter, his wife's sister and her five children and his three grandchildren, including Ms Taufa's 16-year-old daughter Ardelle, who was staying in the house as her mother worked . Fierce blaze: The fire which engulfed the Taufa family home at Slacks Creek, 25km south of Brisbane in August, 2011, was well alight when police and firefighters arrived after midnight. It tore quickly through the home, claiming the lives of 11 family members aged between three and 57 years old . No chance: The three adults and eight children who perished in the terrible house fire which burned through the Slacks Creek home of the Taufa family took the lives of teenagers and children (pictured, in a backdrop to the mass funeral held in September, 2011), the youngest aged just three . Mr Taufa, 65, his brother-in-law, Jeremiah Lale, 36, and son-in-law, Misi Matauaina, 26, were the only three of the 14 people staying the night in the house to walk out alive. The flames were so intense it took several weeks to identify the dead. They were Mr Taufa's wife, Fusi, 57, his daughter and Mr Matauaina's wife, Annamaria, 23, and their children, Kahlani, three, and La'Haina Matauaina, seven, Fusi's sister and the wife of Jeremiah Lale, Neti-Teukisia Lale, her children, Jerry, 18, Paul, 17, and Richie, eight, and daughters Lafoa'i, 14, and Sela, 10, and another of Mr Taufa's granddaughters, Ardelle Lee, 16, who was staying the night. Devastated: Tau Taufa, 68, is surrounded by family members outside the Brisbane Court where an inquest has begun into the house fire - considered Australia's worst - which killed 11 members of his family. Spokesman, Louise Naumovski, speaks on behalf of the family to media . Too late: when police and fire officers arrived at the scene just after midnight the house on Wagensveldt Street in Slacks Creek, south of Brisbane, was well alight. By the time officers had the laze under control, 11 members of the Taufa family wer edead. Forensic police are pictured entering the crime scene to find the bodies and evidence . Lost forever: Annamaria Taufa, Tau Taufa's daughter, and her two daughters, Lahaina, 7, and Kalahnie, 3, all of whom died in the blaze which ripped through the family home in August, 2011 . Mourners at the scene of the tragic house fire in which 11 members of the Taufa family perished in August, 2011 . The inquest heard there was nothing to suggest the fire was suspicious, but the speed with which it took hold was a major factor in the high number of deaths. In his evidence to the Brisbane Coroner's Court yesterday, Mr Taufa said a fire alarm had been turned off at his home many years earlier because it was too noisy. Mr Taufa estimated that the property's smoke alarm in the ceiling of a hallway had gone off in the 1990s, but was then deactivated 'to get rid of the noise'. Ardelle Taufa, 16, (pictured, above, left and right) had the misfortune to be visiting the Taufa family home when the blaze ripped through the house. Her mother had been out working. Tau Taufa lost most of his family including his wife, Fusi, with whom he is pictured wearing Tongan flower leis from their homeland . Mr Taufa told the inquest that his family's sleeping arrangements at their home had changed when a second family, the Lales, moved in to the suburban home in the month before the fire, making a house of 14. The inquest is examining the cause of the tragedy, and at the same time considering whether all properties up for sale should have smoke alarms fitted. Counsel assisting the coroner, Simon Hamlyn-Harris, asked Mr Taufa if he could remember anyone turning the device back on. 'Not at all sir, I don't remember that anybody (turned it on again),' Mr Taufa said. He was unsure who had deactivated it, saying 'even I don't remember who (was) the person that turned it off.' Detective Sergeant Michael Egart told the inquest how when police had arrived at the home at 12:10am, six minutes after the first triple zero call, it was well alight. He said there was no hope of rescuing anyone at that stage because the flames had taken hold of the building; it was believed the fire started in the downstairs part of the house. 'It was utilised as an office by Mr Taufa,' Sergeant Egart said. 'It was quite congested with paperwork. It had various items of furniture as well.' Mr Taufa told the inquest he was working in his study on the night the fire erupted and that his desk had been covered in papers, by a desk lamp and glass ashtray. Mr Taufa recalled having a cigarette earlier in the nigh, and that his daughter, Annamaria had come downstairs and kissed him goodnight. 'She said ""Dad, I'm going to bed"", and I said ""ok, see you tomorrow"".' Mr Taufa would nt see his daughter alive again. Mr Taufa said his wife was sleeping in the lounge room with two of his grandchildren when he went upstairs to have a bath. He told the court he smelt smoke and noticed a ""mist"" seeping through the kitchen floorboards. He raced downstairs and grabbed a garden hose and saw a red glow coming from his study. 'I'm thinking of killing the fire, stopping the fire,' he said. Frantically calling out to his family, Mr Taufa two other members of the household were crying and calling out as the flames took hold. The inquest, before Coroner James McDougall, continues.","A house fire south of Brisbane in 2011 killed eleven members of a Tongan family .

"By . Harriet Arkell . If you need the loo, you'll have to go in the dunes, and if you want a shower you'll have to walk to the communal shower block, but that doesn't stop this modest timber shed being Britain's most expensive beach hut. With an asking price of £270,000, Hut 433 costs £5 more than a four-bedroomed detached house in the market town of Spalding, Lincolnshire, and the same as a six-bedroom house in Handsworth, Birmingham. And you can only get to it by boat or on a novelty 'Noddy' train, followed by a half-mile hike across the dunes.  But the estate agents selling the modest hut on Mudeford Spit, near Christchurch in Dorset, are not anticipating problems finding a buyer. Scroll down for video . Hut 433 is for sale for £270,000 - more than a four-bedroom house in the Lincolnshire market town of Holbeach - but the agents say its views are 'second to none' Nice spot: The beach hut on Mudeford Spit near Christchurch, Dorset, boasts views across to the Needles and the Isle of Wight, and is just a short stroll to the water . Cosy: The hut can sleep ten (at a squash) with a first floor mezzanine,  two sofa beds and a pull-out double bed, and it has a small kitchen area and fridge freezer . David Bird, from Austin and Wyatt, said: 'The location is second to none and there are beautiful views to the Needles and Isle of Wight. 'To my knowledge this is the most expensive beach hut in the area, but the reason is because of its position, as well as its high-standard interior and stunnings views. 'The owners have completely renovated it and everything was made by carpenters so the furniture is almost bespoke.  You can live in the huts for seven months of the year, and there's a really nice community down here.' The timber-built, 18ft by 12ft hut can sleep up to ten people, with four on a mezzanine deck, four on two sofa beds and two more on a pull-out bed.  It has hot water for the kitchen and electricity is powered by solar panels on the roof, and a cooker and small fridge run off a camping gas bottle. On a £ per square foot basis, the asking price equates to £1,250/sq ft - equivalent to homes in London's Chelsea.  And in addition to the asking price, the new buyer will have to pay £4,000 ground rent to Christchurch Borough Council, and a £15,000 transfer fee. Mr Bird said the hut was being sold by a family of five who are selling to buy another hut to do up with a different view on the sandy peninsula. The record price paid for a beach hut at Mudeford is £170,000, and one recently went on the market for £225,000. Cam McGregor, whose family is selling the hut, relaxes in the mezzanine area in the beach hut's roof space - his parents plan to buy another hut in the same spot . The yellow-painted, timber-built hut lies amongst beautiful dunes on a sandy peninsula near Christchurch, Dorset, but you'll have to walk to find a loo . Room to relax: Cam McGregor, whose parents own the hut, illustrates the space inside the Tardis-like building on the Mudeford Spit in Dorset . The current owners have done a complete redecoration, which the estate agents say has contributed to its high price - believed to be the highest for a hut in the area . There's no loo or bathroom but there is hot and cold running water in the kitchen, and a fridge powered by a camping gas bottle... plus the breathtaking view . The owners' son demonstrates how much room there is once the sofa beds have been tucked away - ten people can fit in the hut, apparently, but it'll be a squeeze .

"By . Aap . Melbourne could be a contender to host another Olympic Games with Victorian Premier Denis Napthine admitting the city 'ticks many of the boxes'. But he says a lot of work is required before deciding on a formal bid. The Committee for Melbourne has called for the city to bid for the 2028 Games, but Dr Napthine is less sold on the idea. Victorian Premier Denis Napthine says Melbourne had the right facilities in place to host another Olympic Games . Melbourne has hosted the Olympic Games before in 1956, with Ron Clarke lighting the torch at the opening ceremony (pictured) 'We are a sporting city. We've got fantastic facilities. We are well-placed to deliver a major sporting event like the Olympic Games,' he told reporters on Thursday. But Dr Napthine said any bid would need the support of state and federal governments. 'We tick many of the boxes, but you'd certainly need to do a lot of work before you went into a formal bidding process,' he said. Dr Napthine said it would be expensive to bid for the Games so work would have to be done to see if there was a genuine prospect of success. The last time an Australian city hosted a games was Sydney in 2000 . Dr Napthine says Melbourne ticked 'many of the right boxes' with sporting facilities, such as the MCG . 'We would want to make sure that there is broad support across the world community and the Olympic community before you went and spent large amounts of money,' he said. Dr Napthine said Melbourne already had most of the infrastructure in place, but given it had already hosted the Games in 1956, as did Sydney in 2000, other cities could be ahead of it in the queue. The next Olympic Games will be held in Brazil's Rio de Janiero in 2016, following its hosting of the FIFA World Cup earlier this year in July. But Dr Napthine says if Melbourne wanted to make a bid, a lot of work still had to be done .","Victorian Premier says the infrastructure is in place for city to host games .

Liam was one of about 70 guests celebrating the 18th birthday of his friend Harry Staples in Forestville in Sydney's north in January last year when things went horribly wrong. The then 16-year-old known as DS gatecrashed the party with four other young men only to be told they were not on the guest list, and unwelcome. Scroll down for video . Extreme harm: Liam Knight, pictured leaving Downing Centre Court following the sentencing of his attacker, suffered an 'extreme' degree of harm in the 'catastrophic' steel pole assault in January last year, said Judge Ronald Solomon, which left Knight with permanent injuries and his future life 'in tatters' Plans shattered: Liam Knight, pictured leavibng the Downing Centre Court on Friday afternoon, told the court last month in a pre-sentencing hearing that the metal pole attack by the teenager known as DS, 'changed my whole life. For the simple fact that he could not get into a party, my life as it was before the injury is gone. I nearly lost my life numerous times that night. The future I had planned has gone . DS then scaled a high fence at the home and climbed onto the roof of a shed, shouting to his mates, 'come on, we can come through this way'. Harry Staples' father, Phillip Staples, shone a torch on DS and said: 'Mate, you're not invited, you have to leave.' Angry and intoxicated, pushed Mr Staples in the chest, and punched one of the party guests in the face. Then he began throwing building materials at partygoers. One of four steel three-metre rebars that he threw into the crowd pierced Liam's skull and lodged in his head. Paramedics arrived on the scene and sedated Knight, but had to wait for firefighters to cut the large piece of steel protruding from his head, before they took the young man to hospital. In Royal North Shore Hospital, Knight underwent a five hour emergency bilateral craniectomy. Pole assault victim Liam Knight (pictured, right, alighting from the vehicle) arrives at the Downing Centre Court on Friday for the sentencing of the teenager who threw a steel rod at his head, permanently injuring Knight who said his life has been ruined by the attack .
