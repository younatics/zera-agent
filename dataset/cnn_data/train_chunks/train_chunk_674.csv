Hard-left union leader Len McCluskey has praised Ed Miliband as Labour’s best leader since Michael Foot. The Unite chief used a speech to hail him as the most radical leader since 1983, the year of Labour’s ‘longest suicide note in history’ manifesto and worst election result since the War. And he gloated over the fact that under Mr Miliband, New Labour and the centre-left policies pioneered by triple election-winning Tony Blair had been abandoned. Comparison: Unite boss Len McCluskey praised Ed Miliband (left) as Labour’s best leader since Michael Foot . Omen: Mr Foot was responsible for Labour’s ‘longest suicide note in history’ manifesto and worst election result since the War . The trenchant speech will raise fears over Mr McCluskey’s influence over the Labour leader, dubbed Red Ed by critics. Unite is one of the largest trade unions, and the unions are responsible for three quarters of Labour’s funding. Mr McCluskey gave the lecture in memory of Jimmy Reid, a left-wing activist who led a group of dockers who took over shipyards on the Clyde in 1971. He praised Ed Miliband’s speech to last month’s Labour conference, when he promised 1970s-style price controls for energy bills and suggested developers who refuse to build on their land should see it confiscated by the state. ‘We should ask if the glass is filling up or draining way,’ he said. ‘Put like that, the answer cannot really be in doubt. ‘Ed Miliband’s speech to the Labour conference was – some would say – the most genuinely radical we have heard from a Labour leader for nigh on 30 years.’ Thirty years ago, Michael Foot led his party to a historic defeat, losing three million votes since the 1979 election. His successor, Neil Kinnock, started the slow process of moving Labour towards the centre ground and making it more electable. Attack: Len McCluskey hailed the death of New Labour in his speech . Mr McCluskey went on: ‘To say that the next Labour government will not let the energy monopolies carry on ripping us off, to say that the property speculators will no longer be able to stop our kids getting a decent roof over their heads, and to tell the biggest companies that they are going to have to pay more tax – that is not just a break with the Coalition’s policies, it also represents Labour turning its back on the neo-liberal dogmas which dominated the Blair-Brown years. ‘So I unequivocally welcome Ed’s speech. Allied to his brave stance over Syria – a stance which flew in the face of the unsolicited advice of Tony Blair and which I believe has saved lived by stopping a global rush to war – there is no doubt that this is no longer “New Labour” as we knew it.’ Mr McCluskey said, however, that the ‘critical question’ – more important than any social policies Labour might introduce – was what the party was planning to do about ‘trade union freedom’. ‘I do not say that just because I’m a trade union leader, but because I believe that social progress is maybe 25 per cent the work of government, and 75 per cent the job of working-class self-organisation,’ he said. Pressure: Mr Miliband, pictured today in Gateshead, Newcastle, was accused of demoting New Labour figures in this week's reshuffle . The Unite general secretary said calls to break the link between Labour and the unions was a ‘right-wing agenda’, saying: ‘That’s what lies behind the incessant attacks on our political work by the Tories and the media, and the unfortunate echo those attacks sometimes find within the Labour party itself.’ In a menacing section of his speech, he suggested that the working classes should ‘take over’ society. He said: ‘Jimmy Reid believed that a better society could be achieved if people were willing to fight for it. It is a belief I have always shared. ‘Jimmy said – at the time of the UCS work-in – “We are taking over the yards because we refuse to accept that faceless men can make these decisions”. ‘Substitute the word “society” for “the yards” and we have an outlook as relevant today as it was then.’ Last night a Tory source said: ‘The union barons have given 75 per cent of Labour’s cash under Ed Miliband. ‘They oppose cutting the deficit, they oppose fixing the welfare system and they oppose every difficult decision we’ve taken to fix our economy. With the union barons in charge, Labour haven’t changed. It’s the same old Labour.’","Unite leader used a speech to hail Miliband as best leader for 30 years .

A Vanderbilt University fraternity has been suspended after a brother sent an email which made light of the school's current rape case. The email was sent to prospective new members of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity on September 22, announcing upcoming events. One of the events included a Monday Night Football viewing at the house. The Alpha Tau Omega fraternity at Vanderbilt University has been suspended following an insensitive email sent to prospective new members one of the brothers . Insensitive: The email invited new members to a football game viewing party which they promised would be a 'rape free' event - referencing the current rape case involving four former members of the school's football team . 'We have refreshments and stadium seating. This will be a rape-free event...I promise. Football is safe again,' the email said. The author of the email was referencing the current rape case involving four former members of the Vanderbilt football team. Ex-players Brandon Vandenburg, Cory Batey, Brandon Banks and Jaborian McKenzie have each been charged with five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery for allegedly raping a student in her dormitory last June. Tight end Brandon Vandenburg, 20 (left),and safety Cory Batey, 19 (right), are among the four Vanderbilt football players charged with rape . Brandon Banks, 19 (left), and Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, 19 (right), are also charged in the crime . Vandenburg was also charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography. On October 3, the school formally suspended the ATO fraternity while they investigate the incident. All fraternity events have been cancelled, including recruiting events. Scene of the crime: The victim was allegedly raped in Brandon Vandenburg's room at Gillette House, above, with the three other players present. The incident was also recorded on Vandenburg's camera phone. Following the fraternity's suspension, the university issues a statement condemning the email. 'It conveys a message that is reprehensible in its disrespect for women and is not representative of the Vanderbilt University student body or the values that we uphold as a community,' wrote Beth Fortune, Vanderbilt's vice chancellor for public affairs. The fraternity is also facing punishment from their national office. ATO's CEO Wynn Smiley deemed the email 'abohorrent' and said that they too have put the chapter on suspension while they conduct their own investigation. Despite apologizing, the member who sent the email has since been expelled from the fraternity.","The Alpha Tau Omega fraternity at Vanderbilt University has been suspended following an insensitive email making fun of rape .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:24 EST, 11 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:25 EST, 11 October 2013 . Controversy: Archbishop Jozef Michalik has apologised for his comments appearing to blame divorce for paedophilia . The top Catholic bishop in Poland has apologised for blaming divorce for encouraging paedophilia in comments that the church have described as 'a slip of the tongue'. Archbishop Jozef Michalik sparked outrage when he said earlier this week that sex abuse was the result of people 'looking for love', and appeared to suggest that divorce could be just as harmful to children as paedophilia. But he has since apologised for the anger caused by his comments and claimed that they were taken out of context. After his comments sparked fury among Polish social media users, the episcopate called a press conference in a bid to try and calm the situation. His spokesman said that his comments had been a 'pure slip of the tongue'. Archbishop Michalik added: 'The context of my comment was as follows: ""A child is always innocent. But it can be hurt not only by priests but also by its own environment"".' His initial comments came as Poland's Catholic church faces mounting allegations of priests sexually abusing children. 'Many of these cases of molestation could be avoided given a healthy relationship between parents,' Archbishop Michalik had told the PAP news agency. 'We often hear that this inappropriate attitude [i.e. paedophilia], or abuse, manifests itself when a child is looking for love. 'It clings, it searches. It gets lost itself and then draws another person into this.' While condemning paedophile priests 'whom neither the Church nor anyone else can accept,' the cleric also spoke out against divorce as being harmful to children. 'How many wounds are their in children's hearts, in children's lives, when their parents go their separate ways,' he said. 'Today nobody talks about divorce doing great harm to a child. It's obvious that sex abuse does great harm, one can't forget about it, but it's not the only thing.' In an unprecedented move, Polish church leaders apologised earlier this month for the actions of alleged paedophile priests, as prosecutors began probes against two high-profile suspects. Archbishop Jozef Wesolowski, a . 65-year-old Pole who served as a papal envoy in the Dominican Republic . for five years, is being investigated for allegedly having sex with . teenage boys. While condemning paedophile priests 'whom neither the Church nor anyone else can accept,' the cleric also spoke out against divorce as being harmful to children . Authorities in the Caribbean country are also investigating Wojciech Gil, a 36-year-old priest suspected of raping several young boys while serving there. Gil told Polish media last week the allegations were fabricated, claiming that Dominican drug gangs were trying to frame him. Despite the apology, Church leaders in Poland insist they will not be offering victims any material compensation. Unlike in countries such as the U.S. and Ireland, child sex abuse by priests in Poland has been a largely taboo subject and has so far not provoked widespread public outcry.","Archbishop Jozef Michalik said his comments were taken out of context .

The National Cockroach Project has shown that New York cockroaches can tell each other apart by where they were born and prefer to stick with other insects from their neighbourhood . They're traditional New Yorkers in that they prefer to stick to their own . neighborhoods and have strong family ties, but any semblance to those whose homes they inhabit stop there - they are cockroaches. Research by the National Cockroach . project has shown that the household pests tell each other apart . by their place of birth, and avoid those who aren't from the same . 'neighborhood'. Accordingly, cockroaches native to the Upper East and Upper West Sides and Roosevelt Island can and do breed with one another, but they prefer to stay in their home areas with their own species. Mark Stoeckle, a senior research associate, told National Geographic: 'The diversity was a big surprise to us and the fact that they're not just all mixed together - it's not a random assortment. 'So they must be staying close to home, and they have their own neighborhoods.' Stoeckle joked that the insects were more similar to New Yorkers than most residents would like to admit, adding that they are 'immigrants', descending on America from all over the globe. Researchers are trying to track the most common cockroaches in America and work out how they migrated across the country . 'We know these are tropical species that . are thought to have come from Africa, though there's no definite proof . of that,' he said. 'They require a very warm, moist environment. And we've made a nice home for them in cities, because we have underground tunnels and sewers where they can live year-round. 'In the summer they come up above ground, and that's when we usually see them. Sometimes . called palmetto bug or waterbug, the American cockroach is the most common large roach in the . U.S. and thought to have hitch-hiked to the continent from Africa inside . goods shipments. They . commonly inhabit warm, moist environments in man-made structures, . including basements of large buildings, steam tunnels, and sewers. The smaller cockroaches seen in homes and apartments are usually the German cockroach. In . warm weather, the American variety may be seen roaming urban sidewalks . at night particularly near large buildings, street drains, and manhole . covers. 'But they've only been here as long as we've had an underground environment that's congenial for them.' The National Cockroach Project is a research initiative by Rockefeller University which wants to find out the origins of the American cockroach, and understand how it has migrated across the country. Using genetic barcoding the project tracks different species across the US and relies on samples sent in by citizen scientists. These include schoolchildren who are asked to post cockroaches they find for examination - although the website emphasizes all samples must be dead first. While the project collects specimens from all over the country, New Yorkers are the most likely to post the vermin in. 'We've gotten about 200 specimens, either mailed in or [hand-delivered]. Most are from the U.S., from New York City,' Stoeckle said. 'We've had better luck getting New Yorkers to pick up cockroaches than we've had elsewhere.' One of the researchers joked that, just like real New Yorkers, the cockroaches are all immigrants coming to the city from overseas . Anyone wishing to kill a cockroach may . have their work cut out for them as the hardy species has been known to . survive a nuclear blast. They . can also survive being decapitated from their bodies for a number of . days, until the head starves to death due to its inability to eat.","Cockroaches can tell when others weren't born near them .

Earlier this year, jobless mother of 11 Heather Frost caused outrage when it was revealed that she would be moving into a taxpayer-funded £500,000 home with her brood. But although the resulting furore cost her the house, Frost, who appears in new Channel 5 documentary On Benefits And Proud, is unrepentant. In the film, the foul-mouthed 37-year-old from Gloucestershire is seen telling her friends that as far as angry taxpayers are concerned, her view is 'f*** the lot of them.' Unrepentant: Heather Frost with one of her nine daughters at their taxpayer funded six-bedroom home . Outspoken: In the aftermath of the controversy, Frost appeared on Good Morning to defend herself . 'It's a f***ing s****y council house,' she adds. 'Everyone wants to believe what they read in the f***ing papers don't . they. 'Every child needs a house, a roof over their head I should say, . don't they? It . wasn't our choice for the council to build a new house, it was theirs. 'No one's put a gun to their f***ing head. I think they [other people] . are jealous. F*** the lot of them! Everyone's entitled to their opinion . but everyone's entitled to a place to live.' Frost, who receives benefits totalling £900 per week - the same as someone who earns £60,000 a year - is now looking forward to a council-funded renovation of her current home, which will see the two three-bedroom houses she currently occupies knocked together to create a permanent six-bedroom house. The cost of the renovation will run into thousands of pounds, and includes a new kitchen and bedrooms. But despite the vast expense to taxpayers, who spend a staggering £100 million on benefits every day according to Government figures, Frost, who has never had a full time job, says the system is put there to help people like her. 'Yes, people don't agree with the . benefits system and s*** like that but the benefits system is put there . to help people that can't go out and work,' she asserts. 'Yes, it's my choice and my . decision to have a large family but there's no law out there to say how . many kids you can have or can't have. There's people out there with more . kids than me, that's my argument.' Family affair: Frost pictured with her 11 children including Toby, 19,  and Sophie, 21 who also live on benefits . Home: Frost stands in the doorway of her current home which is to be totally remodelled at taxpayer's expense . She adds: 'Fred .

We can't afford to take the . kids to Spain or on posh holidays.' As a result, in order to make ends meet, Frost says she is forced to enlist the help of local shoplifters who sell her purloined goods for half the price of what she would splash out legally in a shop. 'Everybody has to get stuff off shoplifters, don't they,' she says. 'Wouldn't have enough to live otherwise.

When not entertaining shoplifters, Frost says she is looking forward to seeing what kind of response those who do eventually get the £500,000 home she almost moved into. 'Are the people who get it going to get as . much grief as what I got?' she asks. 'The £500,000 house was built for somebody. So lets . see if they get the s*** I got for being allocated it.'

Matthew added: 'It was about sending a message . to racists that Americans aren't going to tolerate that.' 'We raised $10,000 within seventy-two hours. It was really amazing.' Some online commenters have called the authenticity of the receipt into question, but Jenkins stands by her story.

Virtually all of the comments on the teenagers Facebook page were from friends showing their support for the young woman. However, some have also cast doubt on the authenticity of the writing. One doubter commented: 'As a black man, I simply don't believe this is real. The word 'none' has totally different handwriting from the word 'Ni**er.' There's lots of stories lately of people making false accusations of racism or discrimination for attention.

Virgin Atlantic however has said its . business plan allowed for the 'low load factors' and said the flights . were contributing to the overall business plan by connecting passengers . to its long haul network. Virgin Atlantic has lost 'millions' since it started its domestic flight service Little Red, according to reports. Sir Richard Branson is pictured at the launch of the service . The company started flying from Heathrow to Manchester in March while links to Edinburgh and Aberdeen began in April. According to The Independent, industry insiders believe losses for the network could be in the region of between £2m and £3m a week. It is understood the airline disputes this figure. Losses on domestic flights can be sustained by airlines if they supply passengers to its intercontinental network. A Virgin Atlantic spokesman said: 'With the launch of Little Red, Virgin Atlantic is offering millions of passengers a strong alternative for domestic flights and renewed choice for connections to the rest of our long haul network, and it is those connections which means Little Red is contributing to a robust business model that will protect competition to and from Heathrow for the long-term. 'As with any new route it takes time for customers to become fully aware of our service and it is normal to have comparatively low load factors in the first six months of operation. 'Our business plan allowed for this. Bookings for future travel continue to grow steadily and our recent . connecting revenue performance has beaten our expectations. Virgin Atlantic has said its business plan allowed for the 'low load factors' and said the flights were contributing to the overall business plan . 'We are fully committed to all of our domestic routes and believe our great reputation for service and value for money will continue to attract passengers to Little Red.' The aircraft used by Virgin Atlantic for its Little Red service in fact belong to Aer Lingus, who 'wet-lease' the planes and crews to Virgin and get paid regardless of how many people use the routes. Virgin Atlantic said the average number of passengers was rising as the airline built up its domestic operation. Sir Richard Branson, Founder of the Virgin Group and President of Virgin Atlantic said: 'Little Red is a British business giving a better deal to British passengers. 'On routes where previously customers in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Manchester had a “choice” of one, there is now a strong alternative and we are shaking up a monopoly market. 'We are doing so with a full service, a great schedule and at exceptionally good value for money. 'There have been challenges as there would be for any new business, but we do not shy away from these – in fact they are what the Virgin entrepreneurial spirit is all about. 'Bookings are growing steadily with passengers from around the globe connecting onto Little Red flights and we know they will continue to do so.'","Little Red service is believed to have been third full since starting this year .

The 16-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot at point blank range by the Taliban because of her unswerving campaign for education says she hopes to be her country's prime minister one day. Brave Malala Yousafzai, who has made an astonishing recovery since being shot in the head, refuses to be daunted by the terrorists who tried to assassinate her. She revealed her political aspirations just hours after she was awarded Europe's top human rights prize and on the eve of the announcement for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, for which she was a strong contender but lost out to chemical weapons watchdog OPCW. Malala Yousafzai, who was among the favourites to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, says terrorists cannot kill her dream of better rights for women . In an interview with CNN, Malala said she had initially wanted to be a doctor but later learned she could help more people through becoming prime minister of Pakistan. 'I can spend much of the budget on education,' Malala said to applause and laughter as she sat next to her father, human rights activist Ziauddin Yousafzai, the founder of a girls' school in Pakistan. Ziauddin Yousafzai says he is proud of his brave daughter Malala . Malala recounted the moment she was shot while sitting in the back of a vehicle travelling home from school and reiterated that she was not intimidated by threats to her life. 'I'm never going to give up,' Malala said when asked about repeated death threats made by the Taliban. 'They only shot a body but they cannot shoot my dreams.' On October 9 last year a masked gunman jumped into a pick-up truck taking a group of girls home from school and shouted 'who is Malala?' before shooting her in the head. Her father asked his brother-in-law to prepare a coffin for her funeral but Malala was flown to the UK and woke up a week later at a hospital in Birmingham. Following treatment she gradually regained her sight and voice. Malala said her first thought after finding herself in Britain was of two friends she was with who were also injured in the callous attack. 'If I was shot that was fine for me but I was feeling guilty that they have been the target,' she said. The world's reaction to her attempted murder led to the creation of the Malala Fund, which campaigns for girls' education around the world. She has since received multiple awards including the prestigious Sakharov Prize for free speech, which is awarded by the European Parliament annually in memory of Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov. Previous winners include South Africa's Nelson Mandela and Burma's Aung San Suu Kyi. Earlier this week the Pakistan Taliban repeated their threat to kill Malala as well as attack any bookshops which decide to stock her new memoir 'I Am Malala', which was published on Tuesday. Shahidullah Shahid, a spokesman for the terrorists, told the Dawn newspaper in Pakistan: 'Malala abandoned Islam for secularism for which she is being given awards. 'The Taliban will not lose an opportunity to kill Malala Yousafzai and those who were found selling her book will be targeted.' Malala's failed assassination attempt has also drawn international attention to the struggle for women's rights within Pakistan. Malala addressed the United Nations on her 16th birthday, and she expects to meet the Queen later this month. The Nobel Peace Prize committee had a record 259 candidates, including 50 organisations, that were nominated this year. Undaunted: Malala Yousufzai believes she could help more people as prime minister . Before she lost out, humble Malala said it would be a 'great honour and more than I deserve' to win the accolade, but insisted she had more to do before she could feel she has truly earned it. 'I need to work a lot,' she said. Malala's father said he did not regret how outspoken his only daughter has been growing up, including when she first started blogging and speaking out against the denial of education to young girls in Pakistan's Swat Valley. 'I will never put my head into the yoke of slavery,' he said. Malala spoke passionately against forced marriage and the denial of education to girls and boys throughout the world. She urged young girls in the developed world to take advantage of their education - and to do their homework and be kind to their teachers. 'I would like to tell all the girls: realise its importance before it is snatched from you,' she said. Malala lives with her family in Birmingham. She said that while in Pakistan she liked to listen to Justin Beiber, but now longs for the Pashto music of her homeland.","Malala Yousafzai says she hopes to become her country's prime minister .

A 'wicked' Eastern European couple pretended to Good Samaritans and helped a blind pensioner into a shopping centre before stealing £100 cash from his bag, police said today. Officers in Hereford are hunting for the criminals after the man, in his 80s, was targeted after he withdrew cash from a bank. After offering to help the man into Marks & Spencer, the couple stole the money from his bag before fleeing. Terrible: This is the shocking moment a blind man is targeted by thieves after withdrawing money from his bank in Hereford . CCTV images released from West Mercia Police show the moment the woman, wearing a fur coat and short white skirt, took the elderly man, by the arm. The victim, who is snapped holding his white stick, is unaware the woman and her accomplice are luring him into a quiet area of the shop where they raid his bag. The man only discovered what had happened when he checked his bag and realised the money had gone. The theft took place in broad daylight at 12.45pm on Thursday, September 19 and police say the couple had foreign accents likely to be from Eastern Europe. 'Appalling crime': The woman took the man by the arm, led by her accomplice, right,  into a quiet area of M&S where they raided his bag for £100 . Pc Julian Jones is investigating the incident. He said: 'The victim, who is registered blind, walks with the aid of a stick and sadly, it appears this may be the reason he was targeted. 'To take advantage of someone so clearly vulnerable is an absolutely wicked and appalling thing to do. 'We believe he was distracted by the woman's offer of help so that someone could steal the cash from him and we are keen not only to find those responsible, but also to issue a warning to stop others from being victims in the future. 'I would urge people to be on their guard against distraction thieves, especially the vulnerable such as the elderly or disabled, who unfortunately are often the targets of these types of offences. Anyone who sees them should call 101 and ask for West Mercia Police, quoting reference 303S 190913.","Criminal couple preyed on man, 80, after seeing him take out cash .

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 07:58 EST, 11 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:20 EST, 11 October 2013 . A man has told how his life was saved by the photograph on a packet of cigarettes. Mark Knight realised he had cancer after he saw the signs in a graphic warning image he was designing for use on cigarette packets. The 50-year-old graphic designer from Bristol has been creating cigarette packets for more than 30 years but in June he noticed he had similar symptoms to those on a packet he was designing. Mark Knight, 50, was diagnosed with tongue cancer after recognising the signs from the warning on a cigarette packet he was designing. He has had surgery to remove the tumour and rebuild his tongue (pictured) As a result, he went to his doctor and was quickly diagnosed with cancer of the tongue. He had an operation last month to remove the tumour and replace the missing tissue with skin and a vein from his forearm. Mr Knight, who smoked 10 cigarettes a day for 20 years before giving up in 2005, said: ‘I am very lucky. If I had a different job I may not have ever recognised the symptoms. My job saved my life. ‘It would have probably been another four or five weeks before I would have started to think about going to a doctor or anything like that. I may not have done. ‘I am so lucky I do what I do for a living. That is the simple point. That picture is the thing that really set me into action and made me go and find out what was wrong with me. ‘I first realised something might be wrong in June. I had the operation in September. Mr Knight recognised the signs of tongue cancer from a cigarette packet (pictured) that he was designing for an Australian company. He says that he believes his job saved his life . ‘I have had cancer of the tongue and they removed it all away and basically in the job that I do I saw this picture it and aroused some sort of suspicion in my mind as to what was going on. ‘They removed a cancerous tumour from the tongue and replaced it with skin and a vein from my forearm. ‘They also removed cells from my neck as well as some teeth. I will be in recovery for another three weeks and am looking forward to going back to doing the job I did before.’ Father-of-two Mr Knight was designing the image for display on a packet of Australian cigarettes. It showed a woman suffering severe throat and mouth cancer. Mr Knight is now urging the British government to force British cigarette companies to put warnings over the whole of their packets so that no branding is visible . Now in recovery and preparing for radiotherapy, Mr Knight is urging the British government to force UK firms to carry warning images over the whole of their packets so no branding is visible. Last year Australia became the first country in the world to adopt the policy - which sees packets entirely covered in graphic warnings. Despite a recent survey by the British Heart Foundation which revealed that a third of UK teenagers are put off smoking due to the health warning pictures, the government is not convinced. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We take very seriously the potential for standardised packaging to reduce smoking rates. ‘But in light of the differing views, we have decided to wait until the emerging impact of the decision in Australia can be measured and then we will make a decision.’ Mr Knight said: ‘I mainly design them for Australian companies and I haven’t seen that many in this country. ‘I would urge this to change and I encourage people to really look at the pictures on the side of the packets. ‘If I had seen a British one I wouldn’t have known anything about my symptoms as the picture wouldn’t be there.’ A spokesperson for Mr Knight’s company Studio 404, said: ‘Mark is an important and popular member of our team, we look forward to having him back. ‘We were all concerned to hear that he had discovered a potential medical issue whilst viewing a tobacco health warning image during the course of his job. ‘All of us in the studio have been exposed to these types of health warning images for many years, but this is the first time that we have felt their full impact so close to home. ‘Looking back over the past few weeks it is quite a remarkable story to think that Mark discovered the cancer in the way that he did.’ Tongue cancer is classed as a form of mouth cancer. Symptoms include a red or white patch on the tongue that does not clear up, a persistent sore throat, an ulcer that does not heal, pain when swallowing, numbness in the mouth or bleeding from the tongue. Risk factors include smoking and drinking a lot of alcohol. Treatment depends on the size of the cancer and whether it has spread. It usually involves surgery, radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.

Police set light to $250million of cocaine seized from an international organised crime ring. Armed officers stood by as others burned 2,551lbs of the Class A drug inside a military base in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. According to the attorney general, the 1.2-ton haul was confiscated from a drug smuggling gang in a recent police operation in Peravia Province. Blaze: A firefighter walks away from the pile of Class A drugs police seized from drug lords in the Dominican Republic . Haul: Police seized 2,551 lbs of the Class A drug from an international drug smuggling gang in a recent police operation in Peravia Province . Officers piled the Class A drug into one area at the military base in the capital before lighting it with torches. The popular tourist destination of Peravia Province is in the south of the Dominican Republic. The coastal province, bordering the Carribean Sea, is home to nearly 300,000 people. At the beginning of October, MailOnline reported a British man has admitted attempting to smuggle $30million (£80million) of cocaine into Europe from the Caribbean. Rawson Watson, from Kent, faces 10 years in an American jail after he was caught boarding a Belgium-bound plane in the Dominican Republic with a tonne of cocaine in December 2011. The drug was found spread across 20 suitcases in 1,001 separate packages, according to reports. As well as a jail term, Watson could also face a fine of up to $10million. Capital: The hillside community of Santo Domingo in Medellin, also known as Comunas . Hazardous: Officers and workers wore masks and respirators to protect themselves from the harmful smoke . Burning: An armed guard watches as workers pile up the packets of the Class A drugs ready to set light to them . This comes at a time as officials say the Caribbean is becoming a hot spot again for drug smuggling into the United States as a new generation of 'Cocaine Cowboys' use speedboats to smuggle the drugs into the States. About 14 per cent of U.S.-bound cocaine shipments, roughly 42 tons, was trafficked through the Caribbean in the first six months of this year. The Dominican Republic is emerging as a hub of the burgeoning trade, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. That was double the share of U.S.-bound cocaine that was shipped through the region during the first half of 2012, Vito Guarino, special agent in charge of the DEA's Caribbean division, said. Colombian-led traffickers are also taking advantage of a region where they made deep inroads in the 1980s, before drug lords in Mexico began to dominate the trade by the late 1990s. In the last year, U.S. law enforcement agencies have turned up the pressure on the Caribbean traffickers, with more Coast Guard patrols, as well as well as human and electronic intelligence, to detect illicit planes and boats. A tidy sum: Packets of cocaine are closely guarded by officials from the country's police force . While experts have been predicting a rise in Caribbean trafficking for years now, Guarino said the evidence of an escalation was now unmistakable. Most cocaine shipments into the region are smuggled aboard drug-laden speed boats, with two or more big engines, that roar across from the northern tip of South America in one or two days, Guarino said, often under cover of darkness. Bales of cocaine are off-loaded to fishing boats or transferred to vehicles on deserted beaches.'I was here when they were doing it predominantly by air. Now it's predominantly by go-fast (boats),' Guarino said. In August, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection aircraft spotted a 30-foot long, go-fast boat near Puerto Rico loaded with 1,500 lbs of cocaine in waterproof bales. The boat, its three-man crew, and its cargo were seized by a British navy frigate, HMS Lancaster, patrolling in the area. Stacked up: The huge seizure comes as experts say drug-smuggling in the Dominican Republic is on the rise . The lure of Puerto Rico is its status as a U.S. territory. Once drugs are smuggled onto the island they can head right to the U.S. mainland without going through customs. About 500 lbs of coca paste, the raw ingredient for refined cocaine, was recently seized from a laboratory on a ranch on the outskirts of the Dominican capital recently. Dominican authorities said it was the first full-scale cocaine processing operation ever uncovered in the Caribbean. Cocaine lab refining is usually done in South America, before the final product is shipped in bulk. The similarities between Miami in the 1980s and Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic today are striking, Guarino added. 'The Cocaine Cowboys, the Uzis, the shootouts that we used to have ... You're seeing the same violence,' Guarino said. In 2011, Puerto Rico set a new record with 1,117 killings. The homicide rate was more than six times the rate on the U.S. mainland and the government said almost half the murders were drug related. The crime rate has since fallen, but still remains three times higher than on the mainland.","Police seized the Class A drug, worth around $250million from drug smugglers .

The estate of a woman fatally shot by her estranged husband along with their two daughters has sued a Cleveland-area Cracker Barrel restaurant, alleging it failed to protect them from him. The lawsuit was filed late Thursday in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court by the brother of Katherina Allen, who was shot on April 12, 2012, at the restaurant in nearby Brooklyn, Ohio. The lawsuit seeks more than $125,000 in damages. Fatal shooting: Kevin Allen became enraged and began shooting when his wife Katherina told him she was taking their daughters and leaving him . Brooklyn police photographed investigating the shooting at a Cracker Barrel restaurant in Brooklyn, Ohio, in April 2012 .

The company had a duty to customers to take precautions to protect them 'from known and foreseeable third-party criminal acts on its premises,' according to the lawsuit, which said Cracker Barrel had failed to do so. Kevin Allen, 51, angrily confronted his 42-year-old wife at the restaurant and left, then returned and began shooting. Responding officers killed him. While the Lebanon, Tenn.-based company cannot comment on the lawsuit, spokeswoman Jeanne Ludington said in an email, 'We believe that in times of difficulty, families and communities come together and we are grateful to the Brooklyn community for their continued support and acts of kindness.'

Jailed: Casey Bowen, nicknamed 'Pocket Money Boy' in the 1990s, was jailed for another three years today . A criminal nicknamed ‘Pocket Money Boy’ after social services gave him money to keep out of trouble nearly 20 years ago has been jailed for burgling a pensioner’s home and stealing her car. Casey Bowen, 33, was just 14 when he earned his 'Pocket Money Boy' nickname in the mid 1990s. Gloucester social services attempted to wean him off juvenile crime by paying him £60 a week - but today he was jailed for three years at Gloucester Crown Court for a crime he committed while on parole. Bowen, from Churchdown, Gloucester, pleaded guilty to burglary, taking a car without the owner’s consent and going out equipped for burglary. The cocaine-using father-of-two targeted a vulnerable 81-year-old woman in July this year who was living alone in Cheltenham, the court heard. Bowen was still on licence from a five-and-a-half year sentence for armed robbery. Prosecuting barrister David Maunder said: 'Mrs Susan Merrell, who is 81, was in the kitchen when she saw the defendant in her back garden. 'She asked him what he was doing and he said he could help her get rid of bags of rubbish and garden waste. She was thankful and said that it would be lovely. 'He followed her into the house, was polite and friendly and started to help her move items. 'He went into the living room where there was a sideboard and cabinet and told her not to follow him as he was behind the door. 'The defendant stacked the bags in the hallway along with a shopping trolley and he asked if he could borrow her car, a silver Rover 25. She agreed, gave him the keys and he loaded the bags into the vehicle. Youth: Casey Bowen pictured leaving court in 1996 - around the time he was given his nickname . 'But when he left and she returned to the living room she found that two display cabinets had been emptied. 'Old and sentimental value items - bone china tea sets, plates and dishes, glassware and a Victorian clock - were gone.' The court heard how a neighbour of the elderly woman saw Bowen reverse the Rover into his driveway before walking away the following day. He took photographs of Bowen and called the police - who arrested him on July 20. Defending solicitor Lloyd Jenkins said: 'Upon release from his current sentence my client has been co-operative, reliable and keen to prove that leopards can change their spots. 'All went well until he went back to Cheltenham, succumbed to temptation, started using cocaine again and mixing with the wrong sort of people. 'But when I spoke to him recently, for the first time ever he has demonstrated remorse and is ashamed of his behaviour.' Jailing Bowen, Judge Hart said: 'You committed your first burglary at the age of 14 and since then a variety of non-custodial disposals have been tried. 'Your criminal record is littered with offending of a serious nature - violence, burglary and drugs supply - and you have served four jail sentences. 'Perhaps this is not a case of a leopard changing his spots but more of a leopard disguising his spots. 'You preyed on a vulnerable and elderly lady and stole items of sentimental value to her. You then took her car. 'Such offending has a damaging effect on the elderly whose feelings of vulnerability lead to helplessness. 'She put her faith in what she saw as your goodwill and you deliberately targeted her.' Miss Merrell said after the hearing: 'The man just came up the garden path and said that he would take away my rubbish. 'I was very pleased and I went inside the house to get my purse to give him some money and he followed me in. Behind bars: Bowen pleaded guilty at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) to burglary, as well as taking a car without consent and going out equipped for burglary . 'I can’t remember what I was doing, but he stayed in the house and was helping himself to what he wanted. 'He took a lot of family heirlooms including a clock that my sister was very fond of. I was very cross about that. It made me fell very sick at that point. 'I didn’t realise what he had done. I only noticed that everything had gone the following morning.' Bowen's criminal career dates back  two decades and in the 1990s Gloucestershire social services provoked national outrage when they started paying him £60 a week. At the time, the authority thought the money would provide him with the means to legally purchase the items he regularly stole. But the policy was condemned by politicians for paying what appeared to be a 'reward for crime.'","Casey Bowen, 33, was a teenager when he was nicknamed 'Pocket Money Boy' for getting £60 a week from social services to deter him from crime .

A petite personal trainer who competes in weightlifting competitions wants to prove you don't have to be butch and burly in order to be powerful. Megan Batchelor, 24, from Southampton, is 5ft 6in and can lift twice her own body weight of 10st 8lb. She currently trains six days a week so she can deadlift 125kg (19st 6lb), bench press 80kg (12st 6lb) and squat 97.5kg (15st). Mrs Motivator: Megan Batchelor hopes to inspire more women to take up weightlifting . Loves to push herself: The personal trainer works out six days a week . Megan, who only started powerlifting at the start of this year after qualifying to be a personal trainer in 2011, hopes she can inspire other people to get involved with the sport. She told MailOnline: 'I want to show women that you can do something empowering like powerlifting whilst still remaining feminine. She added: 'To be clear - it's not bodybuilding. It's very different. Bodybuilding is about size and definition of muscles, aesthetics and not about function.' Megan has launched her own business,  MGB Fitness, with the support of her husband Mark, to help people tone up and get fit. But she wants to lead by example and show how you can build strength and fight fat through weighting lifting - an exercise regime that many women are loathe to follow in case it makes them look too masculine. Strong: Megan can deadlift 125kg, bench press 80kg and squat 97.5kg . Good exercise: Megan recommends weigh lifting to people who want to get into shape . 'A lot of women don't realise how good it is for them, so I wanted to use myself as a guinea pig to help inspire them,' she explained to the Southern Daily Echo. 'It helps women appreciate that you can do this but not end up looking like a bodybuilder. We . simply don't have enough testosterone to gain muscle quickly... you don't wake up one morning and look like . The Hulk.' 'A . lot . of women are put off lifting in general because they think it's about . getting ""stacked"" and ending up looking very masculine and bulky' She added in an interview with MailOnline: 'A . lot . of women are put off lifting in general because they think it's about . getting ""stacked"" and ending up looking very masculine and bulky.' She admitted that even she was sceptical at first when it was suggested she try it. She . said: 'I was reluctant as I didn't want to end up like a bloke but I . did my research and looked at the different weight categories and saw . that you don't have to be huge to be strong. 'I . know for many people - both men and women - the weights area of a gym . can be very intimidating but they are also intrigued to try it.' She added that women keen to drop a dress size and banish their 'muffin top' should note that lifting weights is 'very good at keeping your body fat down and keeping you slimmer.' Multi-talented: Her other passion is singing and she's in a band . She explained: 'Strength training boosts your metabolism so your body uses more fuel and stores less fat. 'Muscle mass is much firmer than body fat. If you have a thick layer of soft, squidgy fat on your body, you are likely to get overhang like 'muffin tops' and 'bat wings' because your clothes cut into the soft tissue. Even slim people struggle with this if they have no muscle tone. A firmer surface (that is muscle closer to the surface of the skin) makes clothes look better and stops those horrendous VPL.' Another additional health benefit is stronger bones. She said: 'Women's changing hormone levels and often lighter body weight than men make us more prone to diseases like osteoporosis, particularly in post-menopausal women. Strength training tells the bones that they are still needed. It stimulates the rebuilding process and makes them stronger.' For those she's convinced to try lifting weights, Megan recommends first seeking advice from a professional via the accredited Register of Exercise Professionals (REPs). Megan intends to compete in a southern counties weightlifting competition in Bournemouth this November. If successful, she will qualifying for a place in the British Drug Free Powerlifting Association's national competition, where she could compete to be the country's strongest woman. Megan said she's always loved exercising and has been a 'gym bunny' since the age of 16 and run a marathon. But exercise is not her only passion. She also loves to sing and her band, Madison Heights, regularly perform at events including weddings. She sought a career in fitness over trying to break into the music industry as she felt the latter was too competitive. She also gets job satisfaction from inspiring people and pushing herself and others out of their 'comfort zone'. She said: 'I've had a few women tell me that I . inspire them to do more weights training, it's so humbling and I love to . see more ladies in the weights area.'","Megan Batchelor, 24, from Southampton, can deadlift 125kg .

A pastor charged in a triple slaying at a Kentucky pawn shop had attended the funeral of two of the victims, offering condolences to relatives who say they're sickened by the arrest of the man who seemed to be a sympathetic mourner. Kenneth Allen Keith, pastor of Main Street Baptist Church in Burnside, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with murder and robbery after the September 20 slayings in Danville. Keith, 48, attended the funeral of Michael Hockensmith, 35, and Hockensmith's wife 38-year-old Angela.  Daniel P. Smith, 60, also was killed. Kenneth Allen Keith, pastor of Main Street Baptist Church in Burnside, Kentucky, was arrested on Wednesday over three killings at a pawn shop . Michael Hockensmith counted Keith a friend and fellow Christian, relatives said, adding they were jolted by Keith's arrest. 'To find that out, it made me sick,' Hockensmith's brother, Tony Hockensmith, said on Thursday. There was no indication yet if Keith had an attorney, authorities said. The pastor is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges on Tuesday in Boyle District Court. The shootings took place at ABC Gold Games and More pawn shop last month. The shop was run by the Hockensmiths and Mr Smith was a frequent customer. Michael Hockensmith, his wife Angela and Daniel Smith were killed at the pawn store on September 20 . Keith also operated a pawn store called Gold Rush Gold Buyers in the nearby town of Somerset. Tony Hockensmith, the victim's brother, said Keith was the former owner of the ABC pawn shop. Mr Hockensmith said he believed the pastor to be in financial trouble which was the reason he sold the pawn shop to his brother. He told kentucky.com: 'Everybody's in shock.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 06:56 EST, 11 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:22 EST, 11 October 2013 . One of two men who claim that they encountered an unidentified flying object and its inhabitants 40 years ago on the banks of the Pascagoula River has said that he has never come to terms with the extra-terrestrial encounter. Calvin Parker Jr., who became famous along with Charles Hickson after reporting the sighting, says the encounter on October 11, 1973 turned his life upside down. 'This is something I really didn't want to happen,' Parker told The Associated Press as the 40th anniversary of the encounter approached. Scroll down for video . Returning to the site: Calvin Parker Jr, now 58, was only 18 when he and a friend went fishing off the banks of the Pascagoula River when they were abducted by aliens . The aftermath: Parker (right) and his co-worker Charles Hinkson (left) became instant sensations in 1973 . Parker was unnerved by initial crush of unwelcome attention, with newsmen and UFO enthusiasts overrunning Walker Shipyard, where he and Hickson worked. He tried to dodge the spotlight for decades, moving frequently before returning to Mississippi's Gulf Coast in recent years. Hickson never regretted the notoriety that came his way after he told authorities he encountered an unidentified flying object and its occupants 40 years ago on the banks of the Pascagoula River. Until his death in 2011, Hickson told his story to anyone who would listen. The incident made headlines, sparked a wave of UFO sightings nationwide and became one of the most widely examined cases on record. Skeptics ranged from the deputies who first interviewed the men to an author who sought to poke holes in the story, and Parker himself has had conflicting thoughts about whether he was visited by aliens or demons. Parker, now 58, was 18 when he went fishing with Hickson on a tranquil Thursday night after work. Embracing it: Hinkson, who died in 2011, enjoyed the fame and regularly told the story of the crab-clawed extra terrestrials to anyone who would listen but Parker had the opposite reaction . As they dangled their lines without much luck, the two said a UFO with blue lights swooped down. They told of a zipping noise made by the object. Hickson, then 42, said three creatures with leathery gray skin and crab-like claws - he thought they were robots - took them by the forearms and levitated them aboard the craft. He said something that looked like a large floating eye appeared to examine him. Parker says he was conscious but paralyzed. 'They gave a thorough, I mean a thorough, examination to me just like any doctor would,' he said. And then they were back on the shore, where it all began. The UFO was gone and Parker said they tried to collect themselves. Hickson needed three shots of liquor from a bottle in his car to calm his nerves before deciding to report what happened. At the Jackson County Sheriff's Department, deputies initially suspected both men were drunk. Reliving it: Parker said that the police did not believe him and Hinkson but eventually realized they were not lying . Getting out of dodge: Parker took out of state construction jobs following the incident to avoid the attention . Then-Capt. Glenn Ryder, who still works for the sheriff's office, said he laughed at the report, but met with the men. Parker and Hickson stuck to their story. After the formal interview, deputies left Hickson and Parker together in a room with a hidden tape recorder, hoping to catch them in a lie. 'Me and the other investigator got up and left to let them talk, to see if they were going to say, “Well, we got them fooled,” but they didn't,' Ryder said. 'They were really concerned.' Another sighting: Hinkson, seen here in 2001, said that he had a similar encounter in 1974 . On the tape, Hickson tells Parker, 'It scared me to death too, son. You can't get over it in a lifetime. Jesus Christ have mercy.' 'I don't know what happened to them,' Ryder said. 'I wasn't there with them, but I know you don't fake fear, and they were fearful. They were fearful.' The next afternoon, the story was splashed across the front pages of newspapers in Pascagoula and Gulfport. Overnight, Pascagoula became a magnet for news reporters and UFO investigators. Widespread interest in UFOs began in the 1940s with an incident at Roswell New Mexico, in which UFO enthusiasts believe the government got its hands on a crashed UFO and alien bodies. The government spent decades denying it. In the 1960s, interest flared anew with a series of reports, including the purported alien abduction of New Hampshire couple Betty and Barney Hill in 1961. The widespread attention to the Pascagoula encounter set off a new round of reports. In south Mississippi, hundreds of reports overwhelmed authorities in the two weeks after the Hickson-Parker encounter. There . were hoaxes and humor too. A Long Beach, Miss., taxi driver told police . a being with pincers tapped on his window, a story he admitted days . later was fake. A Mobile, . Alabama television station said it would record a UFO appearance . predicted by a psychic between Mobile and nearby Pascagoula. Roughly . 1,000 cars converged on the spot, where nothing happened. An Ocean Springs alderman proposed an ordinance making it illegal to operate a UFO at more than twice the speed of light on U.S. 90, the coast's main drag. Mayor Tom Stennis voted against the ordinance, joking he didn't want to discourage tourism. UFO skeptic Philip Klass believed Hickson and Parker's report was a hoax. In his book 'UFOs Explained,' he noted Hickson changed some details of his story and claimed a polygraph operator whose test Hickson passed wasn't up to the task. Parker later passed a lie detector test himself. Interpretation: Hinkson, seen here in 1998, said at one point that they could have been demons . Hickson would go on to appear on talk shows, give lectures and interviews, and self-publish a book in 1983 titled 'UFO Contact at Pascagoula.' He reported three more encounters in 1974, and said the aliens communicated to him that they were peaceful. 'The only thing he wanted to do was let everybody know we were not alone,' said Eddie Hickson, his son. 'He didn't care if you believed him or not. If you wanted to listen, by gum, he'd tell you.' 'He could never understand why he was chosen,' the younger Hickson added. 'But he never once told me that he wished it had never happened. Never.' Parker said the intrusions by curiosity seekers have become less frequent over the years, but have never really let up. 'You don't never have no privacy,' he said. Parker married later in 1973 and eventually took oil industry and out-of-state construction jobs to escape the attention. Local celebrity: Parker said he regularly gets recognized when he visits the area near the abduction site . 'By the time you get somewhere and they figure out who you were, I'd just go,' he said. 'I'd just go find another job somewhere.' Parker attended some UFO conventions, and was once hypnotized by Budd Hopkins, a noted UFO investigator. He briefly tried to capitalize on his story in 1993 by starting a Louisiana company called UFO Investigations where he and partners would produce television segments on the subject. Parker moved to Moss Point in 2006 and in 2010 suffered a stroke that limited him physically. He's on disability aid now, but sometimes boats by the site of the encounter when he goes fishing. He said that just recently he met a woman at a gas station who already knew who he was. 'I'm always recognized,' he said. There's no historical marker on the river bank noting the encounter, and stores don't sell UFO souvenirs. But local people remember - though often with skepticism and jokes. For his part, Parker said he's had conflicting thoughts over the years about that night in 1973. At one point, he wasn't even sure the creatures were aliens. They might have been demons, he said. 'I'm a firm believer in God and where there's good, there's bad,' Parker said.","Calvin Parker Jr and Charles Hinkson claimed that they were abducted by aliens while fishing in Mississippi 40 years ago .

Spanish police have said her body was discovered in the Hotel Sevilla Congresos this morning and she had died 'apparently from natural causes.' An autopsy is due to be carried out on the 33-year-old today, but local media are reporting she died of a suspected heart attack, while the Health and Saftey Executive have said links between the injuries she sustained in the crash and her death will be investigated.

A spokesman for Spain's National Police in Seville, said: 'Everything is . pointing to Maria's death being the result of natural causes. 'Officers found no suspicious substances or medicines in her room and . there were no signs of violence either in the room or on her body.

McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh said as the chairman of the Formula One Teams' Association: 'She was an inspiration not just to women in this sport, but also to all those who suffered life-threatening injuries.' Sauber's Monisha Kaltenhorn, the first female team principal in the sport, said: 'If anybody represented strength and optimism, it was Maria. Her sudden death is a big loss to the motorsport world.' Williams development driver Susie Wolff recalled how De Villota asked her to carry on for her and all women drivers following her accident. 'She very much said to me after it it's up to you to go out there and show them that it (a woman driver in Formula One) is possible. 'She knew that women could compete at that level and that's why, after her accident and her not being able to do that anymore, she just wanted someone to know it was possible.

Stuart Ross, the neurosurgeon who treated Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond after his crash, theorises de Villota may have died of a seizure . Maria de Villota could have died following a seizure provoked by her head injury, the medic who treated Top Gear's Richard Hammond said today. Consultant neurosurgeon Stuart Ross said the Spaniard's freak accident in July last year may have left her with epilepsy. This could have led to her death in a hotel room more than a year after the crash. 'The only obvious connection I can see between the injury and her death is that she could have developed seizures after her head injury and she happened to have a big seizure in the hotel room,' he said. 'After a knock on the head or any brain injury, there's a possibility of developing epilepsy. 'That could happen 14 months down the line, even if she had not had a seizure in the interim.' Mr Ross led the team that cared for Hammond at Leeds General Infirmary following the high speed crash in a jet-powered dragster that nearly claimed his life in 2006. Doctors have yet to confirm how De Villota died. But the neurosurgeon, a senior lecturer at the University of Leeds, said epilepsy was the most likely cause - if her death was related to her accident. 'Anyone with epilepsy has a small background risk of sudden death,' he added. 'It's a phenomenon that doesn't happen very often but it seems to be the most likely connection - if there is one - between what has happened and her (de Villota's) injury.' A fit may have been brought on by flickering lights of a television or a simple infection or illness, he said. Other possible catalysts for a seizure include failure to take medication if a patient is receiving treatment for the condition, he said.","Spanish media reporting 33-year-old died of a suspected heart attack .

A Massachusetts couple aboard a Royal Caribbean cruise last month wanted to fall asleep to sounds of the ocean – instead, they were woken by desperate cries for help. Roy Nagy’s wife Karen awoke at 4am and asked him to open the window so she could hear the ocean. Cries for help from outside led to a phone call, the ship was turned around and three men aboard a sinking motorboat were rescued an hour later. ‘We started to go back to sleep, and right after that, we started to hear voices out in the water,’ Mr Nagy told CBS Boston. ‘We heard, ‘Hey, hey, hey, hey.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Saved: Roy and Karen Nagy (far right) saved the lives of three men (far left, center bottom and blue shirt) by calling the ship's staff after hearing them cry for help . Unable to see anyone in the dark of night, the couple was sure they heard the voices – which were fading deeper and deeper into the dark as the ship traveled on. Thinking people had fallen overboard, Mr Nagy told Nashoba Publishing, he called the ship’s crew to inform them people were in the water. Two other couples also reported hearing people screaming for help outside the ship, according to CBS Boston. The captain soon turned around his ship, the Jewel of the Seas, switched on the flood lights and all hands on deck began an exhaustive search that lasted roughly an hour. ‘They shined a spotlight in the water, and we could see a person waving his arms frantically, so we were thrilled that somebody was going to be rescued,’ Mr Nagy, the executive director of the Boys and Girls Club of Billerica (MA), told Nashoba. Saving grace: The men were rescued by Royal Carribbean's Jewel of the Sea . As the ship inched closer to the marooned men and a rescue boat was deployed, Mr Nagy had goosebumps, he told CBS Boston. ‘They were without food, water and floating without life jackets for hours, so they were in real tough shape,’ he added. The three men were Americans in a speedboat that had been headed from St Thomas to St Croix, in the Virgin Islands, according to Nashoba. They had been in the water for 10 hours, but were soon posing for pictures with their rescuers, Nagys included. From outside: The Nagys heard the men cry for help after opening the window to their room to hear the ocean . The ship’s crew fed them, gave them water and a medical checkup. Dropped off only a few hours later, the trio was off the ship almost as quickly as they had come aboard. ‘I never saw them again, never even getting their names,’ Nagy told Nashoba. ‘It was such a blur, but no way I'll ever forget it. Just an off-the-charts experience.’ The Nagys received the royal treatment for the rest of their cruise, Roy told Nashoba. The captain invited the couple to the bridge, sharing tales of past rescues and saying the rescued men would have died if the call had not been made. Chills: Mr Nagy got goosebumps as the men were pulled from their sinking speed boat, and gets them again every time he tells the story of their rescue . Crew members showered them with endless bottles of wine and chocolates, fellow passengers asked them to recount the tale, everyone wanted to know their story, Mr Nagy said. ‘We wanted to go away and relax, but it kept coming up,’ Nagy added. ‘I feel the emotions every time I tell the story. It just gives me goosebumps every time.’ Reached by CBS Boston, one of the survivors was grateful for his rescue. ‘There’s really a lot of nice and beautiful people in the world,’ Matthew Spencer told the station. A Royal Caribbean spokesperson said in a statement that the cruise operator was glad to be in the right place at the right time.","Roy and Karen Nagy heard the men cry for help after opening the window to their cabin at around 4am .

Mullen was named by Carson's former lawyer and one-time best friend Henry Bushkin as one of three other men hired by the late-night television star to break into the secret Manhattan apartment of his second wife in 1970. Backing up Bushkin's claim that the gang discovered cast-iron evidence Carson's wife was indeed carrying-on with Gifford, Mullen also confirms that 'The Tonight Show' host broke down in tears when her infidelity dawned on him. Mullen told the New York Post's Page Six, 'I confirm I was present, indeed an eyewitness to the events described by the author as the so-called ‘break-in’ of the apartment used by Johnny Carson’s wife, Joanne. The head of the J.T. Mullen agency said, 'Break-in is a bit of a misnomer as no locks were picked and no windows broken. 'The group of us who accompanied Carson managed to convince the person on duty to let us into the apartment where we confirmed Carson’s suspicions, finding various framed photos of his wife with football legend Frank Gifford . . . and Gifford’s clothes were in a closet along with a bathrobe.' While Mullen, who has worked as a private investigator in the Big Apple since he was 16 does not claim that he saw that Carson was carrying a .38 revolver, he does say that the popular personality cried. In Happier Times: Johnny Carson and his bride, . actress-model JoAnne Copeland, are shown after their marriage in August . 1963 at left, and Frank Gifford is seen at right in his NY Giants . uniform that same year . 'At one point, Johnny leaned against the wall and began to sob. Once we had our evidence, we whisked him out of the apartment as quickly as we could.' Described as being straight out of Mickey Spillane, Mullen's revelations contradict those of Frank Gifford's current wife, 'Today Show' presenter Kathie Lee Gifford. The morning talk show host said on Tuesday that her 83-year-old husband could not remember whether or not he had an affair with Johnny Carson's second wife, as Carson's friend alleged in a new tell-all book. The affair between former NFL star Gifford and Joanne Carson reportedly took place in 1970, while Gifford was married to his first wife Maxine. Still together: This is not the first time that infidelity has been an issue for the former NFL star as his marriage to Kathie Lee (seen together in April) was rocked in 1997 from an affair . Reading the news: Kathie Lee opened up about the issue during her portion of the Today Show on Tuesday . Gifford married Maxine, his college sweetheart, in 1952 and were together for 26 years which means that the alleged Carson affair would have come during that time. 'I got the call and Frank was still asleep and... (she said) ""Tell me, tell me! It was a long time ago. Did you have an affair with her?""' she recalled saying. 'I can't remember, maybe?' she said as her husband's response. 'No it's not true,' she followed up quickly. She was clear not to make total light of the claims, however, as she even threw in a jab about her husband's much publicized affair with a stewardess during their own marriage that was made public after it was revealed that the woman was paid by a tabloid to arrange the trysts. 'Although the man is capable of it as you know. It's not- he was friends with Joanne,' Kathie Lee said. Expressive: Kathie Lee made light of the alleged affair, saying that her husband can't remember . Co-host Hoda Kotb held up one of the local newspapers that had the story splayed across the front page where Gifford is pictured with his then-wife Maxine and Joanne Carson is pictured with her then-husband, famed Tonight Show host Johnny. Kotb mentioned that she thought that was Joanne in both pictures, and Kathie Lee was quick to note the similarities. 'She does look a little like Joanne doesn't she?' she said. 'It's never a dull moment in our house!' The news of the alleged Gifford-Carson affair broke on Monday when Carson's friend Henry Bushkin released an excerpt of his tell-all book where he details how he and Johnny broke into a secret apartment that Joanne was leasing without his knowledge. Loved Across The Nation: In this undated photo provided by NBC, Johnny Carson begins an episode of the ""Tonight Show"" as ""Carnac, The Magnificent!"" Cheating past: Frank had two trysts with flight . attendant Suzen Johnson (left) in 1997 while he was married to Kathie . Lee (seen here in 2000) 'I have reason to believe my wife is cheating on me,' Carson reportedly told Bushkin. 'I also have an idea who the son of a b**** is that she's shacking up with.' When they arrived at the apartment and saw six or seven framed photos of Gifford, who was also on television as a frequent commenter for Monday Night Football, Carson began to cry. Now 70-years-old, Bushkin's revelatory tale is just one of many he recounts in his memoir, 'Johnny Carson', that charts the 18-years he worked for the comedian as his lawyer, wingman, fixer and closest confidant and hits bookshelves on October 15th. Gifford's well-publicized infidelities of the past add some semblance of credibility to the claims, as his affair with flight attendant Suzen Johnson in 1997 was splashed across New York City papers throughout the ordeal. It came after he and Kathie Lee touted the strength of their marriage in infomercials for a marriage counselor and after they both told different versions of their personal histories in their respective biographies. According to a 1997 article in People Magazine, Frank wrote about his cheating past but said that his third wife, Kathie Lee, cured him of that. 'I get along great with women, but there's no sexual undercurrent anymore,' he wrote in his 1994 biography. Kathie Lee made light of his lady-killer past, saying that his sole indiscretion 'was the time he sleepwalked in the nude and wound up in the nanny's bedroom'.","New York private investigator Joe Mullen claims Johnny Carson's second wife Joanne did have an affair with ex-NFL star Frank Gifford .

A mother's admission that she only bathes her three-month-old son once a week - if that - has sparked a fierce parenting debate. Part-time blogger Claire Goss, 32, from Ashland, MA, made the candid statement on Babble in a post titled 'Do You Actually Need to Bathe Baby', prompting fellow users to brand her 'lazy' and 'gross'. Today, the mother-of-three defended her parenting, telling ABC News: 'I aim for once a week. It might not happen. I will confess, it has gone longer than a week. . . It can be a good 10 days, but if you met my baby and held him, you'd probably think he smells as amazing as I do.' Too busy: Mother-of-three Claire Goss has admitted that she only bathes her three-month-old son Charlie once a week - if that. Fellow parents are now divided on whether she is right or wrong . Mrs Goss says that a bath every evening was a routine with her first child, now five, but since then she finds she no longer has the time. 'My first baby got her daily baths, sometimes two bathes a day,' she said. But when her pediatrician warned her that her second child's skin was getting dried out from too many baths, she eased up. Now baby Charlie's nighttime routine involves a diaper change, and washing his hands and face. 'In my gut I don't think he needs it,' she said. 'He is a happy baby, he is a healthy baby. . . What I realized now after five years of parenting children is, he's not a dirty kid, he's a baby.' New routine: Mrs Goss says that her first child was bathed every night, but when her pediatrician warned her that her second child's skin was getting dried out from too many baths, she eased up . But while a nightly bath may not be essential for babies, it seems fellow parents are loathe to leave it as long as Mrs Goss. Nina Postans, from Brooklyn, NY, says she bathes her three-month-old, Madeleine, every day as part of a bedtime ritual. 'In my gut I don't think he needs more frequent baths. He is a happy baby, he is a healthy baby' 'They are at a crucial age where they need to establish a sleep routine and having a nightly bath (water is fine - you don't need to use soap all the time!) is part of this,' she told MailOnline. 'Most babies actually enjoy being bathed plus it's ultra soothing for them. 'Babies also drool a lot at 3 months so if you're not washing their neck creases every day you're in for a delightful funky smell!' she added. But fellow mother-of-one MaryBeth Long, from Westchester, NY, found that twice a week was best for her daughter, Kyra. 'Pre-crawling I probably bathed my . daughter twice a week because greasy hair isn't cute on anyone,' she . said. 'Now that she's a toddler I bathe her every other day since she's . an avid fan of rolling in the dirt.' Mother knows best: Mrs Goss says that every mom has the best gut instincts about their own baby, and that little Charlie smells 'amazing' Psychologist and mother Stephanie Manes tells MailOnline that a potential risk in passing up bath time is that the infant may be losing out on a powerful moment of maternal connection. 'The . bathing ritual can play an important developmental role for a child in . that it offers a powerful opportunity for mother infant bonding,' she . says. 'Ideally, the bath is a time for physical closeness along with . face to face contact when the mom can follow her baby's gaze - . experiences that foster healthy attachment.' The American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents to bathe babies at least three times a week, but acknowledges that 'too much bathing can decrease babies' natural bacteria count and make them more susceptible to infections and . rash.' 'We've . learned now that baby skin is very different than adult skin,' Dr Alan . Greene, a California-based pediatrician, told ABC News. 'Really, you want to . watch your baby more than watching the calendar when deciding to give a . bath.' And Mrs Goss echoes this: 'Mothers know their babies,' she said. 'They have gut feelings about their babies, and I would never presume to tell you how often to bathe your baby.'","Part-time blogger Claire Goss, 32, from Ashland, MA, says she is too busy to give baby Charlie a nighttime bath .

"By . M L Nestel . PUBLISHED: . 05:55 EST, 11 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:22 EST, 11 October 2013 . The parents of a nine-year-old boy who sneaked onto a plane from Minneapolis to Las Vegas never filed a missing persons report with the police and his father gave up looking for him to go to work, MailOnline has learned. The boy’s parents have said he vanished while taking out the trash last Thursday. The boy sneaked out of his home in the morning, got on a train to the airport, dodged all security, embarked the Delta Flight at 11.15am and after a three hour flight made headlines around the world. But MailOnline has learned it was the police - not his parents - who filed the missing persons report and only when they were called by Las Vegas police after the boy had arrived there. Scroll down for video . 'Good parents': V.J. Smith, right, who appeared alongside the boy's hooded father at a bizarre press conference, claimed to MailOnline that the boy's mother and father 'did everything good parents do' The parents only learned where their son was on October 4, when officers from the Minneapolis Police Department came to their door at around 5.30pm to tell them their son was 1,600 miles away in Nevada. A family friend told MailOnline that the parents thought they needed to wait for 48 hours before informing authorities that their son had vanished. He added that they 'thought he must be somewhere'. ‘The information they got was they needed to wait 48 hours before you call the police,’ family friend and anti-violence advocate V.J. Smith, who is representing the family told MailOnline. ‘So they were going by certain rules and they thought he must be somewhere.’ But a missing child of such a young age would have been a top priority, cops said today. ‘With a 9-year-old that would be a fairly substantial priority for us,’ Sgt. William Palmer, a Minneapolis Police Department spokesman said. He said the search could even call for the best investigators to solve the case. Mystery: The boy vanished after taking out the trash and the family 'thought he must be somewhere' so the father, above, went to work . ‘We might even bring in a lot of officers and knock doors and in some cases we might involve some of our homicide investigators.’ It has also emerged that the boy’s father gave up looking for his son on the Thursday, and hoped he was just with friends. He went to work at a local bus company. ‘They were hoping he was at a friend’s house,’ Smith said. ‘And they were calling around and they didn’t know.’ Smith insists his mom called in sick from her job at the airport so she could search for him. ‘He [dad] was at work and she took the day off and began to look. So they really did do their best to be good parents.’ It has also emerged that the boy was at home because he’d been suspended from school for fighting with another student. The apparently relaxed attitude of the parents to where the child was is particularly alarming because just 48 hours before he boarded the flight he had stolen a truck and crashed it into a police cruiser after a short chase. The boy's father said they his son had thought he was playing video game 'Grand Theft Auto'. His father has admitted that his son's outlandish behavior has included truancies and slipping passed an entry gate at a local theme park, and was escalating even as young as five-years-old. Troubled youth: It has emerged that the boy stole this truck and crashed it after a short police chase just two days before his cross-country jaunt . String of dramas: The truck incident happened just two days before the boy boarded the flight to Las Vegas . Troublesome: As well as stealing the car, the boy also has a history of playing truant and sneaking into a local water park without paying entry . At a press conference yesterday, in which he hid his face in a hoodie and baseball cap, he sobbed as he said he had asked the authorities for help with the boy on countless occasions but had got none. He even blamed the airport for his son’s behaviour, railing at the lack of security that allowed his boy to go through three sets of checks unchallenged before getting on the plane. The minor was eventually rumbled by cabin crew – but only when he was 40,000ft in the air. The boy is expected to be reunited with his family on Friday when he is flown back from Las Vegas and Smith said his group would help provide them with mentoring. Leaving: The runaway boy flew to Las Vegas from Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport on a Delta plane like this one, pictured. It was only discovered mid-air that he had no ticket . Smith said:  ‘They are going to get him back. Yeah of course they want him back. They do. 'The parents are going to get some help. A lot of folks in this community are stepping up to make sure that they get the assistance they need. ‘It's sad because I just had a gentleman come by my office and say “same thing happened to me, my son's in prison now. I don't know when he'll get out. I reached. I called. Nobody listened.  Now he's in prison. I just want to embrace this family. ‘They're getting the help now. But it's sad it had to come to this - him jumping on a plane for that to happen. But they're going to be okay and we're going to make sure that we get around this family.’ His siblings - an infant and teenage daughter - have remained in the custody of the boy’s family. The parents have also been paid visits by Janine Moore, who works for the county’s Human Services and Public Health Department. In all, the family have had four child assessments carried out on them. In an email titled ‘private data’ dated from last December, Moore described the boy to fellow administrators as ‘challenging’, The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. Destination: Las Vegas McCarran International Airport, with the 'Strip' in the background. The nine-year-old flew here from Minneapolis without a ticket . Moore added that there ‘was a pattern of behaviour’ and that the kid couldn’t be trusted. ‘Typically, staff can tell if a child is lying, but with this child they are unsure what is going on. This is a two-parent home, and there is at least one other child.’ In her memo, Moore wrote that the boy's future could go two ways. If he's been mistreated, he could be removed from his home. If he has a mental health issue, there could be a 'behavioral health response,' which she didn't explain.","Family friend tells MailOnline that parents never called the police when their son, 9, went missing for at least seven hours .

A teacher at a Los Angeles-area high school is on paid leave as administrators investigate her profanity-laden outburst in class this week. That outburst happened Wednesday at the new Humanities and Art (HArts) Academy, located on the Narbonne High School campus in Harbor City. The teacher was being heckled by a student in the middle of the lesson when she broke down. Scroll down for video . Teacher tirade: A teacher at the Humanities and Art Academy is on paid leave as administrators investigate a viral audio recording of her cussing at students in her class . Careful what you say: The outburst happened at the Humanities and Art Academy, a new school located on the campus of Narbonne High School in Harbor City, California . 'I know my f****** shit. Don't f*** with that. I'm tired of trying to educate you and you guys resist every step of the f****** way. Get the f*** out of here.' The student heckler recorded the outburst, and it has since went viral online. The unidentified teacher in question was placed on paid leave, and has since issued an apology in the Daily Breeze. 'You know, I had a weak moment,' she said. 'Forgive me.' The teacher explained that she was in the middle of a lecture about how the term 'African-American' can be a misnomer when a student started heckling her. She says that though her family traces its roots back to Italy, she doesn't call herself an 'Italian-American'. 'You're an American first,' she said. But the student who started heckling her insisted that she was wrong. When the teacher broke down, that student recorded the outburst and shared it with another teacher who encouraged her to keep spreading it. 'This girl took my moment of weakness and used it against me,' she said. 'And then the teacher (at Narbonne) egged (the student) on to send it to her, and then they disseminated it. It's just cruel. The teacher also explained that she was stressed out because of health issues and recently underwent an appendectomy. Warning: A school district representative said that usually teachers are issued with a 'notice of unsatisfactory act' for such behavior . 'I’ve always felt safe with my students,' she said. 'That’s why it hurts so much that someone would do this.' Ellen Morgan, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Unified School District said they are continuing to investigate the incident. 'At the outcome of the investigation, he/she will meet with the individual and conference, reprimand and/or move to recommend dismissal,' Ms Morgan said in an email to the Daily Breeze. Morgan said that usually in these cases, a teacher would receive a 'notice of unsatisfactory act' for the behavior. The outburst has caused a mixed reaction among the high school's students and their parents. 'I think the teacher should get fired for talking to the student that way,' Narbonne junior Carla Mateo told NBC Los Angles. 'They're not supposed to react like that no matter what the situation was.' Aaron Taylor, another student, said it was wrong that the teacher cussed but noted that other students egg on the teachers. Sympathetic: Student Aaron Taylor said that while the cussing was wrong, he understands why she did it because students can often egg teachers on . 'She's a good teacher. Everybody makes mistakes and she's only human,' he told KTLA. Parent Anton Georgis agrees. 'Why would a student heckle a teacher? They're there for an education if they can't understand that, the teacher should have went to the principal and the student should be taken to a lower grade to be re-educated,' Georgia said.","A teacher at the Humanities and Art Academy in Harbor City, California was placed on paid leave this week for cussing at students in her class .

Despite reports that flesh-eating krokodil is spreading across the U.S., a drugs watchdog is refusing to recognise it as a serious threat to America. Fears that the drug could head to the United States have been rife since 2011, when a Drug Enforcement Administration official said the agency was aware of its use overseas. But even with a drug treatment physician publicly announcing medics have now treated four users within the U.S., the DEA has said it is not ready to recognize it as an immediate threat. Scroll down for video . This Russian man is suffering the side-effects of Krokodil use. Doctors say there are users of the drug in Chicago just weeks after first known cases in U.S. were reported in Arizona . This man's ankle (left) shows symptoms of gangrene and another individual's fingers are rotting away (both cases are from Russia). Doctors fear an epidemic of the cheap heroin substitute in the U.S. Agency spokeswoman Dawn Dearden told FoxNews.com: 'We, the DEA, are not seeing cases of it. Nothing’s been turned into any of our labs. As far as the DEA is concerned, we have not seen any cases.' The announcement comes after a worrying wave of some victims injecting themselves with krokodil because they think it is heroin, doctors said. The first instances of its use in the U.S. were recorded in Arizona last month. It is already widely used in Russia. Three cases have now been reported in Chicago and doctors say two of . the women did not even know they had been sold the drug. The victims were all aged between 18 and 25 and come from middle class backgrounds. Krokodil, whose medical name is desomorphine, has been called a 'moonshine drug' because addicts are often able to cook the narcotic at home. Mixing the substance can leave traces of toxins in the final product which addicts then inject. Pictures and videos of users in . Russia show blackened fingertips, large open wounds, and even exposed . bone where skin has fallen off. Prolonged or even short-term use can damage blood vessels, muscle, cartilage, and bone, and amputation is frequently the . only way to save a patient’s life. Doctors . have warned of the horrifying side effects of the homemade drug, which . is said to give a more powerful high than heroin and is much cheaper to . produce. The . flesh rotting that is specific to the drug occurs directly at the . injection site, often leaving users with wounds to their feet or arms. It is created using a mixture of codeine and gasoline or oil and then filtered before being injected into the user's body. It . is called Krokodil because it leave addicts with reptilian-like skin. Dr . Abhin Singla said he instantly recognized the smell of rotting flesh at . Presence St Joseph Medical Center in Chicago and realized krokodil use . had arrived in the city. Dr . Singla, the hospital's director of addiction services, told Joliet.Patch he was surprised at how quickly krokodil use had spread from . Arizona. He said: 'If you want to kill yourself, this is the way to do it.' Rabid use of the drug in Russia has caused up to 2.5 million people to register and seek treatment as addicts. The average life span for a user is only two to three years. 'When drug users do it repeatedly, the skin sloughs. It causes hardening of their skin. It will cause necrosis,' explained Dr Frank LoVecchio. Dr. Frank LoVecchio at Banner's Poison Control Center says he believes the two cases found in Arizona to be the start of a problem in the United States . He added two patients had arrived at hospital asking for help to . wean themselves off heroin without realizing they had actually been . injecting themselves with krokodil. Dr Singla said he hoped warnings about the drug would spread through word of mouth among . addicts. He told the website: 'The goriness of the pictures of rotting arms . and legs are hard to look at, but I think parents really need to share . them with their kids.' Krokodil's, medical name is desomorphine and is created by mixing codeine with gasoline, paint thinner, hydrochloric acid, iodine and red phosphorous.There are reportedly nearly three million users in Russia and the epidemic began in Siberia and the Russian Far East.The drug causes flesh to rot from the inside out and the addict's skin becomes scaly, like a crocodile's, hence the name. Blood vessels burst and the surrounding tissue dies. Gangrene and amputations are a common result and sometimes bone can be exposed.The drug high lasts around an hour and a half. It is three times cheaper to produce than heroin. Last month, Banner's Poison Control Center in Arizona . encountered the drug when two addicts arrived in emergency rooms with . their flesh hanging off their body, exposing bone. 'We've . had two cases this past week that have occurred in Arizona,' said Dr LoVecchio, the co-medical director at Banner's Poison Control . Center to KPHO.Com. 'As . far as I know, these are the first cases in the United States that are . reported. So we're extremely frightened,' he continued. Dr LoVechhio . said the two cases he encountered are most likely linked and . he declined to comment on the appearance of the two users. 'Where there is smoke there is fire, and we're afraid there are going to be more and more cases,' he said. Prevalent in Siberia and the Russian Far East, the explosion of users first began in 2002. The numbers of Russians using the drug is thought to have trebled over the past five years. In 2011 alone, Russia's Federal Drug Control Service confiscated 65 million doses.","Three young women treated in hospital for effects of krokodil use .

A woman who tracked down her long-lost brother more than 12 years after they were separated has discovered he was living just 30 miles away. Julia Mauer, who lives in Lochbuie, Colorado, started searching for her brother, Isaiah Luke, five years ago but was unaware she had got his date of birth details wrong. Miss Mauer posted a picture of herself holding a sign appealing for help on Facebook and within hours it had gone viral and been shared more than 2,000 times across the site. By Wednesday night, she had located her brother and discovered he had been living just 30 miles away in Aurora, Colorado, for the last decade. Fulfilment: Julia Mauer (pictured) said she 'almost passed out' when she realized she had found her long-lost brother on Facebook. She had been searching for him for five years but it was only when she posted this picture on the social networking site that someone got in touch to tell her she had been searching with the wrong year of birth . 'I've never felt this happy, this sort of fulfillment, and closure of the past in my entire life,' a tearful Miss Mauer told ABC News today. 'It's tears of joy. It's also a new beginning. I have part of my family back, I have part of myself back.' Miss Mauer, 24, says she hasn't met her 19-year-old brother in person yet but they are now friends on Facebook. 'He accepted my friend request on Facebook and I've been stalking him,' She said. 'He's so handsome and so tall.' She remembers his bright blue eyes and added, 'I miss seeing those eyes.' Miss Mauer, who is now a manager at a medical center and also owns beauty firms Julia's Wraps and Rhinestones, remembers growing up with parents who suffered from substance abuse and were physically and verbally abusive. Child Protection Services had to intervene and Miss Mauer, along with her twin sister, Isaiah and their youngest sister Sarah were removed from their home. Sharing one mother but different fathers, Miss Mauer's paternal grandmother was granted custody of the twins, while Isaiah and Sarah were temporarily placed with their paternal grandmother. Miss Mauer was 12 and her brother was seven. ""I looked high and low... I always found dead ends but I had this draw to find him."" - Julia Mauer . 'Their father kept on coming back and was physically abusive,' Miss Mauer recalls, so Isaiah and Sarah were put into foster care. They were later adopted and they lost contact. 'Growing up there weren't a lot of great things, but he was such a light in my life,' Miss Mauer says of her brother. 'When he was born, we had something to care for.' Miss Mauer had been searching for her brother for years. She scoured Facebook and went as far as looking up athletic rosters and high school online yearbooks to find him. She said 'I looked high and low, searched his name a million times on Facebook thinking of any way I could possibly find him. 'I always found dead ends but I had this draw to find him.' She decided it was time to take it to the public. On Tuesday afternoon, Miss Mauer posted a Facebook selfie and a sign that displays all the information she knows of her baby brother. Along with the post, she included a blurb urging people to share her story, to tell people of her 'little brother named Isaiah Luke who has been missing from my life for the past 12 and a half years.' 'I was sitting here and something just told me to do it,' Miss Mauer said. When she woke up Wednesday, the post had been shared 2,000 times. She said she was overwhelmed with the outpouring of love and support from the Facebook community. Overwhelmed: Miss Mauer said she had a lot of love and support from the Facebook community. After a woman got in touch through Facebook to tell her she thought her brother had adopted Isaiah, she typed his named into Facebook and started crying as she recognized him . 'I just started crying,' Miss Mauer said, 'I was so happy, I couldn't believe it.' Two Colorado TV stations also saw her post and interviewed her about the search. Those stories prompted a woman to contact her through Facebook to tell her that her brother had adopted a boy that matched her description except that he was born in December 1993 and not 1994. Miss Mauer typed in the last name of the adoptive family and what she saw has convinced her that she has found her brother: his photo, the blue eyes and the middle name of Luke. 'I literally almost passed out,' she said.","Julia Mauer started searching for her brother five years ago .

Canadian police said on Thursday that a violent, high-risk sex offender who has been missing for more than a week has been located in the United States, but he can’t be arrested because he’s not wanted on any charges in the U.S. Edmonton Detective Chris Hayduk said U.S. border officials were warned that Michael Sean Stanley might try to cross into their country, but Stanley still managed to make it through at Blaine, Washington, south of Vancouver, on Monday night. 'We have no authority to go get him,' Hayduk said. 'We are investigating his crossing, taking a look at the details of his crossing, into the United States. 'For us, it would have been the best outcome to have caught him prior to that, so for him to be in the States is a concern that those agencies are going to follow up for sure.' Pedophile: Michael Sean Stanley is a violent, high-risk sex offender who has been missing for more than a week and is on the run in the U.S. but cannot be arrested because he is not wanted here . The Canada Border Services Agency referred calls on the matter to U.S. officials. The Washington-based spokesman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was not returning phone messages because of the federal government shutdown and an email seeking comment wasn’t immediately answered. The media contact for the Seattle office of U.S. Customs and Border Protection is not available because of the furloughs due to the government shutdown. A secondary phone number based in D.C. had a full voicemail inbox. Washington State Patrol spokesman Dan Coon said with no warrant, troopers and other local officers can’t arrest Stanley. Dangerous: Stanley has a long history of sexual offenses against women and children and has been missing since October 1 . 'That’s the issue, unless he does something to make us arrest him,' he said, adding 'The question is how he got through the border.' Coon said troopers had not had any contact with Stanley, but couldn’t speak to county and local authorities. Stanley has a long history of sexual offenses against women and children and has been missing since October 1 when the electronic monitoring bracelet he was wearing was cut off and found in Lloydminster, on the Alberta-Saskatchewan boundary. Last week, schools in several west-central Saskatchewan communities locked their doors and kept children inside after police got multiple, unconfirmed sightings of the Edmonton man. He’s wanted in Canada on charges of breach of recognizance and mischief and driving offenses, but he isn’t wanted in the United States, so Hayduk said police have no authority to arrest him. 'The extradition process — we are still exploring those options,' he said. Hayduk said officers do know Stanley’s specific whereabouts, but he wouldn’t release those details. 'We can take some comfort that police know where he is and will be taking the appropriate steps to ensure the communities remain safe.' Hayduk said there is no evidence that Stanley has re-offended while he has remained elusive. 'At this point it looks like he was just fleeing from us,”' he said. Stanley was released from jail in April 2011 after completing a 32-month sentence for assault and forcible confinement. He was being monitored by police under a peace bond, which authorities can get to impose conditions on individuals in the community. His peace bond has 20 conditions, including one ordering him to stay away from children.","Michael Sean Stanley last seen October 1 .

A math teacher and cross-country coach at an elite New Jersey boarding school has killed himself on the same day investigators went to the campus to look into allegations of sex between a teacher and student. Donovan Dickson, 24, an apparently popular teacher at Peddie School in Hightstown, plunged to his death from the New York side of the George Washington Bridge last Friday morning. Authorities refused to say whether or not he was the target of the investigation by police and county detectives and would not say if the two incidents were connected. Suicide: Donovan Dickson, pictured with some of his students, has jumped to his death. It occurred the same day police went to the school to investigate reports of sex between a student and teacher . No charges have been filed in the case, a spokeswoman for the Mercer County Prosecutor's Office told The Times of Trenton. No charges means that the teacher cannot be identified. Detectives had gone to the private school, which teaches around 500 students, on Friday to look at the possibility of bringing criminal charges against a teacher.

'The broad outlines of those events are known; the details I cannot discuss,' he said simply. He also spoke about two meetings he had had with students since Dickson's passing. 'At the first, I spoke to our students . about the ways in which people grieve,' he wrote. 'At the second I . emphasized that their safety and well-being are always our top priority.

Grieving families of fallen troops will receive compensation despite the government shutdown, president Obama assured as he signed the benefits guarantee into law today. Relatives of soldiers lost in battle since closing of federal government on October 1st were outraged when Pentagon suspended the roughly $100,000 payments. Obama signed the bill securing the payments into law after it won final passage in the Senate earlier on Thursday. Pentagon promises: President Barack Obama signed a bill securing payments to families of fallen troops during the government shutdown . Among those relieved are the families of Sergeant Patrick Hawkins, 25, Private First Class Cody Patterson, 24, Lieutenant. Jennifer Moreno, 25, and Special Agent Joseph Peters, 24, who all died from an explosive device this past weekend, and the families of 25 other active-duty service members who lost their lives during the 11 days of the shutdown. Initially the familes were told that there would be no 'death benefits' payments, typically $100,000 paid out within three days of a service member's death. while the federal government was on ice. The new bill reinstates benefits for surviving family members, including funeral and burial expenses, and death gratuity payments. However Obama's chief spokesman, Jay . Carney, had said the measure was unnecessary because a military charity . had stepped in to continue the payments. Sad sight: Pfc. Cody Patterson's body was brought back to the United States after being killed in Afghanistan on October 6, when his family was told the benefits payout was at risk . Respect: The Pentagon has now agreed to pay the charity back after the shutdown is lifted and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was at Dover Air Force Base when Patterson's body arrived . The Pentagon had said the lapse in . funding meant it had no authority to continue the payments, but that . explanation that did not sit well with members of Congress in either . party. The Pentagon . said a law allowing members of the military to be paid during the . shutdown did not cover the death benefit payments. Congress passed and . Obama signed that measure into law before the shutdown began, and . lawmakers insisted the benefits shouldn't have been affected. The . House voted unanimously on Wednesday for a resolution that would ensure . that death benefits to families of fallen troops will be disbursed . during the government shutdown. In . stepped the Fisher House Foundation, which Defense Secretary Chuck . Hagel said Wednesday would cover the costs during the shutdown. Hagel said the Pentagon would reimburse the foundation after the . shutdown ends. The government could not actively solicit funds from . private organizations but could accept an offer. The . administration said Thursday night that the Pentagon's agreement with . Fisher House would remain intact to make sure the benefits are delivered . without further interruption until officials can get the program up and . running again. Victims twice over: The relatives of Sgt Patrick . Hawkins (left) and 1st Lt Jennifer Moreno (right) were initially denied . survivors benefits from the military because of the federal shutdown . The bill is the second ‘piecemeal’ measure Obama has signed to hold the military harmless during the shutdown. At the same time, the White House has threatened vetoes of other ‘piecemeal’ measures passed by the Republican-controlled House to continue funding for certain government operations. The White House has said the House should reopen the entire government and not choose to fund some agencies and programs over others. Obama also supports House-passed legislation to provide back pay for thousands of federal workers forced off the job because of the shutdown. Across the Capitol, Republicans on a House Armed Services panel excoriated Pentagon comptroller Robert Hale, accusing him of playing politics with his interpretation of the original law. They said the law was designed to pay the death benefits as well as keep all Defense Department civilians on the job — not to select the most essential. ‘You went out of your way to make this as ugly as possible, to inflict as much pain as possible on this department,’ said Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo., who introduced the first bill days before the shutdown in an attempt to exempt the military. Hale responded that the law was poorly written and there never should have been a shutdown in the first place. ‘I resent your remarks,’ the budget chief said. ‘I acted on the advice of attorneys and our best reading of a loosely worded law.’","Families of fallen troops will receiving benefits during shutdown .

'I was given directions to pose with the shoes and, honestly, five-inch heels on a 10-inch bench in 90-degree weather - you know, I didn't want to do it. 'It's upsetting to me that I was a part of that. It's really upsetting because I loved my visit to India, and I would love nothing more than to go back, even in the near future.'

Most young men would be haunted for life by the sight of their mother having sex - the last thing they would want is a picture of it. But for Leigh Ledare that image was such an inspiration that he decided to capture it on camera for the world to see in a series of photographs that Sigmund Freud himself could only have dreamed of. The American artist has now sent shock waves through the art world after his collection explicit images of his mother, Tina, cavorting naked with an array of younger men was showcased as part of a new exhibition in London. The New York-based photographer, 36, is showcasing the controversial series, many of which are too graphic to publish on this website, in a bid to redefine the perceived boundaries between mother and son. Mother of art: This image is one of the less graphic pictures in the series, Pretend You're Actually Alive, and shows artist Leigh Ledare in bed with his mother, Tina . In . one, the middle-aged woman stares confidently into the camera as she . removes her underwear, her legs spread wide in a pose that leaves little . to the imagination. Another shows her laughing in bed as she cavorts naked with a younger lover to whom she appears to have tied herself with a belt. Meanwhile, others need little explanation beyond their titles, such as the provocatively-named 'Mom Spread with Lamp' and 'Mom F***ing in Mirror'. Asked by The Guardian if he ever gets turned on when taking such pictures of his mother, the artist replied ambiguously: 'I don't know what to say.' 'I think already in the background there were some foggy boundary issues. What people talk about as being Oedipal – there's a flirtation with that, but the boundaries were never actually crossed,' he said. He says he gained inspiration for the series after returning home for Christmas one year to be greeted by his mother in a most unusual manner. Ambiguous: When asked if he ever gets turned on when taking such pictures of his mother, New York-based Ledare (pictured) replied ambiguously, 'I don't know what to say' 'I arrived home not having seen her for a year and a half,' he recalls. 'She knew I was coming and opened the door naked.' He said when he then entered the house and caught a glimpse into her bedroom, 'a young man, almost exactly my age, was sprawled out naked. He rolled over to see me, saying hello, before rolling back over and returning to sleep.' 'I had a camera and began making photos of her then,' he added. 'She was the catalyst.' The exhibition also includes extracts from his own adolescent diary entries; ads Tina placed in the Seattle Weekly for 'a generous, wealthy husband (not someone else's) who wants his own private dancer'; as well as descriptions of her fraught relationship with her sons and former husband. As a teenager, Tina was a ballet prodigy, who danced for the New York City Ballet Company, but turned to stripping when her career ended prematurely. For seven years, Ledare has been photographing her in her most intimate acts and attitudes, exploiting her need for recognition and her boundless and exhibitionist attitude. The pictures will be showcased in an exhibition The Home Truths: Photography, Motherhood and Identity – at the Photographers' Gallery in London .","Leigh Ledare pictured mother Tina for series, Pretend You're Actually Alive .

A grieving father has been run over and killed during an attempt to walk across America in a campaign against homophobic bullying after his gay son took his own life earlier this year. Joe Bell was struck by a truck in eastern Colorado on Wednesday evening as he walked along the shoulder of a highway. The 48-year-old from Oregon began his 5,000-mile walk in April to raise awareness about gay rights after the death of his 15-year-old son Jadin in January. Double tragedy: Joe Bell was hit by a car as he walked across the U.S. in memory of his son Jadin . Bullied: Jadin died in hospital after attempting to take his own life in January . Truck driver Kenneth Raven has been cited with careless driving resulting in death, and police believe he may have fallen asleep at the wheel, the Gay Star News reported. On the Joe's Walk for Change Facebook page, a post announced Mr Bell's death and paid tribute to the father who had been speaking at schools and clubs across the U.S. about homophobic bullying. He had been due to talk to a youth group . in Hugo, Colorado, on the night he was killed. A few hours before his . death, Mr Bell posted a picture of a road sign on Facebook with the caption: 'Making . headway, one step at a time.' The organizer of the Facebook page later announced his death, saying: ‘I am very sad to have to announce that our friend Joe Bell was hit and struck by a semi while on his walk last night.' ‘He will continue his journey now with Jadin,’ the spokesman, named only as Ann, added. Mr Bell's son suffered brain damage after attempting to hang himself at a La Grande school on January 19. Tribute: Joe Bell began a campaign against homophobia after Jadin's death . Support: Jadin's father decided to embark on the walk as a way to deal with his grief . He was kept on life support for a few days, before Mr Bell and Jadin's mother Lola Lathrop agreed to end treatment after doctors registered little brain activity. The 15-year-old student had been the victim of relentless bullying in school and on social media sites because of his sexuality. 'He was different, and they tend to pick on the different ones,' family friend Bud Hill told KOMO News at the time. Mr Bell, who has another son and a daughter, came up with the idea for the two-year walk after struggling to come to terms with Jadin's death. He told OPB he was left with a feeling of emptiness but needed to get through it so he could be there for Jadin's siblings. Change: Joe Bell had been on his way to talk about bullying when he was hit by a truck . 'So I decided I needed to walk across the United States,' he said. He began his walk in Oregon in April, traveling up to 25 miles a day as he raised awareness for Faces for Change, the anti-bullying foundation set up in Jadin's memory, according to the Huffington Post. 'We need to stop this bullying - it starts in our households, how we raise our children,' Mr Bell said at the time. 'We need to educate our school systems on how to deal with it; they don't know how to deal with the problem.' Loss: Friends and supporters who met Joe on his walk have paid tribute to the father . Those he met on the walk left tributes to Mr Bell on Facebook, thanking him for his 'life-changing legacy' and offering sympathy to the family. At one stop on his journey, Mr Bell told a youth group about when Jadin first told them he was gay, the Denver Post reported. 'My son didn't choose to be gay. My son was different at a very young age,' Mr Bell had told the group. 'He told his family he was gay because he knew they would accept him. I hugged him and kissed him on the cheek every day. I was proud of him.'","Joe Bell was on his way to give a talk about bullying when he was run over .

If you are faced with a dirty floor but don't have the energy to clean it, Japanese company Sugoi might just have the solution you've been searching for. The RC Sugoi Mop works like a regular mop but is operated by remote control, which means you can clean the floor from the comfort of your sofa. Amazingly, the robo-mob, which comes in colourful canary yellow plastic, costs just £19 - similar to traditional mops and far less than high-tech steam versions. Scroll down for video . Dream clean for lazy people: The RC Sugoi Mop is remote controlled and lets you clean the floor from the comfort of your sofa . For those with a smaller space to clean, the mop also comes in a mini version for £18, available in a choice of pink, purple, orange, green and black. And if one remote controlled kitchen gadget isn't enough to satisfy your technological cravings, the company also makes a remote controlled dustbin - seen zooming around like a mini R2D2 in Sugoi's promotional video. Bizarre though the mop might seem, it's not the first automatic floor cleaning product on the market. Robotic vacuum cleaners, that zoom around a room cleaning a floor at the touch of a button, have been around for years. Although they have not taken off to replace the traditional vacuum, the makers of the robo-mop have not been deterred. The invention is arguably more useful than other gadgets that have come from of Japan in recent years. The country is famous for its technological creations, among them the 'crisp picker-upper' immortalised by An Idiot Abroad star Karl Pilkington during an episode set in Japan. Colourful: Sugoi's time saving gizmo also comes in an £18 mini version that works similarly to the original . Other wacky inventions include the Ear Wax Camera, a tiny camcorder designed to be inserted into the ear to check for wax deposits and the Slim Mouth Piece intended to reduce the size of your mouth. For beauty conscious women with a shaky hand, there's the lipstick mask, which, when laid over the mouth, acts as a template for clumsy lipstick fans. More useful, particularly for those living in the UK and Republic of Ireland, is the full body umbrella which combines a brolly with a tube of clear PVC that extends to the feet - ideal for driving rain. Less so are the odd Pee and Poo dolls - designed to resemble the contents of your toilet - and the unwieldy Swiss Army shovel, which combines a spade with a rake, clippers and a pickaxe. And action!

Last . week, the school said its own research concluded they are not required . by the Koran to wear beards, and it is therefore a personal choice to do . so. Around a third of . the 750 pupils at Mount Carmel are from ethnic minorities, mostly . Pakistani, according to the 2012 Ofsted report. A . relative of one of the boys said last week: 'Because these boys cannot . shave their beards for religious reasons, they are being put in . isolation for six-and-a-half hours every day. 'They are not being allowed to mix with anybody or speak to friends. It is pure discrimination. 'They . chose that school because it is within their area and has good results. The school has to have an open policy and they have to take in people . from all religions.' She said the youngsters were put in a room on their own and made to study without the rest of their classmates. She . also said their parents sent the school a letter of complaint . explaining they could not shave as their beards were symbols of their . faith. The letter was later . retracted to allow for talks between the families, teachers and the . Lancashire Council of Mosques, the relative said. Mr Bowers said the rule had been in . place for a while, but had been strictly enforced from the beginning of . the new term, after letters explaining there would be no exceptions were . sent out. 'Because these boys cannot shave . their beards for religious reasons, they are being put in isolation for . six-and-a-half hours every day. They are not being allowed to mix with anybody or speak to friends. It is pure discrimination' - A relative of one of the boys . He said: 'The rule in school is that all boys have to be clean shaven. 'Having . said that, there were two Year 11 boys last year who had grown a beard . and because it was months or weeks before their GCSE exams, I spoke to . the two boys, who explained that on religious grounds, they wanted to . keep their beards. 'I felt it was an unfair pressure to bear on them and I agreed to an exception. 'On . the back of that, I made arrangements to speak to a number of other . Asian boys who were also sporting beards to make them aware there would . not be any further exceptions and, when they came back after the summer, . they were expected to be clean-shaven. All but two did. 'Children . who turn up to school with red hair, inappropriate jewellery, false tan . or make-up are isolated in a room until the matter is addressed and . then they return to their normal day. 'These boys were given the option to do that and chose not to.' Tonight, in a statement the school said: 'Governors at Mount Carmel have decided that there will be no change to the school rule which requires boys to be clean shaven. 'However, following discussions with leaders of the local community, exemptions will be made in certain clearly-defined circumstances. The school has said the pupils are breaching the dress code, which bans beards as well as false nails, fake tan, make-up, dyed hair and inappropriate jewellery (file picture) 'As a voluntary aided Catholic school, governors are the employers and legitimately set their own rules regarding uniform and appearance. 'The rule regarding boys being clean shaven is reasonable and proportional and has been in place for some time. All parents and children are fully aware and accepting of school rules. 'The rule is part of the school standards agenda along with hair style, hair colour, jewellery and make up ensuring high expectations for all pupils and that their appearance is standardised. 'The school is advised that it is part of Muslim tradition and religious belief that a beard is a sign of commitment to the Islamic faith but it is ultimately down to personal belief. 'In line with European Human Rights legislation, governors have taken the decision to only allow Muslim boys permission to grow a beard as a sign of their faith' - Statement from Mount Carmel tonight . 'Having said all that as governors of voluntary aided schools we have to comply to the European Convention of Human Rights, as do all schools. 'As part of this legislation all schools must make reasonable adjustments to school uniform on genuine religious grounds. 'The Bishop of Salford’s advice has been for governors of Mount Carmel to work with the local Islamic leaders to support boys who are genuinely and fully committed to their faith. 'With this in mind, and in line with European Human Rights legislation, governors have taken the decision to only allow Muslim boys permission to grow a beard as a sign of their faith as long as they have started the Hafiz programme at their local Mosques. 'Hafiz is an extensive programme that involves attending Mosque for 2-3 hours a day to pray and learn the Koran word by word in Arabic.' Welcoming the decision, County Councillor Munsif Dad said: 'I’m very glad that we are moving in the right direction and I’d like to thank the headteacher and governors for their understanding and co-operation. 'Mount Carmel is an excellent school in our local community - we have always supported it and will continue to do so. 'Understandably, this has aroused some interest, but we hope we can continue the dialogue and address the issues as they arise. 'Regards this issue, we hope the school can continue the important job of providing excellent education to its students.' The . issue of whether beards are compulsory for devout Muslims is open to . interpretation, according to Professor Muhammad Abdel Haleem, of the . School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London. Growing debate: Last month David Cameron weighed in on the debate about religious dress code in schools . He . said the Prophet Muhammad was believed to have had a beard and that men . insisting on doing the same claimed they were emulating his actions. Mr Bowers said the issue was not one of religion, but of upholding school rules. He . said: 'We have not taken this decision lightly. I have spent quite a . lot of time researching the issue and speaking to Muslim elders. 'There . is nothing specifically written in the Koran about wearing a beard. It . is a choice those boys are making. However inclusive we are, we have . standards to maintain.' Chairman of governors Dennis Ford said: 'The decision to uphold the rule was made by governors and it is a rule for everybody.' Abdul . Hamid Quereshi, chairman of the Lancashire Council of Mosques, said: . 'The headteacher is co-operating and the school wants to learn about the . issue and address them appropriately. 'Different people have different variations of understanding. 'Some are newly interacting with the Muslim community and it is our duty not to put people in awkward positions.' Last . month the Prime Minister indicated he would support guidelines to . judges, teachers and immigration officers telling them when Muslim women . can be asked to remove their veils.","Lancashire school told to honour European Convention of Human Rights .

Conman: Richard Pearson stole £3,000 from a pensioner claiming he knew of a miracle fix for intolerable condition, tinnitus . A conman preyed on a vulnerable pensioner stealing £3,000 by spinning the lie that he knew a miracle fix for an incurable medical condition. Devious Richard Pearson discovered his 73-year-old victim suffered from tinnitus - a persistent and debilitating ringing in the ears - during a chance meeting on a bus in Sunderland. The conniving 53-year-old convinced his victim he knew of a clinic that could cure the intolerable condition. Days later Pearson claimed to have arranged an appointment at a centre in Birmingham, making sure his elderly victim was present when he posted a £3,000 cheque on the pensioner's behalf - 'secure' the alternative treatment. He then persuaded his victim to pay the £3,000 back in cash, escorting the pensioner to the building society to ensure he got his hands on the money. Pearson made the scam appear more believable by telling the tinnitus sufferer he had previously been cured by the clinic. In addition he gave him a £3,000 cheque as 'compensation' in case things went wrong. But when Pearson backed out of his offer to give the pensioner a lift to his appointment, concerns grew and the unsuspecting victim discovered the promise of a cure had been a cruel con, and that the clinic never actually existed. The £3,000 compensation cheque bounced when the pensioner tried to cash it, in a bid to get his money back. Prosecutor Mark Guiliani told Newcastle Crown Court: 'It was totally disgraceful conduct, targeting a vulnerable man. 'There is no cure but the clinic, he said, offered alternative treatment, the victim no doubt having been told by his doctor it was an incurable condition one learns to live with. 'He is a confidence trickster, the offending against a 73-year-old man was particularly sophisticated. Pearson, from Sunderland, was handed a suspended prison sentence after Recorder Euan Duff said he hoped the fraudster, who is setting up a landscaping business, would repay the money . 'The clinic, despite efforts by the police to locate it, does not exist.' The court heard the case had previously been adjourned after Pearson promised to repay the money back to his victim. But Mr Guiliani said: 'Not a penny has been forthcoming.' The cruel con took place just weeks after Pearson cost a hire company more than £4,000 by failing to return a petrol lawn mower, mini-digger, strimmer and concrete breaker he had leased. The machinery was never recovered after Pearson claimed they had 'been lost'. Pearson, of Hendon Dock, Sunderland, was sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for two years, and ordered to pay the victim’s £3,000 back to him within the next 12 months. He had admitted theft and fraud charges. Mr Recorder Euan Duff said: 'This offence was a particularly unpleasant and a particularly mean offence, targeting this man in this way. 'It was a quite determined effort, you pursuing him, going to his home and getting the money in that way.' The judge said the sentence could be suspended 'with a good deal of hesitation' to allow Pearson, who claims to be setting up a landscaping business, to pay the money back. He told Pearson: 'You are extremely fortunate to be leaving the court today.' Lewis Kerr, defending, said 'disgraceful' was an appropriate word for the offence, which he had not pre-planned, and said Pearson is a former business owner who is hoping to start afresh. Mr Kerr said: 'He had never met the victim, there was nothing more than a chance encounter, an opportunity the defendant seized and pursued, with some determination, I accept.'","Cruel conman claimed he had been cured of the intolerable condition .

A former cheerleading captain at a suburban Minneapolis high school was sentenced today to three years in prison for prostituting a younger squad member and keeping the money for herself. Montia Parker, 18, of Minnesota, previously pleaded guilty to three prostitution-related counts. She was immediately ordered into custody, and must spend at least two years behind bars before she's eligible for release. She must also register as a sex offender. Female pimp: 18-year-old Montia Parker, left and right, will serve at least two years in prison before being eligible for release . 'You were the leader of an attempted . high school prostitution ring,' Hennepin County District Court Judge . William Koch said at the sentencing hearing. 'And you did it all for a . pair of sneakers.' Parker . admitted that last March she told a 16-year-old fellow cheerleader at . Hopkins High School that the girl could earn money through prostitution. After the younger . girl agreed, Parker placed an ad for her online, then took her to an . apartment where the girl was paid to perform oral sex. The girl gave $60 . to Parker, who kept the money. The . next day, Parker drove the girl to another apartment, but the girl . didn't do what the man asked her to do - vaginal sex - and offered oral . sex instead. The client declined and no money was exchanged. The . victim's sister told Koch that Parker manipulated a girl with a . learning disability, and that she had trusted Parker whom she considered . a friend. Skipping classes: The crime was reported when the victim's mother was notified about unexcused absences and read the text message conversations between the two girls . She asked the judge to make an example of Parker, saying her sister's life had been destroyed. Her sister has since isolated herself, switched schools, and quit cheerleading, she said. Prosecutor . Joshua Larson asked that Parker be sentenced to up to five years in . prison, saying Parker was the'""instigator, designer, manager and CEO of . pimping this child.' Parker's . attorney, Leon Trawick, argued for time in the workhouse and probation, . saying his client was an honor student with no criminal history and a . bright future ahead of her. Parker apologized in a letter to the judge, which was not read in court. But Koch said the crimes demanded time in prison, calling her actions peer pressure of the worst kind. 'This took planning. It took preparation. It took follow through,' Koch said. It . was revealed in court that Parker had become familiar with online sex . ads after a former boyfriend tried to pressure her into selling herself . for sex. Koch said that because of that, Parker should have known better and should have protected the victim instead of exploiting her. The victim's family left the courtroom without saying anything. Parker's family declined comment. According to the criminal complaint, Parker posed as the girl's mother and took her out of school. The . girl's mother called police after she noticed changes in her daughter's . behavior and checked the girl's cellphone, finding messages between . Parker and the girl. Hopkins .

The director of the shelter apologized for the error, but it is not the first time Hillsborough County Animal Services has made a fatal error. In the latest case, one-year-old German Shepherd JoJo was waiting for his new owners to arrive when staff mistakenly put him down on Tuesday. Fatal error: JoJo the German Shepherd was put down as he waited for his new owners to collect him . The error was described as 'regrettable' by the shelter, which cares for about 20,000 animals each year. In an official statement the shelter said: 'Sadly, JoJo had been selected for adoption and was to be picked up by his new family later that day ... a combination of human errors may have been the cause of JoJo’s euthanization.' The staff responsible for the tragic error have be reassigned at the shelter as an investigation into how an adopted dog came to be put down is carried out. 'It looks like the file was not cleared . for euthanasia but the procedure was done,' Hillsborough . County Animal Services director Ian Hallet said told Fox 13. He said the family had visited the shelter to adopt a puppy, but fell in love with JoJo. After the dog was accidentally put down Mr Hallett contacted them personally and says they still plan to rescue a dog from Hillsborough. Danielle Yoho, who was in the process of adopting two dogs from the shelter, told Fox 13: 'This is their last chance, this is . their last stop you can't make a mistake.' Apology: Shelter director Ian Hallett says the staff responsible have been reassigned . She added: 'There needs to be a triple and quadruple check.

In April last year and mixed dog named Zeus, who had been adopted, was accidentally euthanized only an hour after arriving at the shelter. The shelter has also been criticized over illness at the shelter, including a recent outbreak of Parvovirus, a contagious and potentially fatal dog disease, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Mistake: JoJo is not the first adopted dog to have been accidentally euthanized . A protest is being organized outside the shelter on October 19, with a combined drive to bring in donations of blankets and toys for the animals to help the facility. Mr Hallett was brought in as director last year to implement changes at the shelter and try to reduce its high kill rate. About 12,000 animals a year are euthanized at the center. Since taking over he has extended the center's opening hours to allow more potential adopters to visit the animals being held there.","Rescue dog wasn't the first to be put down after being adopted at Florida center .

While he would like a boy, or boys, Miss Menkhausen would love to have a boy and girl, because it would be 'the best of both worlds'. On September 24 she was filmed by Today under anesthesia, as eggs were harvested from her ovaries by ultrasound guidance at St. Luke's Hospital, Missouri. NBC's Dr. Nancy Snyderman said from inside the operating room: 'Right now Dr Sherman Silber is inserting a micro needle with a little suction into the ovary and each of these black sacks you see really houses an egg. They're being sucked out and being examined behind us.' IVF process: The 33-year-old is seen in the operating theater as 'good embryos' are transferred into her uterus .

'enlighten other women who are having the same challenges.' 'I know that the next three months are a . very critical time period for the pregnancy, so no more fast food for . me' 'It’s also a form of . self-enlightenment - sharing my story is helping me deal with some of my . own fears, by courageously facing them head on.'

It sounds harmless enough, but just as the United States Postal Service was about to release a series of stamps encouraging kids to keep active, it's decided to cancel the lot for fear they may end up taking the blame for youngsters hurting themselves. The stamps were created to commemorate Michelle Obama’s 'Let’s Move!' program and although the children are seen to be having fun, they’re engaged in unsafe activities or not wearing protective gear. Activites: U.S. Postal Service hoped to raise awareness about the importance of physical activity in achieving a healthy lifestyle . Unsafe: Whilst is may be fun, a Cannonball dive could be unsafe . Dangerous: A headstand without a helmet . Asking for trouble: Skateboarding without kneepads . 'The stamps are on hold with the printer and we have not made a decision at this point, right now, with respect to how we are going to move forward,' a USPS spokesman told the website. According to a report from Linn’s Stamp News, the President’s Council on Fitness Sports and Nutrition and the first lady’s Let’s Move campaign raised concerns about three of the 15 the stamps in the series. Ideas: U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama developed the Let's Move Program to solve the epidemic of childhood obesity within a generation . The two White House entities had concerns over stamps with a man doing a cannonball into a swimming pool, a skateboarder not wearing kneepads, and a child doing a handstand without a helmet. The unsafe depictions came to light after USPS Marketing chief Nagisa Manabe asked Michelle Obama to take part in a first day ceremony for the stamps . That was apparently the first time the stamps had been reviewed by the Sports Council. The series is set to be destroyed, but a final decision won't be made until sometime next year. On track: The initiative has the initially stated goal of 'solving the challenge of childhood obesity within a generation so that children born today will reach adulthood at a healthy weight'","USPS destroys stamps, concerned they show kids doing unsafe activities .

He solved one of the biggest mysteries in the universe, but nobody knew the whereabouts of Peter Higgs - the scientist who first predicted the existence of the ‘God particle’ - at the time when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences could not raise him on the phone before making the announcement, and said he had gone ‘into hiding’. But now the famous physicist has revealed that he found out that he had won the award when a woman stopped to congratulate him in the street. Professor Higgs said a former neighbour got out of her car in Edinburgh as he was returning from lunch and told him the good news. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences couldn't contact Peter Higgs (pictured) on the phone before making the Nobel announcement and said he had gone ¿into hiding¿. But speaking at the University of Edinburgh, Professor Higgs said a former neighbour got out of her car in Edinburgh to tell him the good news . Speaking at a press conference at the University of Edinburgh, Professor Higgs said: 'She congratulated me on the news and I said ""Oh, what news?"" 'She told me her daughter phoned from London to alert her to the fact I had got this prize. I heard more about it obviously when I got home and started reading the messages.' Professor Higgs was recognised by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for his work on the theory of the particle which shares his name, the Higgs boson. The existence of the so-called 'God . particle,' said to give matter its substance or mass, was proved 50 . years on by a team from Cern, the European nuclear research facility in . Geneva, Switzerland, in 2012. Colleagues . had told journalists that the self-effacing 84-year-old, who has not . been well lately, had gone hiking in the Scottish Highlands to avoid the . ‘storm’ of interest at the time the prize was announced. Finally proved: Professor Higgs wiped away a tear as scientists at the Large Hadron Collider first claimed to have discovered the Higgs boson. But the 84-year-old went hiking in the Scottish Highlands to avoid the 'storm' of interest in the Nobel Prize . Born in Newcastle in 1929, the son of a BBC sound engineer, Peter Higgs was a gifted pupil at Bristol’s Cotham Grammar where he won many prizes – although none for physics. He chose to study at King’s College London, after rejecting Oxford and Cambridge as the choice of the ‘idle rich’, and gained a first-class honours degree in 1950. He was a young lecturer at Edinburgh University in 1964 when he dreamed up the particle that would make him famous. Along with two other groups of scientists who were working independently, he came up with an explanation of how the most basic building blocks of the universe gain mass. The theory states that the cosmos is pervaded by an invisible field that confers mass on particles as they pass through it. Unlike the other scientists of the time, Professor Higgs also forecast the field was made up of countless tiny particles – Higgs bosons, or God particles. The theory was not universally accepted and one of his papers was rejected for publication because it was ‘of no obvious relevance to physics’. But by the 1980s, the hunt for the Higgs boson was on in earnest and last year, almost 50 years after Professor Higgs predicted its existence, scientists at the Large Hadron Collider found it. Giving his reaction to receiving the prize for the first time, at the university where as a young lecturer in 1964, he dreamed up the particle that would make him famous, he said: 'How do I feel? Well, obviously I’m delighted and rather relieved in a sense that it’s all over. It’s been a long time coming.' An old friend told him he had been nominated as far back as 1980, he explained. Professor Higgs said he had been having lunch in Leith in the Scottish capital when the announcement was made on Tuesday. Describing the low-key way he learned of the prize, he told the assembled press he was walking up Heriot Row in the New Town when the former neighbour spoke to him. But there will be a champagne celebration with family this evening. 'There was a celebration with a group of us last night after a lecture by Frank Close - that was a start,' he said. 'I shall be celebrating with my family with the help of a bottle or two of champagne early this evening. 'It hasn’t been possible to get us all together before that.' Professor Higgs, who shares this . year’s prize with Francois Englert of Belgium, joins the ranks of past . Nobel winners including Marie Curie and Albert Einstein. The 84-year-old is an emeritus professor at the University of Edinburgh. The . Higgs-Englert award recognises the 'theoretical discovery of a . mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of . subatomic particles'. That mechanism predicted the existence of the Higgs boson, which enables particles to acquire mass. Its discovery is of huge significance to . the theory that enables scientists to understand the physical universe, . known as the Standard Model of Physics. Professor Higgs (pictured right), who shares this year's prize with Francois Englert of Belgium (left), joins the ranks of past Nobel winners including Marie Curie and Albert Einstein. The 84-year-old is an emeritus professor at the University of Edinburgh . Professor Higgs established the concept of the 'God particle' while working as a lecturer in 1964. He wrote two scientific papers on his theory and was eventually published in the Physical Review Letters journal, sparking a hunt for the elusive particle. Other researchers, including Professor . Englert, were also working separately on the same idea as Professor . Higgs and published papers around the same time. Large Hadron Collider: The magnet core of the world's largest superconducting solenoid magnet in Cern . A . new particle 'consistent' with the Higgs boson was discovered last year . by a team at the Large Hadron Collider at Cern, the European . Organisation for Nuclear Research, near Geneva. Professor . Higgs said he celebrated on the return flight from Cern last year with a . bottle of London Pride beer, which he was presented with during today’s . press conference. He said: 'I think I face the immediate . future with some foreboding because having experienced the wave of . attention which followed the announcement at Cern in July 2012, I . anticipated that this last announcement will trigger an order of . magnitude of more attention. 'I think I am going to have difficulty in the next few months having any of my life to myself. 'I should remind you that although only two of us have shared this prize, Francois Englert of Brussels and myself, that the work in 1964 involved three groups of people, (including) two in Brussels. 'Unfortunately Robert Brout died a few years ago so is no longer able to be awarded the prize, but he would certainly have been one of the winners if he had still be alive. 'But there were three others who also contributed and it is already difficult to allocate the credit amongst the theorists. 'Although a lot of people seem to think I did all this single-handed, it was actually part of a theoretical programme which had been started in 1960.' Professor Higgs was made a Companion of Honour in the New Year Honours list and the Higgs Prize has been set up by the Scottish Government to recognise school pupils who excel in physics. He was joined at today’s event by Edinburgh University principal Professor Sir Timothy O’Shea and Dr Victoria Martin, a reader in the School of Physics and Astronomy who works with Cern and is a former student of Prof Higgs.","Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences .

Labour former home and foreign secretary Jack Straw has accused the Guardian of 'indulgent irresponsibility' Condemnation of the Guardian for publishing top-secret files intensified yesterday as Jack Straw accused the paper of ‘indulgent irresponsibility’. In a devastating indictment, the Labour former home and foreign secretary said it had developed a ‘sense of power and almost adolescent excitement’ from holding thousands of classified intelligence documents. As a result, its journalists - whom he accused of ‘extraordinary naivety and arrogance’ - were ‘blinding themselves about the consequence’ of putting the material in the public domain. Mr Straw’s criticisms are among the most damning yet about the Guardian’s printing of US and UK government secrets stolen by fugitive National Security Agency worker Edward Snowden. They are especially potent coming from a former Labour cabinet minister whose tenure in government included lengthy periods overseeing the work of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. The newspaper continues to insist it will carry on publishing the secrets and yesterday its front page claimed there would be a ‘review’ of surveillance powers initiated by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. But yesterday morning Downing Street dismissed the suggestion outright, with a spokesman for the Prime Minister endorsing the current system of oversight and saying: ‘There is not a Government review.’ Mr Clegg’s aides quickly distanced themselves from the Guardian’s story, saying he was simply ‘posing the question’ about oversight of the security and intelligence agencies. Meanwhile, other former senior intelligence and security officials lined up to condemn the newspaper and issue further warnings about the damage done by Mr Snowden’s theft of the documents, which are thought to be in the hands of the Russian government. Sir David Omand, the former head of GCHQ, the Government’s listening station, said the Guardian, and others in possession of the leaked files, had published information that was invaluable to foreign spies, terrorists and criminal networks. He said it was the ‘most catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever’, eclipsing even the leaks by the Cambridge Five, the ring of spies including Kim Philby and Guy Burgess, who were turned by the Soviets. Last week, before the row exploded, Sir David told BBC’s Newsnight: ‘Not even the KGB in its heyday of Philby, Burgess and [Donald] Maclean could have dreamt of acquiring 58,000 highly classified intelligence documents. Mr Straw's criticisms are among the most damning yet about the Guardian's printing of US and UK government secrets stolen by fugitive National Security Agency worker Edward Snowden (pictured) ‘My fear is that we are now going to witness a slow motion car crash in which gradually sources dry up, targets such as terrorist and cyber criminals will work out what are the kind of capabilities that we have and they will adapt their methods. It will be harder to track them down.’ But it is Mr Straw’s comments – the first criticism from a senior Labour figure – that are the most incendiary. In an interview with BBC Sunday Politics Wales, to be broadcast tomorrow, Mr Straw said: ‘The head of the security service, MI5, has been absolutely right to say what he has said, and I regret what I can only describe as indulgent, irresponsibility by the Guardian newspaper. ‘You can always justify everything, if you’re a newspaper, on the grounds that this is open journalism, but this is about much more than journalism, it’s genuinely about how we protect the national interest. ‘And that’s not just about protecting the establishment, it’s about keeping people safe, it’s about avoiding another 7th of July 2005.’ Mr Straw said the publication had ‘potentially’ risked lives. He added: ‘I’m not suggesting for a moment that anybody at the Guardian gratuitously wants to risk anybody’s life. Sir David Omand said the Guardian had published information that was invaluable to foreign spies, terrorists and criminal networks . ‘But what I do think is their sense of power of having these secrets and excitement, almost adolescent excitement, about these secrets, has gone to their head and they’re blinding themselves about the consequence, and also showing an extraordinary naivety and arrogance in implying that they are in a position to judge whether or not particular secrets which they publish are or are not likely to damage the national interest. ‘And they’re not in any position at all to do that.’ Condemnation of the Guardian began on Tuesday when, in a major speech, the new MI5 director general Andrew Parker said revelations about GCHQ’s techniques were a ‘gift to terrorists’, and had given them the advantage they needed to ‘strike at will’. His comments were immediately backed by Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May and sparked calls for an inquiry into whether the Guardian should be prosecuted. Mr Clegg has lined up alongside the PM by saying the leaks ‘helped terrorists’. Nigel Inkster, the former director of operations and intelligence at MI6, said the leaked documents contained ‘an awful lot of operational detail... about ongoing activities which risk being compromised’. He told Radio 4’s World at One he understood there was a ‘real possibility’ that people could have been put at risk as a result of the leaks. Mr Inkster warned that terror groups would now be much more aware of GCHQ’s ‘vulnerabilities’ and assessing the damage would be difficult.","Jack Straw has accused the paper of 'indulgent irresponsibility'

The average in the state sector is only 16.8 per cent. The high-performing authorities with selective schools also included Southend-on-Sea in Essex and Torbay in Devon, which have some of the worst areas of deprivation in the UK. Seven of the top ten LEAs at GCSE also had grammar school places available to some or all of their pupils. They include Sutton in South London, where 75.9 per cent of pupils got five GCSEs at A* to C grade including English and maths, and Trafford with 72.4 per cent. They came behind the Isles of Scilly, which scored 86.4 per cent but has only one school providing education up to the age of 16 at different sites, and Kensington and Chelsea, on 79.6 per cent, which is the wealthiest LEA in the country. The average for state schools was 59 per cent. The information on the exam results of state schools in England was requested from the House of Commons Library by Tory MP Graham Brady, who resigned as a shadow minister for Europe in 2007 over David Cameron’s opposition to new grammar schools. Mr Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, said: ‘The tables show that selective and partially selective authorities tend to perform better than comprehensive ones and can help social mobility by getting state school pupils into the best universities and professions. The information on the exam results of state schools in England was requested from the House of Commons Library by Tory MP Graham Brady . ‘We should remove the restrictions imposed by the previous Labour government and allow communities to have selective schools if they want them. ‘Some schools might wish to be partially selective in intake and others wholly selective grammar schools.’ Only 164 state-run grammar schools remain in England. A few areas retain a formal grammar school system, using the 11 Plus exam to select the most able pupils. These include Trafford and Buckinghamshire. The Conservative Party’s official line is that no new grammar schools are to be built, but some have been allowed to expand because of population growth. Despite the lack of political will, selective schools remain very popular with the public. Robert McCartney, of the National Grammar Schools Association, said research about five years ago showed England’s grammar schools had produced as many A and B grades at A-level as 1,500 comprehensives. ‘We have had two polls since 2010 which showed overwhelming demand for grammar schools,’ he said. ‘I think Cameron has bought into the idea that they are bastions of middle-class elitism – to which there is some truth but only because the places are so limited and competition so fierce that aspirational parents by and large are the ones who get places.’ The Department for Education declined to comment.","Reading, in Berkshire, was the best performing local education authority with 45.9 per cent of pupils gaining AAB or equivalent in sixth form exams .

A mother-of-two who advertized a $19,000 diamond ring on Craigslist has been lured hundreds of miles from her home by a man claiming he wanted to buy it before he robbed her, she has told police. Emily Graham, 32, said the man paid for her flight from Madison, Wisconsin to St Louis, Missouri for September 21, claiming he wanted to get the ring appraised and buy it for his wife. When she landed at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, a car service picked her up to take her to a jewelry store to meet the buyer - but instead, he took her to an abandoned warehouse, she said. Scam: Emily Graham, left, said a man flew her to St Louis after responding to her Craigslist ad for a $19,000 diamond ring - before he allegedly stole it. Police have released an image of a 'person of interest', right . 'The neighborhood was really shady,' she told the St Louis Post-Dispatch. 'He pulled into the back of an abandoned warehouse and stopped the car, and someone was pounding on my window, saying, ""Stop the car"".' The man then demanded the ring, she said: 'It felt like an eternity, maybe 30 seconds, and I realized I've been scammed.' The driver pretended to act shocked and put his hands in the air but sat in the car while the suspect robbed her of the ring, her purse, her laptop, an iPhone, other jewelry and her shoes, she said. 'He could have killed me or raped me behind that warehouse,' she said. He hit her across the head with a pistol and forced her behind the building before leaving in the vehicle, an SUV, she said. She then ran to a nearby house for help and called police. Stolen: She said she wanted to sell the ring, pictured, to raise money as she went through a divorce . Berkeley Police Maj. Art Jackson told the Post-Dispatch that they are now checking nearby pawn shops for the items. He said the buyer had used a fake name in the correspondence and that the plane ticket had been bought with a stolen credit card. He said there was no doubt that the incident had occurred. 'We believe her,' Jackson said. 'She was in a very frantic state. Once the investigators started talking with her, they believed it did actually occur.' Victim: Graham, pictured wearing the ring, said she was taken to an abandoned building and robbed before the suspect drove off and left her there. She went to a home for help and called police . Graham, who works in website marketing, did not have the ring insured and after the robbery, she launched an online fundraising campaign to raise $30,000 to fund an after-school care program - which police said had raised some suspicions but that they weren't going to discount her story. She added that she needed the money from the ring, which she and her former husband bought and had appraised for $36,000 in 2007, because she was going through a divorce. Her husband, Jim Graham, 47, said he did not mind she had wanted to sell the ring, but that she was lucky to be alive after choosing to sell it as she had. He added that he supported her online fundraising efforts.","Emily Graham, 32, flew from Wisconsin to Missouri to meet with potential buyer who said he wanted to buy ring for his wife .

Alerted: Documents claim twod eaths could have been avoided had Andy Burnham's department taken action after he was alerted in January 2010 . Labour’s former health secretary was told about a string of baby deaths – despite his claims he did not remember any ‘specific’ warnings, it emerged last night. Andy Burnham said he did not recall being told about the problems at Furness General Hospital in Cumbria. But documents seen by the Mail show Mr Burnham was briefed about the problems in January 2010, three months before his regulator gave the hospital a clean bill of health. It is thought the lives of two babies might have been saved at Furness had action been taken by Mr Burnham after he was alerted. Mr Burnham was briefed on the scandal ahead of a meeting with local MP, Tim Farron, in January 2010. The memo he was given mentions five maternity, neonatal and gynaecological incidents including the death of baby Joshua Titcombe, who was killed in 2008 by an infection which should have been treated with antibiotics. It states that Joshua’s death ‘highlighted a number of underlying contributory factors’ at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which runs the hospital. Mr Burnham did not act on the information in the memo, which notes that the incident was being taken ‘very seriously’ and that the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and  Strategic Health Authority were monitoring the trust. Three months later, the CQC reduced its risk rating of the Trust to ‘green’ and registered it as compliant. A further two babies died after this decision. In July, Mr Burnham faced pressure to quit after a review by Sir Bruce Keogh revealed failings at 11 hospitals where ‘thousands’ of patients needlessly died on his watch. Last week, Mr Burnham was accused of trying to suppress a critical report into poor hygiene standards at the Basildon and Thurrock trust in Essex. Emails were released suggesting his department ordered the CQC not to release a report on the problems during the run-up to the 2010 general election. Mr Burnham has strongly denied the claims and has threatened Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt with legal action after he tweeted about the scandal.

Needless death: Joshua Titcombe with his sister Emily before he died in Furness General Hospital, Cumbria . In June, Mr Burnham denied that he had been warned about the Morecambe Bay scandal.

A Carnival cruise has been forced to fly passengers home after the ship experienced overflowing toilets and power outages just a month after a sister ship was stranded for five days in the Gulf of Mexico. Carnival announced on Thursday that guests are being flown off the island of St Maarten where the ship is moored. Passengers will be refunded for three days of the trip and get a 50 per cent discount on future voyages. The cruise ship, which has a capacity of 3,646 passengers and 1,367 crew, is docked at Phillipsburg in the Caribbean on the last leg of a seven-day cruise from Florida. Scroll down for videos . Trouble in paradise: The Carnival Dream, pictured on Thursday, is flying passengers back to the U.S. from St Maarten after it reported problems with its propulsion system leading to overflowing toilets . Vacation's over! Passengers were being flown out of the Caribbean after their seven-day trip was cut short by Carnival because of ship malfunctions . A Carnival spokesman told MailOnline on Thursday that no passengers had yet boarded flights but would be flown to Florida to collect their vehicles at the port or their home destination. There was no information on what would be happening to the crew on the crippled ship which had a mechanical issue with a diesel generator. Dream's captain alerted authorities of possible trouble with the ship's propulsion system on Wednesday, a U.S. Coast Guard spokeswoman in Miami said today. Several passengers told CNN that guests had been held on the boat despite the fact toilets were overflowing and unusable on Wednesday. Gregg . Stark, who is on vacation with his wife and two children, said 'human . waste' was sloshing on to the floors of some of the ship's bathrooms. He added: 'The elevators have not been working. They've been turning them on and off, on and off.' Other passengers said that crew had . announced over the tannoy system that generator problems would take an . hour to fix but that seven hours later, the unsavory situation remained. Lights out: The Carnival Dream appeared to have darkened decks on Thursday as passengers made their way to the airport to fly back to Florida . Back to reality: Thousands of passengers on the Carnival Dream are being flown back to Florida which takes around two hours . Trouble at sea: The Carnival Dream has reported problems with its propulsion system leading to overflowing toilets at port in St Maarten, Caribbean (stock image) The ship had been due to leave the Caribbean island at 5pm on Wednesday after making the trip from Port Canaveral. Passengers will now fly the two hours back to Florida on both commercial and private charter flights. Petty Officer Sabrina Laberdesque said the ship has functioning sewage and power systems, adding that officials are working to correct the problems. She said the Coast Guard is not involved because the ship is moored. Carnival shares fell 1.3 per cent on Thursday morning to $35.24 after the cruise cancellation was announced. The Carnival Dream has a technical issue with the ship’s back-up emergency diesel generator which our engineering team is currently working on. Yesterday, during regularly scheduled testing of the ship’s emergency diesel generator, a malfunction occurred. At no time did the ship lose power and the ship’s propulsion systems and primary power source was not impacted. The ship is at dock in St. Maarten. All guests are safe and comfortable. There were periodic interruptions to elevators and restroom services for a few hours last night. However, all hotel systems are functioning normally and have been functional since approximately 12.30am. While personnel continue to work on the technical issue we are making arrangements to fly all guests home via private charter flights and scheduled flights from St. Maarten. Guests on the current voyage will receive a refund equivalent to three days of the voyage and 50 percent off a future cruise. We are also cancelling the ship's next voyage which is scheduled to depart on Saturday, March 16. Guests scheduled to sail on this cruise will receive a full refund and 25 per cent off a future seven-day cruise. Guests who re-book will have their current rate protected on the future sailing.Additionally, any non-refundable transportation related expenses will be reimbursed. Yesterday was a scheduled port of call visit to St. Maarten. Guests were able to spend the full day in port and have the option of continuing to do so until their scheduled return home. All of the ship's activities and facilities are fully operational. We are very sorry for this disruption to our guests' vacation plans and extend our sincere apologies. We look forward to welcoming them back on another Carnival cruise. The Carnival Dream was on the last leg of a seven-day cruise and was docked in St. Maarten when the technical problem arose. The ship is based in Port Canaveral, Florida.

Several lawsuits have been launched against Carnival - but whether complainants will have any success is doubtful as the cruise company has a legal structure that shields it from big-money lawsuits.

They say the best way to a man's heart is through his stomach... and the old adage has certainly been proven true by one foodie couple. Stephanie Smith's boyfriend Eric loves her sandwiches so much he promised he'd propose marriage to her once she had made him 300. And with only 124 wraps, pittas, burgers and baguettes to go, she's getting pretty close. And Eric, who has been dating Stephanie for two years, can't go back on his word: the savvy Brooklyn-based writer has been chronicling her efforts in a colourful gastronomic blog, 300sandwiches, in which she provides daily recipes, witty anecdotes and tempting photographs of her creations. Stephanie Smith's blog 300sandwiches.com chronicles her bread-buttering tactic to get what she wants - marriage - by making her boyfriend Eric 300 sarnies . Now, more than halfway through her bread-based challenge, Stephanie has just revealed her previously secret identity, and disclosed that her time spent not making sarnies is actually spent as a reporter on the New York Post. Despite a telling-off by gossip website Gawker, who say Stephanie is 'deranged' and must have 'lost her goddamn mind' to be bowing to the stringent demands of her bossy boyfriend - he won't eat sliced avocado, broccoli, spinach, mushrooms, anything with the word 'sprouts' in it, cauliflower, raw tomatoes, peas, kale, blueberries, raisins or olives - Stephanie continues to defend her behaviour. Sandwich number 19, made on 18 August 18, was a prime rib steak ciabatta with caramelised onions and rocket . She says: 'Some might say the idea is sexist. I say come over for dinner, and watch E whip up roasted duck breast with a balsamic and currant sauce with a roasted parsnip puree and shaved pickled beets in no time, and you'll see who spends more time in the kitchen. Sandwich number 175 was fried green tomatoes with feta and pesto . 'Some say I’m just desperate to get engaged. Hardly. I don't have to be. E didn't say ""cook me 300 sandwiches or I’m leaving you"", he gave me a challenge - a dare, to some degree - and the type-A, Tracy Flick side of me can't stand being challenged. 'When I reach my 300th sandwich, I’ll have an arsenal of meals I can use for dinner, parties, picnics,  breakfast and desserts. 'And barring any major fights or infidelities, E and I will likely go all the way, buy that country house and have babies, so I'll need to know how to cook a variety of meals for my kids and house guests anyway.' Writing in the Post, Stephanie explained the reasons behind the challenge that has led to her spending the past few months whipping up lobster rolls, Vietnamese bánh mìs, pulled pork buns, smoked salmon and scrambled egg bagels, grilled cheese toasties, fried courgette and tomato on a pretzel roll, French toast with banana and strawberry jam and roast chicken with sweet potato mash clubs, all for her hungry beau. She said: 'Eric is the gourmet cook in our relationship, but he'd always want me to make him a sandwich. 'To him, sandwiches are like kisses or hugs. Or sex. ""Sandwiches are love,"" he says. ""Especially when you make them. You can't get a sandwich with love from the deli."" On her blog, Stephanie elaborates: 'I realised what it would take to get him to commit after the first time I made him a turkey on whole wheat bread, with mustard, lettuce and Swiss cheese. '""Honey, this is the best sandwich ever!"" he exclaimed in between bites so rapid in succession,  the sandwich was gone in minutes. And then, he dropped a bomb me: ""You’re, like, 300 sandwiches away from an engagement ring."" 'That was it - a proposal hinged on me making him sandwiches.' Stephanie provides recipes for each of her creations on her blog, as well as little anecdotes as to where the inspiration behind each sarnie came from . And so, each week, from Monday to Friday, Stephanie makes Eric a sandwich. She has even been known to make one for his breakfast, one for his lunch and one for his dinner. In order to speed things along. Some people were dubious about the scheme, particularly some of her single friends who believed the idea of slaving over a cold butter knife for the sake of a ring was deliriously old-fashioned and anti-feminist. One pal called her a 'Stepford wife', another said: 'It's not 1950! It's chauvinistic! He's saying, ""Cook for me, woman, and maybe I'll make you my wife.""' Some of the sandwiches made were savoury, but others - such as this 'throat-soothing' ice cream sandwich with Graham Crackers - were for times when a sweet sarnie was required . The problem Stephanie's own mother had with the idea was that her daughter cannot cook. Defending her light-hearted blog, Stephanie says: '300 Sandwiches tracks the journey between two people in love as they share experiences and emotions through food. 'The blog chronicles our adventures, arguments, holidays, special times and average days over the course of 300 sandwiches. 'I will learn how to cook amazing food, we will learn more about each other, and hopefully my boyfriend will make good on his promise.'","New York writer Stephanie Smith blogs at 300sandwiches.com .

A boy stranded 4,500 miles from home for more than a year because of his fear of flying has finally made it back to Britain. Joe Thompson, 12, walked on to a plane and flew home yesterday after being hypnotised. Joe and his father Tony had been forced to stay in the Middle East while the rest of their family came home to Britain because of his extreme phobia. Scroll down for video . Fear: Joe Thompson, 12, pictured left, was so scared of flying he had to be hypnotised on the plane . Trauma: Joe, who had been stuck in the UAE for 18 months because of his fear, received therapy from hypnotist Russell Hemmings, left, who helped him deal with his anxiety . Anxiety: The schoolboy, who first moved to Abu Dhabi in 2009, became incredibly tense at certain points before the flight and so was helped by the therapist . After landing at Heathrow yesterday, Joe said: ‘I’m so happy to be home. I can’t believe how cold it is here. ‘I just want to get home and see my dog. I haven’t seen him for two years and I want to give him a big hug.’ Joe . moved to Abu Dhabi with his parents four years ago. He had been a . confident flyer, but while in the United Arab Emirates, he developed a . deep fear of flying, which made him unable to board a plane. On board: The schoolboy, pictured while the plane is in flight, looks calm and happy thanks to his hypnotherapy . Finally home: Joe, centre, who was accompanied by the hypnotherapist, right, for the whole flight, hugs his father Tony, left, the moment his plane touches down at Heathrow . When . the family was due to return to Britain in June 2012, after his . father’s job as manager of a private hospital came to an end, Joe found . it impossible to fly. He was so terrified as he approached the departure gate he would slump to the floor sobbing with stomach cramps. Mr . Thompson, 62, an ex-aide to former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott, . said: ‘It just happened out of the blue and the fear is quite acute. He . was fine until he got to check-in and then he fell apart. ‘It was awful. He never talked about the plane crashing. He just said each time, “It’s the height”.’ Arrivals: Hypnotherapist Russell Hemmings, left, Joe Thompson, centre, and Tony Thompson, right arrived back in the UK in the early hours of the morning . Emotional: Joe is reunited with his mother Pauline who had to move back to the UK in May for work . Reunited: Joe with his sister Chloe, second left, and his mother and father after his successful flight . Stuck: Joe and his father Tony, pictured at their rented house in Al Ain, were trapped in the country for 18 months . There . was no income to support the family, so Joe’s mother Pauline, now 50, . was forced to return to the family home in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset . with her daughter Chloe, 18, leaving Joe and his father behind in Abu . Dhabi. The Thompsons say . they spent £40,000 on cancelled flights, on accommodation during their . extended stay and on treatments to try to cure Joe’s fear of flying. After . four attempts to get his son on a plane, Mr Thompson began planning an . alternative journey by car through Saudi Arabia to Jeddah, where they . would board a cargo ship to Europe, but they were blocked by visa . complications. After that Joe was treated by a number of specialists and psychiatrists without success. But . earlier this year hypnotherapist Russell Hemmings, a British ex-pat . living in the neighbouring emirate of Dubai, contacted the family and . offered to help. After three . months of treatment, Joe finally plucked up the courage to board a . Quantas flight from Dubai to Heathrow. Accompanied by Mr Hemmings and . his father, he held his nerve and touched down yesterday at 5.30am UK . time after a seven-and-a-half hour flight. Just before boarding Joe began hyperventilating, but he relaxed after Mr Hemmings went through some deep breathing techniques. He . then walked on to the plane with his father and the hypnotherapist. Joe . endured take-off by closing his eyes and meditating. During the flight, . he constantly watched films to distract himself. Alternative: Mr Thompson, a former aide to former deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, tried to arrange for his son to board a cargo ship home last year, the route which he would have taken pictured . Temporary: The father and son relax in their rented accomodation in Al Ain, UAE, a few days before flying . Mr Hemmings, who did not charge the Thompsons, said: ‘I used a combination of hypnosis and cognitive behavioural therapy. ‘Joe . started having a meltdown at the airport, but we worked through it. On . board I was able to calm him using hypnosis techniques. I had prepared . for this flight weeks ago during our therapy sessions, using the power . of hypnotic suggestion, meaning Joe already had the tools for success . deeply planted into his subconscious mind. He just wasn’t necessarily . aware of it. ‘Only in the . most extreme cases of flying phobia would an accompanied flight be . needed but Joe’s anxiety and panic was off the scale.

The prescribing of blood pressure drugs have also helped cause rates to plummet among older people - those most vulnerable to their devastating effects. Huge advances have been made in the treatment of patients with high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Professor Graham MacGregor, chairman of charity Blood Pressure UK, said stroke rates were plummeting 'throughout the UK' as a result of better treatments . Six million Britons take drugs to . lower their blood pressure, usually for life. In addition, more than . eight million take statins to reduce cholesterol levels - meaning these . are now the most widely prescribed drugs in Britain. Many older people have also heeded campaigns to have medical checks, and to make lifestyle changes such as cutting back on salt. As . a result, the incidence of strokes has dropped from 247 per 100,000 in . 1995 to 149.5 in 2010, according to researchers at King’s College . London. Professor Graham MacGregor, chairman of . charity Blood Pressure UK, said stroke rates were plummeting ‘throughout . the UK’ as a result of better treatments. ‘We’ve got better blood pressure drugs now and they are used more effectively,’ he said. ‘In the past GPs would prescribe one drug. ‘But we now know they work more effectively in combination, and they are often more acceptable to patients, with fewer side effects, so they take them and don’t leave them in the medicines cupboard. ‘Statins cut the risk of stroke by 30 to 40 per cent so they have also played a part, but we need to do more.’ He said the study demonstrated a huge proportion of strokes were preventable. ‘Every patient who ends up on a stroke ward is a sorry indictment of our failure to help prevent it,’ he said. Huge advances have been made in the treatment of patients with high cholesterol and high blood pressure . Dr Yanzhong Wang, lecturer in medical statistics at King’s College London and lead author of the research, said ‘This study on the trends in stroke is the most comprehensive in the UK. It shows a 40 per cent overall reduction of stroke over 16 years, which is good news.’ Strokes affect around 152,000 Britons each year, often triggered by high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels. Patients with hypertension – the medical term for high blood pressure  – are routinely advised to change their lifestyle and eat less salt, lose weight, drink less alcohol, eat more fruit and vegetables and exercise more. The study, published in the medical journal Stroke analysed records on 4,245 patients living in South London who had their first-ever stroke between 1995 and 2010. But the findings are likely to apply to the rest of the country, say researchers. Six million Britons take drugs to lower their blood pressure, usually for life. In addition, more than eight million take statins to reduce cholesterol levels - meaning these are now the most widely prescribed drugs in Britain . The rate fell in men, women, white groups and those aged more than 45. But it did not drop among those aged 15 to 44 years and black groups. ‘The reasons for this are not entirely clear but it could be because of a rise in diabetes and obesity in these groups,’ Dr Wang said. ‘If this trend is not reversed we could face a major public health concern because long-term disability, as a result of stroke, will put a strain on health and social care services.’ Researchers are calling for greater efforts to identify younger people at risk, including those with diabetes. Co-author Professor Tony Rudd said: ‘It is essential we begin to understand the reasons for the differences in incidence and how we can address them. Without this we are only going to see widening health inequalities amongst the UK population.’","Strokes have fallen by 40 per cent in just 16 years thanks to statins .

The husband who survived the brutal invasion of his home that left his wife and two daughters dead is now being courted by local Republican officials to run for office. Dr William Petit is known best for being the survivor of the 2007 home invasion that left his Cheshire house burnt and his wife and teenage daughters raped and killed by two men during a robbery gone awry. He has since gotten remarried and his new wife is pregnant with their first child together, and now he may be launching a political career. Next ambition: Dr William Petit Jr (seen here at a trial appearance in 2011) is considering a run for Congress . Earlier times: Petit's first wife Jennifer Hawke-Petit (center) and their daughters Micahela (top left) and Hayley (bottom left) were all killed in a 2007 home invasion . The local newspaper reports that he is being considered as a possible contender to challenge the sitting Democrat in the state's 5th Congressional district. 'He certainly has a lot of what people are looking for. He's got strong ideals and he's not afraid to stand up for them,' said Mike Clark, the Town Committee Chairman for Farmington. 'He's lived through hell and back. He's obviously got tremendous internal strength,' Mr Clark told The Hartford Courant. Mr Clark is not just basing his predictions on optics either as Dr Petit, who made his career as an endochrologist has been meeting with the state Republican Party chairman, Jerry Labriola. Mr Labriola has not denied their . meetings, saying that he has had 'informal discussions with prospective . candidates on a regular basis'. One . of the issues that apparently seems the most daunting to the would-be . first-time candidate is the schedule as he would have to start . campaigning and fundraising very soon in order to be competitive against .

Happy turn: In August of this year, the couple announced that they were expecting a baby . Ms Esty was elected in 2012, so she is only in her first term. He is no stranger to taking a stand and raising money, however, as the Petit Family Foundation that he established in honor of his slain wife and two daughters has accrued $1million that they then passed on to organizations working to support violence victims. And while it would be his first time running for office, he would not be entirely new to the prospect, as his father launched a failed bid for Senate. 'He'll have to take positions on topics he hasn't really thought a lot about before. … It's getting down to crunch time,' Mr Clark told The Courant. 'Until you do it, you don't realize how much groundwork has to be laid and how much money has to be raised ... it's a lot of dough.'","Dr William Petit Jr was the sole survivor of a 2007 home invasion where the two attackers sexually assaulted and killed his wife and daughters .

A woman whose leg muscles were shredded in the Boston bombing has shown extraordinary determination as she prepares to run a marathon this weekend. Lee Ann Yanni, 31, was standing 10 feet from the finish line with her husband Nick, 32, when the first of two homemade bombs detonated on April 15, killing three and injuring more than 270. Shrapnel shattered her fibula and tore her leg muscles - but just six months and three surgeries later, she will be taking part in Sunday's Chicago Marathon. 'I don't care if I have to walk, crawl or piggyback,' she told the Boston Herald. 'I'm not letting these fools take my first marathon away from me.' Fighter: Lee Ann Yanni's left leg was broken and her muscle was torn by shrapnel in the Boston marathon bombing in April. In an astonishing show of determination, she is running a marathon on Sunday . Yanni, who had to learn how to walk again after her devastating injuries, is running in memory of her father, who died of cancer this time last year. Although this is her first full marathon, before the April blast she had ran numerous road races and half marathons. She now hopes to finish the 26.2 mile race in about six hours. Even taking part in the race is an astonishing feat, considering less than six months ago she was in hospital for eight days after undergoing surgery. The blast caused blood to pour from her leg as shrapnel broke the bone in her left leg and lodged inside, and tore muscles. Her husband Nick escaped with just a pierced eardrum. Back out there: Yanni, a physical therapist, knows she will be running far slower but wants to complete it . Strong: She is running the Chicago Marathon in memory of her father, who died of cancer last year . 'It was a very large boom,' she said in an interview afterwards. 'It just sounded like fireworks. I felt something hit my leg. So I looked down and saw the bone sticking out, and being a physical therapist the first think I said to myself, ""That's not good"".' Her husband added: 'All of a sudden, it was like a cannon went off. And honest to God, at first, I didn’t think anything of it.

Target has released a Merida doll who, with her glossy, wavy hair and dainty features, looks more like a Barbie than the feisty Scottish princess from Pixar's Brave. The unrecognizable toy is being launched just days after Disney sparked controversy for giving Merida a 'sexy' make-over - a decision that was criticized in a 200,000-strong petition, prompting the company to remove the image from their website. In contrast to Merida's untamed curls and endearing looks in the movie, this new doll, part of Target's Ultimate . Disney Princess Collection, has a polished, styled haircut, disproportionately thin limbs and nondescript facial features that could seemingly belong to any other princess. Make-over: Target has launched a new Merida doll (right), whose glossy hair, tiny proportions and nondescript features are a far cry from the feisty Scottish princess in the Disney movie (left) Even the Target doll's baby blue dress is nothing like the real number she wears in the movie. Writer Laura Beck expressed her dismay at the doll: 'This . Merida is completely unrecognizable as anything other than a . conservatively dressed Barbie with a weird belt on,' she wrote on Jezebel. Other critics voiced their opinion that the new depiction of Merida is a bad role model for young Disney fans. 'This is really annoying,' wrote one woman of the new, thinner doll. 'This Merida is unrecognizable as anything other than a Barbie with a weird belt on' 'They wonder why girls end up freaking out about . their weight and looks starting at a young age!' It's not the first time a conventionally prettier depiction of the spunky heroine has caused an outcry. Merida made headlines earlier this month when Disney gave her a 'sexy' make-over in the lead-up to her 'coronation' as one of the 11 official Disney princesses. A picture of the updated princess on . Disney's website showed her with a smaller waist, bouncier curls and . higher cheekbones, a far cry from the frizzy mop of red hair and . authentic teenage looks she sports in the movie. Controversy: Merida made headlines earlier this month when Disney gave her a 'sexy' make-over (pictured) - with a smaller waist, bouncier curls and higher cheekbones . Not just a pretty face: Both the Disney and Target make-overs strip Merida of her unique red curls and fuller and more realistic body shape, as well as her trusty bow and arrow . A 200,000-strong petition called for Disney to revoke the 'sexist' make-over, which was seen as 'a tremendous disservice to . the millions of children for whom Merida is an empowering role model.' The original Merida, who rode through the Scottish Highlands shooting arrows with conviction, 'speaks to girls' capacity to be change agents in the world rather than just trophies to be admired,' stated the petition. Shortly after the petition was launched, Disney quietly removed the controversial picture from their website. However, executives at the company have since defended the make-over. Nondescript: The new doll is part of Target's Ultimate Disney Princess Collection, a line of seven dolls that all have similar facial features and can only be distinguished by their hair color and outfit . 'It's designed to match the look of the other Disney Princess characters - to make them all appear as if they stepped out of the same world instead of differing across decades of artistic styles,' explains a statement on Disney news website, InsideTheMagic. And Catherine Connors, editor in chief of Disney Interactive Family, explained on her blog: 'These are fancified depictions of Merida, not a new Merida. 'The gussied up Merida on the coronation invitation is Merida gussied up for one of the most important events of her princess career,' she continued.

A 69-year-old married Connecticut man accused of stockpiling an incredible arsenal of guns, ammunition and home-made bombs in his $1million mansion was arrested on Monday. No one yet knows what Joseph Callahan had in mind for more than 250 guns, tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition and explosive devices police say they found at his house in Fairfield. But yesterday Callahan, who has a chemistry background, was charged with 11 counts of illegal possession of explosives, six counts of first-degree reckless endangerment and one count of manufacturing bombs. On his LinkedIn page, Callahan says he is president of chemical company Remair. He also worked at gun manufacturer Remington Arms for nearly two decades. The Hartford Courant reported that local police and federal agents raided the five-bedroom property last week after a reported burglary. Instead, officers found 274 firearms, tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition and a large amount of hazardous materials on October 1. Authorities immediately closed down Bronson Road, where the home is located. It then took two days for experts to deal with the dangerous materials and make the area safe. No one was injured in the operation, which included agents from the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, alongside state and local police. Fairfield police chief Gary Macnamara described 'tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition strewn through the residence', as reported by Fox Connecticut. There were also scores of containers of highly explosive material stored at the large property at 1625 Bronson Road. Christopher Tracy, Fairfield's acting fire chief, said in a press release last Wednesday that 'a large amount of various chemicals' were found at the home.

The Courant reported that haz-mat professionals and fire department officers will remain on the scene until Callahan fully complies with the court order to dispose of the material. He is due in court in Bridgeport, Connecticut, on October 16.

An airline is facing tough questions after it sent a dismissive email to a journalist who had asked how it came to lose a woman's dog. In an email sent from one of Air Canada's spokesmen, the airline said there was no need to respond to press queries as it was 'just a local story'. The email, sent accidentally to the reporter who had asked for information, went on to criticize the media for asking about the missing dog during the government shutdown. Missing: Larry the Italian greyhound escaped when an Air Canada worker let him out of his travel crate . Dismissive: Air Canada accidentally sent an email to a journalist, which advised staff to ignore questions . CBS13 reporter Maria Medina had contacted the airline to ask how it came to lose an Italian greyhound called Larry, who was being rehomed in Canada. Instead of getting answers to why airline staff had opened the dog's crate, causing the tiny dog to escape, Ms Medina was sent an email from Air Canada's Peter Fitzpatrick criticizing the network for running the story. 'I think I would just ignore, it is . local news doing a story on a lost dog,' Mr Fitzpatrick wrote, according to CBS13. 'Their entire government is shut down and about to default and . this is how the U.S. media spends its time.' When the news channel showed the response to the dog's owner, Jutta Kulic, she wasn't surprised. '[I] wouldn’t expect anything different from a company that would allow something like this to happen,' she told CBC. Ms Kulic had arranged for Larry to be flown on the airline to a new home in Canada, after promising his original owner, who was dying, she would find a good home for him. When Larry was dropped off at San Francisco airport, she had zip-tied his crate closed and left instructions that he should not be allowed out unless in a contained space. But, when his flight was delayed earlier this week, an airline employee decided to let the two-year-old dog out. 'They called ... and told me one of their employees had decided to walk the dog,' Ms Kulic said. But Larry had been spooked and run away, with Air Canada workers unable to find him. Concern: Jutta Kulic had arranged for the dog to be flown to new owners in Canada . On Friday Air Canada responded to the loss of the dog - and the email about it - in an official statement. 'Air Canada acknowledges inappropriate . comments were made to a reporter’s follow-up questions regarding Larry. Air Canada has been providing the best available information to media on . this matter. However, these comments do not refer to the search for .

Santa Barara corner's officials have confirmed that an 18-year-old Cal Poly student whose body was discovered on the beach six months ago died from a blunt-force trauma injury sustained falling from a 60-foot cliff. Sociology student Giselle Ayala, 18, traveled to Isla Vista, California for 'Deltopia' - the annual Spring Break party organized by University of California, Santa Barbara students and attended by thousands each year. Ayala's body was discovered on April 6 on the beach by a jogger, the morning after a booze-fueled Friday night party. Tragic fall: Coroners confirmed this week that 18-year-old Cal Poly student Giselle Ayala died last April due to blunt-force trauma sustained in a fall from a cliff during a Spring Break party in Isla Vista, California . The student wasn't reported missing until Saturday evening. The last time her friends saw her was 11pm Friday night, when they say she left to go use the restroom. By the time they reported her missing at 7pm, on Saturday, officials were in the midst of trying to identify the body they had been discovered at 8:20am. The body on the beach was described as a 5ft 8 woman, wearing a purple sundress and black lace-up boots. College tradition: Ayala had traveled to Isla Vista with friends to attend the annual 'Deltopia' Spring Break party which attracts thousands of students every year . Out of hand: At last year's Spring Break event, police arrested 23 people and issued 71 criminal citations . While they were able to quickly determine that the woman was Ayala, police didn't finalize the report until late last month due to the office's caseload and an investigation that ruled out criminal acts in her death. A toxicology test found that the teen had an 'acute; blood-alcohol concentration 0.145 - twice the legal amount for driving. THC was also found in her system, and friends confirmed that she had been smoking marijuana that night. An autopsy conducted in April revealed the teen died from 'sustained injuries consistent with a fall'. In the chaos of the event, police say she likely could have fallen off a local cliff. Dangerous: The cliffs around Isla Vista have become dangerous for the community of college students - especially when combined with binge drinking . 'Unfortunately, there is a long history of college students occasionally falling off the cliffs in Isla Vista and efforts that have been made to try and stop this from happening,' Santa Barbara County Sheriff's spokesman Kelly Hoover told The Press Democrat. Cat Ayala, the woman's mother,  told the Press Democrat that her daughter's death isn't reflective of the life she lead, and that she wants her to be 'remembered for who she was: Bright, beautiful, loving'. In recent years, county and city officials worked together to install fences along the cliffs as a safeguard for the students, but unfortunately most of the cliff-front properties are privately-owned. And the unfenced cliffs combined with binge drinking have not been a good combination for the community. Pattern: Since Ayala's death at least three others have sustained injuries falling from the cliffs in Isla Vista . According to the Press Democrat, at . least three others have sustained serious injuries falling off the . cliffs since Ayala's death, including a 20-year-old Santa Barbara . Community College student on September 28. The Deltopia event, named for the Del Playa Drive where it is held on the bluffs above the ocean, was first organized in 2004 and it has been a major headache for locals ever since. According to the Facebook invite for the page, last year more than 12,000 people were invited and 6,800 had responded that they would be attending. In the invitation for the event, the organizers described it as: 'Official Deltopia 2013: When California's crazies party town goes its hardest.' The drunken fest has a history of creating problems for the community as its attendance has swelled with the advent of Facebook. Keeping safe: In recent years, the community has tried to safeguard students from falling by installing fences along the cliffs. Unfortunately most of the cliff-front property is privately-owned . In 2009, two attendees were hospitalized after falling off a cliff and 33 others had to receive treatment for head injuries, alcohol poisoning and other injuries. Last year, police arrested 23 people and handed out 71 criminal citations. Police have to actively patrol the area during the event, which costs the local taxpayers an estimated $20,000. Officials at UCSB have urged students to reconsider hosting the event given the environmental impact of the debris left on the beach that is washed out and the amount of urine and vomit that enters the water.","The body of Giselle Ayala, 18, was found the morning of April 6 on the beaches of Isla Vista, California .

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers say a third player has been diagnosed with MRSA, a staph infection that is resistant to many common antibiotics. General manager Mark Dominik made the announcement Friday, a day after confirming guard Carl Nicks is being treated for a recurrence of MRSA. Dominik and coach Greg Schiano declined to identify the third player involved in the case diagnosed late Thursday, saying the player requested his name not be released. Off to a bad start: According to NFL.com, the latest Tampa Bay Buccaneer to be benched due to a MRSA infection is rookie cornerback Jonathan Banks who was drafted last April from Mississippi State University . Spreading? If NFL.com is correct, Banks will be the third Buccaneers player to contract the hard-to-treat infection. Guard Carl Nicks and kicker Lawrence Tynes got the infection during the team's summer camp . 'I've spoken to the player, I've spoken to his agent, and we're not at liberty to confirm or deny any player right now,' Dominik said. NFL.com reported the player was rookie cornerback Johnthan Banks. The second-round draft pick out of Mississippi State was the only new addition Friday to the injury report, which said Banks did not practice due to illness. Banks is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Nicks, who along with kicker Lawrence Tynes was diagnosed as having MRSA in August, also sat out practice. He is questionable to play against Philadelphia. Off the field: Tynes (left) and Nicks (right) were diagnosed with MRSA last August. Both have been sitting out practices . The team flew in an infectious disease expert to answer questions players had before practice. Schiano said the session lasted more than an hour, pushing back the team's practice schedule. 'As in anything, I think so much of the fear is the unknown,' Schiano said. 'So as we became better educated, I think kind of understands the game plan and how to make sure this doesn't become a bigger problem.' Dr. Deverick J. Anderson, an associate professor of medicine at the Duke University Medical Center and co-director of the Duke Infection Control Outwork Network said even though there are no other confirmed cases of MRSA on other NFL teams that he doesn't feel players and staff in Tampa Bay are at any higher risk of coming in contact with MRSA. Meanwhile, NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith issued a statement on the situation. 'We have been involved in an ongoing review of the MRSA incidents in Tampa Bay initiated by the concerns we had about the manner in which team officials responded to these cases,"" Smith said in a statement. Tynes has filed a complaint with the players union when the team listed him on the non-football injury list. He believes the infection should be classified as a football-related injury since he was practicing with the team when he contracted it . 'We advised the NFL and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that an outside expert should be brought in to assess the situation and we are pleased with their decision to take that recommendation,' Smith added. ""We have also been in regular contact with the player representatives from Tampa Bay. We will reach out to the Philadelphia Eagles player representatives today and provide them with our best medical guidance and regular updates from the outside experts."" Smith said the situation in Tampa 'underscores the need for a League-wide, comprehensive and standardized infectious disease protocol' as well as 'improved accountability measures on health and safety issues by the NFL over the clubs.' The initial cases of MRSA were confirmed while the Bucs were in New England holding joint practices with the Patriots before a preseason game. The team hired a company to sanitize One Buc Place, the team's headquarters and training facility, on two separate occasions in an effort to minimize the prospect of other cases. Not related: Health officials say that Nicks (above) and Tynes infections are not related, and that neither contracted it from the other. They are trying to determine now how the third player contracted the infection . Famous: Lawrence Tynes (9) twice kicked the New York Giants to the Super Bowl with NFC Championship-winning overtime field goals . The Bucs said at the time they did not know where Nicks and Tynes were exposed to MRSA. Anderson did not plan to recommend a third cleaning of the facility, but that he was working with the team on things players can do themselves to minimize the risk of getting MRSA. 'I can say that I believe it is a safe environment for players and staff,' said Anderson, who toured the complex in August and also observed how the team practices after Nicks and Tynes were diagnosed in August. The expert said the cases involving Nicks and Tynes do not appear to be related, explaining there are different strains of MRSA. 'We don't know about the third one yet. We still need additional information about the specific MRSA that we're dealing with,' Anderson said. 'But we can actually definitely say that the first two cases were not related to each other.' Usually contracted by people in hospitals or other medical facilities . Resistant to most antibiotic treatments . Can lead to deadly flesh-eating bacteria . Can remain in the body for years while being treated . The superbug killed more people than AIDS in 2011 . And, the doctor said Nicks and Tynes did not get the infection from one another. Nicks sat out the preseason and also missed the first two games of the regular season before being told he was 'MRSA free.' He started the past two games against New England and Arizona. Tynes, who helped the New York Giants win a pair of Super Bowls, signed with the Bucs before training camp. He was sidelined by an ingrown toenail on his kicking foot when he was diagnosed as having MRSA. The Bucs later placed Tynes on the non-football injury list instead of injured reserve. He is being paid his salary, however the players union has filed a grievance on the kicker's behalf due concerns about how the team handled the infection.","Tampa Bay Buccaneers manager Mark Dominik announced Friday that a third team member had contracted an MRSA infection .

When he questioned whether the rule would apply if the band played a traditional rendition of God Save the Queen, he was told not to stand at any time. Outraged: Former Royal Artillery Gunner Doug Speller, 74, above, was told he would not be able to stand to salute the national anthem . According to Mr Speller, organisers said the rule was a health and safety precaution which prevented people dancing dangerously in the stands.

As far as I am concerned we should be standing up to protect it, not . banning people from respecting it because of silly regulations. 'It's a lovely theatre but if they want to survive they shouldn't be doing things like this. It's like so many things in this country, they want to stop this and stop that. 'You've got to wonder whether they'll try to do away with the national anthem all together. Health and safety is a good idea when it's done properly but things like this really beggar belief.'

'There’s no way we can afford that. It’s absolutely ridiculous. 'If only they could see me, to see the state I’m in, they would feel differently about the situation.' Natalie’s weight steadily rose since childhood when she began comfort-eating to combat loneliness and anxiety. In her teenage years she became a heavy drinker. By the time she was in her mid-30s, her weight had ballooned dangerously to 35 stone. She attempted to shed the weight through dieting and exercise, but when she married Terry in June 2007, she still weighed 28 stone. By 2010, Natalie was effectively housebound and a visiting GP told her she needed to lose weight urgently. Natalie and Terry on their wedding day, (left) when Terry weighed 25 stone and Natalie weighed nearly 30 stone. Between them the couple have now shed over 30 stone (right) Natalie said: 'The doctor told me that unless something changed, my organs would start to fail. 'He referred me to the NHS, but after the application I was told I needed to go to Colchester hospital and make the case personally.' Terry said: 'Me and Natalie had to sit in front of a panel of six managers and basically beg them to approve the surgery. 'Natalie was in a wheelchair, and terrified because she wasn’t used to being out of the house. It was a difficult experience for her - she felt quite humiliated.' Terry now a healthy 13st 7lb, is Natalie's full time carer as years of obesity have left her with a series of health problems . In July 2011, surgeons carried out Natalie’s sleeve gastrectomy surgery. Over the next year, through a baby food diet and an incremental exercise regime, she lost a staggering 15 stone. Natalie said: 'All I could manage at first was pacing in the hallway, but eventually I could start walking outside and riding my bike. 'The weight came off really quickly at first before stabilising at my current weight. I feel like a completely new person. Then, in June 2012, Terry was approved for a gastric bypass after a doctor judged his obesity to be causing chronic back and leg pain. He went from 25 stone to 13st 7lb. Between them, the couple have lost more than 30 stone. Years of obesity have left Natalie with a series of health problems and unable to work. Terry, who is diabetic, acts as her full-time carer. Terry said: 'We’re able to do things together now like day trips which we couldn’t do before. We’ve been brought much closer together. 'We just have one more hurdle to get over, and that’s persuading the NHS to remove Natalie’s saggy skin. 'It’s difficult for me to see how much she’s struggling with it.' Natalie is currently waiting to see whether she will be classed as an exceptional case by the North East Essex Clinical Commissioning Group. Natalie, pictured on her wedding day in 2007, weighing nearly 30 stone, is arguing that the huge amount of weight she has lost means she should be considered as a special case for the surgery . A spokesman for NHS North East Essex Clinical Commissioning Group said: 'To protect a patient’s privacy, we won’t comment on the circumstances in this case. However, we do always have to make sure that taxpayers’ money we spend is only used for health needs. 'We have to have a way of assessing that, so we have a policy which looks at the BMI of the patient and whether they are severely limited in what they can do because of the condition. 'If a patient is assessed as not having medical needs in this way, then their doctor can still argue on their behalf that they have other “exceptional” care needs. 'This appeal is tested by the Clinical Commissioning Group, which funds any treatment, according to whether the patient is significantly different from others with a similar issue, and whether that patient would benefit significantly more than others.'","Natalie lost over 21st, dropping from 35st to 13st 11lb after surgery .

"By . Paul Thompson and Sam Webb . PUBLISHED: . 14:53 EST, 25 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:27 EST, 26 February 2013 . A Chinese tourist in her 30s mysteriously drowned on Sunday during a group scuba diving trip off the coast of Miami Beach, Florida. She was found with a weight belt still strapped around her waist, but had no other equipment on her body, leading police to launch an investigation. The victim had taken part in a scuba dive organised by RJ Diving Ventures of Miami Beach, the same company that reportedly left two divers stranded in open water in October 2011. Group diving trip: The female Chinese tourist in her 30s was found dead during the group diving trip in Key Biscayne, Miami (diving group pictured alongside police) Kevin Galloway, an EMT, performed CPR on the woman after she was hauled out of the water . The woman, who has not been named, failed to surface after a group of 40 divers went into the water near Key Biscayne. Although everyone was paired up with a diving buddy, those aboard said the woman must have dived alone and panicked. One theory is that the woman failed to understand safety procedures and ditched the wrong equipment while panicking under water. CBS 6 reported she appeared nervous before the dive. 'Nobody here did anything wrong, said Ariane Dimitris, a scuba instructor on board, told WSVN. 'She shouldn't have gone alone. If she missed her buddy, she should have stayed on the boat or asked the dive master to go with her or something but nobody knew that she went in by herself.' Tourist attraction: Divers were taken out on a boat from Key Biscayne (pictured) and were meant to pair up with buddies, but the woman who died did not speak English and left her partner . Investigation: Local Miami Beach Police (pictured) are investigating the mysterious death . She added that scuba divers are taught to jettison the weight belt that keeps them under water. 'I've never heard of anyone taking off even their fins. It's very strange,' Dimitris said. 'And . normally if someone panics you're supposed to drop your weights and . keep everything else on you because that was her survival.' Divers believe keeping the weight belt on was the woman's fatal mistake. They compared it to grabbing onto an anchor in the water, instead of a life preserve. The woman was declared missing after the group did a roll call and she was not there. Mysterious death: The woman had been diving off the coast of Key Biscayne, Miami, Florida (pictured) Divers used a buddy system but the women did not speak English and left her partner, WSVN.com reported. The US Coast Guard sent a boat to join in the search for the woman who was found after two hours. 'We brought her back up, I did CPR, I'm an EMT,' said diver Kevin Galloway, who was on the boat. 'There were also two student doctors on the boat. We did what we could but she was gone.' The U.S. Coastguard and Miami-Dade Police are now investigating Sunday's death. In the 2011 incident, Paul Kline and Fernando Garcia Puerta had to cling to a buoy for two hours after surfacing from their late-afternoon dive in the Atlantic Ocean three miles from Miami and finding no trace of their RJ Diving Ventures boat. 'We were in shock. We could easily have died,' Kline, 44, told the Miami Herald.

A billionaire scam artist put under house arrest after funneling millions from his clients has asked to be allowed a more lenient curfew so he can go to the opera. Disgraced financier Alberto Vilar, 73, used some of the $22million he stole from his clients to fund his favourite philanthropies, including the Metropolitan Opera. The opera-loving swindler was sentenced to nine years in prison in 2010 but was released under a strict 11pm curfew last year pending an appeal. Illegal libretto: Alberto Vilar, pictured in 2007, stole $22million from his clients to fund his lavish life style and pay for donations to his favourite opera houses . Now the septuagenarian libretto-fan wants to be allowed to stay out beyond 1am in the morning so he can be allowed to watch his favourite opera and ‘socialise’ after the curtain closes. ‘Alberto Vilar has been offered free tickets to a sold-out opera this Saturday night by the conductor, his original bail signer Valery Gergiev,’ his lawyer said Wednesday in a letter to Manhattan Federal Court Judge Richard Sullivan. ‘The opera does not let out until after his curfew. Mr Vilar would like the opportunity to socialize after the opera for a short time, and asks that his curfew be extended to 1:30 a.m.,’ lawyer Vivian Shevitz said in the letter. Vilar’s request was swiftly denied by Judge Sullivan, but his lawyer is requesting a reconsideration, NY Daily News reports. Pet project: Vilar has requested to be allowed to stay beyond his curfew to see Tchaikovsky's 'Eugene Onegin', pictured during a London production, at the Metropolitan Opera this weekend . Stolen gift: Alberto Vilar, center, poses with tenor and artistic director of the Los Angeles Opera, Placido Domingo, right, and Valery Gergiev, of Russia's Mariinsky Opera and Ballet, as they announce Vilar's multi-milion gift to the operas in 2000 . Vilar built up a billion dollar fortune as a star of the dot-com era, thanks to early bets on companies such as Microsoft and Intel. His business Amerindo Investment Advisers at one stage had $10billion (£6.6billion) under management. In 2000, Vilar was claiming to be 'the largest supporter of classical music, opera, and ballet in the world'.  Among his gifts was £10million to London's Royal Opera House for the Vilar Floral Hall, its showpiece foyer, now simply Floral Hall. When the dot-com bubble burst, he began siphoning money out of his clients’ accounts to fund his philanthropies and to pay the mortgage on his New York apartment, and stole a total of $22million. Vilar and his business partner Gary Tanaka were arrested in May 2005, after one of their clients, heiress Lily Cates, the mother of Hollywood actress Phoebe Cates, claimed they had stolen $5million from her. They were charged in 2006 and Vilar was found guilty on all 12 counts of fraud.","Alberto Vilar, 73, was found guilty of stealing $22million from his clients .

This astonishing footage shows a 22-year-old paedophile emerging from a tent where he had raped a schoolgirl who he groomed online. Sean Clode groomed the 14-year-old on the internet before persuading her to skip school and travel hundreds of miles from her home in Northern Scotland to see him. He was jailed today for six years at Teeside Crown Court after the footage from a police helicopter caught him getting out of the tent and putting his trainers on while the girl pulled her dress down. Scroll down for video . Caught: In helicopter footage of the search for a missing schoolgirl Clode is seen crouching outside of the tent where he had spent the night with his teenage victim . The court was shown the footage during his trial where Clode claimed the girl had arrived at Hartlepool without his knowledge and that they had not had sex . Secretive: Here Clode appears to be in conversation with someone onside the tent in other parts of the footage he is seen putting on his trainers while the school girl pulls down her dress . Judge Howard Crowson told jobless Clode, from Hartlepool, that age of consent laws were needed to protect vulnerable teenagers from men like him. Sentencing him to jail he said: 'That she was a willing participant in these activities is no mitigation,' the judge added. 'Her life and outlook have been completely distorted by you.' Judge Crowson said Clode could easily have cut the communication before things . got so serious, and decided the defendant continued it 'for your own . selfish motives.' Vile: Clode groomed the schoolgirl online and persuaded her to runaway to see him in Hartlepool but told court that no sex took place between them . He said the plan for the pair to meet up caused 'unimaginable . anxiety' for her parents, and described the father’s search for his . daughter as 'desperate.' The Judge added: 'Your intention was clearly to coerce her into sexual activity. 'This case demonstrates why the age of consent law is necessary to protect 14-year-old girls. 'You are a selfish man interested only in your own sexual desires.' The court heard that the pair had rendezvoused at the railway station in Hartlepool five months ago and camped overnight on nearby dunes in a tent she had bought on her way down. They had sex on at least two occasions during the night, despite him knowing she was underage. She had pretended to her parents she was going to school before going on a sleep-over with a friend, but instead met up with Clode. When it became apparent she had vanished, her frantic father drove through the night, first to Edinburgh, then on to the North East desperately searching for the teenager. He asked postmen, knocked on doors and wandered the streets looking for her, having arrived at dawn. It was only at 2.30pm that day that he finally heard she was safe. The next day the girl told police in a recorded interview that she had sex several times that night with Clode in the tent. But the following month she changed her story and said no sex had taken place in a bid to protect the man with whom she was still infatuated. The judge concluded she was acting on his wishes by giving a false account. Trying to hide: Clode was spotted by the tent which appeared to have been deliberately pitched in the shadow of some plants to make it more difficult to see . Shameless: The court heard the tent the pair slept in was purchased by the teenage girl on her way from northern Scotland to Hartlepool . The jury deliberated for just over an . hour before convicting him of sexual grooming, child abduction and two . counts of sexual activity with a child. The abduction charge related to Clode removing the girl from the lawful authority of her parents.

The case has continued to drive a wedge between the girl, who cannot be identified, and her family. Speaking . of a Victim Impact Statement made by the girl’s father, Anthony Dunne, . prosecuting, said: 'It talks very strongly about the stress that was . caused to the family by the daughter’s disappearance, by the difficulty . that continues in their relationship with their daughter given her . apparent sense of loyalty towards the defendant and what appears to be . his continuing influence and control over her.' Rebecca Brown, defending, said her . client did not set out to groom the girl when they chanced upon each . other while playing Xbox games online. Clode was subject to a Sexual Offences Prevention Order, will sign the sex offenders register and may be barred from working with children. After the case, the girl’s father said in a statement: 'We would like to thank Cleveland Police for their prompt and extensive search which found our daughter, for their work and effort made to bring her abductor to justice. Also for the understanding shown to the family at this difficult time.' Outside court, Detective Constable Chris Bryan said: 'Parents should view this case as a warning to check who their children are speaking to, not only on social networking sites but also over live chat when playing on games consoles. 'Sexual predators will use any opportunity possible to groom victims.'","Sean Clode, 22, who abducted his victim and had sex with her on a beach has been jailed for six years at Teeside Crown Court .

"By . David Richards . UPDATED: . 06:57 EST, 24 January 2012 . Europe's most senior judge has launched an attack on David Cameron over his criticism of the European Court of Human Rights. Sir Nicolas Bratza, 66, said one of the key lines of attack, that the court unnecessarily interferes in domestic cases, is 'simply not borne out by the facts'. He also accused the Government of pandering to the tabloid press. 'It is disappointing to hear senior British politicians lending their voices to criticisms more frequently heard in the popular press, often based on a misunderstanding of the court's role and history, and of the legal issues at stake,' he said. His comments come on the eve of the Prime Minister's visit to Strasbourg, the home of the ECHR, where he is set to make a speech on what Downing Street described as the 'much-needed reform' of the court. Sir Nicolas Bratza's comments come on the eve of the Prime Minister's visit to Strasbourg, the home of the ECHR, where he is set to make a speech on what Downing Street described as the 'much-needed reform' of the court . During his visit to the ECHR tomorrow Mr Cameron will say European judges must be more in touch with public opinion, accept more UK court rulings and let countries protect their own citizens and stop interfering in 'petty' cases . Britain’s £150,000-a-year judge at the court, Sir Nicolas, the son of a Serbian concert violinist, is currently president of the ECHR. The court was set up in the Fifties largely to prevent a repeat of the human rights outrages of the Second World War. It ruled recently that having a TV satellite dish was a human right and it now has a backlog of thousands of cases. Its judgments are binding on member states. Sir Nicolas told the Independent that it would be 'deeply regrettable' if the UK's support of the ECHR which is enforced by the Strasbourg court, was to be called into question. During his visit to the ECHR tomorrow Mr Cameron will say European judges must be more in touch with public opinion, accept more UK court rulings and let countries protect their own citizens and stop interfering in ‘petty’ cases. His tough stance follows fury over the court’s ruling last week that Qatada, described as Osama Bin Laden’s ‘right-hand man in Europe’, cannot be deported to face terrorism charges in Jordan because evidence obtained by torture could be used against him. The Government has also been in debate with the court over the issue of prisoners' voting rights. Mr Cameron is determined to take advantage of the UK’s chairmanship of Europe’s Council of Ministers, which oversees the court, to force through a shake-up. The Prime Minister believes the court must reflect public opinion and take into account the cultural, historic and other differences between Strasbourg and individual nations. Cameron's tough stance follows fury over the court's ruling last week that Abu Qatada (pictured), described as Osama Bin Laden's 'right-hand man in Europe', cannot be deported to face terrorism charges in Jordan because evidence obtained by torture could be used against him . He is understood to support a cut in the total of 47 judges – one from each member nation. And he wants new rules to ensure they are more in touch with public opinion. Sir Nicolas maintained that there are reasons for optimism, and that solutions were being sought to the problem of the backlog. He said the backlog of cases was not linked to inefficiency but is a result of an increase in the number of states signing up to the ECHR. Sir Nicolas added: 'It is particularly . unfortunate that a single judgment of the court on a case relating to UK . prisoners' voting rights, which was delivered in 2005 and has still not . been implemented, has been used as the springboard for a sustained . attack on the court and has led to repeated calls for the granting of . powers of Parliament to override judgments of the court against the UK, . and even for the withdrawal of the UK from the convention.'

'It would be deeply regrettable if it were to allow its commitment to that system to be called into question by a failure to defend it against its detractors or to offer its strong support for the vital work of the court.' A Downing Street spokeswoman said: 'The Government's position on this issue is a matter of record and has not changed. We believe the court is an essential part of the system for protecting human rights across Europe but it is not working as well as it could and it is in need of fundamental reform. 'Our top priority during our chairmanship of the Council of Europe is to agree a robust package of reform. We want the court to fulfil the purpose for which it was intended - to uphold human rights under the Convention and to tackle serious violations of human rights across Europe. 'There are many others within the Council of Europe who agree that it is time for a reform and we'll be making a number of serious proposals to them - for example, if an issue has been properly dealt with at the national level then it shouldn't have to be gone over again at the Strasbourg level.

The Guardian was under pressure to apologise last night for a  ‘disgraceful slur’ against Michael Gove by appearing to link his reforms to the deaths of Baby P and Hamzah Khan. Polly Toynbee suggested that the Education Secretary’s decision to dismantle Labour’s ContactPoint child protection database had made it easier for vulnerable youngsters to slip through the cracks. The online version of the veteran Left-wing columnist’s account was headlined: ‘It is the Baby Ps and Hamzah Khans who pay for this Tory vandalism: Michael Gove’s dismantling of successful schemes like ContactPoint has left abuse victims even more vulnerable.’ Guardian newspaper under pressure to apologise for a  ‘disgraceful slur’ against Michael Gove by appearing to link his reforms to the deaths of Baby P (left) and Hamzah Khan (right) Toyrnbee's column as it appeared on the Guardian website yesterday . Miss Toynbee claimed the database ‘would have raised the alarm’ about Hamzah, who was starved to death by his mother and left in his cot for almost two years. In fact, both children were killed before the Coalition came to power in May 2010. And ContactPoint was not scrapped until August 2010 – nine months after Hamzah is thought to have died. Peter Connelly, known as Baby P, died in August 2007. Chris Skidmore, a Tory member of the Commons education committee, called on the Guardian to apologise. ‘This is a disgraceful slur,’ he said. ‘It is deeply disappointing that anyone should stoop so low as to use the tragic deaths of children to score cheap political points. Polly Toynbee and the Guardian should apologise.’ Polly Toynbee yesterday acknowledged the headline on her article was 'provocative', but said she had not written it . Miss Toynbee yesterday acknowledged the headline on her article was ‘provocative’, but said she had not written it. She insisted she was not blaming Mr Gove for particular child deaths and acknowledged that no government could prevent all child abuse. A spokesman for Guardian News and Media said the paper stood by both the article and the headline. She added: ‘The reference to “the Baby Ps  and Hamzah Khans” in the headline is clearly referring to victims of child abuse in general, rather than to those two tragic cases.’ An education source pointed out that Mr Gove had acted to ensure that serious case reviews into child deaths are now routinely published. The Education Secretary’s wife, Sarah Vine - who writes a column for the Mail - criticised Miss Toynbee in a message on Twitter. ‘I respect you very much, but your piece today does you no justice,’ she said. ‘It displays ignorance, laziness and blind tribalism.’ Responding to online criticism from her own readers, Miss Toynbee said: ‘No government can ever protect every child. I say that emphatically. ‘There is no magic bullet, and even the best systems will fail some children. But learning the lessons of these exhaustive reviews is important. ‘I am not accusing Gove of killing children, but the combination of less collaboration and larger than ever crisis caseloads for social workers is a serious risk.’ The ContactPoint database was set up in 2004 in an attempt to improve information-sharing between child protection agencies following the death of Victoria Climbie. But it was widely condemned on privacy, security and child protection grounds. Critics said it was too easy for people to access information inappropriately about vulnerable children.","Pressure on paper to apologise for 'disgraceful slur' against Michael Gove .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . PUBLISHED: . 15:49 EST, 18 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:51 EST, 19 September 2013 . Passengers hit by flight delays caused by bad weather may now be able to claim compensation of up to £510 per person following a landmark court case. The decision is expected to open the door to compensation claims dating back six years that are estimated to be worth tens of millions of pounds. Usually airlines reject compensation claims for delays caused by ‘extraordinary circumstances’ outside their control. A court has ordered easyJet pay compensation to passenger Frederique Jager whose Gatwick to Nice flight was delayed because of bad weather earlier in the day . Although this allowed them to deny payments to passengers on flights hit by bad weather, it also meant no compensation for passengers on subsequent flights that suffer delays as a knock-on effect. However, a court in Cheshire has ruled that those on these later flights are entitled to compensation. The case centred on a claim brought by customers of easyJet, however the outcome will apply to all other UK airlines and can be backdated by six years. Under the court’s ruling, an airline will still be able to deny compensation to passengers on flights delayed by bad weather at the designated take-off time. But if the weather clears up, those affected later because planes are not in the right place at the right time will be able to make a claim. The compensation regime, which applies across the EU, means travellers can make a claim if a flight has been delayed for at least three hours and the airline has no legitimate excuse. The figure varies depending on the length of the journey, rising from £210 per person on short-haul flights to a maximum of £510. EasyJet denied compensation to passenger Frederique Jager, 31, who booked a flight from Gatwick to Nice in the summer of 2012 which landed three hours and 12 minutes later than scheduled. Usually airlines reject compensation claims for delays caused by 'extraordinary circumstances' outside their control, such as heavy snowfall. Pictured is Heathrow under snow in 2010 . Under the ruling, an airline can still deny compensation to passengers on flights delayed by bad weather at the designated take-off time . Miss Jager, who is from Holland but was living in London, made a claim herself, but easyJet turned her away citing high winds and bad weather. However, she knew there had been no bad weather in either Gatwick or Nice and so pursued the case. It later transpired that her plane had been held up earlier in the day by high winds on another route. The judge sitting at the county court in Macclesfield ruled that this did not give easyJet the right to deny compensation and awarded Miss Jager £210. Her solicitors said the decision makes clear that airlines should have enough planes and staff to cope in these circumstances. Paul Hinchliffe, the managing partner of Bott and Co solicitors, said: ‘It’s a victory for passenger rights. Despite the fact that easyJet made what should be a simple process very complicated for their customers, justice ultimately prevailed. ‘The law is clear and airlines continue to exhibit a flagrant disregard for the regulations. The very fact that passengers have to resort to using a solicitor to recover their compensation shows the lack of respect the airlines have towards their customers. ‘We receive hundreds of cases every week where passengers have not got anywhere with the airlines.’ Easyjet said it will take steps to minimise the impact of bad weather on passengers. A spokesman said: ‘Delays of this type are extremely rare and easyJet does everything possible to provide information and care for all customers in line with our obligations. We are reviewing the cases to understand whether further measures can be put in place to minimise the impact of adverse weather on our flying schedule.’","Court ordered easyJet to pay compensation to passenger Frederique Jager .

Fears: Cath Kidston, pictured at a showroom in London, has said she fears she has a shelf life and that her company will get rid of her . Cath Kidston fears she has a shelf life and her multi-million pound company will eventually say 'we've had enough of you'. Kidston, whose kitsch patterned goods have made her an estimated £25 million, said having the founder involved 'can be a real problem' for any business. The millionairess - who opened her first store in Holland Park, London, 20 years ago - said she knew she had a 'shelf life', adding: 'I should . probably leave so it is healthy, but at the moment I am loving it.' Kidston, who is now creative director having relinquished her majority . stake three years ago, said she often struggles to take a step back from the business and she has a tendency to stick her oar in 'which probably drives people crazy.' The businesswoman was speaking at The Times Cheltenham Literature Festival to mark the release of her book Coming Up Roses - which celebrates company's 20-year anniversary. During the talk, she said the brand's success was down to its 'modern vintage' style and the company's ability to 'tilt towards the trend'. Kidston also spoke about a difficult period the company went through in 2003 when she was forced to sell her first stake, shortly after she was diagnosed with breast cancer. A the time the company had tried, unsuccessfully, to open stores in the US before it was ready. 'It was too much too fast,' she said. Kidston also said she had recently been renovating . a house in Gloucestershire, revealing one domestic item that would never feature a Cath Kidston design. 'Putting a print on an Aga is a step . too far,' she said. Kidston first registered the business in 1993 opening the first Holland Park store - which she has called a 'glorified junk shop' in the past - soon after, with a budget of just £15,000. Shabby chic: The brand, a Chelsea branch pictured, now has more stores overseas than in Britain . Al fresco: Kidston's signature florals have expanded beyond the kitchen to include garden gazebos . In the past, she has said the store and its distinct sytle was inspired by her own childhood in rural Hampshire. At first, the store mainly sold furniture and fabric,- including her flagship 'Rose Bouquet' print. She closed her interior design . business in the mid-1990s to focus her energies on the Cath Kidston . brand - which now includes everything from wallpaper to dog collars, and gazebos to smartphone cases. By 1999, the business had expanded - with Kidston opening stores in Marylebone, Fulham and Wimbledon. Three years ago, Kidston, the cousin of property guru Kirstie Allsopp, sold her majority stake -  which has been controlled since 2010 by American private equity group TA Associates, who own a 60 per cent. Business is blooming: Demand from Asian . consumers has helped to propel sales of Cath Kidston's distinctive brand . of floral homeware past the £100million mark for the first time . Overall the firm's results for the year 2012 to March 31 2013 indicate annual sales were up to £105million, with British sales up 21 per cent also. Overseas sales rocketed by 53 per cent - mainly driven by an increase in demand in Asia. The company is now looking to expand further into the far East, having already opened stores in Japan and China. The business will add a second Shanghai store to its 30 other outlets in China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan later this year. There are 32 Cath Kidston stores in Japan, meaning the brand now has more overseas outlets than British stores. Modern vintage: Cath Kidston's floral tents began cropping up at the Glastonbury festival as her popularity grew . As a young designer, her idyllic . childhood in the English countryside provided Cath Kidston with the . inspiration she need to create what is now a global brand. It . was nostalgia for the colours, prints and fabrics of her childhood home . that informed Kidston's concept of 'modern vintage' - the style she hit . upon after spotting a picture in a magazine of rose wallpaper on the . side of a bath. She . opened her first tiny store close to Holland Park in 1993, with a . start-up budget of £15,000 - almost a third of which she ploughed into . creating her first print, Rose Bouquet. Kidston used vintage fabrics to . produce cheerful floral ironing board covers and cushion covers which . she sold alongside second hand furniture. As her store grew in popularity, press attention followed, and so too did hordes of customers. By . the late 1990s the Cath Kidston brand was expanding with more London . stores and new prints and products, and she attracted a celebrity fan . base. Glastonbury was first accused of having become middle-class when . festival-goers were spotted sporting playful Cath Kidston wellies to . tramp through the mud between stages. After .

Former England defender and coach Stuart Pearce has left his wife of 20 years for an FA employee who once worked as a liaison officer for the WAGs. A close family friend said yesterday that he feared Pearce had suffered a ‘complete mid-life crisis’ after walking out on his wife and two children to be with 39-year-old FA employee Carol Day. ‘Stuart told his wife Liz last month that he was leaving and he immediately moved out of the family home,’ said the friend. Break-up: Stuart Pearce, pictured on his wedding day to Liz . ‘He went straight to Carol’s flat in West London and the pair then went off on a holiday for a week.’ His affair adds another chapter to the FA’s  history of unfortunate romantic entanglements – not least the ‘kiss and tell’ affair involving former manager Sven Goran Eriksson and a secretary, Faria Alam, which also involved then FA chief Mark Palios. Pearce, 51, is no longer an employee after losing his job as England Under-21 boss earlier this year. He was nicknamed ‘Psycho’ during his career because of his uncompromising play, and his wife once said his ‘integrity and honesty are beyond doubt’. But she is said to be shocked by his affair with Miss Day, who joined the Football Association in 1998 two years after completing a business administration and marketing degree at Brunel University. New love? Carol Day arranged travel for England teams . Pearce told his wife that the relationship started after the European Under-21 Championships in Israel in June. England went out after losing all three group matches. ‘Liz does not know if Stuart is telling the truth or if the affair had been going on longer,’ said the family friend. Miss Day was Players Wives Liaison Officer at the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and South Korea – arranging accommodation and flights for wives and girlfriends. More recently she has worked as operations manager for England’s junior teams – from Under-16 to Under-21. Pearce began managing the Under-21s in 2007. Miss Day was also an organiser for the Great Britain football team at last year’s London Olympics – a team also managed by Pearce. She is said to have told her FA bosses about the relationship. Three years ago Pearce tried to motivate the Under-21 squad with a visit to Colchester barracks, where the players and staff met soldiers due to be deployed in Afghanistan. The group later competed in tests conducted in a battle simulator and the winner was Miss Day. ‘From the 39 people on the coach, Carol – the only lady on board – got the top marks, so that doesn’t say much for the rest of them,’ Pearce said afterwards. Pearce played more than 800 games – including 78 appearances for England – in a career that started at non-league Wealdstone. In 2002 he embarked on a managerial career that included a spell as caretaker England manager last year when Fabio Capello resigned. The Pearces wed in 1993. Mrs Pearce, 50, the daughter of a Wiltshire pig farmer, is not a stereotypical WAG. She is a keen horsewoman and keeps former racehorses at stables close to the £1.8million family home near Marlborough, Wiltshire. Passionate: Stuart Pearce celebrating his successful penalty during the Euro 1996 game against Spain has become somewhat iconic . Boss: Pearce managed the Team GB football team at the London 2012 Olympic Games . She is credited with having sparked an interest in both the theatre and reading in her husband, who left school with five CSEs. She is said to be ‘devastated’ by the break-up of her marriage. ‘She always thought he was not the sort of person to do what he has done,’ said the family friend. The couple have two children – Chelsea, a talented rider tipped to represent Great Britain in eventing, and Harley. Pearce is currently on a Bear Grylls survival course, which was a present from them. Pearce and Miss Day were unavailable for comment yesterday.

Its leafy lanes and idyllic charm have helped make it one of the most desirable places to live in Britain. But the sordid goings-on in some of its car parks and woods have elevated one exclusive corner of Surrey to the top of a rather more unsavoury list. The Elmbridge district, which includes the wealthy commuter villages of Claygate, Esher, Oxshott, Weybridge and Cobham, is among the most popular ‘dogging’ hotspots in the country. Wealthy Weybridge: But it is popular among 'doggers' for outdoor sex . Known as Britain’s Beverly Hills because of its celebrity residents, including football stars John Terry, Peter Crouch and Frank Lampard, Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood and tennis ace Andy Murray, its 37 square miles include at least ten known areas where strangers gather for sex. Some entire counties have fewer dogging sites. For example, Norfolk has six, Warwickshire three and Sussex only two. In total, Surrey has 93 – double the tally two years ago – making it the nation’s public sex capital, according to figures from a Freedom of Information request. Lights on: Surrey is a hotbed for 'dogging' with people obviously preferring the more picturesque locations . Out of 222 outdoor sex sites known to police across the UK, Surrey has almost half. In addition to the ten sites in Elmbridge, Guildford has 16, Reigate and Banstead 13, and Mole Valley and Surrey Heath 12 each. Residents complain of finding condoms, sex toys and pornographic magazines littering local beauty spots. Dominic Raab, Tory MP for Esher and Walton, said: ‘Public places, especially woods and parks, are for everyone to enjoy. Endorsing them as communal pick-up joints is wrong. ‘I’ve had complaints from women . walking their dogs alone who were propositioned, and many parents don’t . want to take their children anywhere near that kind of environment.’ The . figures were revealed after the Mail asked police forces across the . country to disclose the number of ‘public-sex environments’ (PSEs) they . monitor. Police do not officially designate areas as PSEs, but use the term to describe places commonly used for open-air sex. In . many ways, Elmbridge is the perfect community. Quality of life surveys . have repeatedly found that its 130,600 residents are fitter, live longer . and earn more than most other Britons. The weather is said to be . sunnier there, too. But even when it does rain, those out cruising for casual sex need not worry. One . dogging website advises that among the ‘awesome’ places to meet in the . area is a ‘semi-indoor dogging site under a building on stilts so you . can dog whatever the weather - amazing!!!!’. It also gives directions to another site, described as ‘a middle class location’ where ‘all the posh couples are up for it, especially at about 10pm on Fridays’, although it warns ‘watch out for the gypsies, they can get quite violent’. Of a third spot in the entrance drive of a Surrey golf club it says: ‘A huge amount of dogging action going on mainly Saturdays and Wednesdays.’ Picturesque: Reigate in Surrey is a popular site for dogging, according to recently-released statistics . Dogging hit the headlines in 2003 when former Labour Welsh Secretary Ron Davies’s political career was destroyed after a newspaper caught him in a sex act with a stranger at Tog Hill near Bath, Somerset. Mr Davies claimed he was in the picnic area ‘watching badgers’. The following year, former England footballer Stan Collymore admitted he had become hooked on having sex with strangers in car parks. Surrey Police said the county had a high number of sites because the force was so pro-active at monitoring them. Hampshire is in second place overall, with 30 sites, followed by Northamptonshire with 16. It is not illegal to have sex in a public space. It becomes a criminal offence if it causes ‘alarm or distress’ to others.","Area including Claygate, Esher, Oxshott, Weybridge and Cobham is among the most popular sites for anonymous public sex .

Two girls will be forced to have the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine against their will after a High Court ruling. The children, aged 11 and 15, were told it was ‘in their best interests’ to have the vaccine despite telling the court they didn’t want it. They were due to receive the injection yesterday but the procedure has been postponed due to ‘practical difficulties’, according to the solicitor of the girls’ mother. Ruling: The children, aged 11 and 15, were told it was 'in their best interests' to have the vaccine despite telling the court they didn't want it . The ruling came after their divorced parents disagreed over the children having the inoculation. It is only the third case of its kind in the High Court. The girls’ mother, named only as Mrs F, doesn’t want them to have the inoculation because she fears side effects. But their father has pushed for the girls to be protected against MMR. The sisters, named in court documents as L and M, live with their mother. The ruling was revealed by BBC Newsnight, which obtained the court papers. According to the Newsnight report, a court-appointed guardian was concerned that the girls had been ‘strongly influenced’ by their mother. The report said that the girls’ father initially favoured his daughters not receiving the vaccination but changed his mind after the measles epidemic in Wales earlier this year. In evidence given to the High Court, the girls’ mother said: ‘Parents have a choice to do what they feel in their hearts they really believe. I feel both children have grown up in a frame of mind which they were settled in and supported in the same outlook and are now forced to take a different view without more positive reassurance and the recording of ingredients [of the vaccine] is unsatisfactory. They have a right to be informed.’ Concern: The girls' mother, named only as Mrs F, doesn't want them to have the inoculation because she fears side effects . However Mrs Justice Theis said the girls felt obliged to agree with their mother and are not able to form an opinion on their health independently. She said ‘weight should be attached to the wishes of mature children,’ but in this ‘unfortunate’ case the children could not decide for themselves. The couple, who married in 1996 and divorced in 2011, agreed their daughter L would be inoculated as a baby but changed their mind and agreed she should not have a booster jab. They decided that M would not be vaccinated. Solicitor Phillipa Dolan, representing the mother said the children had been brought up with the idea that ‘if you are healthy, you eat properly, you have a good immune system, then it’s not necessary to be vaccinated’. She said the girls also believed the ‘side effects can be harmful’. Asked if the two girls had been vaccinated, Miss Dolan said: ‘No, there have been practical difficulties in forcing the order and that is, at the moment, an ongoing issue.’ Nicholas Cusworth QC, of the Family Law Bar Association, said: ‘In this case the judge decided that the views expressed by this 15-year-old weren’t sufficiently balanced, weren’t sufficiently sensible and didn’t give sufficient weight to the positive side of the immunisation.’","Girls' mother doesn't want them to have the jab  because she fears side effects .

The second bi-annual Candy GPS Report has revealed there was a 34 per cent jump in the number of individuals worth $30 million (£18.7 million) between 2009 and 2012, many of them hailing from the emerging Bric economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China. And they are continuing to invest in the luxury properties available in traditional destinations such as the South of France, Italy and the Caribbean. Second home: The French Riviera remains a popular spot for the super rich to buy a second home . Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Nick Candy, joint owner of the world's . most expensive residential apartments at One Hyde Park in London, said: 'Property is simple: it’s about supply and demand. 'In the Cote d’Azur there are huge planning issues and restrictions. You can’t just build houses.' The report, produced by Candy & Candy, Savills World Research and Deutsche Asset . & Wealth Management, revealed that the price of a typical five-bedroom property in the Cote d’Azur exceeded $17.9m ($28.5m). And while the majority of buyers come from the Middle East and Russia, it also remains popular with the super rich from Europe and North America. Below peak: Transactions on the Cote d'Azur remain down from their peak in the wake of the Eurozone crisis . But while the destination remains beyond the reach of most ordinary people, it did not avoid the eurozone crisis. The report concluded sales remain 'well below' peak levels, as property owners hold on to their investments. The area was also hit by President François Hollande's threat to hit high earners with 75 per cent tax, which led to a fall in property prices of 10 per cent. The report claimed prices had now stabalised after the tax plans were 'probably less draconian than originally feared'. And the Cote d’Azur is expected to continue to be a firm favourite, as demand outstrips supply. Other top spots include Sardinia’s Costa Smeralda and Monaco. Mr Candy said: 'Traditional is still the favourite and it will stay like that. It will take a lot for people to move.' Referring to the emergence of new destinations, he added: 'There are lots of new places, such as Dubrovnik in Croatia, but the traditional places have the big events, such as the Cannes Film Festival. 'Places like that have homes worth £100m to £300m. I think that will continue.' Outside of Europe several Caribbean destinations, such as St Barts and Barbados, remain in the top 20 list. St Barts ranked third overall, where prices held firm due to short supply, while in Barbados, placed sixth, a high number of British buyers are said to be investing. Winter spots such as US ski resorts of Aspen and Vail, and France’s Courchevel also ranked highly, as did Switzerland’s premier resorts of St Moritz, Gstaad and Verbier. Top spot: Properties such as this in Sardinia's Costa Smeralda can go for a small fortune . Highly rated: Across the pond in the US, the Aspen resort in Colorado is still an attractive option . The report said buyers from Russia were a 'key driver' for many of the 'traditional' destinations. But those with newly acquired wealth in the Far East prefer to invest closer to home. Wealthy buyers from Asia and Australasia are buying second homes in the Thai resorts of Phuket and Koh Samui, Indonesia’s Bali and Niseko in northern Japan. Topping the list for the preferred destination of Asians to own a second home was the Maldives. Mr Candy added: 'In the same way that we have seen exponential real estate growth in global cities over recent years, we expect to see the same level of growth and property values replicated in the top luxury leisure enclaves where the world’s super rich are choosing to purchase additional homes.' Far East: Asia's super rich are buying in places such as Phuket, where this property was valued at £5 million .","Rich investors still favour the sunny climes of the French Riviera .

A woman sobbed as she was jailed for four years yesterday for torching a block of flats in an arson attack that left a 76-year-old woman homeless and needing hospital treatment for a week. Kelly Howell was 'drunk and giggling' as she piled up rubbish outside a friend's flat in Stockport, Greater Manchester, before setting it alight following a row, a court heard yesterday. The blaze took hold of the front door, . filling the upstairs and downstairs flats with smoke, and trapping two friends and elderly neighbour Patricia Blackburne inside and fearing for their lives. Jailed: Kelly Howell was 'drunk and giggling' as she piled up rubbish outside a friend's flat in Stockport, Greater Manchester before setting it alight following a row, a court heard yesterday . At a hearing at Minshull Street Crown in Manchester, the jury was told the three petrified residents thought they were going to die, and the entire row of 10 homes could have been engulfed if firefighters had not arrived when they did. Mrs Blackburne, a resident of 22 years, was rescued by firefighters and rushed to hospital for smoke inhalation, where she remained for a week. When she was released, she had to move into a care home for two months because her home had been so badly damaged. Jobless Howell's senseless attack in January also caused £60,000-worth of damage. Prosecuting the 26-year-old, who is from Stockport in Greater Manchester, Lisa Boocock told the court how Mrs Blackburne was woken at 1.30am by her fire alarm in her downstairs flat. 'The lights went out in the flat and it was filling with . smoke,' she said. 'She saw flames at the door. Her door was forced and firefighters . came into her house and took her outside.' Howell's friend's were trapped in the upstairs flat and considered jumping from the window to escape the blaze, added Miss Boocock. Howell was arrested a . short time later, but told police she had nothing to do with the fire. But when she was quizzed she later confessed to her crime. The . court heard she had hatched her plan after drinking with her two . friends. When they had rowed, Howell was thrown out and told not to come . back. Reckless: Howell was sentenced yesterday at a hearing at Minshull Crown Court in Manchester . That was when she decided to torch the place as a 'prank'. Howell pleaded guilty to causing arson reckless as to whether life was endangered. Defending, Michael . Knowles, defending, said: 'It was a small action on her . behalf which resulted in serious consequences which she should have . thought about but did not at the time.' Mr Knowles argued that any jail sentence could be suspended and that Howell could serve her punishment in the community. But Judge Adrian Smith told Howell: 'You placed the lives of three people at grave risk and you did this as a prank. 'You . are entirely culpable. You are entirely to blame for this offence. Such . serious conduct clearly calls for a substantial punishment as a . deterrent to others.' He . added: 'I would fail completely in my public duty if I was to impose a . sentence which could be suspended, or even to think of a suspended . sentence.' As her . four-year sentence was read out, she turned to her family in the public . gallery and asked 'Dad?' Geoff . Harris, head of protection for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue . Service said: 'In the last year, our work in partnership with Greater . Manchester Police has resulted in the successful prosecution of more . than 100 arsonists in Greater Manchester and we hope this latest . sentence will act as a strong deterrent to those who deliberately put . lives and property at risk in this way.'","Kelly Howell set fire to her friend's flat following a drunken row .

"By . Michael Zennie . PUBLISHED: . 15:06 EST, 10 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:11 EST, 10 October 2013 . The police in a small suburban South Florida city have made more than $5.8million selling cocaine to drugs dealers in the last two years - and it's all perfectly legal. The undercover narcotics squad in Sunrise, Florida, runs a sprawling - and highly successful - 'reverse sting' operation in which officers pose as high-level drug suppliers to attract out-of-town buyers. When the buyers show up and take possession of the drugs, the cops swoop in and put them in cuffs. Then they seize their cash, cars, jewelry and cell phones as the ill-gotten gains of drug trafficking. One deal netted more than $500,000 for the department. The cops are able to do all of this thanks to a network of highly-paid, highly-motivated informants. Their star snitch has been revealed as a 'famme fatale' buxom brunette in her 40s who has brought in dozens of dealers. For her hard work, the Sunrise Police Department has paid her more than $800,000 in the last five years. New gear: Police in Sunrise, Florida, have used $5.8million in drug seizures to buy new equipment for the police force . The South Florida Sun-Sentinel revealed Sunrise's shadowy drug activities after a six-month investigation into their operations. One key to the success of the reverse sting operation has been a seductive, shadowy female informant who has brought the police 63 cases that have resulted in more than $5million in property seizures since 2007. And she has been paid handsomely for her work - taking home $800,000 from the city of Sunrise. Police have repeatedly refused to name the woman in court, though the Sun-Sentinel compiled a description of her based on police reports and depositions. She's middle-aged, works as an on-again-off-again model, repeatedly refers to having a 'Colombian' connection. And she's fatally ruthless. In one case, she convinced a man that she was dating him to gain his trust so he would buy cocaine from the undercover officers. Their relationship lasted 19 days, the Sun Sentinel reports. 'We’re not talking about a few hours overtime. We’re talking about police officers who are now making hundreds of thousands of dollars. In my view, it’s all about the money.' Alan Ross, Miami defense attorney . In another, she can be heard on her police microphone with drug mule attempting to buy 150 kilograms of cocaine from the undercover officers. She calls him 'my love' and gently encourages him when he is nervous. Then, as he is being cuffed by officers, she laughs at him and walks away. 'I have to leave,' she can be heard giggling. 'Son of a b****.' Unlike most police narcotics squads, which try to drive drug dealers out of the community, the undercover officers in Sunrise are actively recruiting drug dealers to travel to their middle-class city of 84,000. Only seven of the 195 people Sunrise police arrested for cocaine trafficking in the last four years have been from the city of Sunrise. They come from New York, Philadelphia, Miami and as far away as Peru. Femme fatale: The secret weapon in the Sunrise police department is a confidential information, buxom brunette, who has lured dozens of drug dealers into sting operations (stock picture) Their drug deals aren't made in shadowy alleys, but in classic suburban settings. The TGI Friday's at the Sawgrass Mills mall has been a favorite spot for officers to conduct their drug deals - and subsequent busts. The money and property that the detectives seize has been a tremendous source of income for the police department. In 2011 and 2012 alone, the department received more than $5.8million from drug seizures. Florida's laws allow the police to take any money and property used in drug trafficking operations. The money has gone to buy all manner of police equipment - from guns to radios, to computers and bulletproof vests. And it's also gone into the pockets of the officers involved in the narcotics squad, in the form of overtime pay. In 2010 alone, the small narcotics squad of a dozen officers got $1.2million in overtime. Sgt. James Hughes, who leads the day-to-day operations of the unit, has reaped $240,000 in overtime pay in three and a half years. Officers on the squad have taken home $315,00 to $620,00 each in salary and overtime since the reverse stings began. 'We’re not talking about a few hours overtime,' Miami defense attorney Alan Ross told the Sun-Sentinel. 'We’re talking about police officers who are now making hundreds of thousands of dollars. 'In my view, it’s all about the money.'","Sunrise, Florida, police run an extensive 'reverse sting' operations that has undercover detectives posing as drug dealers .

The birds were hung from kitchen cupboards and bedroom wardrobes in an attempt to 'age' the meat. Oxford Brookes students posted pictures of themselves with pictures of dead birds .

The boys decided to pluck the animals in the courtyard of their halls in Cheney Student Village, as they were surrounded by onlookers and covered the area in feathers.

Feathers flew when Johnny Windsor-Clive, Miles Pattison-Appleton, Alex Archer and James Birley decided to pluck the birds in the open spaces. But the quartet say the university over-reacted, the Daily Telegraph reported. Mr Windsor-Clive, 19, who is descended from Lord Clive, who secured India for the British Empire and was nicknamed Clive of India, said the reaction had been quite extreme.

A North Dakota farmer who discovered an oil spill the size of seven football fields while out harvesting wheat says that when he found it, crude was bubbling up out of the ground. Farmer Steve Jensen said yesterday that he smelled the crude for days before the tires on his combines were coated in it. At the apparent break in the Tesoro Corp.'s underground pipeline, the oil was 'spewing and bubbling six inches high,' he said in a telephone interview yesterday. Vacuum trucks pictured cleaning up the oil in near Tioga, North Dakota - more than 20,000 barrels of crude oil have spewed out of a Tesoro Corp. oil pipeline in Steve Jensen's wheat field . What Jensen had found on September 29 turned out it was one of the largest spills recorded in the state. At 20,600 barrels, it was four times the size of a pipeline rupture in late March that forced the evacuation of more than 20 homes in Arkansas. But it was 12 days after Jensen reported the spill before state officials told the public what had happened, raising questions about how North Dakota, which is in the midst of an oil boom, reports such incidents. The spill happened in a remote area in the northwest corner of the state. The nearest home is a half-mile away, and Tesoro says no water sources were contaminated, no wildlife was hurt and no one was injured. The release of oil has been stopped, state environment geologist Kris Roberts said Thursday. And the spill, spread out over 7.3 acres, or about the size of seven football fields, has been contained. Jacob Wiedmer, who was helping Jensen harvest his wheat crop, likened the September 29 discovery to the theme song from The Beverly Hillbillies television show. What Jensen had found on Sept. 29 turned out it was one of the largest spills recorded in the state (map showing the area and pipeline) 'It was just like Jed Clampett shooting at some food...' he said of the oil coming from the ground. 'Except we weren't hunting, we were harvesting.' Gov. Jack Dalrymple, who says he wasn't even told about what happened until Wednesday night, said the state is now investigating its procedures for reporting spills. 'There are many questions to be answered on how it occurred and how it was detected and if there was anything that could have been done that could have made a difference,' Dalrymple said Thursday, when questioned at a news conference on a separate topic. 'Initially, it was felt that the spill was not overly large,' Dalrymple said. 'When they realized it was a fairly sizable spill, they began to contact more people about it.' The farmer likened his find to feeling like Jed Clampett from the Beverly Hillbillies (Buddy Ebsen pictured from the 1960s TV show) Jensen said he had harvested most of his wheat before the spill, but the land is no longer usable for planting. 'We expect not to be able to farm that ground for several years,' he said. Tesoro Logistics, a subsidiary of the San Antonio, Texas-based company that owns and operates parts of Tesoro's oil infrastructure, said in a statement that the affected portion of the pipeline has been shut down. 'Protection and care of the environment are fundamental to our core values, and we deeply regret any impact to the landowner,' Tesoro CEO Greg Goff said in a statement. 'We will continue to work tirelessly to fully remediate the release area.' Wayde Schafer, a North Dakota spokesman for the Sierra Club, said the spill is an example of the lack of oversight in a state that has exploded with oil development in recent years. 'We need more inspectors and more transparency,' Schafer said. 'Not only is the public not informed, but agencies don't appear to be aware of what's going on and that's not good.' Eric Haugstad, Tesoro's director of contingency planning and emergency response, said the hole in the 20-year-old pipeline was a quarter-inch in diameter. Tesoro officials were investigating what caused the hole in the 6-inch-diameter steel pipeline that runs underground about 35 miles from Tioga to a rail facility outside of Columbus, near the Canadian border. Roberts said state and federal regulators are monitoring the cleanup, and Tesoro estimated it would cost $4 million. A natural layer of clay more than 40 feet thick underlies the spill site and has 'held the oil up' so that it does not spread to underground water sources, Roberts said. 'It is completely contained and under control,' Roberts said Thursday. 'They got very lucky.'","The North Dakota spill, spread out over 7.3 acres, has been contained .

Calling the trial 'the most serious of my career', a Stevens County Superior Judge found the 11-year-old Fort Colville Elementary student who plotted to kill a female classmate earlier this year guilty of conspiring to commit first-degree murder. 'Simple anger – that is what fueled this,' Judge Allen Nielson said Friday afternoon, as the boy stood with arms folded behind his back, face pointed downward. Nielson rejected attempts by the boy’s defense team to cast him as an aloof gradeschooler, suffering from bipolar disorder and unable to separate fact from fiction while developing a two-week plot with another student to bring a gun and knife to school Feb. 7 to kill the girl 'because she was really annoying'. Guilty: A northeast Washington judge has convicted an 11-year-old boy of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in a fifth grade plot that targeted a female classmate. The boy, who cannot be identified, is shown here during the trial . Evidence: The court was shown the weapon the boy was caught with - a .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol, like this one . 'There is no joy in a conviction,' Stevens County Prosecutor Tim Rasmussen said. 'But there is relief that a plan to ruin young peoples’ lives was thwarted.' The boy was taken into custody immediately following Nielson’s ruling Friday, and was led from the courtroom in tears. Defense attorneys announced their intention Friday morning to let 'the court get to know (the accused) a little bit better'. 'Specifically, some of the issues (the accused) brings with him to this courtroom,' defense attorney Don Richter said. 'Those being his mental illness.' For more than two hours Friday, the second day of arguments in the trial, attorneys questioned Craig Beaver, a forensic psychologist based in Boise who examined the defendant multiple times following his arrest. Scene: Fort Colville Elementary in Washington where the murder plot was being planned . Aerial shot of Fort Colville Elementary student in east Washington . Richter used testimony to show his client suffers from periods of manic behavior during which he has an inflated sense of self and an inability to separate fact from fantasy, while prosecutors tried to poke holes in Beaver’s judgment. Beaver said he ran the accused through a battery of tests in May and June at the request of the defense team. The accused’s behavior was 'strongly suggestive of what we see with childhood bipolar disorder, which is relatively rare', Beaver said. The National Institute of Mental Health reports fewer than 3 percent of American adolescents display symptoms associated with the disorder. Nielson found defense attorneys argued successfully the boy displayed symptoms of bipolar disorder, but said his subsequent behavior that day did not illustrate a lack of awareness of the consequences of his actions. During an interview, school counselor Debbie Rogers testified the accused said he was planning to stab the girl to death because she was 'really annoying' and the second boy was to aim the gun at anyone who tried to intervene. Rogers said Friday she saw no evidence of the boy experiencing delusions the day the gun and knife were discovered. Earlier Friday, Nielson ruled that incriminating statements overheard in the halls of the Stevens County Courthouse by a probation officer and made to the official at Martin Hall were not admissible because the accused had not been notified of his rights. However, through the interview with Rogers, Nielson ruled sufficient evidence had been presented to prove the two boys had developed a plan and were ready to carry it out when the weapons were discovered. The co-defendant in the case pleaded guilty to all charges in March. He is serving a minimum three-year sentence in juvenile detention at a facility in Snoqualmie. A sentencing hearing has been scheduled for the 11-year-old next month. The conspiracy conviction is a felony under Washington state law.","Judge concludes 'simple anger' was behind murder scheme in Washington school .

"By . Stephen Wright . PUBLISHED: . 19:15 EST, 11 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:58 EST, 12 October 2013 . A Scotland Yard officer is to be disciplined for racially discriminating against Stephen Lawrence’s younger brother. The police watchdog has ordered the Met to bring misconduct proceedings against the officer, who followed and stopped teacher Stuart Lawrence as he drove home in his car last November. The Met’s professional standards unit had previously cleared the officer of any wrongdoing. Battle: Stuart Lawrence, pictured here with his mother Doreen, will be pleased the case of racial discrimination against him is being investigated . But after Mr Lawrence appealed, the Independent Police Complaints Commission has ruled that his allegation against the officer was ‘well founded’ and he should face a misconduct hearing. More than 20 other, unrelated allegations of racial discrimination – made against the Met by Mr Lawrence - were rejected by the IPCC. Last night Mr Lawrence urged Met chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe to take ‘robust and appropriate disciplinary action’ against the officer who is facing misconduct proceedings. ‘There is no place in the police service for officers who conduct themselves as he did,’ he told the Mail. The decision to partially uphold Mr Lawrence’s appeal is seen as a major embarrassment for Yard chiefs. The public inquiry into the 1993 murder of his brother Stephen, 18, accused Scotland Yard of being ‘institutionally racist’. Father-of-one Lawrence, 36, lodged a formal complaint with the Met in January (2013), alleging he had been stopped or searched by officers on 25 occasions since the age of 17. Tragic: In the years following Stephen Lawrence's death, his brother Stuart was stopped by police on numerous occasions . As revealed exclusively in the Mail, he claimed he had been targeted simply because of the colour of the skin. His patience finally snapped after he was stopped near the home he shared with his fiancée and young son in Peckham, South-east London, on the afternoon of November 16 last year. He was driving his three year old Volkswagen Scirocco when two officers pulled him over and checked his details. Mr Lawrence says that when he asked why he had been stopped, one of the officers replied he had been ‘naturally suspicious’ of him. After spending three months probing his various allegations, the Met’s Department of Professional Standards (DPS) concluded in April there was no evidence any of its officers acted inappropriately.But the IPCC has now upheld Mr Lawrence’s complaint about last November’s incident. The officer who was driving the police vehicle which followed Mr Lawrence’s car told investigators that he (Mr Lawrence) had stared at him as he drove past. He said he noticed that the man at the wheel was Afro-Caribbean ‘but could not make out any more than that’. In its report, a copy of which has been seen by the Mail, the IPCC said it did not find the ‘eye contact’ between Mr Lawrence and the police officer provided a ‘credible justification’ for the decision to follow him. It added that it was more likely than not that Mr Lawrence did not speed up or fail to indicate, as was alleged by the officer and a police colleague who was with him at the time. ‘On the balance of probability we conclude that the conduct took place as Mr Lawrence has alleged,’ it added. ‘In the absence of credible reasons as to why Mr Lawrence was followed and questioned we consider that his complaint that this was on the grounds of ethnicity is well founded.’ According to the IPCC report, 74 per cent of the police driver’s stops between September 2012 and March 2013 were on Afro-Caribbean people. It recommended he face a misconduct hearing for racial discrimination. Because he had never previously been in trouble and didn’t use offensive language in the incident with Mr Lawrence, he is unlikely to lose his job. His colleague who was also involved in the altercation with Mr Lawrence (last November) will not disciplined, the IPCC said. This, it explained, is because there is no evidence he influenced the driver’s decision to follow and stop Mr Lawrence, and was not aware of his race until he got out of his car. Mr Lawrence welcomed the IPCC’s decision to ‘partially’ uphold his appeal. He said: “The IPCC now recognises, on the basis of the evidence that it has seen, that the only reason I was stopped by police on the 16th November 2012, was because of my ethnic origin. This is the conclusion that the original officer investigating my complaint should have reached.

The victim of a vicious motorbike gang attack was seen today for the first time since he was brutally assaulted. Married father Alexian Lien left his Wall Street apartment on Friday in a hoodie, baseball cap and sunglasses. He was accompanied by a woman believed to be his mother or mother-in-law. He shielded himself from cameras as he hurried down the street in downtown Manhattan and entered a high-rise building. Scroll down for video . Hidden: Alexian Lien emerged on Friday from his New York home, the first time he has been seen since he was attacked by a gang of bikers . Terror: Mr Lien was gragged from his car and beaten by bikers on September 29 in front of his wife and two-year-old daughter on a New York highway . The emergence of the victim came as four more bikers accused of taking part in the September 29 assault appeared in court. Bikers Reginald Chance, Clint Caldwell and Craig Wright, as well as Officer Woljciech Braszczok made court appearances on Friday. Chance was in court on Friday morning and was the second indicted following Robert Sims. On Thursday, Sims who can allegedly be seen on video dragging the driver from the SUV and beating him , was indicted. Investigators continue to work to find out what roles other members of the gang may have played in the attack on a New York highway. Braszczok also appeared on Friday but covered his face with a hoodie on his way in and out of court. He is next scheduled to appear in February after he testifies before a grand jury. Caldwell was similarly not indicted and will appear before a grand jury next week. Suspect James Kuehne appeared in court on Thursday, as the one who allegedly hit Mr Lien repeatedly with his helmet. He has pleaded not guilty. During the chaotic incident, Alexian Lien ran over biker Edwin Mieses in his SUV. The biker was left with spinal injuries and may be paralyzed. Lien said he feared for the safety of his wife and two-year-old daughter who were in the Range Rover. He has not been charged with any crime. Admission: Matthew Rodriguez, 28, is assigned to the Internal Affairs Bureau and only admitted being part of the ride a few days ago, according to a report . The developments came as another NYPD officer reportedly came forward and admitted to being part of the biker gang, it was revealed on Thursday. Matthew Rodriguez, 28, who is . assigned to the Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB), only admitted being part . of the ride a few days ago, according to a DNAinfo report. It is unclear whether the five-year veteran played any part in the violence against SUV driver Alexian Lien. Rodriguez is part of the division which is currently investigating those involved in the attack. Detective Braszczok, 32, is charged with gang . assault in the first-degree, assault in the first degree and criminal . mischief in the third degree over his alleged role in the incident. His lawyer insisted he would be exonerated by the very video prosecutors claim incriminates him during the September 29 attack. 'The allegation is that he struck the rear portion hatchback window, which has a gaping hole already in it; it's already destroyed,' attorney John Arlia said. 'Under the law, it's a fatal flaw. You can't break what's already broken.' Mr Arlia said the video clearly shows Braszczok did not participate in the eventual attack on the SUV driver and was nowhere near him. Braszczok hasn't been charged with assaulting the driver, Alexian Lien, who authorities say was pulled from his Range Rover and beaten on the street by other motorcyclists.

A Massachusetts couple have been charged with manslaughter for allegedly killing their 5-month-old daughter by giving her a bottle of formula with heroin in it. Ryan Barry, 30, and Ashley Cyr, 26, both of Quincy, were arrested Friday. They pleaded not guilty and were ordered held on $200,000 cash bail. The couple's daughter, Mya Barry, died in September 2011, when the family lived in Marshfield, a half-hour drive southeast of Quincy. Monstrous charges: Ryan Barry, left, and Ashley Cyr, right, are led into Brockton, Mass., Superior Court for arraignment on charges of manslaughter in the death of their 5-month-old daughter by giving her a bottle of formula with heroin . Police responded to a 911 call and found the baby on the living room floor with her grandmother performing CPR on her, Plymouth County District Attorney Tim Cruz's office said. Baby Mya was rushed to South Shore Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead a short time later. Police said they found 3 grams of heroin and hypodermic needles on a shelf in a bedroom shared by Barry, Cyr, the baby and her two sisters, ages 3 and 4. Bad mother: Barry told police that he had seen Cyr snort heroin off a Dr. Seuss book and then leave the book on the floor . Prosecutor Frank Middleton said Barry told police that Cyr was reckless in her drug use and that he had seen her snort heroin off a Dr. Seuss book and then leave the book on the floor where the kids could get at it. Middleton said in court that Barry told police that at around 7.30am on September 23, 2011, he had made the baby's last bottle by mixing 2 ounces of formula with 2 ounces of water. He said that when Barry was pressed on how the heroin could have gotten into the bottle he said maybe someone had cleaned a dirty syringe in the water bottle he used to make the formula. Testing determined that the baby formula in the bottle contained heroin. An autopsy determined that the baby died from opiate poisoning. A grand jury returned manslaughter indictments against Barry and Cyr Thursday. Cyr also was charged with one count of reckless endangerment of a child. Middleton said in court that baby Mya . was born addicted to heroin because her mother had used the drug on a . daily basis during her pregnancy. Barry's . lawyer, Liam Scully, said that it was unclear who put the heroin in the . baby's bottle and that Barry denies any wrongdoing. 'He was devastated by the death of his daughter and is coping with that tragedy the best that he can,' Scully said. Excuse: Barry (right) told police that the heroin may have gotten into the formula he had prepared when someone had cleaned a dirty syringe in the water bottle he used . Cyr's lawyer didn't immediately return a call seeking comment Friday. Barry and Cyr are due back in court November 8 for a pretrial conference. The Boston Globe reported that Barry has had a number of run-ins with the law over the years. In 2006, he pleaded guilty to raping a girl younger than 16 years old during a drug- and alcohol-fueled party. He was sentenced to 2 ½ years in prison, but served 15 months and was placed on three years’ probation. Last April, the 30-year-old man also pleaded guilty to heroin possession.","Mya Barry, 5 months old, died in September 2011 from opiate poisoning after drinking formula laced with heroin .

Strong winds and heavy rains pounded India's eastern coastline today, as hundreds of thousands of people took shelter from a powerful cyclone that was expected to reach land in a matter of hours. Categorised as 'very severe' by weather forecasters, Cyclone Phailin is expected to hit Orissa and Andhra Pradesh states in the next few hours. The Meteorological Department predicted winds up to 136mph. Scroll down for video . Escape: Scores of evacuated villagers aboard a truck at a relief camp near Berhampur, India .

Black skies above Bhubaneshwar, the capital of Orissa state - which is expected to bear the brunt of the cyclone - continued 60 miles out to sea this morning. Roaring winds made palm trees sway wildly, while to the south of the state seawater was already pushing inland. By Friday evening, some 600,000 people had been moved to higher ground or shelters in Orissa, said Surya Narayan Patro - the state's top disaster management official. About 12 hours before Cyclone Phailin's expected landfall, meteorologists held out hope that it might hit while in a temporary weakened state.

'A . storm this large can't peter out that fast,' said Ryan Maue, a . meteorologist at Weather Bell, a private U.S. weather firm. 'There's . nothing to stop it at this point' he added. Maue said that even in the best-case . scenario there would be a storm surge - a giant wall of water that a . cyclone blasts ashore - of 20 to 30 feet. A storm surge causes a great deal of devastation in cyclones - usually even more than the strong winds. Effort: Indian rescue officials from the Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services lift a search and rescue boat . The . storm has been powerful for nearly 36 hours and . those winds have built up tremendous amount of surge, Maue said.

However, the U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Hawaii forecast maximum sustained winds of 167 mph, with gusts up to 196 mph. Indian officials also made less dire predictions about the storm surge, saying only that it would be 10 feet high. In . Bhubaneshwar, government workers and volunteers were putting together . hundreds of thousands of food packages to be distributed at relief . camps. The state's top official, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, appealed for people to cooperate with officials as they order people to leave their homes. 'I request everyone to not panic.

In Paradip, the Orissa port city . hammered in a 1999 cyclone, at least seven ships were put to sea to ride . out the storm, with other boats shifted to safer parts of the harbor, . officials said. U.S. forecasters repeatedly warned that the storm would be immense. 'If it's not a record it's really, really close,' University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy said. 'You really don't get storms stronger than this anywhere in the world ever. This is the top of the barrel' To . compare it to killer U.S. storms, McNoldy said cyclone Phailin is . nearly the size of Hurricane Katrina, which killed 1,200 people in 2005 . and caused devastating flooding in New Orleans.

Coastline: A man walks past high waves of the Bay of Bengal at Gopalpur beach in Ganjam district .

Officials have been stockpiling emergency food supplies, and setting up shelters for people expected to flee the heavy winds and rains. The Indian air force said four transport planes and 18 helicopters were being kept ready for relief operations in the region.

Benjamin Heale has been jailed after he parked so close to a police car that an officer was able to smell his stash of skunk . A drug dealer was caught after he parked so close to a police car that an officer was able to smell his stash of skunk. Benjamin Heale was caught with £3,000 worth of home-grown drugs after recruiting a friend to drive him from one side of Tiverton, Devon, to the other with the drugs. Police constable Saren Isaac was two cars away from Heale as he pulled into a Tesco superstore. The dealer got out for a soft drink, leaving his passenger window open and the strong smelling drugs on the seat. While he was inside the store the Pc went to investigate and arrested him as he came out of the shop. He tried to blame his friend, John Soundy, who was giving him the lift, but Heale's fingerprints were found inside the two ziplock bags which contained almost half a kilo of skunk. Heale, 27, of Tiverton, denied possession with intent to supply but was found guilty by a jury at Exeter Crown Court. Soundy, 27, also of Tiverton, admitted the same charge. Heale was jailed for 12 months by Recorder Paul Grumbar at Exeter Crown Court. Soundy was jailed for four months, suspended for 18 months. The judge said Heale’s case was aggravated by previous convictions for cannabis dealing, telling him: 'The difficulty with you is that you don’t seem to have learned your lesson. 'It may have been different if you had admitted your role rather than trying to blame Mr Soundy. 'This was a substantial amount of cannabis worth a significant amount of money and you clearly had a significant role.' Soundy was told he was not being sent straight to jail because his role was lesser, he had admitted the offence and had given evidence at Heale’s trial. During a two day case, Pc Isaac told the jury how she recognised the smell of the drugs and arrested first Soundy, then Heale. She said: 'The smell of the cannabis was intense.' She added that Soundy tried to take all the blame but later changed his story and explained he had only been giving his friend a lift because Heale did not want to carry the cannabis through the streets. Police constable Saren Isaac was two cars away from Heale as he pulled into a Tesco superstore car park . Soundy told the jury he lied to police on the day of the search because he owed Heale money and was trying to do him a favour. Heale told the jury he texted his friend to ask for a lift and noticed the smell of the drugs as soon as he got into the van. He said he looked in the bag and saw the cannabis but it was not his and he had nothing to do with it. James Taghdissian, defending, said Soundy’s life had moved on since 2011 and he now has a young child, steady relationship and well paid job and had turned his back on cannabis. Malcolm Clarke, for Heale, said he has also turned over a new leaf, is working for an engineering firm, and helps his girlfriend look after her three young children.","Benjamin Heale was jailed for 12 months after being caught at a Tesco .

A formidable beast weighing several tonnes, the fully grown male was hit by the Siliguri-Alipurduar Express passenger train yesterday while crossing the track in West Bengal's Dooars Forest, near the village of Mongpong. The line had to be completely shut down while staff worked to remove the magnificent creature. Death track: The bull elephant completely blocks the line after being hit by a high-speed passenger train . Tragic: The recovery train prepares to winch the carcass of the elephant off the line so it can be reopened . The . death is yet another reminder of the dangers that India's trains pose to elephants. At least five elephants have been knocked down and killed by speeding trains in the past two years. Opened in 1949, the track traverses  five forests densely populated with elephants - Buxa, Jaldapara, Gorumara, Chapramari and Mahananda. Throughout . its length, it criss-crosses common jungle tracks, which are corridors . for elephant herds migrating from Assam to the Nepal forests through the . Dooars. Casualties have been a common feature of life around the track ever since. In response to the problem, speeds were restricted to 50km. Chief Wildlife Warden NC Bahuguna . said: 'There is a need to further restrict the speed limit of the . trains on the Siliguri-Alipurduar stretch. We are discussing on lowering . the speed limit to below 25 km.' Death tracks: Nearly 40 elephants have been killed along the track since it was upgraded in 2004 .

Grim spectacle: Villages and railway workers gather to watch the tragic sight as the elephant is removed . Since the tracks on the 163-km long route were converted to broad gauge in 2004, speeding trains have mowed down nearly 40 elephants. Speaking about the plans to upgrade the line in 2001, state forest minister Jogesh Burman predicted it would be 'a cancer for our wildlife'. He was speaking against the back drop of a baby elephant that had been struck down in Mongpong. The calf was badly injured with a pelvic fracture and rescuers had to risk their lives to treat it. The mother of the calf stood over its dying baby fiercely guarding it, and other members of the heard waited in the forest nearby. On Thursday, the carcass of an elephant was found with its head chopped off on the outskirts of  Neora Valley National Park in Kalimpong subdivision.

Firefighters in England and Wales are to stage a fresh strike in their bitter row with the Government over pensions. Members of the Fire Brigades Union will walk out for five hours on the night of October 19 in opposition to plans to force them to work longer. They argue firefighters cannot be expected to continue answering 999 calls 'in their late 50s and into their 60s' but ministers said the latest industrial action was 'unconstructive and unnecessary'. Strike: Firefighters will walk out for five hours next weekend in protest at changes to their pensions . The FBU said members will walk out for five hours from from 6.30pm on Saturday October 19. It follows a similar stoppage last month as the stand-off with the government escalates. Union general secretary Matt Wrack said: ‘We had hoped our first strike was enough to show Government that firefighters could not be more serious about protecting public safety and ensuring fair pensions. ‘No firefighter wants to strike, and it's desperately disappointing that governments in Westminster and Cardiff continue to deny reality over pensions costs and the need for a pension scheme that reflects the job firefighters do. Age: FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said firefighters cannot be expected to fight fires in their 50s and 60s . ‘Firefighters simply cannot be expected to fight fires and rescue families in their late 50s and into their 60s. ‘We hope this second strike will mean both governments will be willing to discuss the full range of concerns that firefighters and the general public have expressed. ‘However, more strikes cannot be ruled out if that's what it takes to protect public and firefighter safety from these ludicrous attacks.’ Firefighters in Scotland will not be taking industrial action following an offer on pensions from the Scottish Government which the union said was enough to prevent a strike ‘at the current time’. The FBU argues that changes to pensions and the retirement age will see thousands of firefighters lose their job ‘simply for getting older’. The union also maintains that firemen and women pay some of the highest pension contributions in the UK at almost 13 per cent of their salary, with further rises due next year. But the government accused the FBU of a rush to strike action instead of seeking a resolution to the dispute. Fire Minister Brandon Lewis said the decision to announce another strike date is 'totally unconstructive and unnecessary'. He added: 'The FBU themselves have said that this dispute can only be resolved through dialogue, discussion and negotiation. 'The firefighters' pension scheme is one of the most generous pension schemes in the public sector.' A firefighter who earns £29,000, and retires after a full career aged 60, will get a £19,000 a year pension, rising to £26,000 with the state pension, the government says. An equivalent private pension pot would be worth over half a million pounds and require firefighters to contribute twice as much. Mr Lewis added: 'The firefighter pension age of 60 was introduced in 2006 and matches the police and armed forces. 'Any early ill-health retirements will see an unreduced pension. Firefighter fitness is decided by local fire and rescue authorities so the union needs to work with them to resolve that issue. 'We have informed the FBU that we will support that process with the conciliation service Acas as required.' Row: The latest walkout against government cuts 'is totally unconstructive and unnecessary', the government said . Fire chiefs moved to reassure the public that safety would not be put at risk. London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said: ‘We are as prepared as ever to deal with this next round of strike action. It's a shame that further action is being taken, but our contingency plan will kick in and we will be ready to deal with emergencies. ‘There will be 27 fire engines based at strategic points across London, ready to provide an emergency back-up fire service. They won't deal with minor incidents like bin fires or automatic fire alarms, but will attend serious emergencies like large fires and road traffic accidents. ‘Once again, our advice is to take extra care to prevent fires at home. Simple steps like ensuring your hob is switched off and cigarettes are properly extinguished can make all the difference.’","Fire Brigades Union orders fresh industrial action in England and Wales .

Robert Wills was today awarded £30,000 pounds by an employment tribunal while still in prison serving time for the possession of child porn images . A convicted paedophile serving time in prison has been awarded more than £30,000 after suing his former employers from his prison cell. Robert Wills took RWE Npower to a tribunal after they refused to pay him a redundancy settlement after reading about his sentence for child pornography in the local paper. The former power station worker was being made redundant following the closure of a plant in Didcot, Oxfordshire, when he admitted making indecent images of children. After reading of his sentence his employers suspended his holiday pay and cancelled a redundancy package, arguing he had 'frustrated' his contract by not being available to work. However, Ian Van Maanen, from the Citizens' Advice Bureau, successfully . argued that as Wills was on agreed leave at the time and was not . expected back at work before his job came to an end, he was not in . breach of his contract. He also said that Wills had no moral or legal duty to tell his employers of the criminal case because it did not involve them. In February Wills was sentenced to two years behind bars after admitting 10 charges, including making indecent images, intentionally encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence and distributing indecent photos. Employment Judge Andrew Gumbiti-Zimuto . said: 'In this case it is said on the behalf of the claimant that the . contract is not frustrated by his imprisonment because there was no . requirement for the claimant to be at work. 'He was on leave. Whether the claimant . was in Bullingdon (Prison) or in Benidorm, it made no difference to the . contract of employment.' Wills was being made redundant from Didcot Power Station when he admitted the offences causing RWE Npower to cancel his payments because he had 'frustrated' his contract by not being available to work . He said RWE Npower had cancelled the payment as Wills was not available to work while he was in prison. However, the judge told the tribunal parties: 'My conclusion is that the contract was not frustrated. Imprisonment does not automatically end the employment. 'In this case the claimant was not expected to enter work, whether in prison or out, before the contract of employment expired. 'The claimant's imprisonment has not made any contractual obligation incapable of being performed - he was not required to work.' In his judgement, Mr Gumbiti-Zimuto said he was awarding Wills £5,850 in statutory redundancy, £24,953 for breach of contract and £1,731 in holiday pay.","Robert Wills was being made redundant from Didcot Power Station .

A mother who created false alibis for her murdering son and his friend has been imprisoned for two years. Maria Keane, 37, told police her then 16-year-old son George Keane and his friend Luke Garner had been watching DVDs at her house on the night of December 23. But her lie was exposed when other evidence was uncovered that led the pair to be convicted of the murder of David Scott on the same evening. Alibi: Maria Keane, left, gave a false witness statement to her police saying her son George, right, was watching DVDs at home when in fact he was involved in a murder . The teenagers were jailed indefinitely last month and Maria Keane has received a two-year prison sentence for perverting the course of justice after she gave a false witness statement. Mr Scott, a father-of-two, was repeatedly stabbed by the killers in Stanley, County Durham. Stabbed: David Scott, the father-of-two who was killed by the two youths before Christmas last year . Garner was arrested five days later and in police interviews said he had been at Maria Keane's home. When police checked out the story, Maria Keane told police her son and his friend had been with her watching TV at her house that night and had stayed there until noon the next day. When further evidence came to light George Keane was arrested on December 31 - and repeated his claim. But CCTV showed him away from the house and a witness said he had confessed what had really happened. Sentencing her at Newcastle Crown . Court, Judge James Goss QC said: 'With you they concocted a false alibi . where it was agreed you would all say George Keane and Luke Garner were . in your house and in your company in the period when they were in fact . involved in killing David Scott. 'You gave a witness statement which gave them a cast iron alibi and they gave the same account. 'This . was deliberate lying to deflect possible blame for a crime of homicide . and the seriousness of this type of offence merits a custodial . sentence.' Maria Keane was arrested on January 4 for perverting the course of justice. After her arrest Maria Keane changed her story to try to fit in with other evidence the police had gathered. Accomplice: Luke Garner, who was also convicted of the murder, was jailed along with George Keane . The mother-of-seven - who is currently pregnant with her eighth chid - has two previous convictions for child neglect from 2003 and 2005 and one for animal cruelty in 2011. The court heard George was not living with her at the time and had been in care. Maria Keane pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice. Peter Sabiston, defending, said: 'It was a moral dilemma with it being her son and a really serious allegation. 'She is poorly equipped to deal with the traumas in her life. 'She has seven children and is expecting another child.' David Scott sustained five stab wounds to his upper body, four to his back and one to the right front side of his abdomen, in the attack just after 1am the day before Christmas Eve last year. One of the stab wounds to his back penetrated a lung, causing internal bleeding into his chest cavity and effectively suffocating him. Keane and Garner, both now 17, were given indefinite sentences. They will serve a minimum of 14 years in prison.","George Keane, then 16, stabbed to death David Scott in December .

This is the moment a thief was arrested after neighbours trapped him inside the vehicle he was trying to steal. Matthew Draper, 27, brazenly asked owner Tanya Miles' neighbour to move his vehicle so he could drive off. However, his plan was foiled when the neighbour spoke to Miss Miles' mother and asked who he was. Red handed: Matthew Draper is arrested by police after neighbours trapped him inside a car . When they realised he was a stranger, the neighbours held the doors shut so he couldn't escape from the vehicle - a Smart Roadster. Draper, from Swansea, Wales, tried to and force his way out of the car and when that failed, he started to vandalise the car's interior. Miss Miles, the car's owner, returned home and watched Draper as he frantically tried to escape, pointing the screwdriver at those keeping him inside. At one point Draper spat at her before attempting to kick in the window. The whole thing was filmed by the neighbour. Gotcha! The thief, pictured sitting in the passenger seat, was trapped in the car - A Smart Roadster . Vandalise: Trapped Draper pictured from above, began to damage the inside of the car, pictured, in a desperate bid to be freed before police arrived . When police arrived, they searched Draper and found a camera belonging to Miss Miles in his pocket. He admitted criminal damage, theft, going equipped and failing to provide a specimen of breath in relation to the incident at Swansea Crown Court. He was jailed for 32 months. Draper also pleaded guilty to theft of a car CD player and burglary for a separate incident. The court heard that Draper and another man went to the home of Dean Thompson on June 26. The second, unknown man, told Mr Thompson that a stereo he had been sold belonged to him. Arrest: Draper, who also pocketed a camera kept in the car, was removed by Swansea police, pictured . When he refused to give it back, the pair pushed past him and knocked him to the floor but he was on crutches at the time having broken his leg four days earlier. The pair picked up the stereo and left, leaving Mr Thompson on the floor. Draper has a number of previous convictions including offences of assault, shoplifting and burglary. Giles Hayes, for Draper, said his client's offending was linked to his drug use. He said his life had been relatively stable after his release from prison but that fellow users had contacted him through social media and he went back to drugs. Judge Huw Davies told him his drug use had left him 'out of control'.

Orlando Cruz is after a world boxing title tonight but his bout in the ring is nothing compared to the battle for acceptance the gay boxer has been fighting for years. For 12 years the Olympic sportsman hid his sexuality, fearing the reaction of the macho boxing world, but the featherweight champion is now out, proud - and wearing the rainbow shorts to prove it. Being comfortable with who he is has been a struggle for Cruz, who first realized he was gay after competing for Puerto Rico in the 2000 Olympics. Champ: Orlando Cruz will wear rainbow shorts as a nod to the LGBT community . Big fight: Cruz, left, is taking on Orlando Salido, right, for a world champion title in Las Vegas . 'I was not happy with my life. I would feel a lot of pressure, and inside, I felt weighed down. I cried at night hoping the pain would go away,' he told CSN. He eventually told his parents he was gay but, although his mother accepted him his father became distant. As the 126lb boxer's career began to turn professional, suspicions about his sexuality circulated. He recalled how a crowd turned hostile and verbally abused him in 2008, and said he denied he was gay to his own promoter, Oscar De La Hoya. '[Oscar] . once asked me quite openly before a fight, ""Orlando, tell me, are you . going to tell people that you are gay?’"",' Cruz said. 'There were other . people standing around us, too. Boxers. Managers. I was shocked and . said, ""No, I'm a man"".' Cruz could only hide for so long and, with the help of a therapist and his new promoter Tuto Zabala, the 32-year-old finally had the courage to tell the world he was gay in October last year. Pride: The boxer says he feels liberated after finally admitting he is gay . Settled: Cruz with his boyfriend José Manuel who he is due to marry later in the year . Acceptance: The boxer, who is 'out and proud', wears rainbow shorts when he fights . 'I feel liberated. I feel free,' Cruz, who is due to marry his boyfriend José Manuel in New . York later this year said.  'I [came out] so I can also be a better boxer. Now I have . respect in the streets and the ring.' The couple would also like to adopt children from Puerto Rico, although the country currently doesn't allow same-sex marriages or adoptions. Coming out has brought worldwide support for Cruz, who was inducted into the National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame over the summer. And, as he tries to make history by becoming the first openly gay man to win a world title, Cruz will pay homage to his sexuality by wearing rainbow shorts in a nod to the LGBT community. He has also dedicated the fight to the memory of former world champion Emile Griffith, who died aged 75 in July, and waited decades after retiring before he admitted he was bisexual. For all Cruz's fears of being rejected by fellow boxers and fans, Orlando Salido, the man he will face in the ring tonight has also been supportive. Prepared: Cruz is ready for the fight of his life as he goes after a world title . 'I admire him for what he’s done,' Salido said. 'At the end of the day, we’re just two . human beings fighting for a world title.' The fight is a once in a lifetime opportunity for Cruz, however, who is determined to win. 'It's the most important fight of my life. I'm a gay man, but I'm also a boxer,' he told the Guardian. 'My two worlds have come together and I will fight with all my heart. The world knows the truth about me as a man. Now the world will see the truth about me as a fighter. I'm ready. This is my time.'","Orlando Cruz preparing for once in a lifetime fight in Las Vegas .

Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson first met his recently deceased son while he was on life support after the beating that eventually claimed his life. It has been revealed that the NFL star only learned of the child as recently as two months ago after the boy’s mother started having paternity tests done to try to find his father. Once told of the young boy, Mr Peterson didn’t even question the possibility he was the father, instead offering to help any way he could, according to TMZ. The now-married footballer was actually planning a trip to South Dakota to visit his son later this month, sources told the site. When word of the vicious assault on the boy reached the former MVP, Mr Peterson was on the soonest flight to Sioux Falls that he could find, the site reported. Word of Mr Peterson's link to the beaten child surfaced after reports he missed practice to attend to a personal matter came to light.

An aide to the Republican candidate running against Newark, NJ, Mayor Cory Booker for the state’s vacant Senate seat has been fired after a profane rant questioning his rival’s sexuality. Stephen Lonegan aide Rick Shaftan was fired after an explicit tirade to Talking Points Memo about Mr Booker’s unwillingness to ‘take advantage of the perks of office’ during interaction the Newark mayor had with a vegan stripped from Oregon, concluding he tweets like ‘a gay guy.’ Published Friday, the rant came after Mr Shaftan was asked why he felt Mr Lonegan was gaining in the polls against his more well-known rival. The misguided attack also saw the strategist compare Mr Booker to disgraced former senators Larry Craig and Gary Hart. Misguided: Republican operative Rick Shaftan's rant against Newark Mayor Cory Booker cost him his job . Mr Shaftan’s first shots at the mayor were directed at his Twitter exchange last month with the stripper. It was just weird. I mean, to me, you know, hey, if he said, 'Hey, you got really hot breasts man, I'd love to suck on them.' Then like, yeah, cool. But like, he didn't say that,’ Mr Shaftan explained to TPM. ‘It was like kind of like, I don't know, it was like what a gay guy would say to a stripper,’ Mr Shaftan continued. ‘It's the way he was talking to her. It's just like like there was no sexual interest at all.’ The Lonegan aide then bragged that if he was single and a stripped was tweeting him, that he ‘might take advantage of the perks of the office.’ They've even met!: Mr Shaftan posted this picture, taken with Newark Mayor Cory Booker, to his Facebook page . Mr Booker met stripper Lynsie Lee while filming a still-unreleased documentary about Twitter, according to TPM. The Twitter exchange between the two, which BuzzFeed made public last month, was brief and fairly innocuous. ‘And the East Coast loves you and by the East Coast, I mean me,’ Booker wrote. ‘Well now I'm blushing :),’ Ms Lee replied. ""Its only fair,’ Booker retorted. The faux-controversy soon blew over. A Booker adviser even joked that the real story was that a vegan strip club exists. She caught someone's attention: Mr Shaftan ridiculed Mr Booker for not 'taking advantage of the perks of office' after not taking things further with vegan stripper Lynsie Lee . The messages in question: This Twitter exchange gave mr Shaftan fits, leading him to say Mr Booker tweets like a 'gay man' Big fan: Ms Lee's prolific appreciation of Mr Booker via Twitter shows up almost daily, she has even claimed to 'have dibs on First Lady' The mayor himself touted the Twitter exchange as proof he is still ‘engaging with people no matter what their profession,’ TPM noted. Remarking about the non-stop flood of naked pics posted to social media by the gregarious stripper, Mr Lonegan gnashed his teeth over Booker’s lack of interest. ‘I don't know who she is. I don't know anything about her.' Get the f**k out of here dude,’ Mr Shaftan ranted. ‘You can't follow her Twitter page and not know she's got those great breasts. How do you f*****g not know?’ ‘Who does this guy really want to work for? Who's he representing?’ Mr Shaftan wondered aloud. The unhinged aide also questioned the frontrunner’s willingness to allow speculation over his sexuality to continue, his fondness for pedicures and Hollywood fundraisers. You're fired!: Stephen Lonegan immediately fired Mr Shaftan and apologized for his remarks . ‘I love seeing on Twitter when someone says I’m gay, and I say, ‘So what does it matter if I am? So be it,’ Mr Booker said earlier this year. ‘I hope you are not voting for me because you are making the presumption that I’m straight.’ The soon-to-be-fired aide’s rant began to finish up after he compared Mr Booker to former Senators Larry Craig and Gary Hart. Mr Craig’s political career came to a screeching halt after he was busted in an airport sex sting trying to solicit sex in a men’s bathroom, infamously tapping his foot on the ground between stalls. Mr Hart’s numerous affairs, most notably with Donna Rice, brought a disastrous end to his 1988 presidential candidacy. No comment: Mr Booker has not publicly remarked on Mr Shaftan's comments . Finally satisfied he had exorcised all of the Booker demons from his system, Mr Shaftan touted his candidates ‘surging’ place in the polls. Mr Lonegan fired him almost immediately after the article was published Friday afternoon, and publicly apologized for his comments. Mr Booker has not publicly addressed the incendiary comments. Neither he, nor his campaign could be reached by MailOnline. This is the second time in recent months a New York-area political aide's ranting has been highlighted on TPM. Anthony Weiner aide Barbara Morgan cursed an intern during a July rant to the site. Mr Weiner declined to fire her.

Paedophiles are blackmailing children into performing sex acts by secretly filming them and threatening to share the images if they don't take part in sex games, a charity has claimed. Abusers are using sites like Facebook, Skype and Chatroulette to help find youngsters who have access to webcams, before targeting hacking their PCs and laptops. They exploit computer viruses which can grant access to a victim's computer, enabling them to turn on the webcam of a bedroom computer and begin recording. Going online: Paedophiles are using computer viruses to get access to a victims webcam . (file picture) A charity has claimed that this type of crime is being reported to them more frequently as computers with in-built cameras become commonplace in homes. Anti-online bullying and harassment foundation, the Cybersmile Foundation, said that hackers can track down their victims using special search engines. Once a child has been identified, the attacker uses computer viruses known as trojans which rants them remote access to the targeted PC. When the connection is established, the hacker will turn on the webcam and begin secretly recording the victim. The only way for the webcam's owner to know their machine has been tampered with is if a small light or LED flashes when recording. Scott Freeman, the founder of Cybersmile, said the issue is 'one of the scariest things we have seen'. He said: '(The blackmailers) have this material, them getting dressed or undressed or whatever. 'They want them to do more, to do sexual stuff. I have got my daughter to put a plaster over her webcam, that is how real the worry is.' The charity confirmed that they have received five reports of this type of blackmail in the last three months. Only one in every 15 people caught viewing paedophile images online is arrested according to latest figures . Mr Freeman said: 'If we are getting people contacting us then the real number of victims is obviously much, much higher.' This year a hacker in America was jailed after for accessing the webcam of the current Miss Teen USA and taking pictures of her while she was naked. Internet safety expert Charles Conway, told The Daily Telegraph: 'Users will be tricked into downloading a virus, which may be embedded in a simple piece of software such as a screensaver, or included in a download of a popular music album or movie downloaded from a pirate website or file sharing service.' He said hackers have accessed cameras in children's bedrooms, daycare centres, living rooms and restaurants and have reported being able to take control of cameras, moving them and taking footage remotely. He added: 'Parents would never allow a stranger to take a photo of their child in the park or the swimming pool, but by not taking simple precautionary measures this could be happening in their child's bedroom.'

Jeff Sessions and Republican Policy Committee Chairman John Barrasso read a copy of Obama's budget plan . The Daily Dot reports that Senator Barrasso is a 61-year-old Presbyterian and a . remarried father of three. He openly speaks against gay right's and women's . rights. He's been divorced once. Barrasso is on Facebook and on Twitter. The Washington Post reports that in 2004 Barrasso said, 'I . believe in limited government, lower taxes, less spending, traditional family . values, local control and a strong national defense...' He continued, 'In the state Senate, in addition to receiving . an 'A' rating from the NRA, I have voted for prayer in schools, against gay . marriage and have sponsored legislation to protect the sanctity of life.' Rogers was once named . by The Washington Post as, 'the most feared man on [Capitol] Hill' for his . perfect track record of outing ultra-conservative gay politicians. Over the past ten years he's outed Larry, Craig, Mark Foley, . David Dreier, Ken Mehlman, Edward Schrock, Ed Koch, and Charlie Crist. Rep. David Dreier was reported gay by Micheal Rogers . Florida Governor Charlie Crist is also a gay politician who Rogers exposed . U.S. Senator Larry Craig was also one of Rogers unlucky political targets . Rogers runs a tip-line called BlogActive, a site aimed . at shedding light on hypocritical lawmakers. Rogers was also the main attraction in Kirby Dick's 2009 . documentary entitled, 'Outrage.' The film followed Rogers as he outed gay politicians. Rogers is known to out politicians way before media outlets . share information with the public. According to Rogers, he is not trying to expose politicians . for personal satisfaction, he outs them to point out how their political . decisions don't mirror their behavior. He started investigating and outing politicians in February . of 2004 out of anger for Karl Rove and Ken Mehlman. He claimed they were . running marriage amendments to get Bush back into office. Rogers acknowledges how social media has changed the way . politicians and ordinary people communicate. Rogers uses his twitter account as . a tool to poke fun at those who seek to poke out rights of others. U.S. Senator Rand Paul (L) talks with Senator John Barrasso (2nd L, seated) and Senator Johnny Isakson (3rd L, back to camera) on some political matters . 'The explosion of social media as a primary form of . communication has been a double-edged sword,' said Rogers. 'On one hand, it's a wonderful tool for people to reach out, . make connections, share news, and conduct research. On the other hand, we have . seen the damage that misinformation on the Web can cause. Stock market plummets . and unfairly ruined reputations are just two of the consequences of this . shift,' he continued. Rogers takes responsibility for showing corruption in . government only when politicians act irresponsibly by using their political viewpoints to hide their identity. He states, 'People are entitled to privacy and the exposure . of someone's sexual orientation without their permission is unacceptable to me. Reporting on the hypocrisy of those who represent us in government? That's an . entirely different matter.' Mark Rogers said that over the years his feelings of anger . have turned into pity. He recognizes that some people are trying to lead . truthful lives. He makes an example, of . former New Jersey Senator Jim McGreevy who he says, ‘taught us a very important . lesson.’ Rogers mentions how years ago, politicians would say they were corrupt to . hide that fact that they were gay, and now they come out as gay to mask their . corruption. Who is Mark Rogers' next target? Tea Party Congressman Adrian Smith is under fire.  He voted against reauthorizing the Violence . Against Women Act and against repealing Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, as did Barrasso. Rogers tweeted at him on Sept. 30: .","Blogger Mark Rogers has a perfect track record for outing gay politicians .
John Barrasso votes against rights for gays and for women .

More than 3,300 security passes to gain access to heart of government have been lost since the coalition was formed, new figures reveal. Ministers were accused of failing to grips with a threat to security after admitting the equivalent of nine passes is lost every day. Embarrassingly a third of the passes were lost by officials at the Home Office – the department charged with protecting national security. Pass out: New figures reveal how staff Whitehall departments have lost more than 3,300 security passes in the last three years . Guidance advising that staff are ‘to be vigilant with their passes and staff ID cards’ is now being reviewed in a bid to get a grip on the problem. To date the message does not seem to be getting through, with just 12 departments admitting to losing 3,331 passes since May 2010. Jon Ashworth, Labour’s shadow minister without portfolio, told MailOnline: ‘Since 2010, ministers have managed to allow over 3,000 security passes go missing under their watch - including more than 1,100 at the Home Office which is responsible for our national security. ‘And of course we don't know the full scale of the problem because some big government departments have refused to come clean - so much for transparency. ‘Every time a pass is lost or stolen, there is a potential security risk.   These bumbling ministers need to get a grip.’ The worst offender is the Department . for Transport, where a total of 1,173 departmental identity cards or . passes have been reported lost or stolen at the ministry and its . quangos. Transport minister Stephen Hammond . said: ‘All staff are contractually required to look after identity cards . and passes. Guidance to staff is currently being reviewed.’ However the most worrying figures are at the Home Office, where 1,105 passes have been lost or stolen. The ministry in charge of national . security admitted the figure could be much higher, because it does not . include passes which were later found. Missing in action: Staff at the Home Office have lost 1,105 security passes since May 2010 . Home Office minister James Brokenshire said: ‘The loss of any Government asset, which includes Home Office building passes and staff ID cards, is treated very seriously. ‘All staff must report the loss to their respective departmental security unit without delay. ‘Each loss is investigated and recorded. As soon as a loss is reported to security immediate measures are taken to de-activate the access control capability. ‘Departmental security personnel constantly remind staff to be vigilant with their passes and staff ID cards.’ The Department for Education admitted losing 261 passes, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills 205, the Foreign Office 140 and the Treasury 128. Staff at the Department for International Development lost 136 passes, Department of Health 68, Scotland Office 10, Wales Office 3 and Northern Ireland office two.

He once said he joined a rock band ‘to get rich, to get famous and to get laid’. Now Bob Geldof can add ‘to fly into space’ to the list. Yesterday the Boomtown Rats frontman said he will become the first Irishman and the first rock star to fly out of the earth’s atmosphere. Geldof will be propelled at 2,200mph in a space shuttle to 64 miles above earth. Wearing an astronaut’s suit and helmet, the 61-year-old will only have the pilot for company during the one-hour commercial space flight. He will sit inside a Lynx Mark II shuttle powered by four rocket engines which will take off from a normal runway. The singer and campaigner was given the £64,000 ticket as a birthday present after he performed a gig at a corporate event in the Natural History Museum. His will be one of 100 people who the Space Expedition Corporation is hoping to launch into space next year. Geldof said: ‘Being the first Irishman in space is not only a fantastic honour, but pretty mind-blowing. The first rock astronaut space rat. ‘Elvis may have left the building, but Bob Geldof will have left the planet. Wild. Who would have thought it possible in my lifetime? ‘Who wouldn’t want to leave the planet and have a look? I’d be afraid, but that’s another reason to do it - just the wonder of it.’ The singer was due to start training in a flight simulator this weekend, but admitted there were some teething problems. He added: ‘(My training) was supposed to start in Holland in a simulator on Sunday but the simulator broke down, so it doesn’t bode well.’ The website of the private space company claims members of the public are welcome to apply for a ticket - as long as they have a spare £64,000. Describing the experience, the expedition website says: ‘At an altitude of nearly 37 miles, the pilot switches off the engines. The parabolic flight begins. 'The crew experiences weightlessness for several minutes. The Lynx Mark II reaches apogee (highest point) at 64 miles. The official frontier of space begins at 62 miles. ‘A place where the sky is completely black, despite the sunshine.

When Adrian Peterson was seven, he saw his older brother die in a bike accident after being hit by a drunken driver. For Peterson's teenage years, his father was in prison. He grew up poor in east Texas. Shortly before the Minnesota Vikings drafted him in 2007, a half-brother, was shot and killed. Long before Peterson began running through the NFL record book, he learned to turn tragedy into fuel for an exceptional career. Football has always been his escape, and now he's dealing with more off-the-field strife. Devastated: Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson has known suffering his whole life which has helped him cope with the brutal death of his two-year-old son . One of Peterson's sons, a victim of alleged child abuse, died on Friday of severe head injuries suffered in the attack. The man charged in the case, Joseph Patterson, was home alone with the two-year-old boy on Wednesday and called 911 to report he was choking, according to police. Patterson was the boyfriend of the child's mother. Peterson missed practice on Thursday to be in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where the boy lived with his mother and Patterson. He returned to the Vikings on Friday. 'Things that I go through, I've said a thousand times, it helps me play this game to a different level,'he said after practice, about an hour after the child's death. 'I'm able to kind of release a lot of my stress through this sport, so that's what I plan on doing.' Twitter has been filled with public . condolences for Peterson and his loved ones. From LeBron James to Barry . Sanders to Josh Groban, his peers, opponents and admirers expressed . their sadness and support. 'Praying . for you and your family. May God give you the strength,' tweeted New . York Giants defensive end Justin Tuck, whose team plays the Vikings on . October 21. The Vikings play Carolina on Sunday, and Peterson promised to participate. 'I'll be ready to roll, focused,' he said. That's no surprise to anyone who's known him. 'The . death of his brother at that young age drove him to want to be the very . best that he could be,' said Steve Eudey, who was Peterson's youth . football coach and a mentor to him growing up. 'Because in his opinion, Brian was always better than he was and he felt he had to live up to those expectations.' Charged: Joseph Robert Patterson, 27,  is charged with aggravated battery of an infant and aggravated assault. It emerged in court that he had previously been charged over domestic violence . Peterson's relationship with the dead son was not known publicly, but the boy did not carry Peterson's name. Peterson has another son, Adrian Jr., who lives with him, he confirmed on Twitter on Saturday in attempt to clarify his family situation. 'He's a wonderful human being,' said Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops, who coached Peterson in college. 'He's a very faithful, strong, Christian guy that we all dearly, we all love him. We're all there for him. Incredibly tragic event. He's a great a kid, a great man, a great kid when I had him.' Adrian Peterson Jr. showed up at training camp this year and posed for pictures after one practice with his dad. Peterson also has a daughter; he tweeted last month about how she teased him about Minnesota's loss that afternoon to Cleveland. 'So my daughter is laying here under me and just out the blue she says ... I can't believe you lost to the Browns Daddy!' Peterson posted on September 22. Peterson's half brother, Chris Paris, was killed in Houston the night before the NFL's scouting combine, where Peterson and the rest of the draft prospects worked out for all 32 teams. Tender: Adrian Peterson's two-year-old son Adrian Jr (pictured). It is believed that it is another little boy, who the football player had out of wedlock, who was beaten to death . After wondering whether he could find the strength to participate, he remembered Paris's recent encouragement to him to represent his hometown of Palestine, Texas, well with a strong showing there in Indianapolis. That day was hard, but growing up might've been ever harder. Peterson's dad, Nelson Peterson, was sent to prison for drug dealing when his soon-to-be-famous son was 13. Six years prior to that, Peterson's brother, Brian, who was 11 months older than him, died in front of him in that horrific car-bike crash. The two Peterson boys were tight. So after all that, then came the latest sorrow. Peterson was surrounded by a swarm of media members, cameras and recorders in a three-deep half-circle in the Vikings' locker room on Friday. He was asked how he has dealt with such adversity. 'Just staying prayed up. One thing I always bounce back to is that the good Lord never gives you more than you can bear, than you can handle. So I'm built tough,' he said. His teammates didn't have to be reminded about that. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. We're there for him with whatever he needs and try and help his morale and be there for him,' fellow running back Toby Gerhart said.

The husband of the former Swiss tennis champion, Martina Hingis, claims he had to flee to France to escape his estranged wife and her mother, saying they assaulted him, tried to steal his car and threatened by text message to 'set the Russians on him'. Thibault Hutin, 27, a French equestrian, said that 32-year-old Hingis and her mother, Melanie Molitor, beat him and scratched during a dispute at their apartment in the Swiss village of Feusisberg. Molitor's boyfriend Mario Widmer also hit him in the head with a DVD player, Hutin claimed. Hutin - who accused his wife of serial adultery when the couple separated in July - said he believed Hingis had tried to break into his car a few days before, as he could see that someone had tampered with it and she was the only person other than himself  to have a key to the garage. 'As far as I was concerned, there was only one possible culprit: Martina!' he said. Hutin, who has yet to finalise his divorce with the tennis player, said Hingis had made off with his passport and credit cards when he fled the apartment. 'I have bruises and scratches on the neck, head and right forearm,' he told the Swiss newspaper Blick. 'I'm really scared and asking myself, what comes next - a bullet? 'They wanted to massacre me - I'm shocked! What comes next - a bullet?' Thibault Hutin . 'I have been brought up never to hit a . woman,' he said. 'I fought back because Mario Widmer - Melanie's . partner - hit me on the head with the DVD player.' Police . in the central Swiss canton of Schwyz confirmed that Hutin had called . them, and that they had been called to deal with a family argument on . the evening Hutin described. Hutin . said he had to ask police to retrieve his passport and credit cards . from the apartment, and had left Switzerland for Paris where he felt . 'safe from them'. 'They wanted to massacre me,' he said. 'I'm shocked! I'd never have thought it would come so far. 'First she betrays me, then she tries to break into my car. Now she's attacking me physically and stealing my possessions. 'Most . recently I have even received a text threatening  to set the Russians on me. 'I don't know how much further this is going . to go.' Star: Martina Hingis won three consecutive Australian Opens, one Wimbledon title and one US Open between 1997 and 1999 . Hingis would not comment, while Widmer said the allegations were 'ridiculous'. The Slovakian-born, Swiss-raised Hingis was the world's number one women’s singles player for 209 weeks, winning three consecutive Australian Opens, one Wimbledon title and one U.S. Open between 1997 and 1999. She also held the world number one doubles ranking for 35 weeks, making her one of just five women in history to have been the world number one in singles and doubles simultaneously.Hingis won nine doubles titles and one mixed doubles title for a total of 15 major titles in her career. After an early retirement due to injury in 2002 at the age of 22, Hingis made a return to tennis in 2006 but quit in 2007 after testing positive for cocaine in a routine drug test. She denied using the drug but opted not to contest the ban imposed by the International Tennis Federation and bowed out instead. Since retirement, Hingis has been active with World Team Tennis, and has been coaching up-and-coming young tennis players.

In her complaint, the unmarried flight attendant claims Taubman . grabbed her or brushed against her on multiple occasions, forced his . tongue into her ear and mouth repeatedly, ripped buttons off her . blouse, and once tried to perform oral sex on her. According to the complaint, Rock was awarded disability leave in February 2011 because of the 'extreme stress, anxiety, fearfulness and depression' she experienced as a result of her work conditions. She left Taubman's employ for good that month. The filing alleges 'during a flight, (Taubman) forced his hands down the front of (Rock's) dress and proceeded to forcefully kiss her on the mouth without her consent … Taubman violently tore buttons off of (Rock's) blouse.' Rock alleges she repeatedly asked Taubman to stop, telling him: 'You're hurting me,' and asking 'Are you crazy?' and 'Why don't you hire a prostitute?'

'Privileged': The Archbishop of Canterbury will use his last Christmas message to say how he has been inspired by meeting people who have experienced great suffering such as victims of gang violence . The Archbishop of Canterbury spoke today of how he has been inspired by meeting people who have experienced great suffering, such as victims of gang violence. Delivering his final Christmas Day sermon from Canterbury Cathedral, Dr Rowan Williams also acknowledged how the General Synod's vote against allowing women to become bishops last month has damaged the credibility of the Church. But he pointed out a reason to be positive in the recently published census statistics, which indicated that 59 per cent of people still identified themselves as Christian. Dr Williams, who steps down at the end . of the month after a decade as head of the Church of England, spoke of some of the people he has had the 'privilege' to meet during . his tenure. 'When people . respond to outrageous cruelty and violence with a hard-won readiness to . understand and be reconciled, few if any can bring themselves to say . that all this is an illusion,' he will say. 'The . parents who have lost a child to gang violence, the wife who has seen . her husband killed in front of her by an anti-Christian mob in India, . the woman who has struggled for years to comprehend and accept the rape . and murder of her sister, the Israeli and Palestinian friends who have . been brought together by the fact that they have lost family members in . the conflict and injustice that still racks the Holy Land - all these . are specific people I have had the privilege of meeting as Archbishop . over these 10 years. 'And in their willingness to explore the new . humanity of forgiveness and rebuilding relations, without for a moment . making light of their own or other people's nightmare suffering, or . trying to explain it away, these are the ones who make us see, who . oblige us to turn aside and look, as if at a bush burning but not . consumed.' Downbeat: Dr Williams, pictured last month showing his disappointment after the General Synod vote against allowing women bishops, said the decision had damaged the Church . Rejection: A general view of the Assembly Hall of Church House, where a vote rejected legislation introducing the first women bishops . Referring to the 2011 census, he said that faith has to mean more than just 'what public opinion decides', and Christians should not lose heart. 'We are after all, doing something rather outrageous, asking men and women to stop and look and turn around, and learn how to keep company with a figure whose outlines we often see only dimly,' he told the congregation. Dr Williams, who is to take up the posts of Master of Magdalene College Cambridge and chairman of the board of trustees of Christian Aid, is to be replaced by former oil executive the Rt Rev Justin Welby, the Bishop of Durham. Meanwhile, the Archbishop of York has celebrated Christmas Day by calling on the nation to 'feed those who hunger' and 'give shelter to the homeless'. Positive message: The Archbishop of York has celebrated Christmas Day by calling on the nation to 'feed those who hunger' and 'give shelter to the homeless' John Sentamu told the congregation at York Minster: 'God works through human agents to achieve his purposes. 'So let us feed those who hunger with the bread come down from heaven. 'Let us give shelter to the homeless with him who could find no room in the inn. Let us welcome him into the inn of our lives, so we might be fully alive, fully human again.' The Archbishop - the second most senior cleric in the Church of England - invoked PD James's dystopian novel The Children Of Men to send a message of hope and the power of humanity. He said: 'The novel ends with hope: brutality is turned into compassion, betrayal into loyalty, enmity into friendship, despair into hope, self-absorption into inter-dependence, death into life. 'How? Not by Western science discovering the solution, nor by the plans and schemes of those in power. 'But it's the vulnerable who rise up and neutralise the jealousy, treachery, violence, murder, evil and the intoxication of power.' Dr Sentamu said Christ's birth meant 'religious beliefs were translated out of words into humanity, life and spirit, out of the intellect into the simple impulses of the soul'. He added: 'Yes. His rule is characterised by everlasting justice and righteousness, instead of the ruthless greed and exploitation which prevailed when he was born and is prevailing now in our global village.' The Archbishop said: 'In God's eyes, the quality of our relationships is more important than the rightness of our convictions. 'Sadly, as followers of Jesus Christ, we are often bad at learning how to disagree, but we do need to remain in harmony. We must 'make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace' - as St Paul says in Ephesians 4:3. The Archbishops of Canterbury and York will tweet their sermons for the first time today to 'bring the meaning of Christmas to a new digital audience' 'If we cannot experience and demonstrate the reality of this in Christ, what have we to offer to the rest of society, with its fractured relationships?' The Archbishops of Canterbury and York tweeted their sermons for the first time today to 'bring the meaning of Christmas to a new digital audience'. Dr Williams and Dr Sentamu - with the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby - delivered their Christmas Day messages simultaneously from their pulpits and over the micro-blogging site. Their words will be 'live tweeted' to the UK's 10 million Twitter users as part of a campaign to reach out to social networkers across the country. The Church of England has asked members in its 16,000 parishes to join in by tweeting snippets from services containing the hashtag #ChristmasStartsWithChrist to spread the Christian message. A Twitter spokesman said: 'It is fantastic to see the Church of England embracing Twitter and using it to share their Christmas message with new audiences.' Dr Williams has previously branded the site a potentially 'poisonous' and destructive tool. But he has also spoken of its power when used to do good. The outgoing archbishop - who does not own a mobile phone and admits he struggles with 'any kind' of technology - addressed the issue earlier this month when he said it was often assumed that clergy were 'too unworldly' for social media. But he insisted not all clergy should be assumed to be as 'dim' as he is in this area. Twitter users were able to track the sermons at Canterbury Cathedral, Durham Cathedral and York Minster by following Dr Williams (@lambethpalace), Dr Sentamu (@johnsentamu) and the Archbishop Designate, Bishop Welby (@bishopofdurham), who already has nearly 15,000 followers. Dr Williams will stand down as Archbishop of Canterbury at the end of this month after a decade in office. He will take up a new post as master of Magdalene College, Cambridge and will also serve as chairman of the board of trustees at Christian Aid, the international development agency. Bishop Welby will be enthroned as his successor at Canterbury Cathedral in March. The next archbishop of Canterbury has admitted it is easy to be despondent but used his Christmas Day sermon to stress 'the main job of the Church is never self-preservation, but glorifying God'. The Rt Rev Justin Welby, Bishop of Durham, told Durham Cathedral: ""It is very easy to be despondent about the Church. 'Some speak of division and even of betrayal. 'The processes we go through are agonisingly wounding for many. 'There are profound differences of opinion about the nature of Christian truth and its place in society, about the right of an ancient tradition to dictate or even to advocate ethical values around the end of life, around marriage, around the nature of human relationships, inequality, our duty to each other."" And the bishop said: ""It is even easier to be despondent about the world. 'From the horrors of forgotten Goma in the DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo) to the atrocity in Connecticut, and from Aleppo in Syria to tribal struggles in Burma, and in so many places between, there is the usual diet of tragedy and loss. 'Near at home we remain in the economic doldrums and seem to find a perverse pleasure in emphasising the impossibility of trusting any institution.' But he told worshippers it was important to 'recognise that God's answer to all our despondency or triumph is to come in weakness as a child, to become utterly vulnerable'. Bishop Welby said: 'Christians reach to the jagged edges of our society, and of the world in general. 'Food distribution, places for rough sleepers, debt counselling, credit unions, community mediation, support for ex-offenders, support for victims of crime, care for the dying, valuing those who have no economic contribution to make, or are too weak to argue for their own value. 'All this is the daily work of the church, which goes on every day and everywhere. We leak out into the world the love that God leaks into us.' The bishop said that despite only two-thirds of people now identifying with the Christian faith, 'we would never hear the end of it' if this figure was associated with a political party. And he said: 'The main job of the church is never self-preservation, but glorifying God.'The moment we lose sight of that, we lose everything we are about. The same is true for us as individual Christians.' Bishop Welby was chosen in September to succeed Rowan Williams as archbishop of Canterbury. He is expected to take up the post next year.","Dr Rowan Williams also said women bishops vote has damaged Church .

A male model could face life in prison after being found guilty of murder for killing and castrating his gay lover, a prominent Portuguese journalist, using a corkscrew. Renato Seabra, 23, had argued that he was insane when he killed 65-year-old Carlos Castro in New York in January 2011, and pleaded not guilty to a charge of second degree murder. Seabra bludgeoned Castro with a computer monitor and wine bottle, and used a corkscrew to sever his lover's testicles in a Times Square hotel room. He then wore the testicles as a bracelet and even told doctors he had been drinking Castro's blood following the frenzied attack. Guilty: Renato Seabra has been convicted of murder over the killing of his gay lover Carlos Castro . Pictured together: Seabra sitting next to Castro, a well-known journalist in his native Portugal . 'You do not need an expert to tell you this is psychotic behavior,' David Touger, one of Seabra's lawyers, told the jury in closing arguments on Wednesday. More than 20 doctors have since diagnosed Seabra with bipolar disorder, he said. But the jury found him guilty after deliberating for a day, returning a verdict on Friday afternoon.His trial in Manhattan had lasted two months, partly because it was repeatedly delayed by the effects of Hurricane Sandy. Neither the defendant nor his mother showed any emotion when the jury read out the verdict. 'This was a brutal and sadistic crime, where Renato Seabra bludgeoned choked, and mutilated his victim before murdering him,' district attorney Cy Vance said. 'But the jury's verdict now, finally, holds Seabra accountable. 'It is particularly tragic that Carlos Castro was not only betrayed by his spurned lover, but met a very painful and violent end far from his home.' Weapon: NYPD detectives showed jurors the corkscrew that they found covered in blood in the hotel room . Sentencing for Seabra, also a native of Portugal, was set for December 21. Touger had argued that his client was not responsible for the killing because he did not know what he was doing was wrong, believing instead he was on a God-ordained mission to slay the 'demon' of homosexuality that he saw in Castro. Seabra was found by police at a Manhattan hospital where he had checked in under his real name after arriving by taxi. Maxine Rosenthal, the lead prosecutor, told jurors that driving to the hospital was a ruse to feign insanity, as Seabra knew the body would soon be discovered. She described Seabra as an opportunist who was 'playing the role of the loving boyfriend' to exploit Castro's wealth and connections. He was apparently angry that Castro had ended their relationship. Aspiring model: 23-year-old Seabra claimed to have had a psychotic episode during the killing . Luxury: Castro and Seabra were staying at the high-end InterContinental Hotel in Manhattan . Castro, who met Seabra through Facebook, was a gay-rights activist and journalist, writing about fashion and society for Diario de Noticias, 24 Horas and Correio de Manha. As their relationship dissolved into fierce arguments during their stay in New York, Seabra became enraged, Rosenthal told the jury. 'It is no coincidence . Castro's life ended at the same time he ended his relationship with the . defendant,' she said. 'The . motive is as clear as if it were written in lights on a Times Square . marquee.' After killing Castro, Seabra disconnected the room phone, dismantled Castro's cellphone, and put the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door as he left to buy him more time, she said. He took with him about $1,600 from Castro's wallet and their flight itinerary, fully intending to flee, she added. 'That shows presence of mind, it is deliberate action and is inconsistent with delusion,' Rosenthal said.","Renato Seabra, 23, bludgeoned 65-year-old Carlos Castro to death last year .

A group of thrill-seekers were left suspended 150 feet from the ground for more than two hours when a roller coaster malfunctioned, causing it to stop unexpectedly. A dozen people became trapped in a vertical position on the Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit at Universal Studios, Florida, when a computer glitch sent the ride into 'safety mode' bringing their cart to a halt. The 12-person train stopped near the top of the first hill of track coaster at around 7pm yesterday. Precarious: The train stopped in a vertical position after a computer glitch caused the ride to go into safety mode . Closed for repair: Universal spokesperson Tom Schroder said the ride would remain closed until an investigation has taken place . According to Universal, it took more than two hours to free the passengers, who were brought back to the ground at around 9.30pm. One woman was hospitalised after complaining of neck injuries. Universal spokesman Tom Schroder said rescuers took their time to comfort the stranded riders before making sure they were brought down as safely as possible. He said: 'The safety system did exactly what it's supposed to do. 'We spent a lot of that time talking to them (the passengers) and trying to make them as comfortable as we could.' Several other trains were on the track when the ride stopped, but park workers were able to help those passengers off almost immediately. Don't look down: The car was 150 feet from the ground when it stopped at the top of the ride's first climb . Down to earth: The unlucky thrill-seekers were left suspended for more than two hours before emergency crews could bring them back to ground . However, the final train was stuck more than 150 feet from the ground and was positioned vertically. Orlando Fire Rescue crews moved the cart forward to a horizontal position before the passengers were allowed to get off the train and take an elevator down. No serious injuries were reported, but Schroder said one woman complained of neck pain and went to the hospital as a precaution. Good service: The Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit, which was officially opened in 2009, has a top speed of 65mph . Park officials will now investigate what caused the glitch, Schroder said. It wasn't immediately clear when the ride would be running again. He said: 'We're not going to reopen it until we understand what happened and make sure it can't happen again.' The ride was previously closed for two days in August when the coaster came to a sudden stop, which caused one woman to sustain a minor injury.","12 passengers were suspended 150 feet from the ground .

The diver, from London, claimed the British record during the recent free diving championships held in the Caribbean off the Bahamas. Wearing a wetsuit and flippers, he used a rope to guide himself through the water in a straight line. He explained that diving to such depths puts so much pressure on the lungs and muscles that competitors are prone to blacking out. He said: 'The air in your lungs gets really compressed. 'At about 40 metres down the lungs are crushed until they are about a quarter of their size and blood then enters them, protects them and stops them from getting smaller. 'You really aren't worried about having enough oxygen to get back to the surface, its more about not blacking out.

"By . Mario Ledwith . PUBLISHED: . 21:11 EST, 29 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 21:11 EST, 29 December 2012 . Outspoken: Archbishop Bernard Longley, writing in a letter to churches in his diocese, warns that plans to legalise gay marriage could tarnish the Christian view of family life . Plans to legalise gay marriage would undermine the Christian view of the family, according to a leading Roman Catholic archbishop. The Archbishop of Birmingham Bernard Longley warned that the Government cannot foresee the 'full consequences' of the proposals. In a letter to churches and chapels in his diocese, the Archbishop warned of the impact gay marriage would have on 'children involved or for wider society'. His warnings are the latest attack from a senior member of the Catholic Church on David Cameron's plans to allow gay couples to marry in churches. In the letter, due to be read to worshippers tomorrow, the Archbishop said: 'Government policy cannot foresee the full consequences, for the children involved or for wider society, of being brought up by two mothers without a father’s influence or by two fathers without a mother’s influence. 'We first learn about diversity and acquire a respect for difference through the complementarity of our parents.' He describes the 'complementary love of father and mother' as a 'precious gift that we should wish for every child'. Archbishop Longley adds: 'We know that many single parents courageously and generously look after their children and often struggle to give them a fine up-bringing. 'If it had not been for the . understanding of St Joseph, our Lady herself might have had to face the . difficulties of being a single parent. 'Even . so, the experience of growing up with our father and mother to teach . and guide, to console and love us unconditionally is an invaluable . blessing in life.' Views: In the letter the Archbishop describes the 'complementary love of father and mother' as a 'precious gift that we should wish for every child' Criticism: The archbishop said that the Government could not foresee the consequences for 'children or wider society' The remarks follow the more pointed criticism from the Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols, the most senior Catholic in England and Wales. He lambasted the Prime Minister for his 'undemocratic' and 'Orwellian' plans to legalise gay marriage. The archbishop said the proposals were a 'shambles', and accused David Cameron of pushing through the changes without a mandate. In his Christmas Eve sermon at Westminster Cathedral, he said that only marriage between a man and a woman shares in 'the creative love of God'. The Catholic Bishop of Shrewsbury, . Mark Davies, also used his Christmas homily to liken moves to legalise . same-sex marriage to the way Nazis and Communists tried to undermine . religion. Archbishop . Nichols criticised successive governments for failing to stand up for . marriage and promoting sex before marriage instead. 'Shambles': The Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols said the plans to introduce same-sex marriage laws are undemocratic . In an interview with the BBC, he attacked parties who were promoting same-sex marriage, saying the plan was 'Orwellian' because there was no mandate from the public. 'From a democratic point of view, it's a shambles,' he said. 'George Orwell would be proud of the manoeuvre. I think the process is shambolic.' The attacks from leading Catholics come despite the fact polls show the public is largely in favour of allowing gay couples to marry. Civil partnerships - which come with most, but not all, of the legal safeguards of marriage - were introduced seven years ago. They allow gay couples to celebrate their unions in civil settings, but not in religious buildings. Now the Government wants to allow them to call their unions marriage and have the ceremony in civil and religious settings. Opposition: The most senior Catholic in England and Wales described the plans as 'Orwellian' Religious organisations such as the Quakers and the Unitarians have said they would like to be able to host gay marriages. But the Church of England and Roman Catholic Church are against it and the legislation says it would be illegal for any Anglican vicar to marry a gay couple. Ministers insist that churches will never be forced to carry out gay marriage, but opponents say homosexual couples could get the ban overturned under European human rights laws. Pope Benedict XVI has also reiterated his opposition to gay marriage earlier this month, saying that it was destroying the very 'essence of the human creature'.","Archbishop of Birmingham says government can't see 'full consequences'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 13:37 EST, 24 January 2012 . Turkey threatened the France with retaliation after a controversial bill to make it a crime to deny the mass murder of Armenians by the Ottoman Turks moved a step closer to becoming law. Fury: Turkish press branded Sarkozy Satan as relations between the two countries become more strained . Turkey sees the allegations of genocide in 1915 as the Ottoman Empire imploded as a threat to its national honour, insisting estimates of the scale of the killing is exaggerated. And the country reacted furiously when France's parliament approved the legislation on Monday. Sarkozy, whose party supported the bill, is now expected to sign the bill into law by February. Turkish press headlines slammed Sarkozy: ‘(He) massacred democracy,’ read the banner headline of the leading Hurriyet newspaper while the Sozcu daily blasted ‘Sarkozy the Satan.’ The law has also risked more sanctions from Turkey and is complicating an already delicate relationship with the rising power. Turkey has already suspended military, economic and political ties, and briefly recalled its ambassador last month when the lower house of parliament approved the same bill. Support: President Sarkozy's signature making the controversial bill law is considered a formality . Turkey's Foreign Ministry strongly condemned the decision, saying the law should not be finalized to ‘avoid this being recorded as part of France's political, legal and moral mistakes.’ If the law is signed, ‘we will not hesitate to implement, as we deem appropriate, the measures that we have considered in advance,’ Turkey's Foreign Ministry said. It did not elaborate on the measures. Armenians believe about 1.5 million . Christian Armenians were killed in what is now eastern Turkey during the . First World War and this was part of a deliberate policy of genocide . ordered by the Ottoman Turk government. The majority of Turks argue that . there was a heavy loss of life on both sides during the fighting in the . area, and that mass killing was inevitable result of newly . industrialised warfare. The debate surrounding the measure comes in the highly charged run-up to France's presidential elections this spring, and critics have called the move a ploy by Sarkozy to garner the votes of the some 500,000 Armenians who live in France. ‘It is further unfortunate that the historical ... relations between the Republic of Turkey and France have been sacrificed to considerations of political agenda,’ Turkey said. ‘It is quite clear where the responsibility for this lies.’ Protection: Simmering tension between the two countries saw Turkish riot police stationed outside French consulate during a demonstration in Istanbul . Officials in Sarkozy's conservative government were in damage-control mode on Tuesday, appealing to Turkey's government to keep its calm. ‘As foreign minister, I think this initiative was a bit inopportune. But the parliament has thus decided. What I'd like to do today is call on our Turkish friends to keep their composure,’ Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said on Canal Plus TV. ‘After this wave that has been a little bit excessive, I have to say I'm convinced that we will return to constructive relations - I extend my hand, I hope it will be taken one day.’ France's relations with Turkey are already strained, in large part because Sarkozy opposes Turkey's entry into the European Union. Anger: Protesters vent their anger at the French bill during a demonstration in front of the French consulate in Istanbul . The law is likely to further sour relations with a NATO member that is playing an increasingly important role in the international community's response to the violence in Syria, the standoff over Iran's nuclear program and peace negotiations in the Middle East. The Senate voted 127 to 86 to pass the bill late Monday. Twenty-four abstained. The measure sets a punishment of up to one year in prison and a fine of €45,000 for those who deny or ‘outrageously minimize’ the killings. Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan slammed the French parliament bill as 'discriminatory and racist' For some in France, the bill is part of a tradition of legislation in some European countries, born of the agonies of the Holocaust, that criminalizes the denial of genocides. Denying the Holocaust is already a punishable crime in France. Most historians contend that the 1915 killings of 1.5 million Armenians as the Ottoman Empire broke up was the 20th century's first genocide, and several European countries recognize the massacres as such. Switzerland has convicted people of racism for denying the genocide. But Turkey says that there was no systematic campaign to kill Armenians and that many Turks also died during the chaotic disintegration of the empire. It also says that death toll is inflated. Some Turks said Turkey should retaliate in kind. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused the French of ‘genocide’ during France's 132-year colonial rule in Algeria. ‘I think our country should have retaliated in the same way after the French Bill has passed,’ Yilmaz Sesen, a chemist, told AP television in Ankara. ‘They have committed genocide in North Africa, and not too long ago either.’","Turkish Prime Minister calls the law 'discriminatory and racist'

"By . Jennifer Marjoribanks . PUBLISHED: . 02:52 EST, 11 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:26 EST, 11 October 2013 . It's a boy. These three little words, followed by a screeching cry were the most amazing sounds I have ever heard. It was all so different from the previous year, when those same three words were delivered by a midwife with a sadness and flatness no mother should ever have to hear. On September 11, 2011, I had gone into Forth Valley Royal Hospital in Larbert, Stirlingshire, thinking I was in labour. Instead, my husband Brian and I were told our baby didn’t have a heartbeat. 'Two in my arms': Jennifer with her sons Alexander and Fraser. Her baby son was born after a stillbirth . We returned to hospital the next day where I gave birth to our perfect baby, Andrew, who weighed 9lbs 2oz, stillborn only five days before he was due to make his entrance into the world. We were given a memory box containing photos, footprints and a lock of his hair. Precious mementoes, but not what any parent expects to be taking home from hospital. In the days that followed I did things I never thought I could possibly be capable of. I chose readings, flowers and music for my baby’s funeral. I sat next to my husband with his tiny white coffin over our knees as we travelled to the crematorium, and held Brian’s hand as he carried our boy down the aisle – he said I had carried Andrew for nine months and he wanted to carry his son to his final resting place. After we lost Andrew, we did beat ourselves up about what had caused this. After all, he was inside of me, why didn’t I manage to keep him safe? The results of the post mortem examination showed he had somehow bled out into me, possibly through the umbilical cord. A random and cruel occurrence, like being struck by lightning, the consultant said. Memories: Two tiny footprints is all that Jennifer has left of her stillborn baby son Andrew . Tragic: Jennifer says she will never forget her lost baby Andrew and will always keep him in her heart . Importantly for us, though, it was no more likely to happen again than it had been the first time, and it wasn’t something which would prevent us from  having another child. We were very lucky to be given a cause of Andrew’s death, even if it wasn’t a reason. More than half of stillbirths are unexplained. I don’t think I could have coped with not knowing. Having our son Alexander, then 21 months, was a godsend. His cheeky and mischievous smile kept us going in the darkest of days, but I knew from the very beginning that the only way I would ever feel truly healed was to have another baby. Being pregnant again was both amazing and terrifying in equal measure. At no point did I allow myself to believe there would be a baby at the end of it. Each kick provided comfort, but every time baby was quiet for any length of time, I would start to panic that something was wrong. The day I found myself sitting on the couch at 8am drinking cold Irn-Bru while guzzling sugary sweets in an attempt to get baby to wake up and kick was the day I knew I had finally gone crazy! As soon as I was pregnant again, my parents offered to pay for me to have the baby privately, but for me that was never an option. Part of the healing process was to go back to that same hospital, but this time bring home a baby instead of a box of memories. The hospital staff were generally great, although early on I had a slight scare and phoned the hospital to ask if someone could check me over, just for some reassurance. The midwife I spoke to instead told me I should seek help for my anxiety issues, and that if she let me come in that day to hear the heartbeat, I would just end up wanting to come in every day. I complained, to both my consultant and to the head of midwifery, and from that point onwards the care I received was exemplary. My mum joked that they must have had a big flashing sign whenever I said my name to warn them to be nice! I had extra scans for reassurance, which was great until one at 36 weeks which apparently showed the baby had not grown in two weeks. Cute: Baby Fraser is the spitting image of his big brothers but Jennifer's third pregnancy was beset by worry . All of a sudden the consultant was talking about giving me steroids for baby’s lungs before inducing me right away. We had 20 minutes of complete panic before a second scan showed there were no problems and the first sonographer had simply made a huge error. My previous experience meant any joy in pregnancy had been cruelly snatched away from me. Overhearing excited first-time mums chatting about nursery decoration or prams in the doctor’s waiting room would make me wince. I was so jealous of their innocence about pregnancy and birth. On another occasion I snapped at my newly pregnant friend who was fretting about having had a few glasses of wine before she knew she was expecting. 'Look at me,' I said. 'I hardly drink, have never taken drugs or smoked and look what happened to me.' When you are pregnant, people can’t help but chat to you, always asking excitedly what baby number this would be. I’ve still not quite worked out the right way to answer that one – I never wanted to say this would be my second baby, but equally did the woman behind the checkout in Tesco really need to know I had a dead son? Help: Jennifer, pictured with husband Brian, says baby Fraser has helped them overcome their loss . Political solution: Should the Prime Minister, pictured visiting a maternity ward, do more to prevent stillbirths? It was only the day before I was due to be induced last year, that I finally allowed myself to believe this might actually happen. These months of worry and stress might actually have been worth it. The induction process was long but once labour started, all of a sudden everything was in fast  forward. Barely 40 minutes after my waters had broken and in just three pushes, our third son Fraser arrived safe and sound, on August 24, weighing 6lbs 14oz. His arrival was so quick the midwife barely had time to get her gloves on before he burst into the world. I can’t describe how it felt holding him in my arms that first night. Fraser was the spitting image of both his big brothers. The sheer ecstasy of finally having him here will stay with me forever, just as the aching sadness for the boy we couldn’t bring home will never go away. Women need to know they are receiving the best of care and attention at all times and the thought that some of the 17 stillbirths in Britain each day could be prevented is shocking. When I was pregnant with Andrew I had various niggles and issues along the way – nothing major, but I did spend a few nights in hospital with pains and tightenings at around 36 weeks. During the ward round in the morning, a doctor told me: 'We’re not going to do something to make your baby come early. If your baby comes now, it will have tubes and wires and be in special care. Is that what you want?' Mother's instinct: Jennifer feels more attention needs to be paid to pregnant mothers' concerns . In fact, in all likelihood, had Andrew been born then he would have been perfectly healthy. I mentioned this to my consultant after we lost Andrew and asked what would have happened if I had stamped my feet and demanded something be done at that point. He said they would probably have given me an extra scan, which in  my case would not have shown  anything untoward and I would have been left thinking everything was fine. 'Trusting mother’s instinct and . encouraging women to pay close attention to their baby’s movements is, . in my opinion, probably a better course of action.' With hindsight the consultant was able to say the monitoring printouts of the early contractions I was having could have indicated the baby was showing some distress, but without knowing the eventual outcome, they looked like perfectly normal tracings. I don’t know what the answer is – more scans or monitoring? Perhaps. But as my consultant told me, a scan is only a snapshot of one moment, and in the past when more regular monitoring was carried out in later stages of pregnancy, people were left falsely reassured as a result. Trusting mother’s instinct and encouraging women to pay close attention to their baby’s movements is, in my opinion, probably a better course of action. Since Fraser arrived it is suddenly like everything is just a bit more right in the world. We were supposed to be a family of four, and now we are. Bereaved parents often talk about things getting back to a 'new kind of normal' and that is precisely how I feel. Fraser isn’t a replacement for Andrew but his arrival has helped to fill the gaping hole left by his death. And as for how many children I have? I’ve settled on an answer. I have two in my arms and one always in my heart.","Stirlingshire mother Jennifer Marjoribanks' son Andrew was stillborn .

Derek Martin is jailed for four years after fooling 73 hospitals into treating him for bogus ailments . A compulsive liar cost the NHS £100,000 by faking illnesses at hospitals across the country for years. Derek Martin, 69, was jailed yesterday for four years after a judge said he had fooled doctors and nurses in a ‘diabolical’ fraud. The conman used at least 25 aliases and said he had been admitted to 73 hospitals on 90 occasions. His long and complex history of faking his identity even left his own barrister confused. Peter Wishlade said: ‘I’m not entirely certain who he is, and I don’t think anyone actually knows.’ When Martin was released from one hospital he would simply get himself admitted to another under a false identity. He even tried to fool a psychiatrist who was assessing him by feigning a limp and slurring  his words. Martin was also a persistent thief, and in one incident he took a hospital patient’s wallet while pretending to be a patient himself. The brazen scam was finally revealed after he pretended to  suffer a stroke on a train in May this year. Martin, who is officially homeless, walked into the dock at Teesside Crown Court on crutches, but the judge said he could still be faking even in court. Judge Les Spittle told him: ‘Our medical resources are vital and they shouldn’t be wasted in the way that you are having them wasted. ‘What can I do? I’m going to lock you up for a period of time that gives some respite to the community. ‘It’s diabolical the amount of waste you’ve created.’ He said the resources Martin had squandered ‘could have gone to those who desperately need it’. Judge Spittle added: ‘The temptation is to lock you up for ever, but I can’t do that.’ He described Martin as a ‘congenital liar’ and said: ‘We can’t believe anything he says. All custody is going to do is enable him to tell tales in prison, but keep him out of surgeries and hospitals for a period of time.’ Martin turned up a Middlesborough's James Cook University Hospital claiming he had suffered a stroke but refused to have an MRI scan. His barrister didn't recognise him when he arrived at Teesside Crown Court . A psychiatrist diagnosed Martin with a . chronic ‘factitious disorder’, which causes people to feign or . exaggerate symptoms of illness. Prosecutor . Sue Jacobs said Martin was taken to the James Cook University Hospital . in Middlesbrough after apparently suffering a stroke and gave the false . name of David Martin. 'It is diabolical. Those resources could have gone to others who desperately need them' He was kept in hospital and was given various tests, but his behaviour caused concern. He . was protective and aggressive about his belongings, gave inconsistent . information and refused an MRI scan claiming he was claustrophobic. After . his arrest, it emerged he had accessed £85,000 worth of medical . services using the bogus name. Martin admitted one charge of fraud by . false representation between May 2 and 9 this year. He asked for four more frauds, relating to treatment worth about £14,000, to be taken into account. Mr Wishlade said Martin had detailed his history of fake hospital admissions in a letter. ‘The list of the hospitals where he has received treatment is quite remarkable,’ he added. ‘It . ranges from the very south of the country to the north of Scotland, . something like 73 separate hospitals. Again, whether it’s  true or not, I . can’t say. That’s the list he provided. ‘I did say to him, “What would happen if you were released?” He said, “I’d check into a hospital”.’ Martin had 110 previous frauds and 60 thefts on a criminal record stretching back to the 1950s. Judge Spittle said: ‘He’s just a persistent offender. ‘Unless he has a Damascene moment in prison, he’s going to come out just the same.’","Judge blasts Derek Martin, who had 25 aliases, for wasting NHS resources .

'No place in politics today': Andy Newman, pictured, has been attacked after paying tribute to Stalin in articles . ‘Red’ Ed Miliband is keen to play down suggestions that Labour has ‘lurched to the Left’ under his leadership. But the message doesn’t seem to have reached leafy Chippenham, where the party has just selected an apologist for Stalin as its candidate for the next General Election. At first glance, Andy Newman would appear to be a good fit with the affluent Wiltshire seat, held by Liberal Democrat Duncan Hames. Educated at a private school and Oxford University, Mr Newman’s CV bears the hallmarks of a modern Labour politician. However, a delve into some of his recent writings suggests the union official is determined to keep the Red Flag flying over the West Country. He has called the Berlin Wall ‘a great success’ and praised the ‘significant improvement in working class living standards’ during Stalin’s Great Terror. He described the attacks on Pearl Harbour as the ‘opening salvo in a war between two rival imperialisms’ – equating America with wartime Japan under Emperor Hirohito – and branded the Dalai Lama a ‘figurehead for slavery’. In the run-up to his selection last month, the telecoms engineer set out some of his uncompromising beliefs in articles in ultra-left-wing publications. Paying tribute to Stalin’s character, whose brutal dictatorship led to the deaths of millions of citizens, he wrote earlier this year: ‘We should recognise how Stalin was the creature of his times; and not alone in culpability. ‘What is more, the character of Stalin, who almost through a feat of sheer will industrialised and militarised the USSR to defend itself against the Nazi threat, was also the character that ruthlessly regarded people as expendable. It did give Stalin the attributes needed to be a great war leader’. And in 2009, Mr Newman, who is the local branch secretary of the GMB union, used a piece in Socialist Unity to put a positive gloss on the tyrant’s rule. 'Shocking:' Mr Newman wrote of the rule of Joseph Stalin, right, in glowing terms . Describing him in apparently respectful terms as ‘the Stalin’, he wrote: ‘Free market capitalism had seen worldwide depression in the 1930s and had led to fascism and war. 'Meanwhile the USSR’s economy had achieved staggering success in the same period, including a significant improvement in working class living standards, despite the Stalin’s terror’. In the same article, he wrote warmly of the Berlin Wall: ‘If we set to one side the issue of personal liberty, the [Berlin] wall was a great success.’ 'Red' Ed: Mr Miliband, pictured, has played down his party's 'lurch to the Left' - but the message does not seem to have reached Mr Newman . In other writings he has described modern Britain as a ‘marriage’ between England, Wales and Scotland which is ‘based on shared guilt’, with the ‘bloodstains of the British Empire soaked equally into the souls of the English, Welsh and Scots’. He has also opposed Tibetan resistance to the socialist Chinese ‘hegemonic state sector’, dismissing the Dalai Lama as a ‘feudal figurehead’ of the ‘slavery and barbarism’ in Tibet’s past. Last night, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said Mr Newman’s ‘grossly offensive beliefs will shock ordinary people up and down the country’ and called for his deselection. He added: ‘Suggestions that the Berlin Wall was a good thing and Stalin was a great leader have no place in politics today – the Labour Party must act immediately and sack this throwback.’ A Labour spokesman said: ‘This is a desperate smear attempt by the Tories. Labour are concentrating on addressing the cost-of-living crisis.’","Labour is keen to downplay suggestions it is getting more left-wing .

Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that the Dutch government apologise after one of his country's diplomats was arrested. Russia claims Dmitry Borodin was badly beaten in front of his children by armed men in camouflage during an arrest on Saturday night. Speaking at an economic summit in Indonesia, President Putin said: 'This is the most gross breach of the Vienna Convention. Speaking at an economic summit in Indonesia, Russia's President Vladimir Putin has condemned the arrest of one of the country's diplomats at his flat in The Hague in the Netherlands . 'We . are awaiting an explanation, an apology and also punishment of those . responsible. Depending on how the Dutch side conducts itself, we will . react.' The foreign ministry in Moscow says Mr Borodin's flat in The Hague was stormed by officers wanting to arrest him over false claims of alleged domestic abuse. They say he explained he was a diplomat, but the men took no notice. The ministry added: 'Our diplomat was put in handcuffs and taken to a police station where he was held almost all night. 'After that he was let go without any explanations or apologies.' Dutch Police spokeswoman Ellen van Zijl confirmed an 'incident' had taken place, but she could not give details. Relations between the two countries were already under pressure following legal action by the Netherlands over the arrest of 30 Greenpeace campaigners. The activists, who sailed on a Dutch ship and include two Dutch nationals, were last week charged with piracy after trying to board a Russian oil rig. Moscow alleges that Dmitry Borodin's flat at The Hague was stormed by armed men who beat him in front of his children before keeping him in jail overnight . News of the charges, which carry a maximum 15-year sentence, prompted worldwide protests which were attended by actor Jude Law and musician Damon Albarn in London. Diplomatic immunity is a special status granted under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, giving immunity to anyone serving an officially recognised diplomatic function in another country. Depending on rank that can range from immunity for official actions, to immunity from all civil and criminal proceedings. Diplomatic agents and their families are 'inviolable', meaning they are exempt from all criminal jurisdiction. Without a waiver, a diplomatic agent, or dependent, may only be detained if they are likely to harm either themselves or the public. Diplomats cannot waive their own immunity, that can only be done by the Head of Mission for that country. Where police think there is sufficient evidence to charge an individual, but the Head of Mission does not agree to a waiver, the authorities can ask for the withdrawal of the individual and their family.","Moscow says Dmitry Borodin's flat in The Hague was stormed on Saturday .

Barbara Smith, 72, stabbed husband John, 83, with a six-inch knife after a ‘childish’ bust-up over the complicated device escalated into violence. When officers arrived she told them she was not attempting to murder him but was instead just trying to keep him quiet.

The court heard how she reached into a kitchen drawer, grabbed a knife and stabbed him . Bristol Crown Court heard how she reached into a kitchen drawer while they were face-to-face, grabbed the knife and stabbed him. Mark Hollier, prosecuting, said the couple had been married for 53 years and both had digital cameras, but Mr Smith was not very good with his. ‘They got into a confrontation after a comment over nothing,’ he said. ‘They got into a row, the argument moved around the property and into the kitchen. Mr Smith was arguing with his wife and she took his camera and threw it on the floor.’ The court heard as Mr Smith confronted his wife she grabbed a blade from a drawer, lashed out and stabbed him in the stomach area. She told the court: ‘He kept on moving closer. I could feel him spitting on my face. We were only inches apart. He kept coming towards me.’ Injured: Mr Smith was taken to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol with a small bowel perforation . Mr Hollier said: ‘She was clearly shocked. She telephoned her daughter-in-law, Susan Smith, and said she stabbed her husband. She also called for an ambulance.’ Susan Smith found him trying to staunch a bleeding stomach wound with a towel, as paramedics and police raced to the scene. Mrs Smith told police: ‘He just wouldn’t be quiet. Are you going to take me to prison now? ‘I wasn’t trying to murder him. I was just trying to shut him up.’ Mr . Smith was taken to Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, had surgery to repair a . small bowel perforation and stayed in for a fortnight, the court heard. He . accepted he behaved in a ‘belligerent manner’ and he should have known . better and was extremely supportive of his wife, the court heard. Smith, of Aldwick, Bristol, pleaded guilty to wounding in August. Sentencing her to eight months behind bars, suspended for 12 months, Mr Justice Nigel Teare said there was a degree of provocation. He told her: ‘In judgement this was an offence of greater harm but lower culpability, because of the degree of provocation and lack of pre-meditation. ‘Sentencing guidelines start at 18 months’ custody. You are plainly not dangerous. There are powerful mitigating circumstances.’ She was also handed a £100 victim surcharge. Tristan Harwood, defending, said his client told police she had suffered anger and threats from her husband for many years. He told the court said: ‘This is domestic abuse. She has suffered at his hands for many years.’ Detective Constable Darren Ash, the police officer in charge of the case, said: ‘Mr Smith said there was an argument and he should have just sat down.

A rebel Tory MP’s bid to force David Cameron to bring  forward his proposed referendum on Britain’s links with Brussels to next year has won strong public support. More than one in two voters want a referendum in 2014 according to a new poll – and more than six out of ten want MPs to vote on the proposal in three weeks’ time. The Survation poll comes after The Mail on Sunday revealed last week that Windsor Tory MP Adam Afriyie wants a Commons vote on November 8 on whether to hold a referendum on the EU in October 2014. Self-made multi-millionaire Mr Afriyie invoked the wrath of the Prime Minister and was accused of sabotaging Mr Cameron’s pledge to hold a referendum in 2017 – after the next Election. Clash: Tory grandees have urged Adam Afriyie to back down from his petition for an early vote on Europe . He faced fresh attack yesterday when Tory grandees begged him to back down and came close to accusing him of betraying his country. In an open letter they told Mr Afriyie not to meddle with the Cameron-backed 2017 EU Referendum Bill, stating: ‘No one individual is bigger than the future of our nation – we call on you to withdraw.’ But defiant Mr Afriyie promised to continue his battle and fellow maverick Conservative MP Julian Lewis publicly backed his 2014 referendum rally cry. According to the Survation poll for this newspaper, a total of  55 per cent favour an EU referendum before the next Election, due in 2015, with fewer than one in three saying it should take place afterwards. Do you trust Cameron? The poll's findings. More than six in ten want MPs to vote in three weeks' time . A total of 54 per cent agree with Mr Afriyie that Mr Cameron will not fulfil his 2017 pledge – against one in three who say he will. There is even bigger support for Mr Afriyie’s bid to force a Commons vote when the No 10- backed Referendum Bill – sponsored by Tory loyalist James Wharton – is debated next month on November 8. A massive 61 per cent say the Parliamentary vote should go ahead with just 24 per cent against. The poll shows a continuing public desire to leave the EU, but that could change if it hands back key powers. Asked how they would vote if a 2014 referendum went ahead, nearly one in two, 46 per cent, would vote to leave – with 38 per cent in favour of staying in. But if the EU made ‘significant concessions’ then 47 per cent would vote to stay in – with 30 per cent wanting withdrawal. Mr Afriyie said last night: ‘This poll confirms what I hear in my constituency and on doorsteps around the country and what the Conservative party knows: the people want a referendum on Europe before the Election. I am trying to give them that chance.’ The letter to Mr Afriyie from prominent Tory MPs – including Sir Gerald Howarth, Sir Edward Leigh, Andrea Leadsom and Nadhim Zahawi – says: ‘We support the PM’s decision to hold a referendum after the next Election. Any attempt to tamper with it runs the risk of wrecking it completely.’","More than one in two voters support Adam Afriyie's call for early referendum .

Dr Muhammad Taufiq Al Sattar has said he is a bird without any wings and has nobody left following a house fire which killed his wife and three teenage sons . A father whose family was killed in a suspected arson attack has told mourners he is 'a bird without any wings'. Dr Muhammad Taufiq Al Sattar made the comments at a funeral service for his wife Shehnila Taufiq, 47, and their three children, Zainab, 19, Bilal, 17, and Jamil, 15, in Dublin. The 52-year-old, who is a devout Muslim and highly respected within the Islamic community in Ireland, led prayers for his family in front of 1,000 mourners. The man, who previously thanked God for saving him from the blaze, said: 'This is a very sad occasion for me. You can say now I am bird without any wings. I have nobody with me now.' Speaking to attendees who included staff from Beaumont Hospital where he works, he added: 'Thank you very much for all of you coming here this morning. It's cold and I appreciate it. I can see many of our Irish friends are here as well.' Eight people have been charged in connection with the deaths of the four family members, who died in the blaze at their home in Wood Hill, Leicester, on September 13. Shaun Carter, 24, Jackson Powell, 19, and Nathaniel Mullings, also 19, as well as a 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, face four charges of murder in relation to the fire which started in the early hours. Kemo Porter, 18, has also been charged with four counts of murder in relation to the blaze. It is feared the family's property was targeted by mistake in a revenge attack following a fatal assault in nearby Kent Street. Dr Sattar was supposed to be in the house with his family on the night they died, but decided to stay in Dublin and spoke to his wife on the phone instead. The devout Muslim made the comments today at a funeral service in Dublin which was attended by 1,000 people . Dr Sattar (pictured right of the coffin) carries the body of his son Jamil who was just 15 when he died . Speaking about the tragedy last month, he . said: 'Initially, I planned [to] come one day before so that I could . spend an extra day with Jamil. But it was not possible,' he said. 'God did not want that I should be in the house ... otherwise I could be burnt as well. God did not plan it like that.' The Sattar family is highly respected within the Muslim community in Ireland. Mrs Sattar had brought their children to England to enable them to pursue Islamic studies. Dr Sattar has credited his wife's vision for encouraging him to help set up Islamic community projects in Dublin and is himself a well regarded neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon works at Beaumont Hospital in Dublin and the service was attended by co-workers . Eight men have been charged in connection with the suspected arson attack which killed Bilal, 17 (left) and Jamil, 15 (right) along with their mother and brother at their home in Leicester last month . Around 1,000 people attended the funeral of the Sattar family and another 7,000 gathered for a service in Leicester earlier in the week . The bodies of his family were brought into Dublin on an overnight ferry after about 7,000 people gathered in Leicester to pay their respects on Thursday. The surgeon has vowed to continue on his work for the Muslim community and help to cement links between people of Islamic faith in Ireland and others. His daughter Zainab had planned to train to become a primary school teacher and Islamic religious teacher and to live and work in Ireland.

Intelligence: The machine, cutting-edge at the time, used a series of rotor blades to scramble Morse Code messages so they were impossible to read. A rare German encoding machine used by the Nazis to send secret messages in the dying days of the Second World War will go on sale this month. The machine, built in 1944, was part of the German intelligence operation famously thwarted by British intelligence officers working out of Bletchley Park. A specialist from London auctioneers Bonhams said the 'untouched and unrestored' device is especially valuable because it still has many of its original parts, and was not modified after the war. Engima machines were used through the war by the German military, but this was a later model which sent out even more heavily-encrypted signals than earlier versions, and had billions of possible combinations. The device would had three sets of rotors, which scrambled messages typed into the keypad, which were then printed and sent out via Morse code. Other Enigma machines with the rotors configured in the same pattern would be able to read the messages. This version also comes with an original ebonite 'plugboard', which when added to the Engima would swap pairs of letters so that, for example, pressing the F key would send a letter B to be scrambled at the rotors, and would require a matching device at the other end to make sense of the message. The machine up for auction at Bonhams was built in 1944, by Heimsoeth & Rinke, Serial No. 19088. The . Enigma comes complete with its original I, III and V rotors with . Bakelite thumbwheels and matching serial numbers, its makers plate . stamped A 19088/jla/44, and its standard QWERTZ keyboard with keys made . up of white lettering on black background. Its . battery switch, vacant battery box, complete set of bulbs, ebonite plug . board, set of three plug board cables, and set of instructions applied . to the lid interior together with a spare bulb rack are also original. The . machine rests in an oak carrying case with a hinged lid and a fall . front with a locking mechanism; when closed, the case measures 6 inches . by 11inches by 13 inches. 'Station X': Bletchley Park, pictured, was the hub of the British intelligence effort, where the Engima code was repeatedly broken . Tireless: Intelligence analysts, including these members of the Women's Royal Naval Service, worked tirelessly to break German codes in the Second World War . Endless battle: The Germans renewed the encryption on the Enigma machines every day, which the British would have to crack again . Jon . Baddeley, a specialist at Bonhams, said: 'It’s difficult to tell exactly how many . Enigma machines were made. 'During the war, many were destroyed for fear . of them falling into enemy hands, and documents about their manufacture . were often burned or simply lost. What we do know is that there were at . least five mainstream versions employed by the German military. 'The . first machines to be used in a military capacity only had a fixed set . of three wheels. Later, a set of five wheels were used so that they . could be interchanged to dramatically increase the number of variants . available. 'Each machine could use the interchangeable wheels from any . enigma, so to find a matching set of wheels with the same serial number . as the Enigma is rare.' Genius: Alan Turing, left, was able to beat the Enigma machine, right, thanks to a machine he built . Invention: Turing's Bombe machine thwarted the Engima code. They were all destroyed after the war, but one was rebuilt in 2008, and is seen here with veterans Ruth Bourne, left, and Jean Valentine, right, who served at Bletchley Park. 'Enigma machines rarely come up at auction, and this . particular example is especially unique. 'It’s . unusual because it has Bakelite thumb wheels instead of the more widely . used metal ones: this was due to the diminishing availability of metal . and other resources for the Wehrmacht [German military] towards the end of the war. 'It’s . also special because it’s untouched and un-restored. Many machines were . picked up by the allies as souvenirs during the final stages of World . War II, and as such, their parts were mixed and matched. 'All of the . elements of this one bear the same serial number, making it complete and . original throughout'. Unbreakable? German intelligence officers thought that Engima-encoded messages were uncrackable. (Photo posed by models) However, despite the sophisticated features of the encoding machines, German efforts at keeping their communications secret were continually defeated by teams working at the top-secret Bletchley Park intelligence centre in Buckinghamshire. They were able to crack the Engima code in part thanks to the efforts of mathematical genius Alan Turing, who developed a mechanical device called the Bombe, a forerunner of modern computers, which was able to greatly speed up the process of cracking German codes, which changed every day. The intelligence gleaned from sources including Engima transmissions was known as 'Ultra', and was decisive in the Allied victory. After winning the war, Winston Churchill reportedly told King George VI: 'It was thanks to Ultra that we won the war.' Sir Harry Hinsley, the official historian of British Intelligence in World War II, also held Ultra in high esteem and said that thanks to the information the war was shortened: 'by not less than two years and probably by four years.' The intelligence war waging in a quiet corner of Buckinghamshire was to be decisive in the Allied effort to win the Second World War. Station X - known now as Bletchley Park - was the hub of Britain's code-backing effort, where hugely talented mathematicians and inventors worked tirelessly to give the armed forces a crucial helping-hand. As Winston Churchill himself made clear, the accurate information which flowed from Bletchley Park every day, at a rate which sometimes reached 6,000 messages a day, saved lives and gave Britain a crucial edge in battle. Alan Turing, the Cambridge-educated mathematical genius, and Post Office Engineer Tommy Flowers, are the two most celebrated figures whose innovations greatly improved the Allied ability to decipher German messages. The Enigma machine, which was on sale commercially in the 1920s, was modified by the Germans to make it more secure. They trusted completely that its codes were unbreakable, and used it for all manner of important communications. Technology: The Colossus computer, shown here being rebuilt by Tony Sale, cracked the German Lorenz Cipher, unlocking even more secret intelligence. However, it was thwarted in part thanks to Alan Turing's 'Bombe' device, which was able to speed up the code-breaking process immeasurably. Turing based his invention on a Polish device, the 'Bomba', which was handed over to Britain just weeks before Poland was invaded in 1939. It was not able to decipher German codes automatically, but once analysts had manually deciphered a few letters by picking out common words, such as the names of German generals or short words such as 'to' and 'they', the device could rapidly test hundreds of other possibilities to put together a code. Over 100 of the machines were built to aid the code-breaking effort, but they were all destroyed when the war ended. A replica was built in 2008, and can be seen at Bletchley Park, which is now a museum. The quest to beat the German intelligence services also resulted in the construction of the world's first proper computer - called Colossus. Developed by Tommy Flowers from a network of thousands of electronic valves, the device was able to crack the Lorenz Cipher, which the Nazi high command used for messages deemed too sensitive for Engima transmission. The Colossus Mark II, which was five times faster than the original, was finished less than a week before the Normandy landings, and gave the Allies another crucial edge in the last phase of the war.","The device is an advanced model from 1944, and is completely unmodified .

Controversy: The father of 14-year-old Jade Anderson, pictured, who was mauled to death by four dogs earlier this year, has said the decision is 'disgraceful' and 'ludicrous' Tory ministers sparked outrage last night over plans to cut short a House of Commons law and order debate on dangerous dogs – so MPs can meet the Queen. They have been accused of changing the Commons timetable to stop it clashing with a reception at Buckingham Palace, hosted by the Queen and Prince Philip. MPs were preparing for lengthy debates on Tuesday on a crackdown on dangerous dogs and revising Britain’s extradition laws. But last night, it emerged that the debate has been cut to allow backbench MPs to get to a coveted evening reception at Buckingham Palace. Instead of finishing at 7pm as expected, discussion is now due to be curtailed at 5.30pm. It means MPs will be able to get to the Palace according to strict instructions on the gold-embossed invitation by 6.20pm at the latest. The change was ordered after  some MPs complained that if the debate went on until 7pm, they would be unable to attend the royal party – a 25-minute walk or 10-minute taxi ride in the rush hour from the Commons. Coalition sources insisted there is still enough time to debate the Government’s Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill, which includes new penalties for out-of-control dangerous dogs. But the decision to cut short the debate was condemned by Michael Anderson, whose 14-year-old step-daughter Jade was killed by four dogs in Atherton, Lancashire. Out-of-control: One of the dogs who killed the schoolgirl in April. The debate on how to deal with these dangerous animals has been cut by 90 minutes so MPs can go to an event hosted by the Queen and Prince Philip .

Mr Anderson, who this week is taking part in a cycle ride to Westminster to highlight calls for tougher laws on dangerous dogs, said  shortening the debate so MPs could attend a royal reception was  ‘disgraceful’ and ‘ludicrous’. He said: ‘It’s just ridiculous that something so important, that concerns saving lives and affects thousands of people – especially us who lost a daughter – is being changed for some party. ‘I am sure if the Queen was aware of this, she would not approve.

A 13-month old baby who was on the brink of death when his heart stopped for nine minutes is making a miraculous recovery at home with his family. Tiny Bobby Hutley was struck down with a deadly strain of bacterial meningitis in February and was rushed to hospital. His condition then dramatically deteriorated and his terrified parents, Glen, 25, and Stacie, 24, could only watch as medics gave their little boy CPR. Recovery: Bobby Hutley was close to death when he contracted bacterial meningitis and his heart stopped for nine minutes . Miraculously, Bobby's heart restarted and he pulled through. The critically ill infant spent 12 days in intensive care and another two weeks in hospital before finally being allowed home on May 21. Courageous Bobby is now going from strength to strength after winning his bitter fight for life. And grateful Glen and Stacie, of Thetford, Norfolk, are now setting out to raise money for Meningitis UK to thank the charity for their help and support during their traumatic ordeal. Glen, his father, said: 'We call Bobby our miracle little boy, and we want to do our best for the charity that helped us.' He said Bobby fell ill in February and was taken by Stacie to see their GP. She was told he had a chest infection and and they should give him plenty of fluids. But Bobby's condition steadily worsened and he developed a persistent rash. His worried parents took him to the A&E unit at West Suffolk hospital, Bury St Edmunds, where he was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis disease. Bobby was immediately transferred to Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge. 'The feeling of anxiety was absolutely horrific, it was a horrendous time,' said Glen. The devastated Hutleys feared they were going to lose their only child when Bobby's heart suddenly stopped. Remarkable: Bobby's parents Glen, 25, and Stacie, 24, say their only child has little scarring and his awareness is fantastic . 'I thought if they do bring him round, what is going to happen from there? What quality of life is he going to have? 'But it is a true miracle that he is walking again now and his awareness is fantastic,' said Glen. 'People look at him and they don't suspect that he has had meningitis because all he has been left with is minor scarring.' Stacey said since Bobby is doing really well and has had a string of hospital and follow-up appointments to monitor his progress. The sales assistant said: 'It took him a while to come back to his former self. 'When he first came out of hospital he was like a newborn baby, he could not even hold his head up. 'But now Bobby's walking and talking and he is doing really well. 'He has had a few problems with his left eye, he has a bit of a lazy eye, but he has not had to go to hospital about it.' Stacey spoke of her shock when Bobby was confirmed to have meningitis. 'Bobby was a well, happy boy and I did not see anything like that coming and it seriously affected our whole family,' she said. Stacey praised her family for their backing throughout that nightmare time as well as saluting Meningitis UK. 'It was nice to know that their support was there as an option if we wanted to talk about it,~ she said. 'It is very difficult to speak to somebody who has not been through the experience, so it is nice to be able to share your thoughts and feelings with somebody who had.' The Hutleys are to hold a ball at Sprowston Manor Hotel in Norwich on October 26 to raise money for Meningitis UK.","Bobby Hutley fell ill in February, but doctors said he had a chest infection .

House Speaker John Boehner today told fellow Republicans that his talks with President Barack Obama have stalled. 'The Senate needs to hold tough,' Representative Greg Walden said Boehner told House GOP lawmakers. 'The president now isn't negotiating with us.' Obama rejected the speaker’s effort to lift the debt ceiling for six weeks and reopen government in exchange for a budget negotiating process. Stalemate: Speaker of the House John Boehner walks to his office after a meeting with fellow Republicans at the Capitol in Washington today . Attention now turns to the Senate, where a bipartisan group of Senators are working on a separate plan to reopen the government. Word of the negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and the top Republican, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, emerged as the Senate, as expected, rejected a Democratic effort to raise the government's borrowing limit through next year. Republicans objected because they want the extension to be accompanied by spending cuts. The calendar is edging closer to the October 17 deadline to raise the federal debt ceiling. After that, administration officials have said the government will deplete its ability to borrow money, risking a first-time federal default that could jolt the world economy. Business not as usual: President Barack Obama yesterday discussed challenges from the partial government shutdown small business owners . GOP senators said the talks between Reid and McConnell had started Friday. That was confirmed by Senate Democratic aides. 'I was happy to see the Republicans engaged in talks with the president, the House Republicans. That’s over with. It’s done. They’re not talking anymore,' Reid said. 'I say to my friends on the Republican side of this Senate, time is running out.' Saturday's Senate vote derailing the Democrats' debt-limit measure was a near party-line 53-45 in favor of the bill. That fell seven short of the 60 required to overcome Republican objections to considering the measure. 'The only thing that's happening right now is Senator Reid and Senator McConnell are talking. And I view that as progress,' said the second-ranking Republican senator, John Cornyn of Texas. House conservatives said Obama was to blame for the talks with their chamber running aground. 'Perhaps he sees this as the best opportunity for him to win the House in 2014,' said Representative John Fleming. 'It's very clear to us he does not now, and never had, any intentions of negotiating.' Negotiating: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada is surrounded by reporters as he leaves the Senate floor to meet with Senate Democrats regarding the government shutdown and debt ceiling . Time is ticking: Republican Senator from Kentucky Mitch McConnell walks off the Senate floor after a vote on the motion to proceed on the Debt Limit Bill . 'It doesn't have to be this way. It's not supposed to be this way,' Obama said in his weekly radio and Internet address Saturday. 'Manufacturing crises to extract massive concessions isn't how our democracy works, and we have to stop it. Politics is a battle of ideas, but you advance those ideas through elections and legislation - not extortion.' A bipartisan group of senators, closely watched by Senate leaders, is polishing a plan aimed at reaching compromise with Obama. An emerging proposal by Senator Susan Collins would reportedly fund the government . through March, raise the debt ceiling through January, give federal . agencies flexibility to manage across-the-board cuts caused by . sequestration, and delay Obamacare's medical device tax by two years. New plan: Republican Senator from Maine Susan Collins leaves a Republican meeting and heads to the Senate floor to vote on the motion to proceed on the Debt Limit Bill . In the face of disastrous opinion polls, GOP leaders have signaled they will make sure the debt limit is increased with minimal damage to the financial markets. But they're still seeking concessions as a condition for reopening the government. Obama met Senate Republicans on Friday and heard a pitch from Collins on raising the debt limit until the end of January, reopening the government and cutting the health care law at its periphery. The plan also would strengthen income verification for people receiving subsidies through the health care law and set up a broader set of budget talks. The Collins proposal would delay for two years a medical-device tax that helps finance the health care law, and it would subject millions of individuals eligible for subsidies to purchase health insurance under the program to stronger income verification. Collins said Obama said the proposal 'was constructive, but I don't want to give the impression that he endorsed it.'","John Boehner and President Obama's negotiations to end the shutdown have ended .

Added boost: Mr Bhunnoo says that men can be as self-conscious about their looks as women and that he is 'selling them some confidence' Mr Bhunnoo centre with models Perry Ripley, left, and Andreas Zekaqis, the pair have already sold more than 1,000 of the shirts to image conscious men . They have been designed with a special material which tenses and relaxes with the wearer. More than 1,000 of the 'Funkybod Muscle Tops' costing £29.99 each have already been sold - with many going to the US and image-conscious California. The advert boasts: 'Worn as a normal undershirt garment, the Funkybod top is a great confidence booster for men in the same way a padded bra works for women.' Ash and Ricky - both ultra-fit amateur boxers - came up with the idea after noticing a growing number of friends hitting the gym to change their appearance. Ash, a builder from Chatham, Medway said: 'Men can be as vain as women so we're just selling them some confidence. 'There are skinny guys who are perfectly healthy but when they go out on a Friday night they want to look a bit more buff. 'Women have always been into padded bras and that kind of thing.

'I don't know what it is about Americans and vanity but they just love it. 'People at the gym like them, and so do bouncers.' Ash and Ricky took their idea to a product development company in London who helped them come up with the blueprint. They funded a limited production run themselves and quickly sold out of their initial stock of 100.

All nine of the teenagers reported missing from a rural ranch for troubled youth are back with their parents, according to the compound's attorney, however police remain reluctant to remove an Amber Alert until the location and well-being of the teens can be confirmed following allegations of abuse. On Saturday New Mexico police confirmed that four of the nine presumed missing were in the custody of their parents but said they were still searching for the other five. A search warrant was executed on Friday as part of the investigation of abuse at the Tierra Blanca High Country Youth Program, located at a 30,000-acre compound in high desert country, about seven miles from Hillsboro. However officials said that the teens, aged from 13 to 17, weren't at the property in Sierra County, nor was program operator Scott Chandler, who was named a person of interest in the case. Scott Chandler, pictured, has been named a person of interest in the case. His lawyer said all nine boys have been located . Pete Domenici, the . attorney for the ranch, told CNN early Sunday that the teens . were all with their parents and have been for 'many, many hours'. 'The five remaining kids . on the state police Amber Alert have all been with their parents for . over 24 hours. One boy who is still listed as part of the active Amber . Alert, has been with his parents since Wednesday.' The news comes after the Albuquerque Journal reported last week that state authorities were investigating claims that teenage boys were beaten and forced to wear leg shackles and handcuffs for minor violations of rules at the unlicensed program. Domenici said in a statement Friday that the boys had been 'on a previously scheduled activity away from the ranch for several days' and that nothing was wrong. 'They are safe and have already been picked up by their parents, or their parents are en route to pick them up,' he said. Domenici accused the state of escalating the situation by failing to agree to an emergency hearing in a lawsuit the ranch filed this week over what the suit contends was an improperly handled investigation. However, authorities issued an Amber Alert for the teenagers minutes after Domenici's statement was released, saying they need to 'visually' see the boys.

Susana Martinez told KRQE. 'We're required by law to investigate, and when you . suddenly show up to the place and everybody's gone, it's of huge concern . to us.' Jim Moffat, whose step-son was killed at the ranch in a rollover accident off the property last month, said at the weekend he had no reason to doubt the safety of the boys. He said he sent his son - 18-year-old Bruce Staeger - to the ranch after he could no longer deal with him misbehaving at home, running away and getting into trouble with police. 'We didn't know what was going on,' he said. 'But we saw some great results. He turned into an awesome young man.' Program operators had been ordered to send the kids back to their parents or surrender them to the state after staff members were accused of beating and shackling students. The operators of the ranch, Scott and Collette Chandler, deny any children have been harmed and filed a lawsuit this week accusing investigators of targeting the ranch for closure following a fatal car crash involving students. The operators also said investigators have been illegally interviewing students and telling parents to pull their children from the program by Friday or face abuse charges. Their lawsuit said at least one family was contacted directly by Gov. Susana Martinez, a claim her office denies. At a news conference earlier this week, Chandler said Tierra Blanca has been operating for nearly 20 years. Its website promises a program for unmanageable kids that offers a balance of love, discipline and structure.

Mathews said in court that he had talked with Okenka on the bus that afternoon . 'Prior to me exiting the bus, I reached for what I thought was her purse, but it was the leash for her dog,' Mathews said. He added that he let go when he realized he had grabbed the leash.

Okenka has had the dog named Ingrid for four years, and usually does not hold its leash. She held tight as Mathews yanked in vain and then ran off the bus after a few unsuccessful pulls. She told WTVG in July that she held on so tightly the leash cut her hand when Mathews tried to steal Ingrid. ‘A lot of times, I don't have a hold of her leash, because she's so trained, I just let her lay down,’ Okenka told the Toledo Blade in July. In the struggle for service dog Ingrid, seen here in a Facebook photo, Okenka's finger was reportedly cut and injured . Ingrid helps Okenka with almost everything, from dressing and undressing to opening and closing doors, picking up things she drops and other routine tasks, she told the Blade. Okenka was confused as to why the man would want Ingrid, telling WTVG that maybe he wanted to use her for fighting and wondering to the Blade if he thought he could sell the dog because of her training. The dog would not be of much use to anyone else, Okenka explained to the paper in July. ‘She's trained to do them for me, you can drop things all day long and she's just going to look at you,’ Okenka said.

For the first time since 1937 a baby has been born on one of Britain's tiniest and most remote islands. Thea Windridge-Hicks arrived 76 years after the last birth on St Agnes in the Isles of Scilly, which has had its population increased to 73. A midwife had to take a boat from the mainland to the island after Grace Windridge, 24, went into labour while having a bath. Historic day: Proud mother Grace Windridge with her new born baby Thea Windridge-Hicks, the first child to be born on St Agnes in the Isles of Scilly since 1937 . Distant idyll: St Agnes is one of the most distant parts of the UK and has 73 people living there permanently, half the population there 150 years ago . Pregnant women living on the islands normally travel to St Mary's, the largest of the islands, or Cornwall to give birth as there are no doctors or hospitals on St Agnes. But parents Grace and Aiden Hicks, 24, who have a three-year-old son Joss, had planned a home birth. The last person to have been born on St Agnes was Janice Nicholas, 76, who moved from the island several years ago. Delighted Grace said: 'It was absolutely fantastic and went exactly how we wished it to. 'It felt extra special being able to give birth to our little girl on the island which we plan to bring her up on. 'Because my first labour was so quick we thought it would be best to plan the birth at home as we would have had to get a helicopter to the hospital on the mainland. 'It's really fortunate we did as there is no way we would have been able to get to the mainland in time for Thea to be born.' She's a beauty: Thea is the first child born on the island since the 1930s after her mum opted for a home birth and a midwife who sped there by boat . All change: A pregnant Grace Windridge and partner Aidan Hicks with their son Joss on St Agnes, which now has 73 people living on it . Growing family: Thea's big brother Joss keeps a protective eye on the one-week-old little girl . One of the five inhabited islands that make up the Isles of Scilly, St Agnes is an archipelago 28 miles off Lands End - the most South Westerly point of the British Isles. Its gloriously mild weather, bracing pollution-free sea air and abundant flora, all thanks to the nearby path of the Gulf Stream, make it one of the nicest places to live the UK . St Agnes, a small flower farming community, is completely untouched. Birds, butterflies and wildflowers abound practically all year round here, including many rare species not found elsewhere in the UK. Its main industry is tourism and this is reflected in its amenities, with several B&Bs, a tiny post office and a pub, the Turks Head. Its most famous landmark is the lighthouse (pictured) which has been keeping shipping safe since 1680. She went into labour while . having a bath on October 5 and she called her fiance Aiden, an . electrician, who took her into the living room. He . called midwife Annie, who is stationed at St Mary's, who got a boat to . the island as soon as possible and arrived just in time. Thea was born on the couple's living room floor at around 1pm on October 5 weighing a healthy 7lb 12oz.

'It felt so special to give birth at home as it meant Joss was able to come over straight after to meet his little sister. 'Aiden was bought up on the island so has a lot of family here who were also able to meet Thea very soon after birth.' Grace is originally from Leicester and the engaged couple met when Grace got a summer job on the island aged 16.

Arizona officials say tourists should be able to return to Grand Canyon National Park on Saturday after the state along with several counterparts agreed to a federal government plan.But the Obama administration's OK to reopen parks closed by the government shutdown came with a big caveat: States must foot the bill with money they likely won't see again.So far, Utah, Colorado, South Dakota, Arizona and New York have agreed. Governors in other states were trying to gauge what would be the bigger economic hit - paying to keep the parks operating or losing the tourist money that flows when the scenic attractions are open. The US state of Utah began re-opening its national parks like the Grand Canyon and Bryce Canyon (pictured here) on October 11, 2013 after striking a deal with federal authorities . The Grand Canyon re-opened on Saturday after it was closed during the federal government shutdown . South Dakota and several corporate donors worked out a deal with the National Park Service to reopen Mount Rushmore beginning Monday. Gov. Dennis Daugaard said it will cost $15,200 a day to pay the federal government to run the landmark in the Black Hills.He said he wired four days' worth of the donations on Friday. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state will pay $61,600 a day to fully fund Park Service personnel and keep the Statue of Liberty open. States like Utah decided to pay to keep parks open because the cost of losing tourism would damage the local economy . Even the bathrooms at the main entrance to Grand Canyon National Park were closed until Saturday . Arizona officials said a deal reached Friday will mean visitors should be able to return to Grand Canyon National Park on Saturday.Arizona Republican Gov. Jan Brewer balked at spending about $112,000 a day for a full reopening of the Grand Canyon. She said a partial reopening would be much cheaper while allowing tourists to visit and businesses to benefit.'The daily cost difference is enormous, especially without assurances that Arizona will be reimbursed,' said Andrew Wilder, a spokesman for Brewer. Park rangers had to explain to disappointed visitors that the park was closed . Visitors to Zion National Park take in the sights after the park re-opened . In the end, Arizona agreed to pay the Park Service $651,000 to keep the Grand Canyon open for seven days. The $93,000 a day is less than the $112,000 the federal government had said was needed to fund park operations each day.In additional to state money, cash provided by the town of Tusayan, just outside the South Rim entrance, and private business would also be included in the funding.At this time of year, the Grand Canyon draws about 18,000 people a day who pump an estimated $1 million a day into the local economy. The town of Tusayan, and area businesses have pledged $400,000 to help reopen the canyon, but Wilder said it was unclear if the Interior Department could accept private funds.In Utah, federal workers rushed to reopen five national parks for 10 days after the state sent $1.67 million to the U.S. government with the hope of saving its lucrative tourist season.Zion National Park superintendent Jock Whitworth said staff members began opening gates and removing barriers and expected to have the park fully operational Saturday.'This is a practical and temporary solution that will lessen the pain for some businesses and communities in Utah during this shutdown,' Interior Department Secretary Sally Jewell said in a statement. New york will pay $61,000 a day to keep the Statue of Liberty open . It was welcome news for beleaguered shop owners in the small town of Springdale adjacent to Zion. Hotels have been vacant and rental and retail shops have seen sales plummet during the shutdown.'It's going to be awesome,' said Jenna Milligan of Zion Outfitters, an outdoor gear rental shop. 'A lot of businesses have suffered severely because of the government. I just hope it does stay open through autumn.'In Colorado, officials said a deal had been struck for the state to pay $360,000 to reopen Rocky Mountain National Park for 10 days to allow tourists to reach Estes Park. The visitors are needed to help the town recover from flooding.Just over 400 national parks, recreation areas and monuments - including such icons as the Grand Canyon and Yosemite - have been closed since Oct. 1 because of the partial government shutdown.More than 20,000 National Park Service employees have been furloughed, and lawmakers from both parties have complained that the closures have wreaked havoc on communities that depend on tourism.Interior Department spokesman Blake Androff said Thursday the government had no plans to reimburse states that pay to reopen parks. But members of Congress introduced legislation Friday to refund the money within 90 days.In Utah, Herbert estimated the economic impact of the federal government shutdown at $100 million in his state.","So far Utah, Colorado, South Dakota, Arizona, and New York have agreed to pay to keep parks open .

Marks & Spencer’s ‘leading ladies’ advertising campaign has failed to win new customers for the ailing store, a new poll reveals. The ‘make or break’ campaign, launched amid much fanfare last month, has flopped because it has failed to resonate with middle-class customers, research suggests. To promote the new autumn clothing range, the company drafted in a dozen ‘iconic’ women, such as Olympic boxing gold medal winner Nicola Adams and ballerina Darcey Bussell. Not so iconic: According to industry insiders, Dame Helen Mirren was the only figure in the adverts regarded by many as a household name and an icon to middle Britain . But a survey by polling company YouGov UK has found that despite M&S spending up to £5 million on the advertising blitz, consumers have been unimpressed. The survey found that nearly 40 per cent of the adult population had seen the advertising by last week after the campaign had been in full swing for more than a month. But the number that said they planned to buy M&S clothes increased only slightly, from 23 per cent to 24 per cent. Among women, the figure was slightly higher at 25 per cent. YouGov chief operating officer Tim Britton said: ‘It’s no secret M&S’s retail arm, particularly women’s fashion, is struggling and our research shows that while consumers are aware of the campaign, it has not yet made them want to go out and buy M&S clothing.’ According to industry insiders, Dame Helen Mirren was the only figure in the adverts regarded by many as a household name and an icon to middle Britain. The inclusion of controversial artist Tracey Emin is believed to have actually shocked many of M&S’s traditionally conservative customers. Ms Emin said when the campaign launched that she spent ‘half my life’ wearing M&S pyjamas, but to many she is most remembered for her  ‘My Bed’ art installation, which included condoms, a pair  of knickers and an empty cigarette packet. M&S Britain's Leading Ladies from left to right: Monica Ali, Ellie Goulding, Karen Elson, Katie Piper, Helen Allen, Darcy Bussell, Jasmine Whitbread, Helen Mirren, Nicola Adams and Tracey Emin . Last month, M&S chief executive Marc Bolland denied reports that the new autumn range was make or break for the store after two years of declining sales. He is understood to have insisted to investors that the campaign is working well and that more time is needed to revive the chain’s fortunes. A new internet strategy is being planned for next year.Industry insiders said the campaign is nevertheless seen as the benchmark against which he will be measured. The survey supports concerns raised by City analysts last week over the success  of the new clothing ranges  at M&S. The company declined to comment on the figures ahead of its crucial trading statement in three weeks’ time. But brokers at Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are among those who believe  M&S will say next month  that fashion sales so far this year have been worse than  last year, before Mr Bolland’s latest turnaround plan was  set in motion.","A dozen 'iconic' women were hired .

Early colognes used civetone derived from the African Civet, officially known as Civettictis civetta. Modern-day perfurmes, including Calvin Klein's Obsession for Men, use a synthetic version of this chemical. It is thought the compound acts in a . similar way to territorial markings, which intrigue the cats enough to . make them approach it. Researchers during the original 2010 study experimented with a range of different fragrances to see how two cheetahs reacted to them. The cats spent more than 11 minutes - longer than any other scent - sniffing and nuzzling up to a tree sprayed with Obsession for Men. The Calvin Klein fragrance, pictured left, is popular with jaguars and other large cats because it contains a synthetic version of a chemical taken from the scent glands of nocturnal mammals in Asia and Africa. Sex Panther, right, was a cologne used in the film Anchorman, said to be made from chemicals found in panthers . One program director in Guatemala has . been using the perfume since 2007 to determine the jaguar's . population in the jungle. Roan .

'But . this technique is only effective if animals pass through the cameras' detection range and we get adequate photos,' McNab told the Wall . Street Journal. After hearing about its potency, his team tried spraying the perfume onto a rag tied to a stake in the ground. 'We're . just starting to get an idea of how jaguars behave in their habitat,' McNab said. 'Before we used Obsession for Men we weren't able to get . these images at all.' Obsession . for Men launched in 1986. Ann Gottlieb, one of the creators of Obsession for Men's scent, said it had synthetic 'animal' notes. 'It's a combination of this lickable vanilla heart married to this fresh green top note - it creates tension. It sparks curiosity with humans and, apparently, animals.'

As you watch the drunken antics of eligible new Downton Abbey character Sir John Bullock on your screens tonight, spare a thought for Andrew Alexander, the actor who plays him. This time last year, during his star turn in the West End production of The 39 Steps, newly married and just back from an African honeymoon, he was struck down with  a parasitic infection that doctors failed to diagnose for almost five months. Some rare African disease perhaps? In fact, Andrew had an incredibly common bacterial infection: toxoplasmosis. Fully fit: Andrew Alexander as Sir John Bullock in Downton Abbey suffered a parasitic infection which doctors were unable to diagnose for five months . Many will have heard about it in the context of pregnant women. The bacteria, toxoplasma, that causes the disease hides in cat faeces and uncooked meat, and can attack  the developing foetus. Expectant women are advised to avoid changing cat litter and eating rare meat. A Food Standards Agency report, published in 2012, suggests that 350,000 people become infected every year in the UK. Only one in five of those feels ill. Should symptoms appear, they are similar to a those of a viral infection such as flu or glandular fever – swollen lymph nodes in the neck and groin, fever, aching muscles and weakness. When Andrew, 31, became unwell he had no idea what was wrong. ‘I had been in The 39 Steps for 11 months, doing eight shows a week,’ said the actor – who last week was reported to be Kate Middleton’s first crush after they appeared together in a school production of My Fair Lady. Andrew took a break to get married and then went away for a three-week honeymoon. When he and his artist wife Araxie, 30, returned, he began to feel tired and lethargic with a sore throat. Big balls: Andrew's lymphs swelled up to the size of golfballs when he contracted toxoplasmosis . He thought he was just run down.But over the following week strange lumps appeared on his neck. ‘One night, just before we went on stage, my co-star, Catherine Bailey, gasped with horror, “What on earth is on your neck?” ’ His lymph glands had grown to the size of golf balls. ‘I felt like Frankenstein,’ he says. ‘The whole cast gathered around to look at me.’ His production company immediately sent him to a Harley Street doctor. ‘He thought it was viral,’ says Andrew. ‘I was given a laryngoscopy – where a camera looks at the back of the throat – and sent home to recuperate.’ But his health continued to deteriorate. He was exhausted and was signed off work for two weeks. After a fortnight, Andrew’s puzzled GP referred him to St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington – but they were equally perplexed. Professor Edward Guy, head of the National Toxoplasma Research Unit in Swansea, explained why the infection can be difficult to diagnose. ‘Toxoplasma is a single-celled microscopic parasite ingested via the mouth. Once in the body it enters the bloodstream via the gut. This  is the point at which the immune system kicks in and we feel ill. ‘Most people don’t notice they  have it, but if symptoms appear  they are similar to a viral infection and the immune system reacts  and suppresses it, usually within four weeks.’ The parasite is easy to ingest, but the way it survives is quite unsavoury. ‘Toxoplasma is only able to procreate within the gut of a cat,’ says Prof Guy. ‘The resulting eggs – called oocysts – exit the cat’s body in faeces. These can survive for a year or more, often in or around the soil where cats choose to defecate.’ Humans may ingest it by touching soil then putting fingers in their mouths. It can also be caught by eating undercooked meat from an animal that has eaten oocysts. It cannot be passed from person to person. ‘Because of the lack of symptoms, doctors rarely come across toxoplasmosis,’ says Dr Carmel Curtis, consultant microbiologist at The London Clinic. ‘Most people don’t even go to their doctor.’ After three months Andrew was referred to a West London health centre with a tropical disease unit. He was screened for various infections, and one of the blood tests showed toxoplasmosis. ‘It was a huge relief to have a diagnosis,’ he says. ‘After months of uncertainty,  I was told that I’d recover all by myself and just to go home.’ It is not known why some people have the kind of extreme symptoms Andrew experienced. ‘It could be because he ingested more of the oocysts,’ suggests Prof Guy. Although he is now fine, the toxoplasma will remain in his body for the rest of his life and could be reactivated should his immune system be compromised. Some think the existence of the parasite in the central nervous system may cause subtle behavioural and personality changes. A study published last month even suggested that infected mice lose their fear of cats – meaning that cats consume the mice and the parasite is able to continue its cycle. Andrew now glows with health, however – all 6ft 3in of him – and has put his nightmare behind him. ‘At least I was better by the time we started filming Downton,’ he says.","Actor Andrew Alexander was stuck down with toxoplasmosis .

The U.S. confirmed on Friday that American troops are holding a senior Pakistani Taliban commander, a blow to the Pakistani Taliban who have waged a decadelong insurgency against Islamabad and were responsible for the failed 2010 attempt to detonate a bomb in New York's Times Square. Latif Mehsud, a leader of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, was captured by U.S. forces in a military operation, Marie Harf, deputy spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said in Washington. 'Mehsud is a senior commander in TTP, and served as a trusted confident of the group's leader, Hakimullah Mehsud,' Harf said. 'TTP claimed responsibility, as folks probably know, for the attempted bombing of Times Square in 2010 and has vowed to attack the U.S. homeland again. TPP is also responsible for attacking our diplomats in Pakistan and attacks that have killed countless Pakistani civilians.' Caught: Pakistani Taliban commander Latif Mehsud sits with fellows in Sararogha in south Waziristan in Pakistan. U.S. troops are holding the senior Pakistani Taliban commander they captured in Afghanistan a week ago . The news surfaced as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was in Kabul trying to negotiate the terms of a U.S.-Afghan security agreement that would govern the activities of American forces in Afghanistan after the NATO-led combat mission ends at the close of next year. Harf said she did not have any details of how, when or where Mehsud was captured. Arsallah Jamal, governor of Logar province in eastern Afghanistan, said Mehsud was captured a week ago as he was driving along a main highway in Mohammad Agha district. The road links the province with the Afghan capital, Kabul. Jamal said Mehsud was in a car with two or three other men when the U.S. military arrested him. The Pakistani Taliban confirmed the capture but claimed Mehsud was seized Oct. 5 by the Afghan army at the Ghulam Khan border crossing in the eastern province of Khost. Captured: Latif Mehsud, the second highest ranking member of the Pakistani Taliban has been captured by U.S. forces. The TTP claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing of Times Square in 2010 and has vowed to attack the U.S. again . He was returning from a meeting to discuss swapping Afghan prisoners for money, said Pakistani Taliban commanders and intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media. The Pakistani intelligence officials said American forces seized Mehsud while he was with the Afghan army, and that they no longer know where he is. Mehsud, believed to be around 30 years old, once served as Hakimullah Mehsud's driver but eventually became a trusted deputy. The two are not related. Mehsud is a common name in the region. Terrorist: Faisal Shahzad was sentenced to a life in prison for carrying out a failed attempt to bomb Times Square in 2010 . The U.S. military in Kabul referred all questions to the Defense Department in Washington. A Pentagon spokeswoman, Navy Cmdr. Elissa Smith, said the Pentagon had no comment on the report. A U.S. defense official said Mehsud was being lawfully held by U.S. military forces in Afghanistan. A senior U.S. official said the arrest did not please Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who apparently saw it as a violation of Afghan sovereignty. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the issue with the media. There was no immediate comment from Karzai's office on the report. The detention may have contributed to a . series of emotional outbursts this week by Karzai, who alleged that the . U.S. and NATO have inflicted suffering on the Afghan people and . repeatedly have violated its sovereignty. There . were reports that talks over the past two weeks on a bilateral security . agreement were delayed because of the incident.

As empowering as the internet has been in helping us take charge of our . health – from online pharmacy services to sites such as WebMD where we . can research any illnesses we may have and their potential treatments – . it has also led to something more worrying. More than ever, people are trying to diagnose and treat themselves rather than consulting a doctor. While I was aware of it from my own practice, the true extent is quite astounding. Playing doctor: Home remedies can sometimes even make a condition or ailment worse . For . it’s one thing treating your cold with hot drinks and honey, but the . DIY ‘cures’ some people try are far beyond anything I had imagined. I . have seen countless patients who tried home remedies before finally . making it to my surgery and I’m used to garlic for sore throats and . bananas for diarrhoea. So . when the opportunity came up to be involved with new Channel 4 series . Health Freaks, which will put some of people’s home cures to the test, I . wasn’t expecting to be surprised. How wrong I was. Testing the treatments . The . series, which starts on October 21, will give those who truly believe . in their DIY cures, no matter how strange or unbelievable they are, the . chance to put them to a panel of medical professionals and find out what . we doctors think. Across . the series, the panel of doctors, including myself, Dr Pixie McKenna and . Dr Ayan Panja, are pitched to by more than 40 people, who all genuinely . believe in their home remedy. [caption . From oat baths for psoriasis and duct tape for verrucas to gargling with coconut oil for gingivitis and – bizarrely – breast milk for skin infections, we have heard a number of compelling cases for cures that could really work and should be explored further. Some we even put to the test in a small trial, too. But surprisingly, we also heard from people who’ve been using treatments that are downright dangerous. Just give it a squirt of WD-40 . Two of the first people to pitch were builders Andy and Simon. They told us how they use WD-40, the industrial lubricant spray used to repel water and prevent corrosion, as a cure for arthritis and chest pain. They have been spraying this product on their skin. Apparently it is a common builders’ remedy, and many across the country use it, genuinely believing it will treat their ailments. As a doctor who’s never used WD-40 anywhere other than my bike, I couldn’t quite believe it. But our contributors really believed in their remedy, so we had to warn them to stop and try something more appropriate for their condition AND designed for human use. Why home remedies work . However, as we questioned Andy and Simon on how they believed it worked, it became clear why they could be seeing some improvement in their ailments; with something like this there is almost certainly a placebo effect, particularly in the case of Simon’s tight chest. He genuinely felt an instant improvement, as if he’d used an inhaler. The belief that something is doing you good can be powerful and in some cases is not to be dismissed. However, rubbing a product like WD-40 directly into the skin is definitely not a good idea, as it has not been tested on humans. And of course when I listened to Simon’s chest before and after he’d applied the WD-40 there was no clinical improvement. In the case of the arthritis, it’s more likely that the improvement was due to the physical act of massaging, which we know reduces pain, rather than any chemical effect from the WD-40 spray. More harm than good? Safer . massaging with ibuprofen gels, for example, would do just as good, if . not a better, job – and at least we know they are harmless. We . advised Andy and Simon to stop using this potentially dangerous cure; . it could be a skin irritant and we have no idea of the potential . long-term harmful effects. But I’m pretty sure they believe in it so . much that they ignored us, and the science. Yet . even people using remedies handed down through generations could be . doing more harm than good: one person we met was placing copper coins on . her eye to treat a stye. While styes may not even need treatment, using . money covered in bacteria could spread and worsen what starts out as a . minor infection. Warding off verrucas: Duct tape was found to be a successful way of treating verrucas . Sticking it with the duct tape . One of the first cases we put to a trial was that of Carl, who came to us with a cure for verrucas. Something simple, cheap and in his opinion effective: duct tape. Carl simply covered his painful and long-standing verrucas with a piece of duct tape for seven days, then repeated this process for about a month and his once-stubborn verrucas disappeared. This was pretty compelling because he had already tried the plethora of conventional treatments that doctors like me offer for verrucas. I was sceptical but fascinated to see if it worked, as many patients suffer with recurring verrucas and warts. Collectively as medical practitioners, we thought there could be something in this because of the oxygen starvation, so we conducted a small trial. Not as daft as it sounds . Half of our volunteers used duct tape on their verrucas and half used normal surgical tape, and they all kept video diaries for the month over which the trial took place. Some experiences were good and some not so much. However, when Carl came back for the results we were able to reveal that every participant who had used duct tape had seen a reduction in the size of their verrucas of at least 1mm, which is impressive. It certainly merits further investigation. We found promising results with other home-made remedies, too – for example when one psoriasis sufferer showed that her skin had almost completely healed simply by bathing with oats. Oats are used already in certain skin creams, so this could also warrant further trials to assess their use for serious skin conditions. The series has raised some interesting questions. Some contributors we met identified potential options for further investigation. But not every suggestion was feasible: frankly some were hazardous and bizarre, so I would always recommend people seek medical advice rather than trying to heal themselves with unproven treatments.

A 60-year-old doomsday survivalist has been convicted of stealing $400,000 in coins from his employer to build a massive off-the-grid home to prepare for the world's end. Alaska's Steven D. Berry funded the three-story home - which boasts a gym, hot tub, secret passageways and a Gatling gun on a swivel mount loaded . with a belt of bullets - by raiding the coin vaults of a local car wash. Berry, who still reportedly lives in the Bald Mountain house, will be sentenced in December. Thief: Doomsday survivalist Steve Berry, 60, is accused of building an off-the-grid home by stealing $400,000 in coins from his employer, Mudbusters Car Wash . Alaska Dispatch reported the trouble began in 2009 at Wasilla car wash, Mudbusters, from which Berry had recently been fired. Employee Paul Montanez, 20, told his boss, Mudbusters co-owner Karen Mahoy, he had seen Berry twice lug five-gallon buckets full of quarters to the Alaska USA Federal Credit Union. Berry allegedly told Montanez he was depositing money for Mudbusters, however the business did not use that bank. Karen Mahoy and her husband Stephen Mahoy had already suspected Berry had been raiding the company coin vaults for years and was taking home $1,000 bricks of dollar coins from the bank. Within nine months of Berry leaving, the company took in an extra $30,000. 'That . was the first red flag,' Karen Mahoy said. 'We were suddenly buying a . lot less dollar coins from the bank and depositing a lot more money.' Suspicious: Mudbusters owners Steve and Karen Mahoy suspected Berry had been raiding the company coin vaults for years and was taking home $1,000 bricks of dollar coins from the bank . Berry's former wife, Tasha Buxton, also believes Berry is still hiding a small fortune in coins or cash, according to Alaska Dispatch. Buxton, 41, helped turned Berry in once she realized what he'd done. It was revealed at trial that Berry buried jars of money because he couldn't trust banks and had hidden $30,000 when he moved, penniless, from Maine to Alaska in 1999. While Berry only earned about $50,000 a year as a manager at Mudbusters, he had a big house, a time-share in Las Vegas, a pair of snow machines, a four-wheeler and numerous cars. Berry also spent a fortune renovating his home, constructing a secret room behind the master bedroom closet that contained food, water and ammunition, as well as more than 20 guns. Testified: Berry's ex-wife, 41-year-old Tasha Buxton, helped to turn in Berry once she realized what he'd done . Buxton said his collection included a $4,000 semiautomatic Gatling gun, part of more than $13,000 in items once purchased at a garage sale. From the escape room, a ladder into the attic ultimately provided access to the living room closet. An escape chute allowed someone to drop onto a fuel tank in the basement. Buxton also said the house hid $100,000 in coins, but ultimately, only $50,000 worth of change ended up in the basement wall, hidden behind plastic sheeting, foam insulation and shelving. While Buxton thought it strange her . husband stockpiled his savings in coins, she didn't think it out of step . with an 'end-of-the-worlder' paranoid character. However she saw things differently when the Mahoys accused Berry of stealing. 'Once . I realize there's $100,000 hidden and movement toward a civil case . saying he'd stolen more than $400,000, that's when I really started . questioning his stories,' Buxton said. Affidavit . Investigator Ruthan Josten said in November 2011 that she obtained a . warrant to search Berry’s home, which she described as a half-million . dollar home run on batteries, a generator and solar power. 'A . large amount of U.S. Mint coins were found as well as coin counters. I . found a receipt that showed he recently spent $14,000 at a garage sale,' Josten said, according to Mat Su Valley Frontiersman. '[Buxton] . showed me a secret room in the house that contained life essentials, a . place to sleep and an ‘excape chute’ that went to the basement.' She . also told Josten that he’d hid $1,000 in the wall but removed it after . their relationship fell apart and both filed domestic violence . restraining orders on each other. At . trial, according to the log notes, Berry maintained that the $500,000 . price tag on the home was only its insured value and that he built it . out of pocket. On September 6, a jury in Palmer found . Berry guilty of first-degree theft of more than $25,000, a Class B . felony and the state's most severe theft charge. A . forensic accountant, who examined years of car wash records and Berry's . bank accounts, testified the car wash had lost at least $414,750 between . 2001 and early 2009. The . charge carries up to 10 years in prison, according to Alaska law. The sentence is set to be decided at a December 16 hearing.","Doomsday survivalist Steve Berry, 60, is convicted of stealing $400,000 to build a massive off-the-grid home in Alaska .

Joe Kinan lost his girlfriend and 40 per cent of his skin when The Station nightclub in West Warwick, Rhode Island caught fire during a concert in February 2003. Kinan was the most injured survivor of the fire, with third and fourth degree burns covering nearly half of his body. He also lost his hands, ears, the sight in his left eye and much of his nose tissue. So far, he has had 120 surgeries. While some would let such blows get the better of them - Kinan remained positive and that attitude has clearly paid off. At the World Burn Congress in Providence Rhode Island this week, Kinan announced that he had fallen in love with another burn victim, and that they are engaged.

Not alone: Kinan met his fiance Carrie Pratt at the World Burn Conference in Vancouver, Canada six years ago. Pratt was badly hurt by hot coffee as a young child . Initially devastated after his then-girlfriend died in the horrific nightclub blaze - one of 100 lives lost - Mr Kinan met his now-fiancée Carrie Pratt at the same event 6 years earlier while it was held in Vancouver, Canada. Mr Pratt herself was badly burned by hot coffee when she was a young child. The 44-year-old burn victim says it was at the conference that he first realized he 'wasn't alone.' They first started out as friends, but eventually grew to be something more. Aftermath: The fire at The Station nightclub was the fourth most deadly nightclub fire in U.S. history, killing 100 . 'She made me work for it at first. But she made it a lot easier for me to be open because she knew where I was coming from for the most part,' he told the Providence Journal. Mr Kinan proposed to Ms Pratt a year ago, on the anniversary of their first meeting - just three days before he went into surgery to receive a hand transplant. Happy ending: Kinan proposed to Pratt three days before he went into surgery for a hand transplant a year ago. Kinan and Pratt are pictured above leaving the hospital after the successful transplant . He spoke about the engagement during a session on the emotional challenge that burn victims face - such as overcoming self-esteem issues in dating.

Poor credit: Former banker Giles Darby is pictured outside the Federal Court in Houston in 2006 . It is a far cry from his days as a high-flying City banker, responsible for millions of pounds of business. But after serving time for fraud as one of the infamous ‘NatWest Three’, Giles Darby has begun a new life running a real-ale pub – and it’s strictly cash-only. The 50-year-old was banned from incurring new lines of credit as part of his terms of release, but that’s not the reason he can’t take credit or debit cards behind the bar at the Marlborough Arms in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. ‘The reason we can only take cash is because of this pub’s credit history,’ Darby said. ‘That makes it incredibly difficult to lease a chip-and-pin machine.’ And perhaps ironically for a man who admitted his role in defrauding NatWest, he blames the banks for that predicament. ‘Lloyds would allow me [a card machine] but they would charge me an extortionate amount,’ he said. ‘We’re a new business – we just can’t afford the bank fees. Maybe that’s karma.’ Darby has made no secret of his conviction in the US courts – even posing the question ‘How long did I spend in jail?’ in a pub quiz soon after taking over. But he remains unapologetic about the case. ‘We were stitched up,’ he said. ‘You don’t go up against the US machine and come out a winner.  But I’ve done my time and things have worked out surprisingly well.’ Darby and his co-defendants David Bermingham and Gary Mulgrew hit the headlines in 2006 when they were controversially extradited to the US. In a plea bargain they admitted playing a part in a £3.5million fraud against their employer, NatWest and were sentenced to 37 months in jail. They were allowed to complete their sentence in the UK, and were released three years ago.

European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion Laszlo Andor ordered the report which will be published this week . More than 600,000 unemployed EU citizens are living in Britain at a cost of £1.5billion to the NHS according to a new report. The 291-page study will be published this week by the European Commission and shows the number of European migrants who have moved to the UK but do not have jobs has risen in five years. According to The Sunday Telegraph, the study says the number of non-active EU migrants in Britain rose by 42 per cent between 2006 and 2012. However, the 611,779 migrants who were living in Britain last year cost the NHS about £1.5billion. It is believed the European commissioner for employment, social affairs and inclusion, Laszlo Ando, who ordered the report, is planning to bring a case to court which would make it easier for migrants to claim benefits in the UK. The Department for Work and Pensions has said if successful, it would make the UK a more popular place for migrants to live where they can claim benefits easier. Conservative backbencher Douglas Carswell told The Sunday Telegraph: 'These figures show that the wave of benefit migrants has become a tsunami of economic refugees fleeing the eurozone crisis totry and find jobs here. 'We cannot both continue the free-at-the-point-of-use welfare state and benefits system and allow Europeans to flee the eurozone and come here.' The number of unemployed EU citizens who have moved to Britain for work has risen by 73 per cent in the past three years, according to the report. The report blames economic difficulties in eastern Europe, Greece and Portugal for the rise.

A DWP spokeswoman said: 'We have strict rules in place to protect the integrity of the British benefits system and make sure it is not abused. 'But we are also going further by strengthening the Habitual Residence Test and time-limiting how long some migrants can claim benefits. 'Ministers are also working with their counterparts across Europe to address concerns about the abuse of free movement.

Maintenance work on New York City transit systems ground to a halt Saturday as authorities widened the frantic search for a mute, 14-year-old autistic boy who vanished from his school last week. Surveillance footage from Avonte Oquendo’s Long Island City, Queens school shows him dashing down a hall and out the door around noon on October 4. Two hundred maintenance workers combed the city’s tunnels in search of the boy, who is fascinated by trains and has been found wandering the dangerous paths three times before. Scroll down for video... Missing: Avonte Oquendo is mute and autistic. He vanished October 4 from his Long Island City school in Queens, New York. Subway workers fanned out Saturday in search of the boy, who is fond of trains and has been fond wandering the tunnels before . New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told NBC New York on Friday that 50 officers are now assigned to the case per day and citywide alert has been extended to Long Island and New Jersey. Several promising leads have failed to produce any results in the case, keeping both hope and disappointment very much alive. On Sunday, the reward for Avonte's return had reached $70,000. Avonte was reportedly spotted at a school festival in the DUMBO neighborhood of Brooklyn Saturday around 5:30pm, reports the Daily Dot. ‘The kid in reference caused a bit of a stir as he stood very close [to the DJ],’ wrote the children’s entertainment company FuziPop on their Facebook page, ‘trying to touch the DJ equipment multiple times.’ Surveillance footage from his school shows Avonte dashing down a hallway and out the door October 4. The search for the boy has now spread across New York City and into outlying areas of Long Island and New Jersey . Hopeful: Vanessa Fontaine, left, Avonte's mother, arrives to a vigil October 11 in Queens. Social media has continued to churn up leads in the case, but the boy remained missing Sunday morning . Avonte’s brother Danny has helped make the online search go viral in the days since his disappearance. Thousands of followers have been added to Danny’s social media accounts and a Facebook page called Missing Avonte Oquendo has become a virtual hub for the search. Facebook followers have helped get the flier widely dispersed and have even gotten it translated into Chinese and Portuguese. ‘Avonte requires 24 hour supervision. He is 14 in body, but he has the mind of a very young child,’ reads the Facebook page. ‘Avonte has been alone for 10 days. He needs your help. He may appear dirty, he will have gone to the bathroom on himself, he may seem disoriented and no long answer to his name.’ Vigilant: A vigil was held Saturday as the search continued for Oquendo, with a focus on the areas in and around where Avonte was last seen in Long Island City, Queens . Hopeful: Two hundred transit workers fanned out on Saturday and thousands of other volunteers online and on the ground continued to help in the search Sunday. Avonte may have been sighted at a gathering in the DUMBO area of Brooklyn on Saturday . Avonte cannot care for himself and his family says he may appear soiled and has potentially stopped responding to his own name . On the ground, family and friends organized a vigil Saturday and search parties have fanned out from their headquarters in Queens across the city to help bring Avonte home. 'We get leads throughout the day, and whenever we get them, we try to take them seriously,' said Danny Oquendo. 'We call police detectives, then volunteers who go to that area.' Sunday morning, the search seemed to be focused in an area of Queens north of where Avonte first disappeared. ‘We need more volunteers to canvas the Ditmars area with a focus around 19th and 20th Ave between 37th Street and 81st street,’ Danny urged on his Twitter account @KingDetrick. ‘Go in groups!’ Avonte was last seen wearing black jeans, black sneakers, and a grey striped shirt.

The parents of a toddler with cerebral palsy have told how they face a desperate battle to raise tens of thousands of pounds to pay for him to have life-changing surgery. Oliver Osborne, two, needs pioneering surgery to enable him to walk, but the operation is not  funded by the NHS. His parents, Sallyanne, 38, and Terry, 36, must now raise £60,000 to pay for him to have the operation at either Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital, Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, or Leeds General Infirmary. Oliver Osborne, two, has spastic diplegic cerebral palsy which means he will not be able to walk without a frame unless he has pioneering surgery which is not available on the NHS . Without the surgery, the best they can hope for Oliver is that he will be able to walk with the help of a frame. ‘The surgery would give Oliver the chance for a normal life – I can’t put into words how much it would mean for him,’ Mrs Osborne, from Fareham in Hampshire, told MailOnline. Oliver was born almost 12 weeks early in January 2011 weighing just 2lbs 12oz. He spent seven weeks in hospital during which time he spent weeks in intensive care and he developed the hospital superbug MRSA. Mrs Osborne said: ‘At the time it was the scariest experience. It was described to us by those at the hospital as the biggest rollercoaster you will ever ride, but we got through it. ‘We spent hours staring at monitors willing him to get better.’ Oliver (pictured with his mother, Sallyanne) needs Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy surgery which, until recently, was only available in the U.S. Oliver has recently learnt to stand up with his walking frame but is yet to learn how to walk with it. Without surgery his parents fear he will never be able to play with the other children at school or to ride a bike . Oliver, who has an older sister, Millie, four, was eventually allowed to leave hospital March but he suffered severe reflux meaning he was unsettled and was sick about every hour and a half. He grew out of the reflux but as autumn arrived, he began to develop regular bouts of bronchiolitis – a lower respiratory tract infection. By November 2011, Oliver’s parents, who both work for Virgin Atlantic as on board managers, started to realise something was not right. Mrs Osborne said: ‘We started to realise that Oliver wasn’t really doing anything. Oliver was born almost 12 weeks early in January 2011. When he was born, he weighed just 2lbs 12oz . Oliver spent seven weeks in hospital during which time he spent weeks in intensive care and he developed the hospital superbug MRSA . ‘He was such a happy little man but all he could do was lie on the floor on his back. ‘He couldn’t roll or sit up like other children and hated spending time on his front - he just screamed. ‘We were told by so many people it was just developmental delay and he was just a lazy boy. ‘After months of pushing from us we finally got him to see a physio, and she started to tell us how concerned she was about muscle tone but it really meant nothing to us.’ Oliver (pictured with his mother) was released from hospital when he was seven-weeks-old but just months later his parents realised he was not developing normally as he had not learnt to roll over or sit up . Oliver was eventually diagnosed when a physiotherapist expressed concern about his muscle tone and his parents took him to see a different consultant . Then, in April 2012, Oliver saw a new consultant who finally diagnosed him with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy and his parents were told he might never walk. Mrs Osborne said: ‘We knew something wasn’t quite right but never in our wildest dreams, or should I say nightmares, did we expect to hear that. ‘You go through so many feelings after being told something like that but after a while you pick yourselves up and get on with life again.’ Since his diagnosis, Oliver has been having regular physiotherapy and, as a result, has now leant to roll over, sit up on his own, and crawl. Mrs Osborne said: 'We knew something wasn't quite right but never in our wildest dreams, or should I say nightmares, did we expect to hear that' Mrs Osborne said: 'Life can be so frustrating for him, all he wants to do is join in with other children, scoot, play on a bike and kick a ball. This operation will give him the chance to do this.' Oliver is pictured with his sister, Millie, four . However, to be able to walk without a frame, he needs Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy surgery. This is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs. It involves opening the lower vertebrae to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body. During the procedure, electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves. This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut. Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs. The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body. Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves. This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut. Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic. Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs. Following the surgery, months of intensive physiotherapy is required to help the child walk. The surgery and subsequent physiotherapy cost up to £60,000. Until recently, the operation was only available in the U.S. and Mr and Mrs Osborne are aware that, even now, Oliver may need to travel to America to have the surgery. Funding is not routinely offered by the NHS. Dr Stuart Ward, Medical Director for the Wessex Area Team at NHS England said: 'We sympathise with patients and families who feel they may benefit from this treatment, however, Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR) is not routinely funded by the NHS as the current evidence base does not yet demonstrate sufficient clinical and cost effectiveness for its routine use. 'It has been identified by clinicians and patient representatives as showing significant ""promise"" as a potential treatment option for the future and forms part of the Commissioning through Evaluation programme. 'The Commissioning through Evaluation programme, which was originally developed with clinicians treating heart conditions, will enable SDR, and other appropriate services and/or treatments, to be funded within defined parameters, in a small number of participating centres, and within an explicit evaluation programme.' Mrs Osborne said: ‘Life can be so frustrating for him, all he wants to do is join in with other children, scoot, play on a bike and kick a ball. This operation will give him the chance to do this.’ She told MailOnline: ‘After the surgery he would have some sort of normal life. He could play with the other children – it would be completely different. ‘At the moment he can only crawl – this operation will remove so many restrictions in his life. ‘It will give him less pain in the future and will mean he faces less frustration. It will be absolutely massive for him. ‘Now, the idea of him being able to walk, and even maybe run a little bit, is inconceivable.’ Mr and Mrs Osborne are raising money for Oliver’s treatment through the charity Tree of Hope which helps families raise money for medicines, surgery and treatment which are not available on the NHS. Any money that is left over after Oliver has had his surgery will go to help other sick children. The couple are planning a golf day and also a ball to raise money for the surgery which they hope Oliver will be able to have at the beginning of next summer. Oliver’s four-year-old sister, Millie, is running the 1.5km Mini Great South Run to help with the fundraising. To donate click here.

Morale in the Armed Forces has plummeted in the last three years as jobs losses and pay cuts take their toll. New figures show the number of soldiers in the British Army reporting low morale has doubled since 2010 to 30 per cent. Ministers admitted deep cuts to the Defence budget and restructuring was having an ‘inevitable’ impact on the mood among troops. Uncertainty: Jobs losses and restructuring forced by spending cuts have had the sharpest impact on morale in the Army . The coalition's dramatic reductions in the size of the regular Army, ordering several rounds of redundancies to cut troop numbers from  102,000 to just 82,000. At the same time there are plans to increase the size of the reserves from 15,000 to 30,000. But the combination of pay freezes and job insecurity is having a devastating impact on those who remain. New figures released to Parliament show 30 per cent of soldiers in the Army now have ‘low’ morale, up from 15 per cent in 2010. At the same time the number reporting high morale has fallen from 59 per cent to just 40 per cent. Inevitable: Defence minister Anna Soubry said cuts were bound to impact on morale . Kevan Jones, Labour's shadow defence minister, said: 'With the compulsory redundancies and uncertainty about future numbers, these statistics are hardly surprising. 'The way in which this government are treating servicemen and women and their families is shocking and is counter to all the promises they made at the last election about bigger armies and looking after members of our Armed Forces.' Morale appears to have been least affected in the Royal Navy, with low levels reported by 28 per cent, up just three points since 2010. Among Royal Marines, low morale is now reported by one in four, up from one in five three years ago. Some 46 per cent of Marines said their morale was ‘high’ – the highest level of any of the forces. In the RAF 29 per cent said morale was ‘low’ and 38 per cent said ‘high’. The figures, released in Parliament to Labour MP Gemma Doyle, were drawn from the Armed Forces Continuous Attitude Survey. Defence minister Anna Soubry admitted spending cuts were to blame for the slump in spirits among the armed forces. ‘The recommendations of the Strategic Defence and Security Review have necessitated a series of difficult decisions, including reshaping our armed forces as we move towards “'Future Force 2020”,’ she said. ‘While issues such as headcount reductions and pay restraint have inevitably had an impact on morale, I continue to be impressed by the absolute dedication of our military personnel.’ The results of the survey are used by the Ministry of Defence to overhaul terms and conditions of service. Criticism: With emotions running high, retired Colonel Ian Brazier (left) and Captain Joe Eastwood heckled Britain's Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond as he spoke to the Conservative party conference last week . Miss Soubry added: ‘It is a key function of the chain of command to know their people, including levels of morale and performance. ‘Each of the services has mechanisms in place to ensure that issues are identified and acted upon.’ Cuts to the forces have raised emotions among serving personnel and veterans. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond was heckled by a retired officer during his Tory conference last week. Colonel Ian Brazier accused Mr Hammond of betraying members of the Royal Fusiliers by cutting the regiment back. But Mr Hammond insisted the cuts were ordered by Army chiefs and not ministers.","30% of soldiers now report having low morale, up from 15% in 2010 .

Anne Mawdsley was just about to start cutting the grass when she found the rusty object - lying on the top of the soil. The 67-year-old recognised the device straight away and called police to the house in Formby, Merseyside, where she had been helping out while her neighbour, Amy, was at work. Unexploded: The wartime bomb, which was said to have been found on top of the soil at the bottom of the Merseyside garden . Mrs Mawdsley, who has lived in her house for 45 years, said: 'It is definitely the most remarkable thing I have ever dug up in the garden. 'I always try to help out my neighbour Amy as much as I can, and it doesn't take me long to mow my lawn so I decided to pop round and do her's while she was at work. 'I spotted it on top of the soil at the bottom of the garden, and my first thought was that it looked like a bomb. Discovery: Anne Mawdsley, who found the bomb, said it brought back memories of her parents as her father served in the military . 'She had some work men in the day before who were putting up some new fencing and posts. 'They must have dug it up and left it - one of them had been hitting it with a spade! 'They are lucky that it didn't go off. 'I asked the police to pop round, and I think they thought I was joking at first. Homes nearby were evacuated and the street was closed for over an hour as some 15 police officers turned up, Mrs Mawdsley said. A . controlled explosion was then carried out by experts from the Explosive . Ordnance Disposal Unit on Formby beach, around three hours after the device . was first discovered.: . ""We went round to a friend's house for a coffee and she couldn't believe what I'd found,' said Mrs Mawdsley. The green-fingered neighbour, whose father had served in the Russian Convoy when she was a child, said finding the bomb 'brought back memories' of her parents. 'I knew what it was as soon as I laid eyes on it,' she said. 'I'd seen deactivated bombs and replicas in museums before, and from watching old war films. 'I had the strangest nights sleep after I found it, and I dreamt a lot about my mother. 'I think that finding it must have triggered all of those old memories for me. 'It's amazing to think it has just been buried there all this time, and had the builders not dug up the soil, we might never have found it.' Evacuated: The back garden of the house in Formby, where the bomb was found. The street had to be cleared while experts removed the bomb to detonate it . Mrs Mawdsley's husband Bart added: 'It would be interesting to find out where it came from, and when it was dropped there. 'We've lived here for more than 40 years and it has been buried just metres away all this time. 'These houses were built in the 1920s but before that it was all just fields and farmland around here, so it makes sense.' A spokesperson from Merseyside Police said: 'We received a call that a member of the public had found what was described as a large device thought to be a World War Two bomb. 'Officers attended and the bomb disposal unit was called in to carry out a controlled explosion.' While it is not known where the bomb came from, the small RAF station of RAF Woodvale lies on the outskirts of Formby.

ITV's Daybreak could be renamed Good Morning UK in a bid to make the show more 'newsy' and boost lackluster viewing figures, it has been reported today. Channel bosses plan to revamp the show, watched by one million every morning compared to rival BBC Breakfast’s 1.5million, to make it more news focused. The set and the name will also be changed, according to show insiders. Revamp: ITV's Daybreak, currently presented by Aled Jones and Lorraine Kelly pictured, could be renamed Good Morning UK in a bid to make the show more news focused and boost viewing figures . The latest plans comes just 12 months after . presenters Lorraine Kelly and Aled Jones were brought in to boost the struggling show. It also follows reports that Mr Jones faced the axe following disappointing viewing figures, and could be replaced by Sky News’ Eamonn Holmes on a £750,000 salary. Staff were called into a meeting last week about the future of the programme, according to the Sunday People. An ITV spokesperson said: 'Our new Director of Daytime Helen Warner is looking at the whole of the Daytime schedule and Daybreak is part of this. Axed? Reports in August suggested that Walking In The Air singer Aled Jones, pictured, could face the axe following unimpressive viewing figures . 'Aled and Lorraine are fantastic presenters and remain a key part of plans moving forward.' The new director has been conducting a review of the channel over the last month and allegedly told the meeting - which was attended by all the top presenters - about her plan to shake-up the show. She indicated she wanted presenters to sit on more formal chairs and the current bright, colourful set will be given a complete makeover. The possibility of changing the name of the show was also discussed - although no concrete date was set. The name Good Morning UK, regarded as the most likely replacement insiders, is expected to come within the next year. One insider told The People that bosses are desperate for the show to be a success and regain the viewing figures of GMTV. They said: 'Every detail of the show is being looked at and they are willing to try anything to make the show more attractive to the viewer.' GMTV started broadcasting in 1993 and was presented by Eamonn Holmes and Anne Davies. Some of the country's best loved presenters - including Fiona Phillips and Anthea Turner - presented the show over its 17-year run. After losing some of its best presenters and a slump in viewing figures, ITV announced a major overhaul, with GMTV renamed Daybreak. Daybreak debuted in September 2010 with . presenters Christine Bleakley and Adrian Chiles. The duo left the BBC’s . The One Show for the morning slot for a sizable salary increase. Daybreak's predecessor, GMTV, ran from 1993 until 2010. Some of the country's best loved presenters sat on the GMTV sofa, including Fiona Phillips and Anthea Turner. Daybreak debuted in September 2010 with presenters Christine Bleakley and Adrian Chiles, who left the BBC's One Show for the morning slot. They were removed in 2011 due to poor ratings, with Kate Garraway and Dan Lobb taking over the sofa. In September 2012, Lorraine Kelly and Aled Jones were introduced with viewing figures increasing from 500,000 to around one million. However, ratings soon slumped, leaving rival BBC Breakfast to double its viewers. Eventually, Chiles and Bleakley were removed from the show in November 2011 - with Kate Garraway and Dan Lobb taking over. Within the year, Lorraine Kelly - who also presents her self-titled morning show - and former Walking In The Air singer Aled Jones took over. It was hope that the move — instigated by former BBC Breakfast chief David Kermode — would boost viewing figures from 500,000 to more than a million. Figures have consistently peaked around the one million mark since the pair took over - 500,000 short of their BBC rivals. The new name will inevitably call comparisons to Good Morning Britain, which was broadcaster TV-AM’s flagship programme in the 1980s. It was famously presented by Anne Diamond.","Channel bosses want Daybreak to be more 'newsy' in bid to boost ratings .

Four of the nine teenagers reported missing from a rural ranch for troubled youth are back with their parents, New Mexico police said Saturday. The four boys have been removed from an Amber Alert. Police said they believe the five others are in danger, while an attorney for the ranch said all are safely with parents. A search warrant was executed Friday as part of the investigation of abuse at the Tierra Blanca High Country Youth Program, located at a 30,000-acre compound in high desert country, about 7 miles from Hillsboro. Officials said that the teens, ages 13 and 17, weren't at the property in Sierra County, nor was program operator Scott Chandler, who has been named a person of interest in the case. Scott Chandler, pictured, has been named a person of interest in the case. 5 boys are still missing . The search comes after the Albuquerque Journal reported last week that state authorities were investigating claims that teenage boys were beaten and forced to wear leg shackles and handcuffs for minor violations of rules at the unlicensed program. Ranch attorney Pete Domenici Jr. said in a statement Friday that the boys had been 'on a previously scheduled activity away from the ranch for several days. They are safe and have already been picked up by their parents, or their parents are en route to pick them up.' Domenici accused the state of escalating the situation by failing to agree to an emergency hearing in a lawsuit the ranch filed this week over what the suit contends was an improperly handled investigation. However, authorities issued an Amber Alert for the teenagers minutes after Domenici's statement was released.

Tierra Blanca ranch attorney Pete Domenici Jr. said in a statement that the boys 'are safe and have already been picked up by their parents, or their parents are en route to pick them up' State police said in a statement Saturday night that the parents of the other five boys have made contact with authorities, but the Amber Alert will remain active until an official physically confirms their location and well-being. Jim Moffat, whose step-son was attending the ranch when he was killed in a rollover accident off the property last month, said Saturday that he has no reason to doubt that the boys are safe. He said he sent his son - 18-year-old Bruce Staeger - to the ranch after he could no longer deal with him misbehaving at home, running away and getting into trouble with police. 'We didn't know what was going on,' he said. 'But we saw some great results. He turned into an awesome young man.' Program operators had been ordered to send the kids back to their parents or surrender them to the state after staff members were accused of beating and shackling students. The operators of the ranch, Scott and Collette Chandler, deny any children have been harmed and filed a lawsuit this week accusing investigators of targeting the ranch for closure following a fatal car crash involving students. The operators also said investigators have been illegally interviewing students and telling parents to pull their children from the program by Friday or face abuse charges. Their lawsuit said at least one family was contacted directly by Gov. Susana Martinez, a claim her office denies. At a news conference earlier this week, Chandler said Tierra Blanca has been operating for nearly 20 years.

The number of pet animals poisoned and high on marijuana is growing higher, veterinarians say. California Bay Area-based veterinarians told KTVU on Tuesday more pets are being rushed to animal emergency rooms severely ill and high on the drug. The rise in emergency cases coincides with the rise of medical marijuana, they said. Rick Benjamin from the Berkeley Dog and Cat Hospital told KTVU that marijuana toxicity is more common in dogs than cats. The rise in California medical marijuana has been linked to an increase in ER visits for pet animals, who may accidentally be poisoned eating baked goods containing THC, like in these file photos . Pet animals, like the cat seen in this file photo, need to have their stomachs pumped if they are poisoned with THC. In rare cases the drug can be fatal . 'They're making cookies and crackers and cakes that are fairly potent in marijuana, and the dogs in particular love that,' he said. He said that the main problem is that the small animals have to metabolize large quantities of the psychoactive chemical in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. 'We're seeing more I think for a number of reasons, probably one is the potency of the THC in the marijuana has increased, so that the animal consuming the pot gets more of the active drug,' Benjamin said. Benjamin told KTVU that animals need to have their stomachs pumped to filter the marijuana out of their bodies. Most animals recover -- but in rare cases it can be fatal. Symptoms of poisoning in pets can occur within 30 - 60 minutes of exposures, Michigan Live reports. They include stumbling, dilated pupils, vomiting, and glassy eyes. Other serious side effects, Michigan Live reports, include changes in heart rate, coma, tremor and seizures. The rise in pot poisoning cases in pet animals in not happening just in California. The Huffington Post reports that a 5-year study in Colorado found that pot poisoning in dogs quadrupled after the state legalized marijuana in 2000. Some have claimed that medical marijuan could be beneficial for pet animals. The Daily Mail reported in 2011 that Medical Marijuana Systems LLC had licensed a patent for Tetracan, a 'pot patch' meant to serve as pain relief for animals.

Touted as one of England's greatest military triumphs new research shows 1,260 soldiers were foreign . Nelson's victory at the Battle of Trafalgar is thought of as one of Britain's greatest military achievements. But new research by the National Maritime Museum and the National Archives has shown that the fighting was done by hundreds of foreigners, including some Frenchmen. Of the 13,000 who served on the 33 ships to take part in the battle, 1,260 of them were born outside of Britain or Ireland. They came from as far afield as Africa, India, America and another 20 European countries. While most were from neutral or allied nations, 24 Spaniards and 54 Frenchmen also served in the 1805 fleet. One was Pierre Lomac, 25, from Bordeaux, on HMS Conqueror, whose marines took the surrender of Vice Admiral Villeneuve, the leader of the French and Spanish fleet. Benitte Grinzolo, 22, from Spain, sailed aboard HMS Mars which was heavily damaged in the battle. Another name which stood out was Jane Townshend who served on the Defiance, and is the only woman proven to have been present, though witness accounts describe others being there. She is listed as carrying out 'useful services', which were likely to have involved tending the wounded, cooking and washing. Among the furthest from home were Zada . Del Sulva, 31, from Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil, and Hampoo Hang, 34, born . in Guangzhou, China, on HMS Royal Sovereign, the flagship of Rear . Admiral Collingwood, and the first vessel into action. This painting by Clarkson Stanfield shows the aftermath of the battle which claimed the lives of 449 British sailors . The enormous firefight included 33 British ships and roughly one in six of the Navy's serving personnel . Another was George Westphal, a 20-year-old of German origins, born in Nova Scotia, then a British colony. He was serving as a midshipman on HMS Victory, Nelson’s flagship, and after being wounded Nelson’s rolled up coat was used as a pillow under his head. Westphal's blood bonded some of his hair to it. The surgeon had to cut the garment away to treat Westphal, who kept the fragments. The research also found that around a quarter of the crew were inexperienced 'landsmen' with less than a year at sea. Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph Bruno Pappalardo, naval expert at the National Archives, said: 'Not only was the fleet very cosmopolitan, it also wasn’t as highly skilled as is perceived. 'That has been part of the Nelson myth, that this was a crack fleet.' Kiss me Hardy: Lord Nelson was hit by a French musket ball during the battle and later died from his wounds . As the world spiralled towards all-out conflict for the first time during the Napoleonic wars, a huge strain was placed up the British Navy trying to combat the might of Napoleon's fleet. Around one in six of all the men employed by the Navy at the time took part in the battle, and around a seventh were from land-locked counties such as Warwickshire and Staffordshire. The research is part of an ongoing project to extract information from various sources including muster lists, certificates of service and biographical works held in the National Archives. The latest findings are to feature in the National Maritime Museum’s new Nelson, Navy, Nation gallery which opens on October 21, the 208th anniversary of the battle. The data has also been used to create an ancestor tracker which people can use to find out if their ancient relatives served in the battle. Britain lost no ships during the firefight, but 449 men were killed and 1,217 wounded. French and Spanish losses were 4,408 dead, 2,545 wounded and some 20,000 taken prisoner. Gurkhas are known for their long curved combat knives, which serve as part of the Brigade's crest . Gurkhas - One of the oldest groups of foreigners to serve in the British army is also one of the only one still serving today. The Gurkha Brigade was formed after the defeat of Nepal in 1816 following two bloody campaigns by the British Army. During the conflict a mutual respect developed between the soldiers, and British officers admired the Gurkhas for their fighting spirit, so allowed them to volunteer for the East India Company's Army. The Brigade's numbers peaked during WWII at 112,00 and there are thought to be around 3,500 serving today in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Sikhs - As World War One spread across Europe in 1914 colonial troops were called up in increasing numbers to serve the powers that ruled them. For Britain that meant drawing huge numbers from India. Around 100,000 Sikhs volunteered to serve in the British Army despite making up just 2 per cent of the Indian population. They were so fierce and well organised that by the end of the conflict English officers who served with them were wearing traditional turbans as a mark of admiration. Irish - When the world went to war for a second time in 1939 most of the Irish mainland was no longer a part of the UK, and so its soldiers were not called up. In fact Irish troops were told not to join British forces in the fight against Hitler and threatened with being labelled as deserters if they did. Despite the threat which meant they were unable to work for the state for the rest of their lives, thousands suck away to join the European conflict. They were only recently granted a pardon by the Irish Government. Americans - Another extended battle often called the finest in British history was the Battle of Britain, when RAF pilots successfully defended the UK mainland from Luftwaffe attacks as Hitler prepared to invade. However, among the British pilots were several Americans who later formed the first Eagles Squadron in 1941, an American section of the RAF which initially flew defensive patrols. As the war progressed, however, they were drafted into offensive operations and were joined by two further Eagles squadrons which became operational late in 1941.","Of 13,000 soldiers on ships' books, more than 1,000 were foreign .

Sir Kenneth Branagh has been approached by the National Theatre to take over the job of artistic director, Sir Anthony Hopkins has revealed. Branagh, who regards Sir Anthony as ‘a dear friend’, divulged the sounding out in a personal email to the Oscar-winner. Should Branagh take on the position he would be following in the footsteps of Laurence Olivier, the founding artistic director. Sir Kenneth Branagh has been approached by the National Theatre to take over the job of artistic director . Branagh, left, would be following in the footsteps of of founding artistic director Laurence Olivier, right . Branagh as Henry V in his 1996 film version, left, and Olivier in the same role in 1944, right . Veteran actor Sir Anthony reveals in an interview with The Mail on Sunday’s Event magazine that he is among those urging Branagh to take up the prestigious post at the South Bank venue. The star of The Silence Of The Lambs said: ‘He wrote me an email and told me he’d been offered the directorship. I said do it, because he’s the only actor who could replace Olivier today. ‘I told him he must accept. You see, Ken has got the teeth and the guts to do it.’ After an illustrious career in theatre and film, the job could be seen as the inevitable next step for Branagh, who has spent 25 years trying to emulate his hero. Olivier became the National Theatre’s first artistic director in 1963. Branagh, 52, has made no secret of his admiration for Olivier, and has told how he once wrote to the star when he was young, asking how he should play a particular role. In his reply, Olivier said: ‘I must not give you specific advice. You’ve got to do these things yourself. And you’ve got to have a bash and hope for the best.’ Actor Kenneth Branagh receiving a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II . Sir Anthony, who trained as a member of Olivier’s first National Theatre company in the 1960s, said Branagh was the only actor who came close to the acting  legend. ‘I would go and work for him because he’s a great actor and great director. The best bar none,’ said Sir Anthony, who appeared in Branagh’s 2011 big-screen fantasy adventure Thor and will also star in its soon-to-be released sequel. His comments are the first sign that Branagh is giving serious  consideration to the job which will become vacant in 2015 after the decision by current artistic director, Sir Nicholas Hytner, to stand down. There have also been suggestions that Branagh was being lined up to take over from American star Kevin Spacey when he stands aside as artistic director of London’s Old Vic theatre in 2015. Belfast-born Kenneth Branagh’s passion for Shakespeare meant he was always going to be compared with the man who revolutionised the Bard on the silver screen. As a result, he has spent the last quarter of a century living in the long shadow cast by Britain’s most formidable actor. Branagh wins the award for output, having directed no fewer than five Shakespeare films: Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing, Hamlet, Love’s Labour’s Lost and As You Like It. But his films have failed to eclipse Olivier’s trilogy: Henry V, which won him an Oscar, Hamlet, the first British film ever to win the Best Picture award, and Richard III. In 2007, Branagh again failed to steal his idol’s thunder when he directed a remake of the 1972 crime drama Sleuth. His version was panned by critics who felt it didn’t live up to Olivier’s original. But this didn’t deter Branagh from playing Olivier himself in 2011’s My Week With Marilyn, which looked at the making of Olivier’s The Prince And The Showgirl, starring Marilyn Monroe. The role won Branagh an Oscar nomination. Some commentators have argued that Branagh could not continue his film career while running the Old Vic. But others point out Olivier made a string of films while he ran the National Theatre. A spokesman for Branagh said he had not applied for the job but admitted: ‘He did discuss the  matter with Sir Anthony who is a dear friend and a valued adviser.’ A spokesman for the National Theatre said Branagh had not been offered the role but declined to comment on whether any informal talks had taken place.","Branagh has been approached by theatre to become artistic director .

A valuable bronze artwork by Henry Moore has been stolen from an open air sculpture park. Standing Figure, created in 1950, was one of four Moore pieces in Glenkiln Sculpture Park, in Lincluden Estate by the Glenkiln Reservoir in Shawhead, Dumfries and Galloway. The park also includes his world renowned King and Queen sculpture, and other works by Auguste Rodin and Jacob Epstein. Police said the piece was worth a 'high value', and are appealing for anyone who saw any suspicious people or vehicles in the Glenkiln Reservoir area on these dates to contact them. Standing Figure is among a string of works by the abstract artist, who died in 1986 aged 88, to be targeted by thieves in recent years. Two men were jailed for a year in 2012 for stealing a sculpture called Sundial and the bronze plinth of another work from the grounds of the Henry Moore Foundation in Much Hadham. In 2010, Moore's £45,000 painting Three Reclining Figures On Pedestals was one of three works of art worth a combined £230,000 stolen from a gallery in Broadway, Worcestershire. The Henry Moore Foundation also carried out a security review following the theft of a two-ton piece called Reclining Figure in December 2005. The foundation was established by the artist in 1977 to encourage public appreciation of the visual arts. His sculpture Knife Edge, which stands on Abingdon Green outside the Houses of Parliament, often appears in the background of television interviews and is believed to be one of the most televised works of art in the country. The sculpture park was created by local landowner Sir William Keswick between 1951 and 1976. Sir William bought Standing Figure after seeing it in an exhibition, and Moore was personally 'thrilled' with the artwork's open air location. In an excerpt from a 1975 retrospective of his work on the Henry Moore Foundation website, Moore said: 'Sir William Keswick came to me after he had seen this piece in an exhibition (it may have been the second Battersea Park exhibition). 'He told me about his sheep farm in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, and said its large acreage was unsuitable for agricultural farming because the ground was too rocky.

Standing Figure is among a string of works by the abstract artist to be targeted by thieves . 'I don't know whether he got the idea to put sculpture on his sheep farm after he saw the Battersea Park open-air exhibition, or whether he was inspired by his experiences in China, where he had lived for many years, and where, he said, there are many examples of monumental sculptures in the open air. 'In any case, he bought this piece to put on his farm in Scotland. His sculpture Knife Edge, which stands outside the Houses of Parliament, often appears in the background of television interviews .

Henry Moore was born in 1898 in Castleford, Yorkshire, and was the son of a miner. Between 1917 and 1919 he served in the Army before resuming teaching in 1919. He went to Leeds School of Art and taught at the Royal College of Art between 1932 and 1939. Moore is known for sculpting people with hollow spaces in their bodies and for using flowing, abstract shapes. Most of his sculptures are of female figures but he also created sculptures of families and just faces. The artist was known to take inspiration from nature and spent a lot time sketching each sculpture before he made it. He died in 1986 and was buried only a few hundred yards from his home at St Thomas's Church in Perry Green. The Henry Moore Foundation is a registered charity, founded by the artist in 1977 to encourage public appreciation of the visual arts, and in particular the works of Henry Moore. Its main responsibilities are preserving Moore's legacy at his home in Hertfordshire and through exhibitions worldwide; funding exhibitions and research at the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds; and awarding grants to arts organisations in the UK and abroad.","Standing Figure was one of four Moore pieces in Glenkiln Sculpture Park .

Carer: Sarah Biggs, 45, pleaded guilty to fraud and was jailed for 21 months at Chichester Crown Court . A carer who stole £90,000 from a dementia-suffering pensioner's bank account has been jailed for almost two years. Sarah Biggs orchestrated the sale of 85-year-old John Gallo's family home in Wallington, Surrey, before moving him 50 miles away to Worthing, West Sussex, so she could pocket the proceeds. The 45-year-old, who had cared for him since 2003, exploited her position to almost empty his bank account over three years - then left him alone and uncared for when the money ran out. She had been informed by her bosses at Sutton London Borough Council that Mr Gallo was a vulnerable elderly man who had been conned by rogue traders in the past, a court was told. In 2006, she helped him sell his large house in Wallington - where he had lived since childhood - then played a big role in his £82,000 purchase of a flat in Worthing, near where she lived. Biggs had isolated Mr Gallo from his estranged family and care services while she helped herself to £92,367 left over from the house sale, Chichester Crown Court in West Sussex heard. Her crime was only uncovered after Mr Gallo was found wandering outside in the snow in his underpants in winter 2008 and West Sussex County Council took over management of his affairs. Position of trust: Gallo (outside court on Friday), who had cared for the man since 2003, exploited her position to almost empty his bank account over a three-year period - then left him uncared for when the money ran out . Biggs, who had claimed the money was given to her by Mr Gallo, pleaded guilty to fraud and was jailed for 21 months on Friday by Judge Claudia Ackner. The judge told her: ‘This offence is a very great breach of trust by you as the carer of a very elderly and vulnerable gentleman. You knew Mr Gallo was a man of some considerable financial means. ‘As his care worker throughout that period, you knew he was vulnerable to all forms of abuse - in particular financial abuse. You were in a position of trust by Mr Gallo. ‘The basis of your plea is you entered a situation where you received huge sums of money from Mr Gallo when you were aware to do so was improper. In receiving these sums, you acted dishonestly.’ Biggs had stashed the proceeds from the sale of Mr Gallo's home in Wallington in a Nationwide bank account she had opened by forging the pensioner's signature. She then forged 11 cheques from the account to pay herself £27,000, and made cash withdrawals of £12,360 using a debit card. Sentencing: Chichester Crown Court (pictured) in West Sussex heard Biggs had isolated John Gallo from his estranged family and care services while she helped herself to £92,367 left over from the house sale . The rest of the money was received by standing orders to her own account, and large transfers funnelled through an internet savings account she had also opened in Mr Gallo's name. Jonathan Edwards, prosecuting, said Biggs ceased contact with Mr Gallo when the account was ‘practically empty’ in late 2008. 'He was losing weight. He had no mattress on his bed. He kept a sparsely furnished flat which was filthy. He had poor quality clothes and had stopped paying his bills' Jonathan Edwards, prosecuting . ‘The Crown says it could be viewed that he was simply no longer of any use to her,’ he said. ‘At that time, he was losing weight. He had no mattress on his bed. ‘He kept a sparsely furnished flat which was filthy. He had poor quality clothes and had stopped paying his bills.’ Biggs, of Worthing, had been instrumental in moving Mr Gallo to Worthing. Mr Edwards added: ‘It was said by Miss Biggs in interview that Mr Gallo wanted to move to the coast to be nearer to his sister. There had not been contact between Mr Gallo and his sister for 20 years. ‘With that in mind, Miss Biggs telephoned Mr Gallo's sister but it seems she did not facilitate in a reunion of Mr Gallo and his sister. Miss Biggs told Mr Gallo that his sister did not want contact with him. ‘That seems to be untrue. The move to . Worthing had the effect of isolating Mr Gallo and making him vulnerable . to exploitation by Miss Biggs.’ Change: Biggs orchestrated the sale of John Gallo's family home in Wallington (file picture, left), Surrey, before moving him 50 miles away to Worthing (file picture, right), West Sussex, so she could pocket the proceeds . Simon Gruchy, defending, said Biggs could repay the money in full. He added: ‘She should not have taken those sums and she had accepted it was dishonest and that is where her criminality lies. ‘She has lost her good name, she's lost her job - a job she was good at and did for over 20 years. This was a relationship which developed in a way that was completely out of character as far as this lady was concerned.’ 'To be treated like this by someone who claimed to be caring for him was simply appalling and the team that worked with him and his family have found this quite traumatic' Amanda Rogers, West Sussex County Council . Judge Ackner said Biggs could be out of jail within ten and a half months. After the sentencing, West Sussex County Council's director of adults' services Amanda Rogers said: ‘This was a shocking case. ‘To be treated like this by someone who claimed to be caring for him was simply appalling and the team that worked with him and his family have found this quite traumatic. ‘This is a vulnerable elderly gentleman, who has long term mental health problems and dementia. ‘He was let down and manipulated by the person who claimed to be caring for him. She cut him off from his family, she took all his money and didn't ensure he was safe. ‘He wasn't managing his food or fluids and didn't have a bed in his flat. In terms of the scale of the financial abuse and the level of manipulation and pre-meditation, this is one of the worst cases we've seen. ‘We are glad to have secured this outcome and to have got him back in regular contact with his family.’","Sarah Biggs orchestrated sale of John Gallo's family home in Surrey .

Magistrates described the case as a ‘very sad occasion’ and handed her a six-month conditional discharge, the lowest sentence available to them. Her solicitor said Mrs Hewitt may no longer be able to volunteer with children and could also lose her job as a swimming coach. Mrs Hewitt, from Dorchester, Dorset, said: ‘I am devastated that after 51 years of teaching, anybody could ever think I could hurt a child. ‘Coaching children to swim to their full potential is my life. I am teaching the grandchildren of people I taught 50 years ago. ‘I have taught thousands of children, some of whom have gone on to represent Britain. ‘I didn’t touch that child. I was [kneeling] down and she bumped into me. She knocked me over. ‘I held on to a locker to pull myself up and then the mother accused me of grabbing hold of the girl’s arm. I didn’t do it. ‘Four days after it is said to have happened, I got a phone call asking me to go to Weymouth police station. Mrs Hewitt was accused of grabbing the 10-year-old girl by the arm and shouted at her to get changed at the end of the swimming gala . Janet Hewitt, 69, faces being banned from teaching the sport she has volunteered 40 hours a week towards following the controversial case . ‘That was the first I was aware of the allegation. My solicitor said afterwards that there wasn’t a charge here. Ten days later I was asked to go back to the station and was told they had enough to charge me with assault. ‘It is crazy that the case went as far as it did. It was one word against another. My solicitor said I didn’t have anything to worry about and all along I just thought “when will common sense prevail?”’ Magistrates in Weymouth heard that Mrs Hewitt had been in the changing rooms at the Dorchester Sports Centre when the incident took place. Janet with just some of the flowers and cards she has received from well wishers. She hasn't taught swimming since her arrest in April and has also been on anti-depressants . The girl, who cannot be named for . legal reasons, said she was walking away from the showers to the . changing rooms when she passed Mrs Hewitt. The conviction means Mrs Hewitt will no longer be able to volunteer with children or vulnerable adults . She said: ‘She grabbed me by the arm. She shouted really loudly and in my face and it hurt my arm. She . bellowed that I have three seconds to get changed.’ The incident was witnessed by the girl’s mother, who said her daughter was ‘like a rabbit in the headlights’. The mother added: ‘I marched over and told Janet to stop it. I was very shocked and upset.’ In her police interview, Mrs Hewitt denied touching the victim. She said: ‘I think the mum would not have been able to see clearly. I do not think they were wrong, but they might have been mistaken.’ Another witness, aged 13, said she saw the victim come around the corner and bump into Mrs Hewitt, but had not seen any other physical contact. Lee Christmas, defending, said the conviction means Mrs Hewitt will no longer be able to volunteer with children or vulnerable adults. Magistrate Harry Barnes said: ‘It is a very sad occasion in many respects. ‘Your record of all you have done for young people and disabled people is something I dare say has not been seen anywhere else.’","Janet Hewitt was accused of grabbing the 10-year-old girl by the arm and shouted at her to get changed at the end of a swimming gala .

It is feared a deadly drug known as 'cannibal heroin' which eats flesh from the inside out is about to hit the UK. Krokodil, which is like heroin and originated in Russia 10 years ago, turns users into zombies as their bodies begin to rot leaving addicts with reptilian skin. But the homemade concoction can be up to 10 times cheaper than heroin and is created by mixing codeine with gasoline or oil. Blind victim Margarita Schelkunova, 28, at a rehab centre in Siberia began using Krokodil seven years ago . Within 30 minutes the substance, medically known as desomorphine, is cooked up before it is injected into the user's veins. But the results are catastrophic. Continual use of Krokodil, Russian for crocodile, causes blood vessels to burst, leaving skin green and scaly among addicts eventually causing gangrene and their flesh to begin to rot. In Russia around 30,000 people die from the affects of the drug every year yet it is thought about a quarter of a million people in the country are now hooked on the poison. Within 30 minutes the substance can be cooked up before it is injected into the user's veins . Addiction is spreading among young people and even those who manage to quit come away disfigured for life. Margarita Schelkunova, 28, and her husband became hooked on the drug seven years ago. Even though Miss Schelkunova is now clean, she has lost her sight and has been diagnosed with cancer and HIV with only weeks to live. Her husband died at the age of 27. Drug addict Tanya started using Krokodil after a boyfriend got her hooked on heroin . But Irina Dyadyuchenko, 35, has survived being a Krokodil addict and has now been clean for two years. She began using heroin at the age of 14 but when her local drug dealers were jailed she turned to Krokodil to get her fix. Irina, who is the daughter of an engineer and teacher, said when the recipe landed in Russia, she soon realised she could make it herself with one dose costing around £4. Krokodil has already hit the U.S. already trying to tackle huge numbers of people using homemade drug crystal meth. Devastating: Margarita Schelkunova is now clean but she has been left blind and has cancer and HIV . However, one British doctor believes he may have came across a case in the UK. Dr Allan Harris, a GP in Gloucester, wrote in an article for The Independent that the man was homeless and in his 30s. 'There was essentially a crater in his arm and you could see the bone and tendons,' he wrote. Maria Fadeeva (left) a recovered Krokodil user who cared for Irina Dyadyuchenko who has been clean for two years . 'It is hugely addictive and potent and can be cooked up in 30 minutes. It's only a matter of time before we start seeing it in Britain. It is not a case of 'if' but 'when'. Norman Baker, minister for crime prevention, told The Sun: 'Desomorphine - krokodil - is controlled as a Class A drug in the UK because it is dangerous. 'We are determined to tackle the illicit drug trade which can have such a destructive impact on the lives of so many.' Krokodil's medical name is desomorphine and is created by mixing codeine with gasoline, paint thinner, hydrochloric acid, iodine and red phosphorous. There are millions of users in Russia and the epidemic began in Siberia and the Russian Far East. The drug causes flesh to rot from the inside out and the addict's skin becomes scaly, like a crocodile's, hence the name. Blood vessels burst and the surrounding tissue dies. Gangrene and amputations are a common result and sometimes bone can be exposed. The high lasts for about an hour and a half and the drug can be up to 10 times cheaper than heroin.","Krokodil is like heroin and originated in Russia 10 years ago .

Persecuted: Sam Callahan had to call in police over his torment and even moved schools . X Factor star Sam Callahan was so badly tormented by bullies at school he was forced to call the police. The 19-year-old said he was pinned down and kicked in the face by a bully wearing football boots in one brutal attack. The Essex-born barman, who last night performed in the first of the ITV talent contest’s live shows, said he was targeted because of his dream of becoming a pop star. And he revealed that the same bullies have recently sent him good luck messages on Facebook after spotting him on the show. Callahan claimed the persecution at his secondary school grew so bad that he left and moved to the Sylvia Young Theatre School in West London, whose former pupils include Spice Girl Emma Bunton and the late singer Amy Winehouse. ‘I got pretty badly bullied at my first secondary school, so had to leave there and I went to Sylvia Young,’ said Sam. ‘It was both verbal and physical. I got really badly beaten up. ‘I was quite small and had really blond spiked hair and blue eyes, and I think they wanted to knock me down a peg or two. ‘We had to get the police involved once – when I was 12 a 16-year-old held me down while his mate kicked me in the face with his football boots. We called the police but we didn’t press charges.’ Callahan, who impressed the judges with his rendition of James Blunt’s You’re Beautiful in the show’s audition rounds, added: ‘I’ve always wanted to do music and perform, and I stood out. ‘They used to call me gay, but it was as much me fighting back that got me in trouble because I really stuck up for myself. ‘Since I went on the show, quite a few of the bullies have got back  in touch with me, as if nothing  had happened. ‘They sent messages and just acted as if we were old friends and should meet up. I’m a lot older now – I try not to hold grudges.’ Full support: Sam Callahan, far right, with fellow contestants Nicholas McDonald, left, and Luke Friend and their mentor Louis Walsh . Impressive: Despite not being alive in the eighties Sam's cheeky  performance wowed audiences on last night's live show . Louis Walsh, Callahan’s mentor in the show, believes the trauma of the bullying may have given him a good grounding to cope with the pressures of the music industry. Louis, 61, said: ‘Whatever Sam went through has obviously paid off for him because he’s one of the hardest working people I know. He’s always on the phone to me. ‘He has such a great work ethic and I know he’s going to go a long way.’ The bookmakers’ favourite  to win this year’s series – Kent  teenager Tamera Foster – has a different experience of bullying.

Jennifer Benito-Kowalski traveled 9,000 miles from home to meet her son for the first time after hiring an Indian surrogate - a common practice for American women desperate to find a cost-effective way to have a baby. After spending more than $30,000 on 20 unsuccessful rounds of intrauterine insemination, Jennifer and her husband Steve Kowalski turned to a well-known 'baby factory' in India. The Kowalskis say it's a win-win formula - the gestational carrier gets paid more than she could earn in a lifetime, and the affluent couple gets a healthy baby with their own DNA. Emotional: California's Jennifer Benito-Kowalski (right) receives gifts for baby Kyle from surrogate Manisha Parmar at the Akanksha Infertility Clinic in Gujarat, India .

New mom: Hospital helper Hansa Harjan (center) shows baby Kyle to his mother, Jennifer Benito-Kowalski (left) and grandmother Sue Kowalski for the first time at the Akanksha Infertility Clinic . However critics say the practice of 'human baby farming' is exploitative, turning vulnerable women, usually from developing countries, into 'ovens'. For the Kowalskis, their son Kyle is a gift that could only be delivered through outsourcing. The couple from San Carlos, in California, shared their story with the San Francisco Chronicle. They said the Akanksha Infertility Clinic was a last resort after four years of failed IVF, fertility treatments and normal conception. 'Some people just get to have sex,' Steve, 41, said. 'It's not fair.' Bonding: Surrogate Manisha Parmar comforts her daughter Urvashi, 3, at the Akanksha Infertility Clinic just days before she is due to give birth to Kyle . Unassuming: The Akanksha Infertility Clinic in downtown Anand, India, is near this block. Hundreds of clients from around the world travel to the clinic each year for surrogates . 'Baby factory': More than 80 surrogates sleep at Akanksha Infertility Clinic's dormitories on the outskirts of Anand India where they stay for most of their pregnancy . In 2012, Jennifer, 40, began researching commercial surrogacy and found the financial and legal obstacles in the U.S. were extraordinary. Only a handful of states had clear surrogacy laws, and the service could cost more than $150,000. That's when she discovered the Indian treatment center whose head clinician, Dr Nayna Patel,  appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2007. The service would only cost $20,000. 'I feel like we're helping each other,' Jennifer said of the surrogate mother. 'I'll be eternally indebted to her for helping us with our family, and in turn, we're helping her.' In late 2012, Dr Patel embedded two of their four embryos into Indian mother of two Manisha Parmar's uterus. Although . Manisha, 29, and her husband Raman Parmar, 38, a flour mill worker, . felt 'ashamed' at selling Manisha's body, the $7,500 payment would be . life-changing. Raman earns less than $50 a month. 'We feel a little ashamed about it,' Raman admitted. 'I had a lot of financial problems. I had to bring her here.' Doting parents: Jennifer Benito-Kowalski and Steve Kowalski bond with baby Kyle while waiting for a hotel car after Kyle was released from the Apara Nursing Home . A child of her own: Jennifer Benito-Kowalski watches television as baby Kyle sleeps in their room at the Madhubhan Resort and Spa . Of India's 1.2 billion people, 70 percent live on less than $2 a day. About 23 percent of its 587 million girls and women work, many toiling in low-paying, physically intensive jobs. Surrogacy has become a viable money-maker for many Indian women - it is estimated to be a $2 billion industry. Akanksha is just one of India's 150 known fertility clinics, about 60 percent of which offer commercial surrogacy. Other leading destinations for commercial surrogacy include Panama, Thailand and Ukraine. Dr . Patel's clinic has more business than it can handle with more than 100 . pairs of aspiring parents on its surrogate waiting list. It began . offering surrogacy services in 2004. Hurting: Surrogate Manisha Parmar struggles with waves of pain three days after a cesarean section at the Akanksha Infertility Clinic . Trial: Raman Parmar (center) and daughter, Urvashi, 3, ride the train to Khambhat, India, after his wife Manisha's release from the hospital . Shame: Finally back home in Khambhat after giving birth to Kyle, Manisha Parmar rests and tries to ignore the chilly reception from family and neighbors . Together again: Manisha and Raman Parmar rest after their two-hour journey from the Akanksha Infertility Clinic to their home in Khambhat . San Francisco Chronicle reported life for Manisha - and the other 80 surrogates at the clinic -  'was pleasant if monotonous' during their pregnancy. Nurses kept close tabs on the women, who lived four to six to a room. They had regular sleeping patterns, ate healthily, and took classes in trades when they weren't being injected with vitamins. During their final trimesters, the women move from their dorms into the main clinic in the center of town. Manisha eventually delivered Kyle by C-section, and although she wished to keep the baby, she knew that wasn't part of the contract. Jennifer and Steve were overjoyed after nine months of waiting. 'We've been waiting so long,' Jennifer cried. 'Now we can say 'him' instead of 'it.' ' The couple spent 24 days in India after Kyle's birth dealing with red tape - passports, flights and other documentation. While the wait was excruciating and the risks were high, the Kowalskis said their only regret was waiting so long before turning to a surrogate. Manisha and her husband, meanwhile, had to live with the shame and family who disapproved of the process.

An infant just five weeks old became the youngest organ donor in Britain, saving a woman dying of kidney failure. The tiny organs were transplanted into Samira Kauser after the child died of heart failure. Miss Kauser, a 22-year-old healthcare assistant, said: ‘Words cannot express the gratitude I feel to the parents of this baby. My life was standing still – now I can live it. Saved: Samira Kauser, 22, received a kidney from the youngest donor in the UK, a 5-week-old baby . ‘They have lost so much more than I . can ever comprehend. Their only solace is that someone else has been . able to carry on with their life. It is a  massive gift.’ The . seven-hour operation was  carried out at St James’s University Hospital . in Leeds by surgeon Niaz Ahmad. He said that previously there had been a . cultural taboo about using donors so young but that consensus is being . swept away due to a chronic shortage of donors. Kidneys fully function at around 37 weeks in the womb so could technically be transplanted into an adult from that time. Mr . Ahmad said: ‘For a number of years, there has been a mental block about . using such tiny kidneys, a feeling that they would be too small and not . work. ‘There was also a . cultural thing among surgeons that we had never used this age group, . because of the emotional difficulty of asking parents of a young baby if . they were willing. But there is such an acute shortage of organs, that . we are now prepared to do this, and this case, I hope, shows that it can . work.’ Pain-staking: The seven-hour transplant was carried out by surgeons at the St James's University Hospital in Leeds, pictured, and has now been declared a success after six months of monitoring . The UK Donation Ethics Committee is considering the use of organs from 'beating heart' babies. These are children being kept alive on ventilators but are certified as brain dead. A working group set up by the British . Association of Perinatal Medicine is working with the committee to discuss the controversial method. The practice, already used . in adults and older children, allows medics to use a greater number of organs - . particularly the heart and small intestines - as they can be . maintained while the patient is kept alive on a ventilator. With a . decision on the method is expected within six months. After the baby died . earlier this year following a major infection, Mr Ahmad was told that . the parents wanted to donate the baby’s kidneys, which were only 4cm . long. Miss Kauser, from . Halifax, had suffered more than 90 per cent renal failure due to a . genetic condition that caused cysts to damage her kidneys beyond repair. She spent nine hours every night on a dialysis machine. After . six months of careful monitoring, the operation has been declared a . success. The kidneys are functioning well and have grown to 7cm, with . the potential to reach 75 per cent of adult size. Miss Kauser, who works . at Calderdale Royal Hospital in Halifax, plans to get married next year . – something she never wanted to do while on dialysis. She . said in an interview: ‘I remember the time the call came through. It . was 1.48am … Then I found out it was a child who had died and I felt so . sad. I thought about the parents and how much they wanted to donate and I . knew I had to have the operation, even though I was scared.’ Joe . Brierley, of the British Association of Perinatal Medicine, said organ . donation from babies is an important step when there are more than 7,000 . people on transplant waiting lists. He . said: ‘This should be something we offer as a suggestion to families of . dying babies … it is something positive arising from a total tragedy.’ The .

One-in-a-million: Max Blakely, four, misbehaves because of a condition so rare it is only identified as '2P16.3 microdeletion' A naughty boy whose extreme tempers see him kick and scream while flailing around on the floor has been diagnosed with a chromosome defect so rare it doesn't have a name. Doctors have said that Max Blakely, four, acts irrationally and violently against his will because of a one-in-a-million chromosome defect that they identify as '2p16.3 microdeletion'. It means Max, from Greenock, Inverclyde, can fly into a fit of rage at any second and let out a high-pitched scream - an illness is so uncommon it doesn't even have an official title. His mother Sandra, 42, said: 'It's horrendous. Max throws these terrible tempers at the flick of a switch. 'He hits, headbutts, kicks, screams, lies on the ground and throws anything he can get his hands on. 'It's embarrassing when we're out in public because people just think he's misbehaved - and I'm an awful parent who can't discipline my child. 'I just want to scream, ""He has a condition, it's not anyone's fault.""' Max was diagnosed with the extremely rare disorder which means tiny parts of DNA are missing from one of the chromosomes in his genetic make-up in January. Doctors say it may be linked to either autism or Asperger's Syndrome. Mrs Blakely believes Max is one of only a handful of people across the UK to have been diagnosed with the condition. His diagnosis came as a complete shock to the mother-of-two, who suffered 12 years of heartache and seven miscarriages before having her first child Breanna, who is now nine. 'Horrendous': Mother Sandra, pictured with Max at their home in Greenock, Inverclyde, says dealing with her son's behaviour is a daily struggle . Mrs Blakely said: 'It's a relief to know there's a reason for Max's behaviour, but quite scary as so little is known about it. 'Scientists have only started to detect it in the last couple of years. 'Nobody can tell us anything about how to manage it or what the future holds for Max, because they just don't know.' Mrs Blakely faces a daily challenge managing Max's tantrums. She says he is unable to control his temper which flares up because he doesn't understand or gets frustrated with everyday situations. 'He has about three a day - and that's on a good day!' she said. Unintentional: In one of his tantrums - which can be sparked by any reason - Max will throw himself on the floor and flail around, kicking and headbutting while screaming at random intervals . 'Max can kick off for any reason . . . because he doesn't like the colour of the taxi that has turned up to take us somewhere, because we're going to the supermarket, because he doesn't want to walk on anything black or simply because he wakes up in a bad mood. 'And when he does, I have to watch him . like a hawk. He knows no boundaries when it comes to danger, so can . easily hurt himself or someone else. A '2p16.3 microdeletion' is an . extremely rare genetic condition that has only been possible to detect . in the past few years due to advances in technology. Sufferers have tiny parts of their DNA missing from one of the chromosomes in their genetic make-up. The defect commonly causes irrational and sometimes violent behaviour in those that have it. Although symptoms can vary, Max displayed some obvious indications in his early development that he had the defect. The four-year-old was slow to sit up on his own after he was born and took longer than the average child to learn to walk. He also did not talk until 12 months ago. Max's mother Sandra also says that Max has misaligned toes - another common symptom. 'I've had bruises from where he's picked up heavy things and thrown them at me, he's lifted a knife before . . . the list is endless. 'He's recently started to hold his breath until he turns blue which is very frightening.' The former auxiliary nurse first noticed something wasn't right when Max was born, but doctors dismissed her as a paranoid mother. 'Max was physically shaky but the hospital said it was just low sugar levels. Then he was late meeting milestones. 'It took him eight months to sit up on his own, 18 months to walk and he only started talking when he was three. 'His toes are also mis-aligned which is one of the symptoms. I really had to push doctors for tests, but I'm glad I did. At least now we know it's an illness. At one point I thought either he was just out of control or that I was a terrible mum!' A spokesperson for rare chromosome charity Unique said: 'A 2p16.3 microdeletion is an extremely rare genetic condition. 'Only in the last few years, due to advances in technology, has it been possible to detect and diagnose this disorder.'","Max, from Inverclyde, Scotland, behaves badly because of a chromosome defect that doctors only identify as '2p16.3 microdeletion'

These are the shocking images of hundreds of migrants making the dangerous journey from Africa to Europe cramped into a tiny raft. Humanitarian agencies believe around 20,000 lives have been lost in the last 20 years, as men, women and children cross the Mediterranean sea to escape persecution in their home countries. The incredible footage released by the Italian Navy shows the risks these individuals take as they take on the perilous 70-mile stretch of water between the north African coast and the Sicilian island of Lampedusa. Cramped: This screen shot from a video released by the Italian Navy shows immigrants packed onto a raft before being rescued off the Sicilian island of Lampedusa . More than 30,000 migrants arrived in Italy and Malta in the first nine months of 2013, compared with 15,000 in all of 2012, according to the U.N. refugee agency, with many fleeing dictatorship in Eritrea and civil war in Syria. Thousands then move into northern Europe's larger and more organised immigrant communities. 'They do know that they are risking their lives, but it is a rational decision,' said Maurizio Albahari, assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Notre Dame. Dangerous: Humanitarian agencies say nearly 20,000 migrants have perished while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea into Europe over the past 20 years . 'Because they know for a fact they . will be facing death or persecution at home - whatever remains of their . home, or assuming there is a home in the first place.' 'What . drives them is the hope that they'll have a better life in Europe for . themselves and their children. It's either perish or go . somewhere,' he added. In the last two weeks, two boats have capsized while making the journey, leaving nearly 400 people dead. In the second case, the Italian coast guard said it received a satellite phone call from the boat that it was in distress and was able to locate it based on the satellite coordinates. Perilous: Rescue workers from the Italian Navy surround the tiny raft which is packed with desperate migrants. Around 30,000 are already said to have landed in Europe this year . A Maltese aircraft was sent up and reported that the boat had capsized and 'numerous' people were in the water. The aircraft dropped a life raft, and a patrol boat soon arrived at the scene. Late Friday, Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat reported that 27 bodies had been recovered, three of them children. He said 150 survivors were rescued aboard . a Maltese ship while another 56 had been picked up by an Italian navy vessel with a further 15 on board a fishing boat. Safe: Migrants sit on the deck of the Italian Navy ship, Libra, after being rescued from the raft . In vain: Rescued migrants are frisked by crew members on the Italian ship. People who make the journey are often sent home by Italian immigration shortly after they have arrived . Plea: Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has urged the EU not to allow the Mediterranean Sea to become a cemetery . The incident occurred as recovery operations continued off Lampedusa for victims of the Oct. 3 shipwreck, where 339 people drowned. One of the victims was said to be a newborn baby, recovered with its umbilical cord still attached. The recent deaths prompted renewed calls for the European Union to do more to better patrol the southern Mediterranean and prevent such tragedies - and for countries like Libya to crack down on smuggling operations. 'We cannot allow the Mediterranean to become a cemetery,' Muscat told a news conference in Valletta, the Maltese capital. Last week the politician claimed there was an ‘unsustainable’ number of migrants arriving on Malta's shores. The Mediterranean island, with a population of just 400,000, has become the landing point for many of the migrants seeking a new life in Europe. On land: The migrants rescued at sea disembark from the military ship Libra, which carried 235 migrants to Porto Empedocles, Sicily, Italy. Lampedusa is the destination of choice for smugglers who usually charge more than £800 a head and cram the migrants onto boats that routinely run into trouble and require rescue. Fortress Europe, an Italian observatory that tracks migrant deaths reported by the media, says about 6,450 people died in the Canal of Sicily between 1994 and 2012. Once in Italy, the migrants are screened for asylum and often sent back home if they don't qualify. During the 1990s and early 2000s, many of the arrivals were considered 'economic migrants.' But many of the latest arrivals are fleeing persecution and conflict in places such as Syria and and qualify for refugee status, U.N. officials say. During a visit to Lampedusa this week, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso promised Italy £25 million in EU funds for Italian authorities to provide better care for newly arrived immigrants.","Authorities say 30,000 people have already landed in Italy and Malta in 2013 .

A smiling Gabrielle Giffords toured rows of tables loaded with rifles and handguns today in her first visit to a gun show since surviving a 2011 shooting, and pleaded afterward for people to come together to stop gun violence. The former Arizona congresswoman visited the Saratoga Springs Arms Fair with her astronaut husband, Mark Kelly and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to highlight a voluntary agreement that closely monitors gun show sales in New York. The trio mixed with a gun show crowd that was mostly welcoming - with a few hostile undertones before calling for people to build on the cooperative effort. Safeguards: Former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (center) attended a gun show in Saratoga Springs, New York today to show support for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's (left) system for making gun sales safer . Showing support: Ms Giffords attended the show with her husband, astronaut Mike Kelly (together, left). After perusing the show, she spoke at a press conference about the need to come together to stop gun violence . 'We must never stop fighting,' Giffords said at a post-tour news conference, her fist in the air. 'Fight! Fight! Fight! Be bold! Be courageous!' Giffords, a face of the national gun control effort, slowly walked hand-in-hand with Kelly through the large room where Winchester rifles, muzzle-loaders, antique knives and other weapons were on display and 'Don't Tread on Me' flags hung from poles. They stopped at display tables, Kelly asked dealers questions about the weapons, and Giffords shook hands and smiled when people greeted her. 'Good to see you looking good!' some said. Kelly bought a book on Colt revolvers, and said later he probably would have bought a gun if he had had more time. He said both he and his wife are gun owners. Gun owners: Mr Kelly bought a book on Colt revolvers at the show. He says both he and his wife own guns and that if he had more time, he probably would have had bought a gun today . The trio was greeted by light applause when introduced at the news conference, but some people booed from across the room. Many at the show said the couple made a good impression. Dealer Joe Albano, who chatted with Kelly about his muzzle-loaders, said the couple was nice. But he also said he was against New York's recent gun control law, which is separate from the Schneiderman initiative. 'If she can help us, fine,' Albano said. 'We're doing everything right here. We're legal.' Under the agreements worked out by Schneiderman, all firearms are tagged at the entrances to gun shows. Operators must provide computer stations for sellers to do national background checks. As they are taken away through a limited number of exits, guns are checked to make sure background checks were performed. No buyers can leave a show without documentation of a proper sale. Schneiderman, who has worked with all 35 gun show operators in New York, showed the couple how the process worked. New process: New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (right) led the couple around and explained the voluntary process he came up with to increase safety of gun sales at shows in the state .

'It's great to see government and licensed firearms dealers working together to solve a problem,' Kelly said. Giffords was shot in the head while meeting with constituents in Tucson. Six people died. Though it was mostly smiles inside, about a dozen protesters rallied outside the gun show holding signs critical of New York's new law that expanded a ban on military-style weapons, among other things. The law was passed not long after the December school massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Kenneth Hall, who held a sign with a swastika that read in part 'gun control made the Holocaust possible,' said the New York background check was not needed. 'I believe this is a publicity stunt for Mark Kelly and Gabby Giffords,' Hall said. 'They say they're Second Amendment supporters. I don't believe they are.'

Samsung are gearing up to produce flexible, unbreakable mobile phone screens that can be bent, twisted and even folded up and put in your wallet. The South Korean tech giant reportedly has the flexible screens in the final stage of development and will be ready to ship them next year. Scroll down for video . Bendy: Samsung is gearing up to produce the next generation of mobile phone screens that can be bent and twisted by early next year, according to reports . The breakthrough has been made by through the use of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), which are thin and can be put on flexible material such as plastic or metal foil. Samsung is not the only company to have invested heavily in research into flexible screens using OLEDs. Companies including Japan's Sony and LG Display, also of South Korea have launched prototypes. However Samsung is the first to promise a launch date for the technology, with an unnamed source 'familiar with the situation' telling the Wall Street Journal they will ship in the first half of 2013. Looking at the release dates of the company's flagship smartphones, the S series, that suggests that the first device to feature the flexible screen technology could be the yet to be announced S4. The company's move to produce the flexible displays comes as smartphone and tablet makers search for ways to differentiate their products in a market where customers face a glut of almost identical products. Bendy: The breakthrough has been made by through the use of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), which are thin and can be put on flexible material such as plastic or metal foil . Vinita Jakhanwal, director of mobile and emerging displays and technology at IHS Electronics and Media, told Tech News World: 'Flexible AMOLEDs can help Samsung differentiate its products in a smartphone market where most products offer similar products and functionality.' Even if Samsung were not able to able able to commercialise flexible screens straight away, making their screens out of plastic rather than glass would make their devices lighter, more durable and cheaper than rivals'. A common bugbear with the kinds of touchscreen displays often used on mobile devices is that they are brittle and prone to cracking. Replacing the glass now used with plastic would solve that problem. Durable: Although being bendy is their most exciting characteristic, simply using plastic to manufacture the screens rather than glass could help make phone screens less likely to crack . Samsung had previously promised to bring flexible displays to market this year, but that deadline came and went without any announcement from the company. Flexible displays are made by depositing organic light emitting diodes on a flexible plastic surface. Regular LED displays are usually made on a glass surface, but substituting that for a flexible plastic such as polyethylene terephthalate makes it possible to manufacture screens that are both flexible and lightweight. One possible mass-production method might use a technique similar to inkjet printing. However, the company's push for innovation has become more urgent as other display makers are also introducing different technologies for mobile phone and tablet screens. Sony has been researching the same flexible screen technology since 2002, and showcased a 4.1in flexible OLED two years ago, the same time as Samsung showed off their version of the technology. However, a spokesman for Sony told the Wall Street Journal he couldn't comment on when the company would begin mass producing the displays. And earlier this year, Apple filed a patent for 'electronic devices with flexible displays' that included features like on-screen keyboards that can be modified to handle concave or convex curves. Lee Chang-hoon, vice president of Samsung's display division, told the Journal his company has sent out samples of the new displays to a few select customers, but added that the release dates of any new products using the technology has not yet been confirmed.

A dramatic new blockbuster starring Tom Hanks paints cargo ship Captain Richard Phillips as a hero, but some crewmembers say he was no leader and even blame him for the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates that made him famous. The film version portrays Phillips' crew as layabouts who fell into the hands of pirates, the first time a U.S. cargo ship was hijacked in 200 years, before Navy SEALS arrived to bail them out. But a recent lawsuit and firsthand account say just the opposite. 'Phillips wasn’t the big leader like he is in the movie,' says a crewman who served under the Phillips, no doubt one of the 11 who are now suing Maersk, the company that owns the ship, for nearly $50 million. Telling a lie? Captain Richard Phillips' story has been turned into a blockbuster film starring Tom Hanks. But crew who were there during the 2009 Somali pirate saga allege that the hero Hanks plays has little to do with the real Captain Phillips . 'No one wants to sail with him,' the anonymous sailor told the New York Post. The source said that's because Phillips has a reputation for being 'sullen and self-righteous' and alleges that in April 2009 his arrogance led to the hijacking of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama. 'The crew had begged Captain Phillips not to go so close to the Somali coast,' Deborah Waters, the attorney who brought the claim, told the Post. 'He told them he wouldn’t let pirates scare him or force him to sail away from the coast.' The lawsuit alleges that Phillips was left an anti-piracy plan when he took command of the ship in March 2009. 'Shoot me': Hanks plays the title role in Captain Phillips, and portrays the real life mariner as selfless and dedicated to his crew . Drama: The film dramatizes the April 2009 attack on the Maersk Alabama, which ended with a SEAL Team 6 amphibous rescue of Phillips, who was tied up but unhurt with the pirates in the ship's tiny life boat (pictured) 'He didn’t want anything to do with it, because it wasn’t his plan,' the crew member claimed. 'He was real arrogant.' His fault? Captain Phillips became a hero in the press, wrote a book on the ordeal, and even met the president, but at least one crew member on the scene says he was actually the reason they were hijacked . Phillips denies such a plan existed. Whether the plan existed or not, the crux of the suit lies in whether 57-year-old Phillips intentionally ignored repeated warnings that he keep the ship at least 600 miles from the Somali coast. The crew member said the ship was just 235 miles from the coast, while Phillips has admitted to putting the ship around 300 miles from shore. Either way, he hasn't admitted to wrongdoing in the matter and is a witness for the defense in the case. An even bigger mischaracterization crewmembers see in Phillips' account and in the film is in the moment the captain says he gave himself up to the pirates to save his crew. 'If you’re gonna shoot somebody, shoot me!' Tom Hanks' character says tells the pirates in the film. But crew members say it didn't happen that way at all. 'We vowed we were going to take it to our graves, that we weren’t going to say anything,' Chief Engineer Mike Perry told CNN in 2010. 'Then we hear this PR stuff about him giving himself up . . . and the whole crew’s like, ""What?""' According to Perry and others, Phillips never said that. When the crew tried to swap a pirate who Perry had taken hostage for Phillips, the hijackers simply sped away with the captain. The crew wouldn't see their captain again until days later after a daring rescue by Navy SEALs, who found Phillips tied up but unharmed in the ship's life boat. Phillips would later pen a book on the . ordeal, one that paints him in a far more positive light than do his . former mates. He would also go on to meet President Obama in the Oval . Office. Director Paul . Greengrass said the movie wasn't intended to tackle every twist and turn . but defended the film and said it hews to the truth. However, Greengrass said: ‘Movies are not journalism. Movies are not history.’ 'He was real arrogant': According to an anonymous crew member and a lawsuit against his company, it was Captain Phillips' arrogant disregard for repeated warnings about pirates that got the ship hijacked .","Captain Richard Phillips has been labeled a hero after pirates took him hostage from the Maersk Alabama, but a fellow sailor says that's a lie .

America was warned yesterday that it is within three days of tipping the rest of the world into a new global recession. Talks to avoid the US government defaulting on its debts and to end a 14-day partial government shutdown remained deadlocked last night. The International Monetary Fund told the US that ‘it needs to take urgent action to address the short term fiscal uncertainties’. Conflict: Obama wants the US Congress to extend his government's borrowing powers, but the bid is being blocked by the Republicans . Managing director Christine Lagarde warned of a ‘risk of tipping, yet again, into recession’ just as some economies were recovering from the 2008 crisis. The US defaulting on debts could shatter the fragile economic recovery, she said. ‘If there is that degree of disruption, that lack of certainty, that lack of trust in the US signature, it would mean massive disruption the world over, and we would be at risk of tipping yet again into a recession,” she told NBC. Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, told an IMF press conference the deadlock ‘casts a long shadow over the world economy’. President Obama wants Congress to extend his government’s borrowing authority but this is being blocked by Republicans in Congress. Protests: Government workers in the US have campaigned against the shutdown, which has seen many services stopped .

His visit to the country coincides with a trip by George Osborne. Mr Johnson appeared to admit he had little warning of the timing of the Chancellor's trip but said he was 'absolutely thrilled'. Both the London Mayor and Mr Osborne have long been touted as successors to David Cameron as Conservative Party leader and their visits come at a time of thawing relations following a diplomatic row over the Prime Minister meeting the Dalai Lama last year. Both Mr Osborne's and Mr Johnson's trips have been in the pipeline for months but the timing of the Chancellor's visit was revealed more recently than the Mayor's. Mr Johnson is visiting Beijing to drum up publicity for London. He is pictured riding a Boris Bike during a trip to the London Universities International Partnership showcase event . Mr Johnson stressed he was 'very pleased' that Mr Osborne was visiting while admitting the timing was handled by the Government. Talking to reporters at an event to promote British brands in Beijing, Mr Johnson said: 'I feel very, very pleased that the Government at all levels is reflecting on the importance of China. 'It's great that George is coming, I think we're doing a double act tomorrow at Peking University and that will give us a chance to stress that the UK is one of the world capitals of education. 'London has more higher education institutions than any other city on Earth, although Beijing apparently has even more than London, we gloss over that detail. 'And there's an opportunity for us collectively both as London government and as national government to talk up the links between London and China.' Boris Johnson said he is 'absolutely thrilled' that George Osborne is in China at the same time as him . Asked if he was surprised that Mr Osborne and the Government chose to visit at the same time, he said: 'I think this was a question that was handled by the Government and the Foreign Office and I'm absolutely thrilled that it's worked out in the way that it has because I think it just adds to our ability to get our message across and I think it shows our Chinese friends the seriousness with which we take our engagement with China.' Asked if officials at the Treasury or Government spoke to him before arranging Mr Osborne's visit, he said: 'There's been a long process of working on this trip to maximise the impact and I hope it will be very successful.' Mr Johnson and Mr Osborne's visits will cross over tomorrow with a speech at Peking University.","Boris Johnson is in Beijing to drum up investment for London .

"By . Steve Nolan and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:16 EST, 20 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:06 EST, 21 September 2013 . Jailed: James Stone was sentenced to eight years in prison after grooming a 15-year-old girl on Facebook and luring her to his flat . A pub manager who had sex with a girl of 15 after grooming her over the internet was caught when he boasted about what he had done to a controversial group of paedophile hunters. The schoolgirl’s worried mother contacted Letzgo Hunting, which tracks down and confronts suspected sexual predators, after learning her daughter may have been targeted. The group set up two fake profiles on Facebook pretending to be girls aged 14 and 15, and engaged James Stone, 24, in web chats. And when he confessed to one of the decoys that he’d had sex with the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, the group confronted him in the pub where he worked before telling her mother to call the police. Stone was jailed for eight years at Nottingham Crown Court yesterday after admitting grooming, sexual activity with a child, possessing and distributing indecent images of a child and possessing extreme pornography. Letzgo Hunting’s vigilante tactics of luring out then confronting suspected abusers have earned it praise from parents — but criticism from the police and NSPCC. The meetings are usually filmed, with the footage being posted on the internet and handed to the police. Evidence collected by the group played no part in the conviction, according to the police. But after he was jailed, a spokesman wrote on the group’s Facebook page: ‘James Stone, caught by Letzgo Hunting, has just been sentenced to eight years. Anyone who said we were frauds, fakes or not interested in child protection, eat your words!’ And the girl’s mother said the group was ‘absolutely amazing’. She insisted she would not have known her daughter had been abused if Letzgo Hunting had not investigated. ‘I saw there was a man talking to her, but the messages were quite innocent,’ she said. ‘Having seen these guys [Letzgo Hunting] through Facebook I went to them and asked for advice.’ Hearing: Stone was told he will have to sign the sex offenders register for the rest of his life at Nottingham Crown Court, pictured . She said she contacted the group and not the police because she was not sure at that stage if a crime had been committed. The court heard Stone groomed the 15-year-old girl after meeting her in an online chatroom last February. He pretended to be a 16-year-old boy and the pair formed a friendship before he persuaded her to send intimate pictures of herself. They arranged to meet, with the girl later telling police: ‘The moment I saw him I was shocked. He looked like an older man and I just froze.’ Tina Dempster, prosecuting, told the court the victim had ‘got herself into a situation where she did not have the wherewithal to extricate herself’. Stone took her to a bedsit above a pub in Nottingham city centre, where he persuaded her to take part in sexual activity, despite her telling him she was a virgin and didn’t want to. Ms Dempster said the girl was left ‘hurt, stung and upset’ by what happened. Snared: Stone was caught after Letzgo Hunting, a vigilante organisation which uses the internet to hunt paedophiles, set up fake Facebook accounts. Pictured is a video of the group confront a different man . No longer in action: The vigilante group - whose Facebook page is pictured - announced that it is to fold . She told detectives: ‘I could not move. I felt numb. It was as if I wasn’t in my own body. I wanted my mum.’ The court heard the girl returned home and became ‘distressed and upset’ when she was questioned by her mother. She told her she’d met a man she had thought was a boy, and her mother then discovered what had happened after searching online. Ms Dempster said that the woman then contacted Letzgo Hunting, who weren’t referred to by name in court, for ‘support’. The CPS said that as Stone admitted his guilt early in the proceedings, no evidence from Letzgo Hunting was presented in court. Sentencing him, Judge Joan Butler QC said Stone had taken advantage of a girl lacking in self-esteem and ‘went about a campaign of grooming’.","James Stone persuaded the schoolgirl to send naked pictures of herself .

The tiny result can be slipped into your smartphone, which, Jewson hopes, will mean no one will ever be left scrabbling for a pen again. Clever: The ballpoint pen has been shrunk to 20mm and slots into the headphone jack on a smartphone . Jewson, 50, from Oxfordshire, says that the 20mm gadget has been designed to slot nib side into smartphones as well as the reverse to ensure no ink leaks into your pocket or your handbag. He added: 'The small size and critical tolerances . have meant many different prototypes were built, tried and tested. 'The . ink is viscous ballpoint ink to ensure against leakage, and it maximises . writing capacity equivalent to drawing a line 30 metres long.

One of the most memorable moments of last night's final presidential debate was Barack Obama's mocking comparison of Mitt Romney's foreign policy to the era of 'horses and bayonets'. The barb, which rapidly became popular on social networks, was intended to paint the Republican challenger as inexperienced and out of touch with the realities of modern military conduct. But the President's mocking comment threw the spotlight on the fighting techniques - because both bayonets and horses have remained important parts of the U.S. military right up to the present day. Scroll down for video . Clash: Barack Obama mocked Mitt Romney's complaints over reducing the size of the U.S. naval fleet . Barb: The mocking comment was considered one of the night's highlights by many observers . The crunch exchange came after Romney accused Obama of imprudently cutting back on the country's naval fleet, saying: 'Our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917.' The President replied: 'Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. 'We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines. And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting ships.' The zinger instantly went viral on Twitter and other networks, as Obama supporters took the opportunity to portray his opponent as old-fashioned and clueless about modern warfare. However, bayonets are still an integral item of military equipment. Standard issue: The bayonet remains a crucial piece of equipment for U.S. Marines . In use: Bayonet instruction remains part of basic training for Marines, and was part of Army training until 2010 . New model: The OKC-3S bayonet has been issued to Marines since 2003 . In the U.S. Marine Corps, the bayonet is standard issue, and Marines are instructed in how to use the knives in hand-to-hand combat as part of their basic training. The current model of bayonet used, the OKC-3S, which is designed to fit on the end of the M16 rifle, first entered service as recently as 2003. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have mostly relied on more hands-off techniques such as roadside bombs and aerial attacks, rather than hand-to-hand combat. However, Marines are nonetheless equipped for a knife fight - and four years ago, a British soldier won the Military Cross after using his bayonet to kill a Taliban militant, having ordered his platoon to affix bayonets because it was 'good for morale'. In the U.S. Army, bayonet use was part of basic training until 2010, when it was replaced with more general tuition on the correct use of a knife. Old-fashioned? Special forces troops entered Afghanistan on horseback during the 2001 invasion . Heroic: The troops showed that horses can still be used in combat, though it may seem anachronistic . For most soldiers, a bayonet or other type of blade is the second most important weapon, behind only the rifle. As well as being a combat weapon, bayonets are used as multi-purpose knives while troops are being deployed overseas. Horses are less important to modern methods of fighting, but they have not yet been entirely phased out. In 2001, the first U.S. troops to enter Afghanistan did so by riding into the country alongisde America's allies in the Northern Alliance. Meme: The debate exchange prompted Obama supporters to mock Romney via social media . For many members of the special operations teams, it was the first time they had ever ridden a horse, but the remote desert landscape did not allow them to use more common methods of transport. The mission was not without its difficulties - one soldier was forced to ride with a broken back after his horse fell on top of him - but it was a success in the end. Obviously, neither horses nor bayonets occupy the same central place in the warfare of 2012 as they did during World War I. But despite what President Obama might suggest, both are still used as tools of battle to this day.

A sensational new book has caused a storm among historians by claiming that Jack the Ripper was, in fact, a woman. Former solicitor John Morris, 62, has named Welsh-born Lizzie Williams as the Whitechapel monster - and claims she killed her victims because she could not have children, ripping out the wombs of three in an 'unhinged state'. Lizzie was the wife of royal physician Sir John Williams, himself seen as a prime suspect by many other crime experts. Mr Morris, from Birmingham, also cites evidence - which has not proved popular among Ripper experts - including the fact that none of the five murdered prostitutes was sexually assaulted; and the personal items of one, Annie Chapman, were laid out at her feet 'in a feminine manner'.

Mr Morris's new book, Jack The Ripper: The Hand Of A Woman, was written along with his late father Byron. The men sifted through thousands of medical and legal documents to draw up a compelling case for branding Lizzie the killer. But John, speaking from his current home in Wicklow, Ireland, said their theory has not gone down well with Ripperologists. 'The case for a woman murderer is overwhelming. But unfortunately it does not sit well in some quarters where such a theory flies in the face of long-held beliefs,' he told the Birmingham Mail. 'There’s absolutely no doubt that the . Ripper was a woman. But because everyone believes that the murderer was . a man, all the evidence that points to a woman has always been . ignored.'

He says Welshwoman Lizzie, born on February 7, 1850, was unable to have children and, in an unhinged state, took terrible revenge on those who could. Coroner Wynne Baxter said at Annie Chapman’s inquest: 'The conclusion that the desire was to possess the missing (body) part seems overwhelming.' John also points to the facts: . John believes there’s a reason Mary Kelly was targeted - and why the killing spree ended with her death. Lizzie’s husband, Sir John, who ran abortion clinics in Whitechapel, was having an affair with her. The author added: 'There are numerous clues scattered throughout the crimes which, taken individually, may mean little, but when grouped together a strong case for a woman murderer begins to emerge.' Lizzie - nee Mary Elizabeth Ann Hughes - was the daughter of a Welsh industrialist Richard Hughes. The couple were married in 1872, when he was 32 and she was 22. Soon after the grisly deaths, Lizzie suffered a nervous breakdown. She died of cancer in 1912, having never been quizzed by police over the murders. Sir John and the six-inch 'Ripper' blade... but now his wife's in the frame . Lizzie was wife of royal physician Sir John Williams, himself seen as a prime suspect by many other crime experts . Last November, a knife was unearthed which could be one of the most infamous murder weapons in British criminal history. The razor sharp six-inch blade belonged to Welsh surgeon Sir John Williams, a chief suspect in the notorious Jack the Ripper murders. Sir John - known to his family at the time of the killings as 'Uncle Jack' - was the surgeon to Queen Victoria who lived in London at the time of the slayings. He fled the capital after the murders and later founded the National Library for Wales in Aberystwyth. One of his distant relatives found the old black-handled surgeon's knife, which he used for operations, and is sure it is the murder weapon. Tony Williams, 49, Sir John's great-great-great-great nephew, discovered the blade among a stash of possessions left by the Welshman, including three glass slides which contains smears of a uterus. Mr Williams said: 'Why would he leave this behind? I am convinced that this is the knife used by Sir John Williams to murder those women. 'It is widely know that the person who carried out the killings would have had significant medical knowledge. 'Sir John Williams was an accomplished surgeon and routinely performed abortions on women. 'He held surgeries all over London at the time of the murders. 'Dr Thomas Bond, a pathologist who examined the body of Mary Kelly, said the ripper had used the same six-inch knife in all the murders. This razor sharp six-inch blade belonged to Welsh surgeon Sir John and it is believed to be the Ripper's weapon . 'He said it would have been at least six inches long, very sharp, pointed at the top and about an inch in width - a surgeon's knife. 'This is the knife that fits the description that I've held in my hand back in the National Library of Wales.' Sir John Williams, born November 1840, was a Welsh surgeon and physician who attended to Queen Victoria. He was raised to the baronetcy by her for his work in 1894. The medic had a surgery in London's Harley Street the time of the murders - which saw five prostitutes butchered in the streets of Whitechapel in the city's East End. Nichols, Chapman, Stride, Eddowes and Kelly had been expertly sliced open and some had been disembowelled. Two had their uteruses missing. Many suspects have been put forward for the gruesome killings - but it wasn't until this century that Sir John Williams was named. Some believe Prince Albert Victor was the Ripper .

David Cameron has been urged to slash benefits for European immigrants as it emerged 600,000 are here without a job . David Cameron was last night urged to slash benefits for immigrants from Europe. The calls came after a study revealed a sharp rise in the number of EU migrants without a job living in Britain to more than 600,000 – the equivalent of a city the size of Glasgow. There was a 73 per cent increase in the number of ‘job-seeking’ EU immigrants in the country in the three years to 2011, according to the European Commission. The findings led Boris Johnson to urge the Prime Minister to demand a change in EU laws to delay migrants’ access to benefits. Meanwhile, a poll has found that two-thirds of the public want ministers to take ‘drastic action’ to cut immigration. Mr Johnson said migrants should have to work for ‘quite a long time’ before they can claim any benefits in this country. The London Mayor said it was wrong that ‘we have no control over the time lapse between arrival in this country to work and the ability to withdraw benefits’. And he suggested the Prime Minister should press for a change in the law as part of his renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with the EU. ‘That is something that could be considered by the Government for the renegotiation of the European Treaty that is about to come up,’ he said. Tory MP Douglas Carswell also called for a clampdown, saying that migrants appeared to be fleeing to Britain to escape the eurozone crisis. ‘We cannot both continue the free-at-the-point-of-use welfare state and benefits system and allow Europeans to flee the eurozone and come here,’ the Eurosceptic MP added. European Commission figures show there has been a 73 per cent increase in 'job-seeking' EU immigrants . The European Commission study, published today, reveals that in 2012 there were 611,779  economically ‘non-active’ EU migrants living in Britain – up from 431,687 six years ago. The annual cost to the NHS of treating ‘non-active’ migrants is estimated at £1.5billion. The Commission’s  291-page report sheds new light on the impact of EU immigration on Britain. ‘Between 2006 and 2012 there has been a steady increase of 42 per cent in the number of non-active EU migrants in the UK,’ it says. ‘A particularly high increase can be noticed between 2009 and 2011. The number of job-seeking EU migrants increased by 73 per cent, while the total EU migrant population increased by only 28 per cent.’ The report was commissioned by Laszlo Andor, the Commission’s employment commissioner, who is suing Britain over rules that mean some benefits are not immediately available to EU migrants. Boris Johnson said migrants should have to work for 'quite a long time' before claiming benefits in the UK . A Commission spokesman said it was ‘ridiculous’ to suggest the report’s findings meant there are 600,000 unemployed migrants, because the figure includes older children, students, pensioners and other economically inactive adults. ‘All existing studies without any exceptions say that EU migrants are more likely to be in work than the native population and make a positive contribution to the Exchequer,’ he added. Despite the evidence it uncovers, the report concludes that the impact of ‘non-active’ immigrants on the benefits system is ‘very low’. But Stephen Booth, of the think-tank Open Europe, said the conclusion was ‘misleading… wilfully or otherwise’. A poll carried out for Sky News by Survation suggests the public want ministers to take a much tougher stance on immigration. Sixty-seven per cent said the UK’s population is too high and want ‘drastic action’ to cut immigration, while 52 per cent said they are more likely to vote for a party promising to reduce immigration ‘significantly’. And 27 per cent said the wave of immigration in the last decade had brought no benefit to Britain. Seventy-four per cent said they were concerned that Romanians and Bulgarians will be allowed unfettered access to Britain from the end of this year. Sixty-seven per cent of Britons said they want Cameron to take 'drastic action' to cut immigration (file picture) Britain uses the Habitual Residency Test to establish whether EU migrants are eligible for benefits. 611,779: The number of 'non-active' EU migrants in Britain - up 42 per cent in six years . £1.5bn: Estimated annual cost to NHS of treating 'non-active' migrants . 73% increase in the number of 'job seeking' EU migrants in Britain between 2009 and 2011 . 3.7m: Increase in the population of England and Wales between 2001 and 2011, of which 2.1million attributed to immigration . £2bn: Potential cost of EU bid to end curbs on migrants claiming benefits . 67% of public want 'drastic action' to cut immigration . 52% of voters say they are more likely to back party promising to cut immigration 'significantly' To . qualify for jobseekers’ allowance, employment support allowance, . pension credit and income support they must demonstrate they have either . worked here previously or have a good chance of getting a job. Last . night the Department for Work and Pensions said it was determined to . tighten the test to limit migrants’ access to benefits. But the Commission says this ‘right to reside’ test indirectly discriminates against nationals from other EU states by enforcing a set of conditions that effectively tests their right to state handouts. The test is being challenged in court by Mr Andor, despite warnings from Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith that the existing rules save Britain up to £2billion a year. Mr Duncan Smith pledged last year to toughen up the test to curb ‘benefit tourism’. A DWP spokesman said: ‘We have strict rules in place to protect the integrity of the British benefits system and make sure it is not abused. ‘But we are also going further by strengthening the Habitual Residence Test and time-limiting how long some migrants can claim benefits. ‘Ministers are also working with their counterparts across Europe to address concerns about the abuse of free movement.’","European Commission found 73% rise in 'job-seeking' EU immigrants .

Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi has found herself in hot water after it was revealed that she pushed back the execution of a convicted killer to accommodate her re-election fundraiser, which fell on the same day. Marshall Lee Gore was originally scheduled to die by lethal injection today, but Governor Rick Scott last month agreed to delay the date to October 1 at the request of the state attorney general. On Monday, Pam Bondi went into damage control mode, conceding in a statement that it was wrong to allow her campaign event to take precedent over an execution. Conflict of interest: Attorney General Pam Bondi (left) had to apologize after it was revealed that she had delayed the execution of convicted killer Marshall Lee Gore (right) because it coincided with her fundraiser . Gore's execution had been scheduled twice before this year but he received a stay amid ongoing questions over his sanity. When the latest date change was announced it was not publicly known it was done to accommodate a Bondi campaign event scheduled for the same night. Gore was convicted of the March 11, 1988, killing of Robyn Novick, a 30-year-old exotic dancer whose naked body was found in a rural part of Miami-Dade County, partly covered by a blue tarpaulin. Gore was also sentenced to die for the slaying in January 1988 of Susan Roark, whose body was found a few months later in Columbia County in northern Florida. In addition to the two death sentences, Gore was given seven life sentences plus another 110 years in a case involving the attempted murder of a third woman. The woman, an exotic dancer, testified during the trial for the Novick killing that she was beaten with a rock; choked, raped and stabbed; and left near the spot where Novick's body was found. The woman was attacked two days after Novick disappeared. Novick had been stabbed and strangled. Loved ones of Gore’s victims were upset to learn of the reason for the delay in his execution. 'What's going on down there? It's ridiculous,' Robyn Novick's mother, Phyllis, told the Tampa Bay Times. Speaking to the station WTSP Tuesday, the 86-year-old Ohio woman who had waited 25 years to see her daughter's killer executed called this latest delay a 'shame.' Kept in the dark: Florida Gov. Rick Scott granted Bondi's request to push back the execution, but said he did not know that the reason was because it conflicted with her fundraiser . 'I just think what's been going on has been just terrible for us,' Phyllis Novick said. 'It was just awful for everybody.' The . Republican governor said he changed the date at Bondi's request, but he . acknowledged on Monday that he did not know that the reason was because . it conflicted with the fundraiser scheduled in Tampa. Scott, . who would not say if he would have delayed the execution if he knew . about the event, said it's routine for the governor's office to work in . tandem with the statewide elected officials who make up the Florida . Cabinet. 'When another cabinet member asks for something, we try to work with them,’ Scott said. Hours after Scott answered questions about the execution delay Bondi issued a statement that said she should have not have made the request. ‘As a prosecutor, there was nothing more important than seeing justice done, especially when it came to the unconscionable act of murder,’ Bondi said. ‘I personally put two people on death row and, as Attorney General, have already participated in eight executions since I took office, a role I take very seriously. ‘The planned execution of Marshall Lee Gore had already been stayed twice by the courts, and we should not have requested that the date of the execution be moved,’ she said. Phyllis Novick, however, said she had no use in Bondi's apology at this point, adding that she has nothing to say to the attorney general. Bondi worked for the Hillsborough County state attorney before she ran for attorney general in 2010. This summer she opened her campaign account for a second term. So far she has no declared opposition. Ironic: Bondi (center), a Republican, had been a strong supporter of the state's Timely Justice Act - a new state law which speeds up executions by limiting 'frivolous' inmate appeals . The attorney general plays a pivotal . role in executions. It represents the state in death row appeals cases. Usually the attorney general remains available on the date of the . executions in case of any last-minute legal issues. Bondi's office said that is why she sought a delay in Gore's execution. ‘In light of the seriousness of any execution, it was very important to Attorney General Bondi that she be available personally to carry out her office's duties in the execution process,’ said Jenn Meale, a spokeswoman for Bondi. Bondi's decision to seek a delay in the execution date because it conflicted with a fundraiser was first reported by The News Service of Florida. Gore's attorneys have argued before that he is mentally ill. One previous lawyer claimed Gore was ‘mentally deranged’ and not responsible for his actions. But several judges concluded he was using a claim of mental illness to manipulate the judicial process. Gore's execution was first scheduled in June but he received a stay two hours before he was supposed to receive a lethal injection. He then received a second stay of execution a day before his July execution date. The Florida Supreme Court in August ruled that Gore was sane enough to be executed. Death Row: He was supposed to die by lethal injection in the death chamber at Florida State Prison, pictured, but a court of appeals granted him a temporary stay as his lawyers said he is insane . Bondi, a Republican, had been a strong . supporter of the state's Timely Justice Act - a new state law which . speeds up executions by limiting 'frivolous' inmate appeals . The . delay keeps Gore on death row an extra 21 days to the tune of about . $1,000, according to the Department of Corrections’ estimates. Gore's . attorneys have argued that he is mentally ill. During his trials, he . had frequent verbal outbursts, laughed out loud and even howled. He . has also contended that the previous date of his execution, June 24, . 2013, adds up to 666 and that he is a target of 'Satan Worshippers who . have threatened that date by mail for years'. But Gore has no significant history of mental illness and last month a panel of psychiatrists found that he was mentally sound. They said that Gore claimed that the 'Illuminati' wanted him dead to sell his organs - a story they say he made up to manipulate the judicial process. Gore first kidnapped a stripper named Tina in March 1988, raped her, slit her throat and hit her across the head with a rock before leaving her to die in a rural area. But she survived and managed to alert police. Gore had also stolen her car - and her two-year-old son in the back seat. He was later found alive locked in a cabinet of an abandoned home in Georgia. While officers were searching for the boy, they found Novick's body. The 30-year-old had met Gore while working as a dancer in North Miami-Dade. Crimes: He killed two women in 1988 and raped another before kidnapping her two-year-old son . Gore was tracked down to Kentucky. When he was found, he had Tina's woman's bank and credit cards in his jacket pocket, according to court documents. Police also identified him as the person . who killed Roark. She had last been seen with Gore before vanishing in . April 1988. Her body was found off a rural forest road. Upon questioning about all three crimes and shown pictures of Novick's body, police said his eyes filled with tears and he said: 'If I did this, I deserve the death penalty.' Gore initially denied knowing any of the women, according to police. But he later testified that all three women worked for him at his escort service. In 1995, he was found guilty of Novick's murder and sent to Death Row. Gov. Scott signed the death warrant.","Former escort service owner Marshall Lee Gore, 49, killed two women in 1988 and kidnapped, raped and stabbed another .

All that is missing is a grizzly bear trying to catch these flying salmon, but this is not the wilds of Canada or North America, it is the River Tyne. The annual spectacle of salmon battling upstream has been captured in these stunning photographs. Every year thousands of salmon battle upstream as they return home to spawn, and together with sea trout, the fish are currently negotiating the dangerous journey. An amazing natural spectacle is played out along the River Tyne, Northumberland where thousands of salmon have migrated from as far afield as Greenland and Norway to return to their spawning grounds . The salmon and sea trout are trying to reach their spawning grounds on the upper reaches of the North and South River Tyne, high in the North Pennines . The River Tyne is the best salmon river in England and Wales and October is the peak time for the migrating season, making for awesome sights of the stunning fish leaping many feet above the water . The fish travel from as far away as . Greenland and Norway to come back to the exact spot where they were . hatched, and after recent heavy rainfall a large number are taking full . advantage of the increased waterflow to help them on their journey. Phil Rippon, fisheries technical specialist for the Environment Agency, said: 'They are returning to spawn. They will be spawning in the upper reaches of the North and South Tyne, probably in December or January. 'Obviously on their way up stream they are prone to get caught by fishermen. The impressive fish are known to return to the place where they spawned to lay their eggs . The amazing feat of nature will continue until the fish spawn in December or January . This fisherman is making the most of the 30,000 or so fish which will pass through the River Tyne to spawn in the coming weeks . 'We are talking in excess of 30,000 salmon and sea trout migrating up the Tyne ever year. They are inclined to migrate when extra fresh water flows - after rain. 'We had a lot of rain a few days ago. This is the best time, the peak time.' The area has come a long way since the 1950s, when Mr Rippon says that the river was so heavily polluted that it had virtually no salmon at all. He added: 'The Tyne is the best salmon river in England and Wales in terms of the number of salmon caught by fishermen. It has come back from almost nothing to being the best.'
