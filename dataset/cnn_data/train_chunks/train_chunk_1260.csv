"Lancashire’s Simon Kerrigan remains in England’s thoughts . Peter Moores has challenged Monty Panesar to sort out his attitude as England’s new-look side continue their search for a  front-line spinner. With Graeme Swann no longer on the scene and with Panesar out of favour, Alastair Cook’s team had to settle for 16 wicketless overs of  part-time off-spin from Moeen Ali and Joe Root on Monday as they narrowly failed to dismiss Sri Lanka on the final day of the first Investec Test at Lord’s. ‘We are going to have to identify our next spinner, there’s no doubt about that,’ said England coach Moores. ‘Especially when we go away, otherwise it is going to be a weakness in our ranks that people will try to exploit. Bad attitude? Monty Panesar has been challenged to become England's front line spinner by Peter Moores . Rotation policy: Moeen Ali (L) and Joe Root led England's spinners in the narrow defeat to Sri Lanka . ‘Monty is the most experienced Test bowler out there, but through other issues he has made it difficult to look at him at the moment. The key for Monty is to bowl well and get his things right, and then put himself up for selection like anyone else. ‘There are two things: people have to be in the right place to play from an attitudinal point of view, but also they have to be playing well enough.’ Lancashire’s slow left-armer Simon Kerrigan remains in England’s thoughts, and there are high hopes for Kent’s 22-year-old off-spinner Adam Riley. Panesar, though, remains the classiest option. His 50 Tests have brought him 167 wickets and, at 32, he ought to be in his prime. His form with Essex is not an immediate . concern: he has 22 Championship wickets this summer at 29 apiece. But he . was dropped for the Championship game against Glamorgan at the start of . the month after forgetting to turn up for a team meeting. Class act: Monty Panesar has brought down 167 wickets in 50 Tests during his England career . That followed a warning from Essex about his body language earlier in the season, and a row with Derbyshire’s Billy Godleman. Last summer, Panesar was given a wide berth by England after urinating on nightclub bouncers in Brighton. Meanwhile, Cook has been fined 20 per cent of his match fee after England were deemed to have fallen one over short of the required rate for the Lord’s Test.

"They're both blessed with an outrageous ginger tuft of hair and a cold beady stare, so it's no wonder people think this canary and billionaire business tycoon Donald Trump are birds of a feather. The colourful lookalike for the property magnate turned TV star was spotted by nature photographer Sandy Wiskeman as it perched on a branch in a park in New Jersey. The bird, which is a Gloster Canary, was easy to spot among leaves thanks to its unusual crown of feathers, which almost appears toupee-like. Birds of a feather: The unique Gloster Canary bears a striking resemblance to the American business tycoon thanks to its beady eyes and ginger head feathers . The read deal: Trump's whispy golden crown has become a trademark feature of the billionaire's appearance on the US version of the Apprentice . But it wasn't until later that the photographer realised that odd looking bird reminded her of a familiar face. The swept back style of its feathers is almost identical to Donald Trump's famoulsy manipulated mane. The 67-year-old star of the US Apprentice, who is said to be worth $5bn, is known for trying to maintain an even covering on his head by back-combing his thinning hair, often with disastrous results. One of Trumps most memorable hair-raising moments came when he visited the Scottish Highlands to announce plans to build a golf course on the Isle of Lewis. A highlight of the controversial press trip was the businessman's constant battle to keep his hair under control in the bracing northern winds. Thankfully, Trump's canary companion doesn't have to worry about its headgear being disturbed by such heavy weather. The Gloster Canary is a popular choice of pet which is kept for its beautiful song as well as its stylish crest.

"A former Denver anesthesiologist was sentenced to 20 years in prison Friday after admitting that he bludgeoned an Aspen socialite to death. William Styler, 66, entered his guilty plea after accepting an agreement with Pitkin County prosecutors. Prosecutors said Styler killed Nancy Pfister, 57, February 24, striking her with a hammer while she slept. Case closed: Former doctor William Styler, 66, pictured in court back in March, was sentenced to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to murdering Aspen socialite Nancy Pfister . Lone suspect: Styler (left), a former anesthesiologist from Denver, had told authorities he acted alone in the murder of Pfister, whose house he and his wife had been renting while the socialite was away . The former doctor then wrapped the victim's body and hid it in a closet, where she was found by police two days later. Pfister had rented her home to Styler and his wife while she vacationed in Australia. She was killed shortly after she returned to Aspen. Pfister's parents co-founded the Buttermilk ski area. On a Facebook posting before her death, Pfister said that the Stylers were not paying rent. Defense attorneys denied that claim. But District Attorney Sherry Caloia told reporters Friday that Styler and Pfister had argued before the murder. Caloia also suggested that the motive may have been a financial dispute. Styler, his wife, Nancy Styler, and Pfister's personal assistant, Katherine Carpenter, originally were charged with first-degree murder. Prosecutors dropped the charges against Nancy Styler on Tuesday and against Carpenter on Friday. Caloia said Friday that William Styler had told authorities he acted alone in the slaying. At sentencing, Pfister's relatives asked Chief District Judge James Boyd to impose a maximum sentence of 32 years for the second-degree murder charge. Prosecutors recommended a 20-year term in a prison with medical facilities, and Boyd agreed. Styler had appeared in court in a wheelchair for an unspecified health condition. Cleared: Nancy Styler (right), 62, was released from jail Tuesday after being cleared by investigators, and charges against Pfister's former assistant Katherine Carpenter (right) were dropped Friday . Defense team: Garth McCarty and Beth Krulewitch, defense attorneys for Nancy Styler, speak with reporters Friday . ‘We do believe that this is a good and . just resolution to these cases and hope that Nancy Pfister's family can . find peace in knowing what happened,’ said a statement issued by . Caloia's office. Citing Styler's age and health, it added, ‘We believe this will be a life sentence for him. The Stylers' arrest affidavits that were unsealed last week showed that police found nine blood spots inside the couple's Jaguar, ABC News reported. The murder weapon was discovered in a trash bag not far from Nancy and William Stylers' hotel room. Nancy Pfister, 57, was hit with a hard object that had a small, curved shape and died from a blunt force trauma to the head, according to the coroner's report released in April. She had been dead about 36 hours before her body was found on February 26. William and Nancy Styler, who had rented Pfister's Aspen home while she was in Australia, were arrested March 3 after moving out of the residence February 22. Katherine Carpenter, 56, an assistant to Pfister and a bank employee, was arrested March 14. Authorities said she called 911 to report she found Pfister's body in a closet of the home. Pfister . was the daughter of the late Betty and Art Pfister, longtime prominent . Aspen residents who co-founded the Buttermilk ski area west of town. Buttermilk Mountain has hosted the Winter X Games multiple times. Pfister's death was the first homicide case in Pitkin County in 12 years, not counting those classified as murder-suicides. Pfister wrote on Facebook on February 3 . that 'the people that were supposedly taking care of my house are not . doing what they said they would do and they're not paying rent and they . haven't paid utilities'. Over the years, Pfister had paid . Carpenter, an employee at two Alpine bank branches in Aspen, to manage . her property and to walk her dog, Gabe, who came with the $4,000-a-month . lease. On February 6, . Pfister posted on Facebook that she was looking for new tenants and that . anyone interested should contact Carpenter. Ms Pfister, pictured left with her daughter Juliana, wrote on Facebook that she was returning early from Australia as she was having trouble with tenants who were not paying the rent . She subsequently returned from Australia and, days later, was found dead by Carpenter.

"Amelia Abbott just turned five last month and all she can think about is starting ‘big girl school’ next year and growing up to be a ‘princess ballerina’. Only a few months ago, these dreams were looking far from realistic, but thanks to her three-year-old brother Lachy – things are well and truly looking up for the beautiful little girl. There was a 25 per cent chance of Lachy being a bone marrow match for his older sister Amelia Abbott, 5, from the Gold Coast in Queensland, who was in desperate need of a helping hand after battling acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a type of blood cancer which particularly hits children. But Lachy did so much more than that by providing a very rare 'perfect match' with his sibling – a moment his mother, Michelle Abbott, has described as nothing short of 'magical'. Amelia dreams of one day growing up to be a ‘princess ballerina’ The magical moment when Amelia (left) saw her brother Lachy (right) for the time after the bone marrow transplant operation five weeks later . Only 17 months apart in age, Amelia (left) and Lachy (right) have always had a close relationship . Amelia (left) and Michelle (right) at the Royal Children's hospital in Brisbane . ‘It was just awesome – we were just ecstatic to know Lachy was able to help her to heal and be a part of her journey,’ she told Daily Mail Australia. Amelia was categorised in the low risk category when she was diagnosed in December but within three months, after chemotherapy, she rapidly escalated to extremely high risk with just a 40 per cent chance of recovery. ‘I was glad I was sitting down when I got the news – I was absolutely beside myself,’ she said. But the best possible news was delivered to the family in March when Lachy had an unusual 10 out of 10 bone marrow match with his sister. 'I did have a mother's instinct that he would be a match, but it was amazing when the news came,' Mrs Abbott said. The way Michelle and her husband Chris explained to their three year-old son that he was going to be the unique gift to Amelia was by reading him a book. 'We sat down and explained to him with a superhero story, and he thought it was an awesome story, she said. Amelia has been her mother Michelle's tower of strength throughout the long journey . Their mother describes her son and daughter as having a bond as strong as a pair of twins . Lachy had 280ml of barrow marrow removed, which was transplanted into Amelia just a few hours later on July 9. Amazingly, his young body has replaced this marrow within a few weeks. ‘He woke and all he wanted to do was see Amelia, but she was in isolation so he waved at her through the window,’ she said. When the pair reunited five weeks later, Michelle was glad to have her camera on hand to capture the heart-warming moment. The huge grin on Amelia’s face spoke a million words when she held her little brother. ‘He ran into the room and they just embraced,’ she said. ‘They don’t go well when they don’t see each other for a while.’ Only 17 months apart in age, Amelia and Lachy have always had a close relationship which has significantly strengthened since the beginning of this special journey. ‘She has always been like his little mother since he was born and he’s her strength – they are more like twins,’ she said. ‘And now they have a bond that will never be broken – it has been magical to watch it grow.’ Amelia has a very strong understanding of the incredible gift she has been given by her brother Lachy . The inseparable pair have a special bond that will never be broken . Amelia (left) and Lachy (right) can't bare spending long periods of time apart from one another . When Michelle and her husband, Chris, had to tell Amelia who was only four at the time, that she was sick, they decided to break it down in a way she would easily understand. ‘I told her that the chemo was Pacman, who had to eat the nasties inside her,’ she said. But when the chemotherapy wasn't successful, they had another chat with their daughter about her brother helping out. Her instant response proved her extraordinary understanding of a complex situation for a child who had not yet turned five. ‘Pacman is not doing a good enough job so Lachy’s super cells are going in to help. But Pacman is still on guard to help kill them off if they come back,’ Amelia told her parents. 'She’s an intelligent young girl,’ her mother said. ‘She’s my strength and always has positivity.’ ‘She says “I’ll get those nasties” – it’s been an amazing journey.’ Six weeks after her transplant, Amelia was given the all clear for the first time. But Thursday is the big day for Amelia as she has her 100-day test. In the meantime, Amelia’s family and friends are participating in the Leukaemia Foundation of Queensland’s Light the Night 2014 at Broadwater Parklands, Marine Pde in Southland, Queensland at 4pm on Wednesday.

"A 15-year-old orphan, who has been bounced around the foster care system his entire life, stood in front of a church congregation last month and made a simple plea - for someone to be his family. Davion Navar Henry Only nervously stood before worshippers at Florida's St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church and said: 'My name is Davion and I've been . in foster care since I was born... I know God hasn't given up on me. So I'm not giving up either. 'I'll take anyone. Old or . young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be . really appreciative. The best I could be.' Davion Navar Henry Only told the congregation at Florida's St Mark's Missionary Baptist Church that he didn't mind who the parents were who adopted him because he would be 'really appreciative' Davion Only, 15, gets some last-minute help with his tie from his case worker Connie Going before nervously making his speech before the congregation . Davion spoke quietly in front of the full pews wearing an over-sized, donated suit that had come from his latest foster home. The boy was born while his mother was in jail and has spent his entire childhood in countless foster homes. It was his idea to approach the St Petersburg church to find his own adoptive parents and take control of his future. In three years time when he turns 18, he is aware that he will be on his own. Davion will turn 16 on February 12 next year. He told his caseworker Connie Going that he knows his adoptive parents are out there somewhere. In June, Davion had come to terms with the death of his mother after he used his birth certificate to search for her for the first time. He found her mugshot from her arrests for petty theft and cocaine. And then he found her obituary. La-Dwina Ilene 'Big Dust' McCloud had died aged 55 in Clearwater, Florida just weeks before. The 15-year-old has spent the past few years at Carlton Manor residential group home in Eckerd, living with 12 other teenage boys, all suffering their own problems. Looking for a family: 15-year-old Davion spoke to the church congregation about how badly he wanted a family to care about him . He longs to play football but has no one to take him to practice; to be able to use the bathroom without someone unlocking a door. He would like the light left on when he sleeps. Davion's portrait is one of many in the Heart Gallery - an organization which helps children in foster care find moms and dads. Each child has a small profile telling prospective parents something about who they are. Each article begins with an ID number from the foster care system and the words 'I am available'. Davion, who is pictured smiling on the beach and throwing a basketball in the air, writes that his favorite school subject is science and that when he grows up he wants to be a police officer. He likes to eat 'Chinese Food or Buffets' and enjoys football and basketball along with video games, hand held games, cards and watching Cartoon Network. When it comes to his friends, Davion looks for those who are true to themselves and to him. On his ideal family, the teenager says he doesn't care if the people are rich or poor or what ethnic background they are from. He would like a family 'who are nice, fun and that know how to cook!' The 15-year-old also gives a short description of what he is like for any family out there. Davion writes that he is: 'Nice and fun and would be happy to be adopted! Davion says the nicest thing he has ever done is a save a boy from drowning.' Davion Only, 15, left, to spend some quality time talking one-on-one with his mentor, Richard Prince, 22. He is hoping to find a family after a lifetime in foster care . The teenager has had . behavioral problems - struggling with his own anger at the circumstances . in which he finds himself. Dealing . with his mother's death has led Davion to believe that he doesn't want . to be angry anymore - he wants to discover a better life. He has spent the summer studying hard in 10th grade - achieving As in all but one subject - geometry. He has lost 40lb and tries to let go of his anger. Davion also has support from his mentor Richard Prince, 22. The two got paired up through the One Church One Child program and usually go to a park to play basketball or talk. Floyd Watkins, program manager at Davion's group home, told Naplesnews: ''He's come a long way. He's starting to . put himself out there, which is hard when you've been rejected so many . times.' The newspaper reported that as of this week, two couples had made inquiries about Davion but he is still in the foster care system.

"Panesar was caught urinating on a bouncer in Brighton last year, while he received a suspended ban for 'potentially threatening and intimidating' behaviour in September. Monty Panesar ran into more disciplinary trouble at the worst possible time when he was dropped by Essex just as England selectors prepare to pick their team to face Sri Lanka in the first Test. Panesar was left out despite being chosen on Saturday to play against Glamorgan in the Championship when he failed to turn up for a team meeting yesterday morning after ‘forgetting’ that it had been scheduled. Essex were quick to stress that they did not consider the matter to be serious. But it was the latest and most untimely example of Panesar’s ability to run into the sort of trouble which saw him sacked by Sussex last season. Graeme Swann’s retirement has left England in desperate need of a quality spinner and Panesar, at 32, remains the best specialist option when they meet on Wednesday to consider their options for Lord’s on June 12. Yet he is likely to be pipped for a place by an all-round option in either Moeen Ali or Samit Patel with England as concerned as much by Panesar’s temperament as his ability to bowl out Sri Lanka on what is expected to be a flat pitch. VIDEO Scroll down to the bottom to see Panesar talking exclusively to MailOnline after his nightclub indiscretions last summer . Dropped: Monty Panesar has been left out of Essex's LV=County Championship game against Glamorgan . Oops: The left-arm spinner had been tipped for a Test return by some but should miss out to Moeen Ali . The . suggestion at the start of this summer was that the new England regime . were prepared to forgive and forget the past misdemeanours of Panesar, who lost weight in the winter after staying on in Australia . after the Ashes to work on his game. Yet, . the noises emerging from Chelmsford suggest Panesar has been a handful . this season. He was warned by his new county about his body language in . an early Essex match and had a row with Derbyshire’s Billy Godleman that . led to him being told to calm down by the umpires in a Championship . game. He was replaced by the . promising leg-spinner Tom Craddock yesterday and must smarten up his . act if he is not going to squander the chance Essex have given him to . rebuild a career of such achievement before Swann usurped him. Meanwhile, . the man who played one of the great one-day innings at Lord’s on . Saturday in England’s narrow fourth one-day international defeat is . adamant that he is not yet ready to be considered by England for the . two-Test series. Are you ready? Peter Moores is set to name his first Test squad back in the England hotseat on Thursday . Jos Buttler . took England to within seven runs of their highest successful run chase . in any one-day international on home soil with his sublime 121 from 74 . balls against Sri Lanka but does not expect to play in the first Test . next week. ‘I am probably . not ready for that,’ he said. ‘I average 32 in first-class cricket and . my glovework needs to improve, too, if I’m to play in Tests. I’m 23 and . have time to work on these things.’ England’s . first choice remains Matt Prior and all will depend on how he comes . through Sussex’s Championship match with Nottinghamshire at Hove where . the England  vice-captain reclaimed the gloves yesterday. Centurion: Jos Buttler thinks he is not yet ready for Test cricket despite his stunning ton at Lord's . Prior’s . chronic achilles condition has kept him out of  four-day cricket ever . since he scored a century for Sussex in their first game of the season . and James Whitaker, the national selector, has insisted that England . would not risk any player they deem not to be totally fit. It . now seems almost certain that, should Prior not be considered fully . fit, England will turn to the man who remains one of the best . wicketkeepers in the world in Essex captain James Foster. Foster . played the last of his seven Tests almost 12 years ago and his return . now, at 34, would be a comeback almost as remarkable as Andrew . Flintoff’s.

"They live in one of the most hostile places on Earth, where the ground is littered with black volcanic rocks and daytime temperatures regularly soar to 45 degrees Celsius. But for the people of the Turkana tribe, this lunar landscape is home. More than two days drive from Kenyan capital Nairobi and bordered by South Sudan to the north and Ethiopia to the east, 250,000 people eke out a living from their cattle on the shores of the mighty Lake Turkana. Yet despite living in one of the remotest and most inhospitable places on the planet, photographer Eric Lafforgue, the man behind these incredible images, says the people are welcoming - and have a fascinating array of traditions, not least their habit of celebrating the passage to adulthood with a liberal application of dung. Striking: A Turkana woman shows off her beaded collar. The red colour of her skin comes from a mix of ochre, butter and perfume which is used instead of water to bath . Beads: All women wear beads, with men refusing to look at them if they fail to do so. They never take them off unless they're ill or in mourning for a relative . Beautiful: Both men and women wear the Turkana's trademark nakaparaparal or earrings, which are made exclusively by the men using aluminium . Important: For Turkana men, ostrich feathers are a sign of adulthood and are thus hugely expensive - two ostrich feathers are worth the same as a goat to the tribe . 'To become a man, a Turkana teenager . must go through a ceremony where he has to kill an animal with a spear . in one throw,' explains Lafforgue. 'Once done, the elders will open the . stomach of the animal and smear all the dung on his body - it's their . way of blessing him.' And . the Turkana tribe's uses for poo aren't limited to initiation rites. With little wood to be found, most of the cooking is done over fires . made from dried cow dung, while dog poo is used both as a medicine and . as a lubricant to keep the tribe's elaborate bead necklaces from chafing . the neck. 'Women put . animal fat all around their neck and also on their huge necklaces to . prevent skin irritation,' reveals Lafforgue. 'They also use dog poo as a . medicine and as a lubricant for their necks.' But . it's animal fat that holds the most value for the Turkana, who along . with using it as both food and medicine, also use it as a substitute for . water when it comes to keeping clean. Protective: Women of the Turkana tribe use . animal fat mixed with ochre to protect their skin and use either animal . fat or dog poo to stop their necklaces from chafing . Adults: . Women are considered adults as soon as they hit puberty but boys have . to go through an initiation ritual before they are considered men . Family affair: Fathers give children different jobs depending on their age with boys in charge of herding while girls do things like collecting firewood and water . Initiation rite: Boys of the Turkana tribe aren't considered men until they have killed an animal with a single spear throw, after which dung is smeared over their bodies . 'Since . water is so rare, it’s used only for drinking and never for washing,' says Lafforgue. 'Instead, the . Turkana clean themselves by rubbing fat or butter all over their skin. 'Turkana . women follow it up with grease paint which they make by mixing animal . fat with red ochre and fragrant leaves from one of the local trees. They . say it's good for the skin and it protects them from the insects.' Teeth, meanwhile, are cared for using . twigs from the esekon tree. 'You see them using it all day long,' adds . Lafforgue. 'The Turkana people have . the cleanest bill of dental health in the country.' Although . the Turkana prize their esekon trees and impressively large herds of . sheep and cattle, wealth is revealed via elaborate beaded jewellery . which the tribe value above everything else. 'Turkana women love to adorn . themselves with a lot of necklaces,' says Lafforgue. 'Beads can be made from glass, seeds, . cowry shells or iron. They don't remove their necklaces unless they are ill or mourning a relative - they even sleep in them. 'Married . women will also wear a plain metal . ring around the neck, which has the same function as a wedding ring. So . important are necklaces to the Turkana, a man will do all he can to make . sure that his womenfolk are . dressed in impressive beads. Striking: Older women still wear labrets that . cut through their lower lips while all men wear the elaborate emedot . hairstyle which is made using clay (right) Elaborate: Turkana women all wear beaded necklaces - women who don't are shunned as 'being like animals' by the men of the tribe . Painful: . All Turkana people have their lower incisors removed in childhood - a . practice thought to have begun as a way to make nursing people with TB . easier . Clean teeth: The Turkana use the esekon stick to . clean their teeth (left). Lower incisors, however, are removed in . childhood using the corodat finger hook (right) Palm Shade Camp in Loyangalani sits in the heart of Turkana tribal lands between Lake Turkana and the Chalbi Desert.

'Even . if they can't afford to send their girls . to school, they will still ensure that they have beads because the . quantity . and style of jewelry a woman wears reveals her social status. In . particular, a woman without beads is bad and men will ignore her - they . say ""you look like an animal without beads"".' But jewellery isn't only for the women. Men too wear elaborate decorations, most famously, their nakaparaparaI or ear ornaments, which are made by the men of the tribe from aluminium. 'Men have elaborate . mudpack hairdos called emedot which is a kind of chignon,' adds Lafforgue. 'It takes the shape of a large bun of hair at the back of the head and they . decorate it with ostrich feathers to show they are elders or warriors. 'Tattoos . are also common and usually have a special meaning,' he continues. 'Men are tattooed on the . shoulders and upper arm each time they kill an enemy — the right . shoulder for killing a man, the left for a woman.' More gruesomely, the Turkana tribe still cling to their tradition of knocking out the lower incisors - a practice usually done in childhood using a fearsome-looking finger hook called a corogat. 'Originally, it was supposed to protect people against tetanus because they can feed people with milk through the hole when they're lock-jawed. It also means the lower teeth don't interfere with the . labrets many put on the lower lip.' Sadly, the Turkana, who have lived in their remote home for millennia, could be under threat after oil was discovered underneath their land. 'Many in Kenya are worried that the Turkana will lose their traditions,' says Lafforgue. 'I'm not sure they will though. The . Turkana have succeeded in maintaining their way of life for centuries. Against all the odds, they manage to raise livestock in the . desert. Their knowledge allows them to live where most humans could not.' Threatened: . Because oil has been discovered on Turkana land, many are worried that . their way of life and traditions could come under threat . Man's . best friend: Because of their many dogs, echinococcus is common among . the Turkana. But they say the disease is caused by a spell cast by the . Toposa tribe . Remote: .

Lunar . landscape: The Turkana - and their neighbours, the El-Molo - live in an . area dotted with volcanic rocks and where daytime temperatures climb to . 45 degrees . Home: .

"A woman accused of mowing down a pedestrian and then reversing back over him and into a kebab shop has blamed the crash on her flips flops. Navlet Anderson, 50, was aiming for a teenage girl she had an earlier argument with when she careered towards the fast food restaurant in Bristol, a court heard. However, before crashing through the shop, the jury was told she took out pedestrian Stephen Brothwood. Carnage: A woman accused of mowing down a pedestrian and then reversing back over him and into a kebab shop has blamed the crash on her flips flops. This is the scene following the crash . It is claimed she then reversed back out - abandoning the car on top of her injured victim. Mr Brothwood was left with a punctured lung, fractured ribs and legs. Anderson, of Bristol, denies causing grievous bodily harm with intent during the incident in April. She also denies an alternative charge of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and a further charge of dangerous driving. Bristol Crown Court was told Anderson told detectives her flip flops caught on the pedals of her Vauxhall Corsa, causing the crash. Concerns: The crash resulted in a large presence from the emergency services . She told police: 'When I came back to park my flip flops got caught in the pedals and that caused the accident.' David Scutt, prosecuting, said: 'The Crown’s case is that she sees the youngster and her mother and drives at them and in so doing takes out Mr Brothwood. 'She hits him and the car continues into the front of the kebab shop, damaging the frontage of the kebab shop. 'We say that, in a rage, she drives that car intentionally and deliberately at people. She hits Mr Brothwood and she injures him very badly.' The trial continues.

"Rebel GP: Dr Gordon Gancz accused the NHS of using 'blatant bullying' tactics to 'bulldoze' doctors and patients into complying with the scheme . A rebel GP faces having his practice shut down after vowing to opt all of his patients out of a flagship NHS scheme to harvest their medical records. Under the scheme, private medical information will automatically be extracted from patients’ records unless they opt out. But there are growing concerns over the data collection project, with critics saying the public has not been properly informed about it. And yesterday it emerged that Health Service bosses threatened to shut down Dr Gordon Gancz’s GP surgery because he pledged to keep his patients’ details off the database. Dr Gancz, who has been at his Oxford practice for almost 40 years and first revealed himself to Pulse magazine, accused the NHS of using ‘blatant bullying’ tactics to ‘bulldoze’ doctors and patients into complying with the scheme. The GP told how he was sent a ‘threatening’ email warning him that he would be ‘in breach of his contract’ if he did not automatically opt his patients in to the scheme. He said it also contained the ‘Big Brother-ish’ demand that he remove a statement on his surgery’s website which warned patients that he was ‘concerned’ about the scheme and told them: ‘We have decided to assume that all our patients wish to opt out of this data extraction.’ Sent a 'threatening' email: Dr Gancz has been at his Oxford practice (pictured) for almost 40 years . Under the ‘care.data’ scheme, which is due to start in the spring, the data will be used by the Health and Social Care Information Centre to build a nationwide database to help identify poor performance in the NHS – such as areas with long waiting times or where conditions are being diagnosed late. Officials also believe the new system could help target additional resources in areas where there is a pressing clinical need, and say the data collection could even lead to new treatments. An edited version of the email from NHS England’s Thames Valley Area Team: ‘We wish to discuss the remediation [remedy] needed because you have published on your practice website information about the care data extraction indicating that you intend opting your patients out of the data extraction unless they contact you to opt in. ‘This is contrary to NHS England’s requirement that patients will automatically be included unless they indicate to their practice that they wish to opt out... ‘We therefore believe any GP who prevents the care.data extraction by opting out part or the whole of his list without their consent to be in breach of his contract. ‘NHS England requires you to remedy this breach by... [removing] any opt out codes which you have applied to your patients’ medical records without their prior consent. The Area Team would like to discuss this with Dr Gancz prior to the issue of a remedial notice.’ But there is widespread concern among MPs, academics and doctors that the information could fall into the hands of hackers or be sold to private health companies, insurance firms or drug manufacturers for use in targeting patients. Dr Gancz said: ‘They don’t want me to tell my patients that their confidential data is going to be taken, but my patients have a right to know. ‘I believe research is important – medicine is all about research – but patients should positively want to release their information. ‘In many cases patients will not even know that this scheme is about to start so they will not have an opportunity to opt out, should they so wish.’ He added: ‘The Government and NHS are acting very surreptitiously. I believe they want to capitalise on people’s inertia and hope that those who do not understand what is happening simply won’t bother to opt out.’ On Friday a letter from NHS England’s Thames Valley Area Team was emailed to the practice manager at Dr Gancz’s King Edward Street surgery. The letter requests that the GP take down certain sections of his website bulletin to patients, and remove any ‘blocking’ codes he may have already inserted in his patient’s records which signify that the information they contain cannot be harvested. Dr Gancz is one of two GPs known to be so opposed to the scheme they have removed the thousands of patients on their books from it unless they have specifically asked to be included. The other GP remains anonymous. 'They don't want me to tell my patients that their confidential data is going to be taken, but my patients have a right to know' Dr Gordon Gancz . A spokesman for NHS England said: ‘We want patients to understand how important their information is to improving outcomes and ensuring we all receive the highest standards of care. ‘If a patient wishes to object to their information being used for purposes beyond their direct care they must do so autonomously, based on balanced, accurate information about how and why their information will be used. ‘It is not right for GP practices to make this decision on their patients’ behalf.’ The contentious NHS project of harvesting patients’ data will begin this spring. Even children will be included in the scheme, which sources information on prescriptions, diagnosis of any illness or condition including depression and mental illness, scans, tests, operations and treatments. The data will be stored anonymously so patients’ names won’t be recorded but their date of birth and NHS number will be. The NHS says the information will be used to identify poor care such as areas where patients are waiting long times for appointments or are not being prescribed the correct treatment. In future, they also hope that it will pinpoint cures. Patients have to speak to their GP if they don’t want their data extracted. They can do this over the phone or in person – it will depend on the surgery. GPs will then put a note on their file to warn officials that they have objected to the plans. The only data which won’t be uploaded onto the database is so-called ‘sensitive’ information on abuse, abortions or sexually transmitted infections.","Public 'has not been properly informed about data collection project'

"A dog abandoned outside a train station with nothing but a takeaway tray of water appeared to be so sad at being cast aside, tears filled his eyes. The black Staffordshire Bull Terrier-type dog was abandoned outside Eastbourne Railway Station, tied to the railing and left with just a small pot of water by his owner who fled in a taxi. A photo of the animal, looking forlorn, has been shared dozens of times on the internet with people calling for help for the 'crying' dog. A staffie-type dog was left abandoned at Eastbourne Railway Station with just a takeaway tray of water . The dog was found whining and pining for his owner after patiently waiting by the railing for more than an hour on February 11 in the hope that he would return. When no one turned up to collect the lonely dog he was reported abandoned. He was collected by dog wardens who hope they will be able to find the owner. A spokesman for Eastbourne Borough Council said: 'We were called on Wednesday afternoon with a report of a dog tied up and left for more an hour at Eastbourne Station. The dog cut a forlorn figure and appeared to be so saddened by his situation tears were coming from his eyes . 'We collected the dog which is now safe and well in kennels. 'We are trying to trace the pet's owner who we urge to contact us.' If they are unsuccessful it is hoped the forlorn animal may be able to be re-homed in a similar way to Kai, the Shar-Pei dog abandoned just after Christmas. Kai, a Shar-Pei, was left tied to railings with a suitcase shortly after Christmas and has now been re-homed . Kai was left tied to the railings at Ayr station in Scotland, with just a suitcase containing his favourite pillow, bowl and toy. His story attracted worldwide interest and the Scottish SPCA received offers from as far away as Hong Kong, New York and the Philippines to re-home him.

"Lost in translation: A Swedish women's group launched a campaign to find a word for female masturbation . In Sweden there is no commonly accepted word for female masturbation, so the country's sex education group has launched a competition to establish one. The Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (RFSU) – an organisation that promotes an 'open, positive view of sex and relationship issues' – has so far received more than a thousand suggestions after launching the contest earlier this month. Top suggestions so far include 'Klittra', 'pulla' and 'selfa'. Kristina Ljungros, a spokeswoman for the association, hopes the competition will encourage healthy discussions about sexuality. She told The Local: 'Rather than sit around amongst ourselves talking about it, we thought we would launch a nationwide competition. 'We are trying to put sexuality on the agenda - the positive aspects, not just the negative ones like sexual abuse. We want to focus on the good parts, the lust'. 'When it comes to masturbation, people mostly think about just men doing it and we don't think of it as common for women. If we don't have a word in the language, how can we even talk about it?' The contest follows news that researchers have discovered that although many women assume they know exactly what turns them on, their brains and their lady bits often disagree. Scientists at Indiana University's Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction, used a 'vaginal photoplethysmograph'- a small glass tampon-shaped instrument that measures sexual arousal by blood flow - to demonstrate this mind-body disconnect. Writer Melanie Berliet, 33, based in New York City, underwent the test herself and discovered some surprising discrepancies between what she believed she found sexy, and what her nether regions responded to. 'I've always thought of myself as self-aware sexually,' Miss Berliet writes for Cosmopolitan. 'I consider myself a non-judgmental heterosexual woman who enjoys various positions and toys and is open to the possibility of a threesome if the urge strikes.' In the interests of the experiment, Miss Berliet was required to insert the probe into her vagina and seat herself on a leather chair while various erotic and non-erotic video clips were played before her. Erick Janssen, PhD - whose work in sexual pleasure has reportedly earned him the monkier Dr. Feel Good - and evolutionary biologist Justin R. Garcia, PhD, both leading the study, were controlling the videos from a separate room. Campaign: The most popular suggestions submitted have been 'Klittra', 'pulla' and 'selfa' 'The probe looked and felt like a glass tampon, so it was easy to forget that it was inside me,' Miss Berliet tells MailOnline. The device, she explains, measures blood flow to the surrounding tissue, or the 'pulse' of the vagina, which indicates arousal. 'It was definitely a challenge to stay still, but overall I was comfortable. Since I was focused on watching porn, any discomfort I might have felt was probably eclipsed by the graphic imagery inches from my face.' As Dr Janssen explains, arousal is made up from a balance between two brain systems; sexual excitation, 'your gas pedal', and sexual inhibition, 'your breaks'. Miss Berliet was exposed to wide range of visual stimuli; from 'neutralizing' kitten videos and scenes from uplifting films, to hard-core porn and a disturbing clip from The Silence of the Lambs. For each video, she was asked to rate her emotional responses - excitement, relaxation, fright, sadness, guilt and shame, for example - on a five-point scale. Miss Berliet then told researchers, off the top of her head, that she was generally aroused by concepts including lesbian sex, a threesome and female masturbation. She also declared some concepts that she didn't consider arousing; homosexual male sex, foot fetishism and bonobo monkeys mating, for example. After sourcing video clips relevant to Miss Berliet's preferences, she was invited to view them and rate how aroused each clip made her feel on a scale of one to ten. This created some mental conflicts. 'As a proponent of gay rights, for instance, I wanted to be turned on by sex between men, but I found the sight of two erect penises off-putting. 'And as much as I wanted to believe that neither animals nor feet could excite me, I had to concede a minimal level of attraction to both.'","RFSU promotes an 'open, positive view of sex and relationship issues'

"They're sisters, they’re all four years old – but, remarkably, these three little girls are not triplets. The eldest, Cara, was just nine months old when she became a big sister to twins Laura and Jenna. Her mother, Tessa Singh, 40, had become pregnant again within 12 weeks of her birth, and the twins were born prematurely at 28 weeks. Three's company: Big sister Cara, centre, is only nine months older than her sisters, twins Laura, left and Jenna . It means for three months of each year, the sisters are all the same age. Mrs Singh said: ‘People can’t believe it when I tell them all the girls are the same age, yet they aren’t triplets. ‘I can’t quite believe I’ve given birth to three girls in just nine months. I’ve certainly had my hands full.’ Mrs Singh, a teacher, and her hairdresser husband Daynie, 39, had their first daughter Cara in July 2008. They started trying for another baby three months later. Mrs Singh said: ‘We had wanted to have babies close together so we thought when Cara was three months old that we should start trying as we didn’t know how long it would take. Happy surprise: Tessa and Daynie Singh began trying for another baby three months after Cara was born, but did not count on falling pregnant on the first try . ‘If it was going to take a year or so to . fall pregnant, then we wanted to start trying straight away. I actually . fell pregnant the first time we started trying, which was a bit of a . surprise.’ The couple, who live in Chorlton, . Manchester, were in for a further surprise when Mrs Singh went for a . 12-week scan and the sonographer told her she was expecting twins. She . said: ‘I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I was in complete shock. I’d had a lot more morning sickness with this pregnancy, but I had never . imagined that I could be carrying twins. There are no twins in either . side of our families. ‘I was . actually offered counselling by the hospital after I’d found out. I . think they thought that three babies in under nine months was a bit too . much to cope with. ‘We discussed it and decided that it was daunting, but as long as we were organised, then we would be able to manage.’ Same, same, but different: The three Singh sisters have a very close bond, 'acting like triplets' and all sleeping in one bed . But in April 2009, when Mrs Singh was 27 weeks pregnant, she went into premature labour. She said: ‘It was so frightening that . the babies were on their way at such an early stage. We didn’t even know . if they would survive. We really thought that we were going to lose . them.’ Proud parents: Tessa and Daynie Singh . Doctors at Royal Oldham Infirmary . managed to hold off the contractions for a week. Then the twins were . delivered, each weighing only 2lbs. The . girls were transferred to St Mary’s Hospital in Manchester. Jenna . suffered two bleeds on the brain, had a hole in her heart and had a . collapsed lung. Mrs Singh said: ‘It was a terrifying time for us when . the twins were first born. They were so tiny and so poorly. At one point . we said goodbye to Jenna, but amazingly she managed to fight on.’ Jenna was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and the doctors warned Mrs Singh that she may never walk. But she has proved the medics wrong, something that Mrs Singh believes is down to her close relationship with her sisters. She . said: ‘They have such a strong bond. Cara was only nine months old when . the twins were born, so she has never known life without them there. ‘It . is as if they are all triplets. They are never apart from each other. She has just as strong a bond with the twins as they do with each other. They always want to sleep all together on one bed.’ ‘Jenna . has been helped so much by her sisters. It has given her the goal and . incentives to keep up with them, which has helped her enormously.’ She added: ‘It may have been a shock to give birth to three babies in nine months, but I wouldn’t change it for the world.’ Mrs Singh is fundraising for Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Charity. She has just completed the London Marathon to raise funds. For more information about the charity visit www.cmftcharity.org.uk .","Cara Singh, four, became a big sister when she was nine months .

"If something seems to good to be true in a Facebook feed, is it? Well, when it comes to the portrayal of relationships in the social media sphere, the answer often - but not always - is yes, according to a new study. Research from Albright College in Pennsylvania has revealed that individuals high in Relationship Contingent Self-Esteem - a type of low self-esteem centered on how your relationship is going - are more inclined to post affectionate content, such as posts acknowledging 'the best boyfriend in the world' or other declarations of happiness. These people are also more likely to brag about their relationship, as well as monitor the Facebook activities of their partner. Scroll down for video . Self-conscious selfie? A new study from Albright College in Pennsylvania suggests these couples may use Facebook as a way to lessen their fears of rejection and anxiety within the relationship . 'These results suggest that those high in RCSE feel a need to show others, their partners and perhaps themselves that their relationship is ‘OK’ and, thus, they are OK,' said Albright assistant professor of psychology, Gwendolyn Seidman, Ph.D. Seidman's study, working with Albright alumna Amanda Havens,  surveyed a small group of volunteers in relationships ranging from one month to 30 years, according to The Atlantic. Participants were tested on their relationship-related Facebook habits, such as the tendency to post photos of each other and interact with their partner online. Additionally, the participants were tested on their personalities based on five traits known to psycologists as the 'Big Five': extroversion, neuroticism, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. The research shows that introverts were more likely to use Facebook to 'show off'. Previous studies suggest extroverts tend to be more active on social and have larger online networks. However Seidman said extroverts might be more comfortable to share information with people face-to-face, as opposed to introverts. Individuals high in neuroticism are also more likely to use Facebook to monitor their partner and show off their relationship. 'This is what we expected, given that neurotic individuals are generally more jealous in their romantic relationships,' Seidman said. Study: Participants were tested on their relationship-related Facebook habits, such as the tendency to post photos of each other and interact with their partner online . Other earlier studies concluded that people with a propensity to overshare online might 'just want to belong'. However Seidman was sure to point out that, based on her current research, Facebook bragging can be legitimate, according to Newswise. Often those declarations of happiness are just that. 'I think a lot of people think, ‘'Oh, it’s all phony'',' Seidman said. 'I think they'd be surprised to hear that it is associated with being genuinely happy in their relationships.'","New study from Albright College in Pennsylvania .

"Vicky with her son Connor aged 21 weeks. Doctors told her she could lose both twins but Connor survived . A mother-to-be who feared losing both her twins has told how she had to carry one in her womb for five weeks after it died to save the life of the other. Vicky Campbell, 27, suffered from twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome which caused one of her unborn babies to take in too many nutrients in the womb - starving his brother. Doctors warned both babies could die - with bigger baby Bailey growing too fast and tiny Connor being too small and weak as a result of the rare condition. They performed two risky operations to separate the twins, which resulted in Bailey's death at 22 weeks. Connor immediately began gaining strength and was born by Caesarean section at 27 weeks - the death of his bigger brother having saved his life. However, Vicky then went through the harrowing experience of giving birth to one live and one dead baby. The community carer from Helston, Cornwall, said: 'Bailey died to save his brother. 'As soon as he passed away, Connor was able to develop and grow strong, he finally had the blood and nutrients to survive. 'He is our little miracle. I will never let him forget how his big brother saved his life and is now his angel.' Vicky and husband Aiden Campbell, 26, an aircraft mechanic in the Royal Navy, were thrilled when she became pregnant in July last year. But she began to bleed in September and was rushed to an emergency scan at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Treliske, Cornwall - which showed she was expecting identical twins. A second routine scan two weeks later, on September 26, revealed the devastating news that she had twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. The condition, affecting one in 1,300 twin pregnancies, is a disease of the placenta where one twin takes in too many nutrients by receiving most of the blood supply from the placenta - starving the other. An ultrasound of Vicky Campbell's twins in November last year. The larger twin Bailey (on the right) perished in the womb but Vicky had to carry him to save Connor . Connor was born by caesarean section at 27 weeks . There was a fluid discrepancy between Vicky's babies, with Bailey taking up more nutrients than his younger brother. The problem became so bad that Vicky was forced to undergo laser treatment at St Michael's Hospital in Bristol on October 21, when she was 18 weeks pregnant. Vicky, who also has a son Sonni, six, added: 'We were given three options. The first was to terminate both twins, which we said 'no' straight away to. 'We were then offered the laser surgery, which had a 40 per cent chance one would survive, 30 per cent chance that both would and a 30 per cent chance that both would die. 'The third option was to leave it but there was an 85 per cent chance both would die and I would miscarry. We chose to take the laser option.' Incredibly, both babies survived the first procedure, in which doctors inserted a metal rod into Vicky's womb and used lasers to cut blood vessels between the twins. Vicky with her son Sonnie when she was pregnant with the twins (left) and today with Connor (right). She said: 'Bailey died to save his brother' Vicky and Aiden Campbell with their son. They don't know if Connor will have any healthy problems as a result of his early birth . Vicky and Aiden, who moved from Scotland to Cornwall four years ago, married on November 5, with Vicky feeling the effects of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. A scan two days after their wedding showed Connor had no fluid around him and was 'shrink wrapped' in his sac, while Bailey had lots with his heart overloading to keep up with it. Doctors made the decision to repeat the laser procedure for a second time but had to choose one twin to give more access to the placenta. Vicky began experiencing excruciating pains after the laser treatment and the next day doctors broke the devastating news that Bailey had died. She said: 'Words just cannot describe how horrendous it was when Bailey passed away, it was the worst day of my life. 'The doctors said there was a chance both babies would die but nothing can prepare you for it when it happens. 'I would wake up some mornings and just think 'I can't do this'. I had to stay strong for Connor but it was just so hard. 'Because I was so used to Bailey moving and not Connor I just had a massive dead weight in me. 'Connor started producing fluid for the first time and a bladder appeared for the first time too but it was so hard to get excited because I was so upset about losing Bailey. 'I don't know how I would have got through without Aiden and Sonni, they were fantastic.' Vicky and Aiden Campbell moments after Vicky gave birth on the 27th December . Intensive care: Connor moments after he was born . Vicky continued to carry both babies before giving birth to both by Caesarean section at 4.30am on December 31 at Southampton General Hospital. The twins were in separate sacs so were sterile from each other. She added: 'I was ten centimetres dilated and the nurse said she could feel feet of one moving baby and the hands of one that wasn't moving. 'It was horrendous carrying both of them. Every time Connor moved Bailey moved as well and I kept thinking that maybe he might be alive still.' Connor, weighing 1lb 14 oz, was rushed into intensive care while Bailey, who weighed just 210g, was taken to meet Vicky and Aiden. Doctors gave Connor a 70 per cent chance of survival but he battled through three months of intensive care and was allowed home on oxygen on March 26, four days before his due date. Now five months old, he weighs 8lb 11oz. It is not clear whether he will suffer any long term health implications.",'It was so hard to get excited because I was so upset about losing Bailey'
"A man has been charged after he posted photographs of himself on Facebook hugging a manatee, police said. Ryan William Waterman, 21, was arrested on Sunday after he put up pictures of himself hugging the animal and allowing two young children to sit on it. Waterman, from Fort Pierce, Florida was charged with trying to 'molest, harass, or disturb' a manatee which is an endangered species. Scroll down for video . Harmful: Ryan William Waterman, 21, was arrested after he posted this picture on Facebook of him embracing a manatee in Fort Pierce, Florida . Encouragement: Waterman also posted pictures of two young girls playing around with the manatee on Facebook . The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission filed the misdemeanor charge against Waterman after they were tipped off by an anonymous caller who had spotted the photos online. The 21-year-old also posted pictures of two young girls sitting on top of the manatee calf and petting the creature in the water. Waterman's attack on the manatee happened in January in St Lucie County, according to investigators. The wildlife commission told WPTV: 'An interaction that may seem harmless and innocent may ultimately have serious consequences for manatees and other wildlife.' Disgrace: Waterman encourages the little girl to touch the manatee which is an endangered species in Florida . Bad example: The 21-year-old man encouraged the children to stroke the manatee calf . Arrested: Waterman has been charged with a misdemeanor after being accused of harming a manatee . In November a woman was arrested in Florida for riding a manatee in Fort DeSoto Park. Ana Gloria Garcia Gutierrez, 53, has been charged with a misdemeanor and is out on bail. She told police that she was new to the area and wasn't aware that she had done anything wrong. Florida's Manatee Sanctuary Acts reads: 'It is unlawful for any person at any time, by any means, or in any manner intentionally or negligently to annoy, molest, harass, or disturb or attempt to molest, harass, or disturb any manatee.' The second-degree misdemeanor for harming a manatee carries up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine.","Ryan William Waterman, 21, charged with a misdemeanor in Florida .

"Sir Elton has known Lev, now six, since he tried to adopt him in 2009 (pictured). It is thought the singer helped rescue the Ukrainian boy and his family . Elton John is believed to have helped the rescue of a  six-year-old boy from the conflict in Ukraine. Lev Ageyev, six, his brother Artyom, seven, and their grandmother Yulia Ageyeva were rushed out of the  port city of Mariupol in a  460-mile dash arranged by  a foundation run by the singer’s close friend,  socialite Olena Franchuk. Sir Elton has known Lev since attempting to adopt  him in 2009. At the time he was unable to defy laws in Ukraine barring gay couples from adoption. Yesterday’s rescue mission took place as protesters in the city formed a human chain of more than 1,000 people demanding that  pro-Russian forces keep out. Last night, the singer’s representative declined to comment, but it is believed Sir Elton and his partner David Furnish were involved. Speaking from near Kiev, Mrs Ageyeva said: ‘I thank God for whoever helped us.’ The rescue came as EU leaders were scrambling last night to . bolster sanctions which have so far failed abysmally to halt the Russian . president’s determination – in Western eyes – to bully Ukraine into . remaining in his orbit. A key . concern is that he intends to use his military might to impose a new . ‘statelet’ within Ukraine called Novorossiya –  or New Russia. What . remains of Ukraine could be left with  no coastline if the plan goes . through. A diplomat said: ‘Putin is obsessed with Novorossiya, territory won for the Romanovs by Catherine the Great. He wants it back. 'But the . so-called rebels in this region of eastern Ukraine, who he praised for . keeping Kiev’s army at bay,  are his own soldiers, using his latest . military equipment. Let’s not fool ourselves about the acute dangers.’ Putin’s use of the Tsarist name of Novorossiya is sending shudders through Europe. While . it includes the Donetsk and Lugansk regions – at the epicentre of the . current unrest – it also includes such major cities as Kharkiv, Kherson . and Odessa.

"Tony Blair last night attacked ‘bizarre’ claims that his decision to go to war with Iraq in 2003 caused the current wave of violence in the  country – and blamed everyone but himself for the crisis. The former Prime Minister insisted he was right to topple Saddam Hussein with the US and said things would have been worse if the dictator had not been ousted from power a decade ago. Mr Blair ended a week-long silence after mounting claims by diplomats and Labour MPs that his and Mr Bush’s handling of the Iraq War sowed the seeds of the attempt by the Al Qaeda-backed ISIS terror group to conquer Iraq. In a 2,800-word ‘essay’ on the new Middle East conflagration, Mr Blair refused to apologise and argued: . Tony Blair, right, pictured alongside George W Bush, left claimed their handling of the Iraq war is not responsible for the current crisis facing the country . Defiant Mr Blair said he was determined to reply ‘forcefully’ to ‘inevitable’ claims about his record in Iraq following the rapid advance of ISIS. ‘I understand, following Afghanistan and Iraq, why public opinion was so hostile to involvement. ‘But every time we put off action, the action we will be forced to take will ultimately be greater. Instead of re-running the debate over Iraq from 11 years ago, we have to realise that whatever we had done or not done, we would be facing a big challenge today. ‘It is bizarre to claim that, but for the removal of Saddam, we would not have a crisis. We have to re-think our strategy towards Syria and support the Iraqi government in beating back the insurgency. ‘Extremist groups, whether in Syria or Iraq, should be targeted. However unpalatable this may seem, the alternative is worse.’ Mr Blair hit back at critics who say false claims that Saddam had deadly chemical weapons fatally undermined the Blair-Bush justification for the Iraq War. Turning the argument on its head, he said it was essential to picture Iraq with Saddam still in power: he had used chemical weapons before and would have done so again. Al Qaeda backed terrorists, pictured, are currently marching on Baghdad after major successes in northern Iraq . And, confronted by the ‘Arab Spring’ of 2011, Saddam would have provoked ‘a full-blown sectarian war across the region with national armies’. ‘We have to liberate ourselves from the notion that “we” have caused this – we haven’t,’ said Mr Blair. And he pointed the finger of blame at Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki – and more pointedly at Mr Obama – for leaving Iraq defenceless. ‘Three or four years ago, Al Qaeda in Iraq was a beaten force. The sectarianism of the Maliki government snuffed out a genuine opportunity to build a cohesive Iraq. And there will be debate about whether the withdrawal of US forces happened too soon.’ In response, residents of Baghdad, pictured, are preparing to defend their city against the terrorists approaching from the north . Mr Blair poured scorned on the West’s decision to topple Libya’s Colonel Gaddafi who ‘gave up WMDs and co-operated in the fight against terrorism’ while letting Syria’s President Assad, who ‘kills his people on a vast scale including with chemical weapons’, off the hook. ‘There is no easy or painless  solution. The Jihadist groups are never going to leave us alone. 9/11 happened for a reason. ‘This is, in part, our struggle, whether we like it or not.’ Obama was ‘right to put all options on the table in Iraq, including military strikes. The choices are all pretty ugly, but Syria is slowly but surely wrapping its cords around us, pulling us down with it. We have to act now to save the future.’ Reg Keys, whose ‘Red Cap’ soldier son Tom was killed in the Iraq War, told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘I wondered when Blair would surface to try to justify himself. Before he and Bush kicked down the door on Iraq, Sunnis and Shias lived side by side. Now there is a power vacuum, which allows terrorists to walk into the country. ‘Saddam may have been an evil dictator, but Iraq needs a strong leader to keep the tensions in check. Blair installed a weak puppet government. When Tom was killed, the Iraqi police meant to be protecting the Red Caps’ position dropped their guns and ran. That is what the Iraqi forces did this week.’ Mr Keys added: ‘It is lamentable that Blair is still banging the WMD drum. He and Bush must take ultimate responsibility.’","Former PM claims bungling Iraqi government has allowed Al Qaeda return .

"A South Park commercial that aired on Sunday during the Washington-Philadelphia Eagles game shines a humorous new light on the controversial team name the Washington Redskins. The commercial which aired only in Washington D.C. seems to be an attempt by the creators of South Park to share their negative opinion of the team's refusal to change their name now that as of June, the name Redskins is no longer a protected trademark, reports The Huffington Post. In the commercial, Eric Cartman runs a business under the Washington Redskins name. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Devil's advocate: Eric Cartman of South Park has taken over the Washington Redskins' name to the cartoon version of team owner Dan Snyder's chagrin . Doesn't feel respected: In the cartoon commercial aired only to Washington D.C. during the Washington-Philadelphia Eagles game, Dan Snyder tells Cartman to stop using their team name . The cartoon version of the Redskins owner Dan Snyder tells Cartman to stop using the name 'in the name of decency.' A federal trademark board ruled in June that the Washington Redskins nickname is 'disparaging of Native Americans' and that the team's trademark protections should be canceled, a decision that applies new financial and political pressure on the team to change its name. The Redskins quickly announced that they would appeal and fight to keep their name. In the South Park episode Snyder calls Cartman's use of their teams name 'derogatory.' 'I have total respect for you,' Cartman insists, playing Devil's advocate. 'When I named my company Washington Redskins it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people.' 'I don't feel very respected,' retorts a cartoon version of a Redskins player. The chorus of critics against the use of the name has grown over the past year. In June, a major sector of the United Church of Christ voted to urge its 40,000 members to boycott the Redskins. Half of the U.S. Senate recently wrote letters to the NFL urging a change, one of the letters stating that 'racism and bigotry have no place in professional sports.' D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray suggested Wednesday the name will almost certainly have to change if the team ever wants to build a new stadium in the city. Snyder, who has vowed repeatedly never to change the name. Redskins players have mostly avoided the topic, aware of a potential conflict because they are employed by the team. 'Daniel Snyder may be the last person in the world to realize this,' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on the Senate floor, 'but it is just a matter of time until he is forced to do the right thing.' The commercial got mixed reviews in Washington with Twitter users like Tyler Windover calling it, 'trash.' Other Twitter users like Sean Bishop liked it and said, ' LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO well-played.'

"There are a lot of snobs in football who look down their noses at players like Lee Cattermole. Against Chelsea, the Sunderland man was magnificent. I spoke to Gus Poyet on Sky’s Saturday Night Football after the game and he was waxing lyrical about the job Cattermole does for the team. With his black boots on and his fighting style, he’s an old-school player. He scraps for every ball but his reputation precedes him. His disciplinary record is poor, but that comes from playing on the edge. VIDEO Scroll down for Lee Catermole wins the North East FWA Player of the Year award . Sunderland's Lee Cattermole vies for the ball with Chelsea central midfielder Cesc Fabregas . Cattermole collected the North East Football Writers' Player of the Year award on Sunday evening . One thing is for certain: he’s not one for the purists. We are not blessed with many top defensive midfielders in this country but Cattermole is more than holding his own against some of Europe’s best this season. Our table below shows how defensively he is matching the likes of Sergio Busquets and Daniele de Rossi. I’m not saying he is at the same level as them, but he should not be dismissed out of hand. Against Chelsea he showed he can perform against the very best. Some people will never be convinced, but if he can curb that aggression then maybe even bigger things lie ahead.

Lee Cattermole is not the only Englishman who might feel overlooked by his country. Mark Noble is West Ham’s Mr Consistent. You would do well to find a player in the Premier League who gives more for his team than Noble, but he’s a quality player, too. He’s another who does not jump out as an obvious talent but he does an excellent job in a team that is going places this season. He will have seen Stewart Downing head off for England duty and Fabian Delph and Jack Colback have been called up recently. Noble might rightly be wondering when it will be his turn. Mark Noble is another midfielder who is pushing Roy Hodgson for an England call-up . Frank gunning for Chelsea . Frank Lampard's move to Man City raised a few eyebrows, but it’s been a move that has benefited both parties. Aside from his equaliser against his old club, the deal has not really hampered Chelsea and it has certainly helped City.

Lampard's shot flew past Maya Yoshida and Fraser Forster before hitting the back of the net . After scoring at Southampton he now has 174 PL goals — one behind Thierry Henry. That is an incredible record. No doubt he’s looking forward to his American adventure but right now he will be focused on one thing: hunting down Chelsea. He’ll say all the right things in public but make no mistake, Frank is a winner. He’d love nothing more than to help City beat Chelsea to the title.

"A mother and her nine-year-old daughter are fighting for life after both being struck down with the same potentially-fatal tumour condition. Anna Hillman, 33, contracted cavernoma - clusters of abnormal blood vessels - just three months after her daughter Madi was diagnosed with the condition for the second time. The brave schoolgirl is now fighting for survival yet again after the condition, which is extremely rare in children, left her with a tumour on her brain stem. Anna Hillman, 33, and her daughter Madison, 9, are both are suffering from the rare and potentially fatal condition cavernoma . The condition, called brain stem genetic cavernoma, causes oversized blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord that can lead to life-threatening strokes or seizures . The mother and daughter describe their condition as a 'ticking time bomb' because neither know what their outcome will be. Mrs Hillman, a horse breeder, said: 'It is an extremely rare condition, particularly in children. Madi is now in a position where she will either die or they will operate, obviously we hope it is the latter. 'We are in a position where, when it gets bigger to about 3cm, she dies [from a haemorrhage]. At the moment it is small, but essentially, Madi is a ticking time bomb. 'As for me, I know I have at least one tumour in my temple lobe which is a dangerous place to have them, and I have one growing at the back of my head. 'The symptoms include seizures and strokes, so I know at some point I will experience that, I already quite often wake up with my left side is numb.' The condition is genetic, meaning that Madi's three siblings, Jack, 14, Georgia, seven, and Charlie, two, will also have to undergo brain scans. They have a 50 per cent chance of developing the condition . Madi was first diagnosed with the brain . stem genetic cavernoma, which causes oversized blood vessels in the . brain and spinal cord that can lead to life-threatening strokes or . seizures, at the age of five. Cavernomas are clusters of abnormal blood vessels found mainly in the brain and spinal cord. They vary in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres across. Every year one person in every 400,000 thousand is diagnosed with a cavernoma that is causing symptoms. They can run in families - every child of someone with inherited cavernomas has a 50 per cent chance of inheriting the condition. Nine out of ten cases are not inherited. The average age of diagnosis is 40. Symptoms include seizures, strokes, weakness, slurred speech, numbness, migraines and double vision. The main form of treatment is surgery. The tiny youngster collapsed and suffered such a huge stroke that doctors had to wait 10 days before carrying out an operation - which only had a two per cent chance of survival. But despite beating all the odds for the operation and leading two of years of 'normal' life, her symptoms returned for a second time just before Christmas last year. Her desperate family are now pleading with friends and relatives to help raise money to take Madi to a clinic in Chicago after her doctors said they had run out of options. 'Time is not on our side at the moment - we know how quickly this grows from when she was five,' said Mrs Hillman. 'We need to find some solution. Nobody will ever accept their child will die and if there is any way we can try and give Madi the longest future we will.' But as she fought for her daughter's survival, she too was diagnosed with the deadly condition and has been told she faces an inevitable operation. She said: 'It has had a massive impact . on my life. I live with constant migraines, headaches, short term memory . loss, falling numb on one side of my body. 'I need to be fit and healthy and fighting for Madi, so I'm so frustrated to be fighting for myself.' Mrs Hillman said: 'I'm so frustrated I have to be fighting for myself because I need to be fit and healthy and fighting for Madi' In a further devastating development, the family - who are originally from Clutton, Somerset, but now run a gîte in the south of France - were told the condition is genetic. That means Madi's three siblings, Jack, 14, Georgia, seven, and Charlie, two, will also have to undergo brain scans. They have been told they have a 50 per cent chance of contracting the condition. 'When it first happened Madi was completely paralysed,' said Mrs Hillman, who is married to property developer Tim, 33. 'We had got to a stage before where she had the operation and was starting to go back to school, but by Christmas she had really gone downhill again. 'She had the symptoms of a mini stroke, she was constantly falling over and she had headaches every day. 'The cavernoma attaches itself all around our veins, they are not cancerous so there is no radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment that can help them. 'The gene I carry means it is a very aggressive and it does grow and bleed at an impressive rate. 'The children understand and are aware of it, they expected to be tested but I don't think it has truly sunk in for them. 'Once reality sets in it will be tough, we give them the best possible life outside of the hospital, we just try and keep life as normal as we possibly can.

But when he applied to the Ivy League school, he was accepted and given a free scholarship . A junior engineering student at Harvard has written a touching essay about the moment an admissions counselor told him he could go to school for free, despite his status as an illegal immigrant. It wasn't until high school, at the age of 16, that Dario Guerrero  discovered he was living in the country illegally and a community college he was taking courses at called up to ask about his invalid social security number. 'Son, we overstayed our visa when you were three. You don’t have a social security number,' he recalled his mother saying, in an essay for the Washington Post. The southern California resident and another undocumented friend named Oscar then began their quest to find a college that would accept them, and give them the financial aid their families needed. While most schools will accept illegal immigrants, financial aid is trickier since, at the time, you needed a social security number in order to receive federal grants. Dario and Oscar's only choices then were private schools, and specifically those few 'need-blind' schools which would give them enough aid so as not to bankrupt their families. Near the end of high school, when Dario was preparing to apply to schools, he took a trip to several East Coast colleges and most of the counselors he met with encouraged him to apply. However, he had his sights on MIT and was let down when the counselor told him it would be nearly impossible to be admitted. The counselor told Dario that the only way the school admitted undocumented students was as international students. In order to qualify as an international student, Dario would be required to leave the country and then re-enter the U.S. through an international border. Having lived in the country illegally nearly all of his life, Dario certainly would have been stopped from re-entering the U.S., so he knew that wasn't an option. But things started to turn up when he wandered over to a nearby Ivy League campus. 'My dream crushed, I left the office in a daze and started walking down Massachusetts Avenue. Without really planning it, I found myself in the middle of Harvard. 'Since I was there, I found the Admissions and Financial Aid office and walked in to tell them the truth, too. An officer agreed to see me. My meeting was brief, but it suddenly reversed all the self-doubt. Second choice: Guerrero's dream school was MIT, but the school wouldn't accept him unless he left the country and came back as an international student. Instead, he walked over to Harvard's campus (pictured) and found he was welcome there, no matter his immigration status . '“If you are admitted to Harvard College,” she said, “we will meet your full financial need without regard to your legal status.” Dario applied and a few months later received the joyous news that he had been admitted and qualified for a full-ride scholarship. While the university doesn't require a social security number for financial aid, it does ask for some evidence of income. His parents had filed taxes every year, so he was able to submit that and no further questions were asked. 'This meant I wouldn’t have to worry about student loans or quarterly tuition payments; that I always had a place to stay away from home; that I could travel every semester, on Harvard’s dime, back to California; that my parents would never have to worry whether I’d finish school. Those are luxuries few people, documented or not, ever have,' he wrote. Dario admits that his situation is rare in the undocumented community, that there are others just as bright as him who can't attend college because their parents never filled out taxes, or if they can, must hold down multiple jobs just to keep up with the payments. While this is the burden of undocumented children, he also identifies with his parents' choice to break the immigration rules. Dario writes about attending a recent Harvard-Yale football game where his fellow Crimson supporters held up signs reading 'We are the 6.2 per cent' referring to the low admission rate. 'The opportunity to one day join the 6.2 percent (or the 1 percent, or even just the 100 percent of legal residents who live without fear of deportation) is worth crossing the border for.' Guerrero is currently studying visual and environmental studies at the Cambridge, Massachusetts school. He also co-directed the film 'A Dream Deferred' about  four undocumented students at Harvard.","Dario Guerrero found out he was an illegal immigrant at the age of 18 .

"More than 300 British troops will leave Sierra Leone in the coming weeks – halving the strength of the Armed Forces’ medical mission in the ebola-hit country. The remaining soldiers will stay until there are no more cases of the deadly disease, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon insisted – even if it takes until the end of the year. Around 700 troops and a medical ship were deployed to the West African nation in October to help the country battle the outbreak. Around 700 troops and a medical ship were deployed to the West African nation in October to help the country battle the outbreak . More than 300 British troops will leave Sierra Leone in the coming weeks – halving the strength of the Armed Forces’ medical mission in the ebola-hit country. Michael Fallon is pictured talking to servicemen . The ship – RFA Argus – carried medical supplies and three cargo helicopters that have been used to reach more remote corners of Sierra Leone. But the Argus will sail back to Britain with half of the troops next month. Mr Fallon, who toured the ship this week, said: ‘We are now getting on top of ebola – the number of cases are dropping away. ‘I shudder to think what would have happened if we had not put that effort in. We could have seen that plague spreading out of West Africa, spreading across the continent and, indeed, spreading into Europe and threatening us back in Britain.’ Sierra Leone is the UK’s biggest military deployment – but from next month the numbers deployed to combat Islamic State jihadists will be higher. Civilian contractors will help the remaining troops in Sierra Leone. More than 11,000 ebola cases have been reported there in the past year. The latest figures show 76 new cases in the first week of February. Yesterday an NHS worker evacuated from Sierra Leone at the weekend was being monitored in a British hospital after being splashed in the eye with bodily fluid from a victim. Mr Fallon said the President of Sierra Leone, Ernest Bai Koroma, told him the country would not have been able to ‘get on top’ of the disease without the UK, adding it was a ‘game changer’. RFA Argus (pictured) has been vital in providing support to communities onshore in the region . He told crew of RFA Argus: ‘You have given this country the reassurance that it needed, you have prevented panic and in return of course you have prevented this disease from striking the streets of Britain.’ He said he was ‘proud’ of those on the ship, including those ‘returning home next month’, who had been working over Christmas to tackle the disease. RFA Argus has been vital in providing support to communities onshore in the region. There are also six British-funded medical facilities across Sierra Leone, which UK troops, health workers and aid workers are helping to run. Those 300 or so on the ground will remain until the fight against Ebola has been won, Mr Fallon said. But those on the ship would return home, leaving the remaining work to civilian contractors, it is understood. He told the Mail: ‘It is far too early to claim victory over Ebola and in the last few cases it becomes much harder because people get complacent. ‘We’ve got some very hard weeks and months ahead. Five cases is too many – five cases can lead to a sudden explosion again. ‘We will keep rotating the brigades through until we can absolutely say Ebola has been defeated.’ He added: ‘We could be here until the Autumn, we could be here until the rest of the year.’ District coordinator Raymond Kabia, of the area of Port Loko, where British troops have been working, said: ‘We are going through a bumpy landing. Out of the 11 chiefdoms, only two still have cases of Ebola. ‘We certainly hope that by the first and second week of March we should be completely free of Ebola in this district.’ The remaining soldiers will stay until there are no more cases of the deadly disease, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon (pictured) insisted – even if it takes until the end of the yea . He said the district had gone from seeing 80 new Ebola cases a day down to just one or two after the British came in to help. He added: ‘We hope that before the UK leave, that process of flushing the sick people out will be complete and I am sure before they leave it will be. ‘They leave us with zeros and we are going to stay with zeros. The first two weeks in March we should be zero then and the British can leave then.’ Speaking from RFA Argus, Captain David Buck said: ‘I think there is a willingness amongst the Sierra Leone people to recover their country when this is all over and so in the military we are looking to gradually regress and transfer that responsibility to civilian means.’ He said the ship had ‘provided visual reassurance for the people of Sierra Leone’. Earl Kingston, 37, Cornwall: added: Throughout my career, I have done anti-piracy, I’ve done anti-submarine, I’ve been in the Gulf.. ‘It was very, very different but certainly it was the most rewarding deployment I have done by a long way. Speaking of the departure, he added: ‘As we start to drawdown and we return home then it will become more autonomous with a civilian community. ‘As the military we have taken a back seat and we have provided the logistics and now we are just going to hand over to the civilian contractors who will take it on from there.’","Remaining soldiers to stay until there are no more cases of deadly disease .

"It was the ‘best feeling in the world’ for Helen Conway when she discovered she was expecting her first baby. But after the birth of daughter Amelia, her joy was shattered when it emerged she had developed a rare form of cancer that only occurs during pregnancy. Miss Conway, a consultant for a bank, was diagnosed with choriocarcinoma which affects fewer than 20 women a year in the UK. Back in her arms: Helen Conway, 38, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, overcame a rare type of cancer while she was pregnant with her daughter Amelia, now two . It develops in the placenta when cells that were part of a normal pregnancy become cancerous and spread to other parts of the body. The cause is not known and it can develop months or even years after pregnancy, making it difficult to diagnose. ‘I don’t think any woman considers that cancer might be a risk of pregnancy,’ said Miss Conway, 38, of Halifax, West Yorkshire. Shock: Miss Conway pictured during her chemotherapy treatment in March 2012 . ‘It was terrifying. I’d just brought a baby into the world and I feared what would happen to her if I didn’t beat it.’ The cancer was only spotted nine months after Miss Conway gave birth when she began coughing blood. It took four months of chemotherapy before she was given the all-clear. ‘Hearing that you have cancer must . always be terrifying, but I would definitely consider getting pregnant . again because the cancer is so rare and you should never let anything . hold you back. 'The pregnancy left me with my lovely daughter Amelia so I . don’t regret anything.’ Amelia, now aged two, was born healthy in December 2010, having been conceived naturally with Miss Conway’s former partner. But . the new mother experienced bleeding for six months after the birth, . then in April 2011 took a pregnancy test which came back positive. She . went for a scan which showed there was no pregnancy and, because of the . continued bleeding, she presumed she had suffered a miscarriage. Unbeknown to her, the cancer caused her body to release the HCG hormone, which made the pregnancy test positive. Six months later she started to cough up . blood. After visiting her doctor, she was told it was probably just a . burst blood vessel. When her coughing got worse, she went to . the out of hours doctor at the hospital, who referred her for a chest . x-ray. The results revealed she had black spots on her lungs. Illness: Miss Conway, pictured while pregnant, discovered she had cancer when Amelia, pictured aged one month, was only nine months old . Green days: Miss Conway was given the all clear in January 2012, four moths after she was diagnosed with the rare cancer . ‘I was terrified it would be lung cancer. It’s all I could think about and I was worried about Amelia. I didn’t want her to grow up without a mother,’ she said. She was diagnosed in September 2011, and the cancer had spread to her liver and lungs. She said: ‘I was diagnosed when Amelia was less than a year old and as the consultant delivered the devastating news thoughts flashed through my mind of what would happen if the cancer was terminal. ‘I was completely shocked when I heard my cancer had been caused by my pregnancy. However, I tried to look on the bright side.’ Because the cancer is so rare, treatment was only available in three hospitals in the UK. She had to travel 50 miles to Weston Park Hospital in Sheffield to undergo chemotherapy for two nights every fortnight. Miss Conway was given the all-clear in January 2012. ‘I’m so relieved, now I have time to focus on my daughter and move on with my life,’ she added. A Cancer Research UK spokesman said: ‘More than 90 per cent of women diagnosed with choriocarcinoma make a full recovery.","Helen Conway, 38, developed choriocarcinoma expecting Amelia, now two .

"'Wicked' robber Robert Ziga who wrenched a treasured engagement ring from an elderly stroke victim as she lay helpless in her hospital bed has been jailed for five years . A thief who ripped an engagement ring from an elderly  woman's finger as she lay in a hospital bed has been jailed for five years. Robert Ziga, 29, was told he had committed a crime that was 'distinctively abhorrent'. The Slovakian had prowled a cancer ward for 90 minutes as he sought a  suitable victim, before strolling into  75-year-old Christine Brown's private room unchallenged. She initially mistook him for her son and affectionately reached out to him, but screamed when she realised what was happening. The thief fled down a fire escape with Mrs Brown's diamond engagement ring, which she had worn for 52 years, and mobile phone as staff alerted by the screams gave chase. Both of the items were later recovered by police. Bradford Crown Court heard that when officers brought the ring to Mrs Brown's Bradford home to check it was the right one, her husband John, 75, kissed it through the evidence bag. Ziga admitted robbery and was jailed for five years and four months. Judge Robert Bartfield told him that his crime had left Mrs Brown traumatised. 'She had been petrified you were going to hurt her,' he said. 'You were too strong for her. 'I regard the invasion of a room in hospital just as serious as [that of] a person's own home. 'This is where they go to recuperate, away from thieving hands like yours. 'As a matter of policy it must be made clear those who steal from hospital patients can expect long sentences.' Robert Ziga cased Bradford Royal Infirmary before robbing 75-year-old Christine Brown of her treasured engagement ring . Mrs Brown had been in hospital for almost a month after falling at home. Due to her poor health, she was placed on the cancer ward despite not having the disease. She had earlier had two strokes and had significant mobility problems, with little movement on the right side of her body. The incident in Bradford Royal Infirmary in January had a detrimental effect on her health and led to her being critically ill, her son Damian said. When she showed improvement in May she had to be placed near the nurses' station in a rehabilitation centre so that she would feel safe. Before the theft, Ziga was seen looking into the rooms on ward 15 where Mrs Brown had been recovering. He struck once she was alone. Judge Bartfield told him: 'This lady was left in huge distress, not surprisingly. 'Goodness knows what thoughts went through her mind when this was happening. 'This offence is not unique, but very distinctive in the abhorrence that everybody must feel for what you chose to do to that lady.' Nigel Hamilton, defending, agreed: 'This was an abhorrent offence. It was mean and  wicked. Members of the public will quite naturally be appalled.' Christine Brown was left 'crying and shaking' after thief Robert Ziga left her in her private room on the cancer ward at Bradford Royal Infirmary . However, he said Ziga made a full admission to police and told them where the ring  could be found. Ziga, a drug addict, came to the UK in  2004 with his wife and daughter, now aged 11. He had received convictions for dishonesty since arriving in the UK, and had a criminal record for minor offences dating back to when he was 17. Detective Constable Richard Oxley of Bradford South CID welcomed his jail sentence. 'This was a heartless and despicable act committed against an elderly patient at her most vulnerable,' he said outside court. 'Ziga displayed greed  when most would have shown compassion, inflicting only further strain on his victim's health.' A spokesman for the Bradford Teaching Hospitals  NHS Foundation Trust defended security measures at its hospital. 'We would like to reassure patients that this was an isolated incident and we encourage staff, patients and visitors to be vigilant at all times and report any suspicious behaviour,' they said.","Robert Ziga staked out Bradford Royal Infirmary for more than 90 minutes .

"The lighting of the Olympic cauldron at last night's opening ceremony was, if nothing else, wonderfully unique. The giant flame's design was so sophisticated the studio where it was crafted looked more like James Bond's gadget workshop, its architect revealed today. Thomas Heatherwick said he was pleasantly surprised when the idea to have 204 separate petals come together to form one giant flame got . the go-ahead from a range of officials including Prime minister David . Cameron and London 2012 chairman Lord Coe. Scroll down for video . Complex: The design of the Olympic cauldron was so sophisticated it was made in a workshop that look more akin to James Bond's gadget workshop . Spectacular: It may be far smaller and lighter than previous cauldrons, bu there can be no denying the impact the flame had at the opening ceremony . Going green: Each of the 204 petals is fuelled by natural gas, which means energy consumption can be reduced significantly and the flame will still burn brightly . Measuring just 8.5 metres high and weighing 16 tonnes, it is far smaller and lighter than ones from previous events. The one lit in Beijing four years ago weighed a staggering 300 tonnes. Mr Heatherwick, who developed it at his Heatherwick Studio in Kings Cross, London, said: 'We were aware cauldrons had been getting bigger, higher, fatter as each Olympics happened and we felt we shouldn't try to be even bigger than the last ones. 'This incredible event has 204 nations coming together, so we had a child from each country bringing these copper polished objects in. 'At the end of the Games, this cauldron will dismantle itself and radiate back down to the ground and each of those copper pieces take away by each nation and put in a national Olympic cabinet somewhere.' Blooming marvellous: This series of photographs shows each of the 204 copper and steel petals of the Olympic cauldron being lit before being lifted up to form one giant flame . The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (Locog) requested the flame be powered by natural gas, which is pumped individually through the stems of each petal. A spokeswoman told MailOnline: 'The multiple burners means that the burn-rate is flexible. 'The gas flow can be reduced very significantly - this means we can reduce our gas consumption from 100 per cent down to 15 per cent. 'We are constantly monitoring the flow rate to ensure the minimum quantity of gas is burned.' Locog is also working with energy company EDF to see that all of the carbon emissions will be offset. Intricate engineering has gone into the design to ensure the flame does not go out, in any 'unforeseen circumstances' it will relit by the 'mother flame' kindled in Olympia, Greece. The copper petals, created to be 'very small and humble objects', were made using traditionally skilled craftsmen of the sort who used to roll sheet metal to make body parts for car makers such as Bentley, according to Mr Heatherwick. He said: 'It is like the biggest gadget that anyone can make in a shed but this shed is the most sophisticate shed in Harrogate. 'It was like the Bond gadget workshop.' More than a billion people who watched globally along with the 70,000-plus crowd inside the stadium saw the unique petals being carried by each of the children as they accompanied each Olympic team into the stadium for the athletes' parade. The rods which make up the stem of the cauldron are made of stainless steel with a heat and acid treatment that makes it a colour called bad black, which is actually slightly blue. The petals are copper and the entire structure is about 8.5 metres tall and will be moved from the centre of the stadium overnight tomorrow. It will move to the end of the stadium where the huge bell was struck to signal the start of the opening ceremony. Like the cauldron the London 1948 organisers used when the Olympics were last staged in the capital, the cauldron will stay alight inside the stadium rather than being pitched above it. The cauldron design team used the fact that the athletes' parade is a long event, lasting at least 90 minutes, to retrieve the elements from the centre of the parade and discreetly fix them to specific spots on the cauldron. Practice had to be done at night as the lighting of the cauldron had to be kept secret.Rehearsals were held in the north of England, but were switched to the stadium nearer to the grand event. Mr Heatherwick said: 'It had to stay a . secret. We had to wait until the dancers had gone home so it was about . 3am - that was the time that it (the stadium) was available for use to . use.' The seven teenage . up-and-coming athletes who made up the final torchbearers had 45 seconds . to light the cauldron. There was then a 45-second wait before it all . lifted into place. By the . time the first ring was in place the last one was lifting and coming . together. 'So it was like a dandelion seed being blown - but it seemed . to work, which was a huge relief,' Mr Heatherwick said. Mr . Heatherwick said he and artistic director Danny Boyle, the mastermind . behind the opening ceremony, wanted something that was not about being . bigger than the last Olympic cauldron, in Beijing, but was about the . people involved in bringing it together. This is one of the reasons why is was set in the centre of the stadium with the parading athletes surrounding it. He . said: 'We were thinking about this incredible object with 204 nations . coming together. It was a challenge but it did not feel enough to design . a different shaped bowl.' Historic moment: Five-time Olympic gold medal rower Steve Redgrave carries the Olympic flame into the opening ceremony for the start of ritual lighting of the cauldron . Break from tradition: Flames are handed to seven young athletes nominated by past champions to light the cauldron's petals . The . cauldron will be split up at the end of the Games and each piece will . be returned to a competing national Olympic committee (NOC). Mr . Heatherwick said: 'The cauldron will dismantle itself and come back to . the ground. These pieces will be taken away by the NOC. 'They will be these heated elements, maybe they will get buffed, but everyone will have a piece.' Heatherwick Studio was established in 1994 by Mr Heatherwick, an Honorary Fellow of the RIBA and a Senior Fellow at the Royal College of Art. He is the recipient of honorary . doctorates from four British universities – Sheffield Hallam, Brighton, . Dundee and Manchester Metropolitan. He . has won the Prince Philip Designers Prize and, in 2006, was the . youngest practitioner to be appointed a Royal Designer for Industry. Unique creation: Artist Thomas Heatherwick (pictured), who designed the cauldron, said he wanted to create a smaller flame than one used in previous years . He . has served on numerous judging and advisory panels and has given . lectures, tutorials and talks at the Bartlett School of Architecture, . London’s Victoria and Albert Museum and Yale University. The opening ceremony, put together by . Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle, had been cut to three hours to . ensure athletes did not get stranded and left unable to get home. It was only when organisers put the final rehearsals together that they realised it would run too late for public transport. But some viewers were miffed that it still didn't finish until gone 12.30am. Ben Wilson tweeted: 'A great opening ceremony for @Olympics last night. But I am very tired this morning as it was a late finish.' Darren Huckerby ‏added: 'Not a bad opening Ceremony, late finish though!' Olympics Minister Hugh Robertson previously denied the cut had been forced because of problems with the G4S security firm who failed to employ enough guards for the Games.

"A Colombian politician has slammed singer Shakira for ‘promoting lesbianism’ in her latest music video for her collaboration with Rihanna.

"Arsene Wenger launched a passionate defence of his Arsenal reign after supporters called on him to quit on Saturday. Danny Welbeck ensured the Gunners left the Hawthorns with their first Premier League win since November 1. But that didn’t stop some disgruntled fans making their feelings towards Wenger abundantly clear, despite his team dominating most of the game against West Bromwich Albion. VIDEO Scroll down for Arsene Wenger angry over question about 'Wenger Out' banners . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger (left) cut a frustrated figure on the touchline at the Hawthorns on Saturday . After the final whistle, a group of fans revealed a large banner that read: ‘Arsene, thanks for the memories but it’s time to say goodbye.’ Another read: ‘Enough is enough, Wenger out.’ But Wenger insists he is the man lead to lead Arsenal forward, saying: ‘I can do my job, I do my job with total commitment. ‘I would like you to live with me and see for seven days what kind of work we produce, and you will see that it is total commitment. Some disgruntled Arsenal fans held out a banner suggesting manager Wenger should resign . ‘Am I hurt by any of the criticism? No. Honestly, no.’ Following a string of disappointing defensive displays, Arsenal have now secured two clean sheets in a row. Wenger has been criticised for sticking to his attacking principles when his side’s defensive flaws have been exposed. Danny Welbeck's strike secured Arsenal's first Premier League win since November 1 . But the Arsenal manager rejected that view, saying: ‘I started to manage a team at the top level in 1983; if I am completely useless tactically, I am a genius — I can hide it very well.’ Meanwhile, fit-again Olivier Giroud says he can be part of a deadly attacking trio for Arsenal. He made his first league start this season after recovering from a broken ankle. Wenger’s 4-2-3-1 system means there is room for only one striker in his team. But Giroud insists Danny Welbeck, Alexis Sanchez and he can all play together. Borussia Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp (left) has been linked with the top job at Arsenal in recent weeks . ‘Unfortunately we have had injuries like Jack (Wilshere) and other players, but I am taking a lot of pleasure from being back,’ he said. ‘It is good, sometimes, for your mental strength to go through this and this is why I am stronger. It was a real test. When you are far away from the pitch it is tough.’ Wenger is adamant he can lead Arsenal through their difficult spell in the Premier League .","Arsenal prevailed 1-0 against West Brom on Saturday .

"A British tourist suffering from bipolar disorder spent more than £147,000 during a week-long shopping spree in a Spanish city. Shopkeepers said the man, who had a British passport, was walking from store to store in the northern town of Santander, demanding to 'buy everything'. According to the Diario Montanes newspaper, he bought more than 30 bags of food from 'Diferente' - a gourmet delicatessen - leaving the shop's shelves virtually empty. Shopping spree: The British tourist bought more than 30 bags of food from a gourmet delicatessen in the Spanish city . Sold out: British man suffering from bipolar left the shop's shelves empty during the week-long shopping spree . Staff began boxing up all his purchases as he walked around choosing items while drinking cognac straight from a £260 bottle he had picked up from the shelf. The British man is believed to have paid £7,500 on a credit card as an upfront payment, assuring staff he would settle the rest of the bill later. He then arranged for some of his purchases to be taken back to his hotel where management were forced to assign him a separate room for all his goods. He went back to the shop and continued to pick things out until the shelves were left empty. Staff had to tell him to stop when the shop closed at midnight by which time he'd racked up a bill of £147,000. Confronted with this total, he told staff in English that he didn't have any more money on him but that he just needed to go back to England and his son would give him the money in cash. Dream customer: The man took some of his purchases back to his hotel where he rented a new room to sore them . Strange: This tobacco shop worker eventually called police after the man walked out of his shop with a £20 Cuban cigar without paying . The man also bought 17 pairs of shoes costing £1,300 from Kawasaki - a fashionable footwear store - and spent £600 on cigars and Indian figures in a tobacconist. He became the talk of the town and was also said to have visited the tourist office where he flirted with staff and enquired about booking a table at the exclusive Cañadío restaurant. The extravagant spree finally came to an end when he walked out of a shop with a £20 Cuban cigar in his mouth without paying. The worker who served him told ABC news: 'He lit one in the shop. I told him he couldn't do that inside so he walked out with it in his mouth without paying.' The man was arrested by police and taken to Valdecilla Hospital's psychiatric unit where he underwent a month of intensive treatment. Doctors eventually diagnosed him as having suffered from an extreme bipolar episode. The hospital paid for him to return to England on a Ryanair flight on July 26.","Seen walking from store to store demanding to 'buy everything'

"A D-Day veteran left for dead on a Normandy battlefield has unearthed a haunting letter that prematurely informed his family of his death. Private Bill Ward's superiors thought he'd been killed when they found him lying unconscious and covered in blood after a mortar bomb exploded and he was peppered with shrapnel. His unit was making its way back to Caen, following several hours of fighting, having earlier landed on the beach in Normandy as part of June 6, 1944's allied invasion of northern France. Back from the dead: Private Bill Ward's superiors sent his family a letter telling them he'd been killed in D-Day landings in France in June 1944 after finding him unconscious. Mr Ward is pictured holding the letter (left), and as a 19-year-old soldier (right) With the blood-soaked 19-year-old motionless, his commander Sergeant George Smith assumed the worst before running for cover. But fortune shone on the recent conscript, who was scooped up by the medical corps and awoke the following day in a Folkestone hospital. Deafened in one ear, he immediately wrote to his parents to give them the good news of his survival. But Sergeant Smith, believing his comrade had been killed, had also written to his family to share his sorrow at the news. It was only when his mother died, in 1988, that Mr Ward found the letter - and which the 87-year-old is now considering donating to his local museum in Dorking, Surrey. Bizarrely, Private Ward fought alongside Sergeant Smith again later on in the war, when Ward rejoined B Company of the 1st Battalion Royal Norfolk Regiment. Historic: Private Ward was injured as allied troops landed on the beaches in Normandy in June 1944. Omaha Beach is pictured secured after D-Day . An astonished Sgt Smith described the unexpected reunion as like 'seeing a ghost'. But the pair never spoke about the note home that detailed how Ward had been buried in a tiny French village. Although his mother never mentioned the letter, Mr Ward said he felt sure his own had arrived first. 'When I found that letter it shook me,' he said. 'I had never seen it. It was brilliant that I got my letter in before he did. 'Had it been the other way round, I don't know what would have happened.' Triumphant: After landing at the shore, these British troops wait for the signal to move forward, during the initial Allied landing operations in Normandy, France, on June 6, 1944 . Private Ward survived the war despite suffering a second injury in October 1944 and experiencing a fierce battle at Pavie, near Chjnedolli, where his comrade Corporal Sidney Bates died winning the Victoria Cross. In peacetime, North Holmwood-born Mr Ward married his wife Jean, had two daughters, and worked as a driver and conductor for London Country buses before retiring to Ockley in Surrey. Mr Ward said of his unusual piece of war memorabilia: 'I've got no grandchildren, my daughters aren't interested in it, so I'm not sure what to do with it. 'I've been debating for years whether to take it down to Dorking Museum.' Dear madam . Please let me on behalf of all ranks of my regiment convey our deepest sympathy in the loss of your dearly beloved son William. I was his section commander so I realise that it's my place to let you know all I can about your son. I found him a very happy person, very keen on his job. He was greatly liked by us all and [be] assured that he is missed terribly by everyone. He died at peace with the world and without any suffering, which I can thank God for. He was buried in a little French village by the military authorities with other mates of his. His grave is being attended to daily by a party of gallant little French people constantly under enemy fire. They are therefore showing their gratitude to us all by their action. We have all done our best for him and I sincerely hope you will be able to understand that I have written to make things more clear to you. If there is anything further we can do for you I would like you to say. In expressing our heartfelt feelings again from all concerned, I am yours sincerely .

"An Argentine governor has sparked outrage by firing half of his 340 public sector staff with a personal message - via YouTube. Alberto Weretilneck has been dubbed ‘a coward’ for deciding to break the news of shattering job losses by video rather than meet those affected face-to-face. The Rio Negro province governor posted a to-camera clip, explaining the move which he hopes will deal with budget shortfalls, online Tuesday night. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Argentine governor Alberto Weretilneck (pictured) has sparked outrage by firing half of his 340 public sector staff with a personal message - via YouTube . ‘I decided to decrease the number of public officials by 50 per cent,’ he said. In a further bombshell he announced salary reductions for those that are staying. He said: ‘And those who are continuing on in their jobs will have their salaries reduced by 15 per cent. I have signed the decree that terminates [employment of 140 officials] on Friday, January 31.' Weretilneck . also requested that directors of all of Rio Negro's public enterprises . resign so he could place all of the firms under a single leadership. In . addition, he said he would ask for the wages of the provincial public . advocate, senior prosecutors and auditor-general's office to be brought . down to be in line with lawmakers and cabinet ministers. Alberto Weretilneck is the Rio Negro province governor. Pictured is the Municipal Building in San Carlos de Bariloche . As . a sign he was also making a sacrifice for the public good, he also . revealed he personally would no longer be collecting his official . housing allowance. ‘We cannot . be asking Río Negro citizens nor state workers to join us in this effort . if the Executive branch does not show signs of austerity first,’ he . added in the video. Weretilneck, a member of the centre-left party Frente Grande, was sworn-in as governor two years ago. The announcements came days after Argentina's national currency - the peso - was steeply devalued. His delivery of the news has sparked outrage in the Patagonian province. Many took to the YouTube page, where his message was posted, to vent their anger. Many of the comments, however, are too rude to repeat.","Alberto Weretilneck has been dubbed 'a coward' for firing staff by video .

"Jen Palmer (pictured) and her husband John have threatened to a lawsuit against Kleargear.com after it  fined them $3,500 for posting a negative review . A Texas couple has allegedly been threatened with a $3,500 charge or credit blacklisting by a company who they wrote a bad review about online. Jen Palmer claims her husband ordered 'trinkets' from Kleargear.com in 2009, but PayPal cancelled the transaction when the goods weren't delivered within 30 days. Palmer told KUTV she tried unsuccessfully to contact the company before venting online. The young mom wrote a negative review on Ripoffreport.com, slamming the online retailer's 'incompetent customer service' and 'refusal to ship products to San Antonio, Texas.' But that wasn't the end of it, according to an investigation by KUTV. Three years later, Palmer's . husband got an email from Kleargear.com demanding the post be removed or . the couple would be fined. The company claimed Palmer had violated a . 'non-disparagement clause' buried in the sale terms and conditions. 'In an effort to ensure fair and . honest public feedback, and to prevent the publishing of libelous . content in any form, your acceptance of this sales contract prohibits . you from taking any action that negatively impacts kleargear.com, its . reputation, products, services, management or employees,' the clause stated. Disappointed: Jen Palmer's husband ordered trinkets like those pictured from Kleargear.com in 2009 which never arrived . The . clause also said if a consumer violates the contract, they will . have 72 hours to remove the post or face a $3500 fine. If that fine is . not paid, the delinquency will be reported to consumer credit reporting agencies. 'This is fraud,' Palmer said. 'They're blackmailing us for telling the truth.' Kleargear.com appears to have removed the clause from its terms of sale within the last couple months. It appeared on the website as recently as August 2013. Jen Palmer contacted RipoffReport.com to remove the post, which would allegedly cost $2,000. When she didn't pay Kleargear.com the 'fine' within 30 days, the company contacted credit bureaus, which dinged her credit score. She said the family has been rejected by numerous lenders. 'I have the right to tell somebody else these guys ripped me off,' Palmer said. This is Jen Palmer's critical post on ripoffreport.com for which she was fined $3,500 . KUTV said the company defended its policy, saying the clause was a 'term of sale'. The company also said requiring Palmer to remove the . post or face a fine was a 'diligent effort to help them avoid [the fine]'. Palmer is not the first person to complain about the retailer, with dozens of similar criticisms on Ripoffreport.com. Moreover, the Better Business Bureau slapped the company with an 'F rating' in 2010 for 'not delivering products purchased online in a timely manner'. Kleargear.com today has a 'B rating'. Jen Palmer claims she and her husband have been rejected by several lenders because Kleangear.com reported her 'delinquency' to credit companies . Jen Palmer (pictured with son) said the family had applications for a credit card and a car loan rejected . Salt Lake City First Amendment attorney, Jeff Hunt a judge would likely consider a non-disparagement clause unconstitutional. 'I . think this is outrageous that a company like this would force a . consumer to relinquish their first amendment rights to speak about their . product as a condition of sale,' Hunt told KUTV. 'I have a serious question about whether a court would enforce that kind of covenant because it's massively over broad and against public policy.'","Jen Palmer's husband ordered goods from Kleargear.com in 2009 which she claims never arrived .

The 32-year-old last played in England on New Year's Day in 2014 and was a free agent having recently returned from a stint in the Indian Super League. Pennant trained with Wigan last week and was in attendance at the DW Stadium on Friday night as their worrying form continued in a 3-0 loss to Charlton which leaves them deep in the relegation mire. Jermaine Pennant, in action for Indian Super League side Pune City, has joined Wigan for the season .

"Serbia have been awarded a 3-0 victory over Albania following their postponed Euro 2016 qualifier, but have also been deducted three points and ordered to play their next two games behind closed doors. The Group I clash between the two sides ended in bizarre circumstances earlier this month when an unmanned drone carrying a pro-Albania flag flew over the Partizan Stadium in Belgrade and resulted in a melee between the two sets of players and some Serbian fans. UEFA have taken a dim view of the incident and also fined both nations £78,000. Both countries' FAs have appealed against the verdict.

Kosovo Albanians cheer and light flares as they watch the match on giant public screen in Kosovo . UEFA charged the countries with a number of offences last week although its Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body (CEDB) decided not to expel either nation from the group. Albania have been punished for refusing to play the rest of the match - even if the stadium had been cleared of fans - while Serbia have been sanctioned for crowd trouble. The governing body said in a short statement: 'The CEDB has decided to declare the above-mentioned match as forfeited. As a consequence, the Football Association of Albania (FShF) is deemed to have lost the match 3-0. In addition, the FShF has been fined 100,000 euros (£78,000). 'The CEDB has also decided to deduct the Football Association of Serbia (FSS) three points for the current UEFA European Championship qualifying competition. In addition, the FSS has been ordered to play its next two UEFA competition matches as host team behind closed doors. Finally, the association has been fined 100,000 euros. 'These decisions are open to appeal.' Fans clashed with police as havoc took hold (it is not known if fans shown in this picture were involved) Riot police attempt to contain fans in the stands of the Partizan Stadium. The match was eventually abandoned . Serbian supporters wave their flags on what was a heated night in Belgrade . The match, which was goalless at the time of the abandonment, erupted into controversy three minutes before half-time when the drone, apparently flown in from outside the stadium, was brought down by Serbia defender Stefan Mitrovic. That upset a couple of Albania players which led to brawls involving players, officials and fans before English referee Martin Atkinson led the teams off the field. Objects were thrown onto the pitch while video footage shows some Albania players being assaulted by Serbia supporters as they attempted to come off the pitch. Albanian fans had been banned from entering the stadium by UEFA on safety grounds and the match was set against a backdrop of tight security. Southampton's Dusan Tadic is at the centre of a scuffle along with Man City's Aleksandar Kolarov (second left) The incident prompted hundreds of Albanian fans to spill out onto the streets of their capital Tirana . Some spectators tried to storm the police lines as the disorder continued in the stands . Chelsea's Nemanja Matic sidesteps a challenge before his club-mate Brainslav Ivanovic later walked off . Tensions have never been far from the surface between the nations over Kosovo, the province with which both countries share a disputed border. Kosovo is recognised as independent by the United States and major European Union countries but not by Serbia - a bone of contention with Albania. The incident led to both football associations attempting to blame the other for the abandonment. Serbia claimed the incident had been a 'scenario of a terrorist action planned in advance', but the Albania FA hit back saying the team were targeted even before the game when stones were thrown at the bus, and its delegation and players were hit by a piece of concrete and other missiles during the warm-up. UEFA's sanctions draw a line under the incident although all eyes will be on October next year when the two countries meet again in Albania. Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

"A gypsy teen was gored to death in a running-of-the-bulls style fiesta in a small Spanish town last night.

Running away from the 500kg beast, he was caught off guard and tripped over. A gypsy teenager was gored to death in a running-of-the-bulls style fiesta in a small Spanish town . The bull's horn pierced through his lower back, stabbing into his liver - causing 'copious amounts of blood' to spurt out, reports local media. Shocked onlookers dragged him away from the animal so paramedics could attend to his injuries. But they immediately decided he was in a critical condition and rushed him, at 7.10pm, via ambulance to the area hospital in the nearby town of Hellin. Doctors performed two emergency operations as they fought to save his life. The bull attacked the boy in the town of Isso during a Spanish festival. The town council announced it would be cancelling today's run in tribute to the teen . He went into cardiac arrest at 10pm and died. Another man was also gored at the dangerous event. The 52-year-old was thrown into the air after being hit in his left thigh. Taken to the same hospital, doctors managed to save his leg and he is now said to be 'recovering well' and 'out of danger'. A spokesman for the town's council revealed it would be cancelling today's run in tribute to the teen. The fiestas for the town that lies 200 miles southeast of Madrid started last weekend and were due to end today.

"Spain may be home to World and European football champions but children playing the beautiful game on the country's streets could soon be in line for a fine of up to 1,000 euros (£825). The next Xavi or Andres Iniesta, who helped propel the national team to be the greatest side of all time, could face the financial penalties if a proposed law gets the green light. Spain's governing right-leaning Popular Party passed a draft version of the controversial Citizen Security Law on Friday. Spain may be home to the World and European football champions but children playing the beautiful game on the country's streets could soon be in line for a fine of up to 1,000 euros (£825) It wants fines from between £82.50 to £825 for 'the practice of games or sports activities in public spaces not designed for them,' according to El Huffington Post. The tax would come into force 'when there is a risk of damage to people or property' or when traffic is impeded. The plans have sparked outrage, with many critics saying it will hinder cash-strapped wannabe athletes in built-up areas from being able to hone their skills. Children in Spain could face being fined if they are caught playing football in the street . But the proposals are likely to be given the go-ahead, as the draft reform is expected to pass through parliament where the Popular Party has a majority. The wide-ranging legislation has already come under fire for proposing to fine demonstrators £500,000 if they insult cops or demonstrate near official buildings without permission. That has since been downgraded to a £30,000 fine. The Citizen Security Law was unveiled today which could mean huge fines for people caught filming a policeman to drinking on the street. Insulting or threatening police officers will now cost you anything between 1,000 euros to 30,000 euros. Growing your own cannabis for self-consumption used to be allowed under Spain's previous left-wing government. But now anyone caught cultivating the drug could face being fined tens of thousands of pounds. Demonstrations outside political figure's homes would be banned while Cunderos, the drivers of taxis who take addicts from the city to pick up their drugs on the outskirts, will also be penalised. Youngsters caught drinking in open spaces would have to pay more than their pocket money to get out of trouble.","The next Xavi or Andres Iniesta could be slapped with financial penalties .

"An Argentine blacksmith has been arrested over allegations he fathered five children with his own daughter. The man, 53, is accused of repeatedly raping his victim, who is now 31, as he kept her captive inside their Mendoza home since childhood. Allegedly forcing himself upon her for more than a dozen years, he is said to have claimed she was his reclusive wife when questioned about their relationship. Accused: The man, 53, was arrested in the Argentinian city of Mendoza. He is accused of repeatedly raping his victim, who is now 31 . He is also accused of violently threatening his entire family - including their children, aged between two and 13-years-old - into keeping silent. His alleged reign of terror came to an end on Friday, however, after he was arrested and taken into custody. Chilling echoes: The case resembles that of Austrian psycho Josef Fritzl, who fathered seven children with daughter Elisabeth . Clarin reports that police began investigating in February after his son-in-law, the husband of another one of his older daughters, visited a police station to report the allegations. 'The complainant stated that the girl had no boyfriend and it was the father who had abused her and got her pregnant,' said Manuel Ontiveros, from the Mendoza police sex crime unit. 'The man sometimes passed his daughter off as his wife, when he was asked by neighbours or people outside of the family,' Ontiveros added. A police source said that the man, who has not yet been named, had previously been accused of abusing one of his other daughters - who then left home. 'But as it was not rape, they gave him a suspended sentence and he was not jailed,' the source told Clarin. Authorities are now investigating whether the girl's mother, who left the family home six years ago, was complicit in her former husband's actions. Local media say the case has chilling echoes of Austrian psycho Josef Fritzl, who fathered seven children with daughter Elisabeth, who he kept locked inside a basement for 24 years.

"Relatives of soldiers killed in Iraq spoke of their prolonged agony as it emerged the inquiry into the war has been delayed until late next year. Sir John Chilcot’s report, initially due out in 2011, has been beset by more delays due to an ongoing secrecy row with the Government, which is blocking publication of classified documents. A source revealed it is now likely to be published at the end of next year if not early 2014 if the issues are not resolved soon. Delay: The Chilcot inquiry was set up three years ago to get to the bottom of former prime minister Tony Blair’s decision to join the US in war against Saddam Hussein in 2003, and conduct until the withdrawal of British troops in 2009 . Reg Keys, whose son Lance Corporal Tom Keys was killed in Iraq in 2003 aged 20, said the new delay was ‘frustrating’ and suggested waiting any longer would diminish its impact. The inquiry was set up by Gordon Brown three years ago to get to the bottom of the Government’s decision to join the USA in going to war against Saddam Hussein in March 2003, and conduct right up to the withdrawal of British troops in July 2009. But Sir John’s five-strong panel of academics and former diplomats have met resistance from the civil service to publishing key documents, in particular transcripts of phone conversations between George W Bush and Tony Blair in the run-up to the conflict. Frustration: Reg Keys, whose son Lance Corporal Tom Keys was killed in Iraq in 2003 aged 20, suggested the delay would diminish its impact and described it as 'frustrating' Mr Keys, of Llanuwchllyn, North Wales, who founded the campaign group Military Families Against the War said: ‘The report was due to be published in 2011 when it was still a very hot potato, but by the time we eventually see it, people might think it was all a long time ago and that it doesn’t really matter any more. ‘I can understand why Mr Blair and a few others don’t want things to come out, because there was deceit behind closed doors. ‘But for me and the other families, the delays just keep poking a wound that you’re trying to heal. You try to put things in a box, but until this is done and dusted you can’t move on.’ In July, Sir John wrote to David Cameron to warn him about delays in persuading the government to declassify ‘a significant volume of currently classified material’ that he believed the public should see. This is thought to relate to the intelligence produced by M15, M16. GCHQ and the Joint Intelligence Committee regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction; and key question of whether Mr Blair promised to back the US invasion before he had the backing of parliament. Sir John predicted the panel might contact those who would be criticised in the report in the summer of 2013 to give them the right to reply. But it is understood his team are still in deadlock with the Cabinet Office.A source told the Daily Telegraph: ‘The big issue still remains the inquiry’s belief that it should be able to publish documents that the Cabinet Office is still withholding. ‘Sir John is hoping to send letters out to people next summer to invite their responses to any criticisms he might intend to include in his report. Anger: Demonstrators protest outside the Queen Elizabeth Conference Centre in London before Tony Blair gave evidence to the Chilcot Inquiry . Their responses could take weeks or months to come back, then the inquiry will have to consider whether it needs to change the wording of the report in the light of their responses. ‘So it’s likely to be well into well into the autumn before anything is published.’ The inquiry -which took evidence from 150 witnesses with its last public hearing last February - has cost more than £6million and the year-long delay is set to cost an extra £1.4million. His report is expected to run to a million words. It was claimed last night that a secret document relating to discussions between George W Bush and Tony Blair has not been provided by the Cabinet Office nine months after it was ordered to do so by the Information Commissioner. No one from the Cabinet Office was available for comment last night.","Sir John Chilcot's report initially due in 2011 not likely until late 2013 .

"Promoters of a dance festival where a young woman died of a suspected drug overdose at the weekend have revealed their heartache over the tragedy. Georgina Bartter, 19, was rushed to hospital from the Harbourlife festival at Mrs Macquarie's Chair in Sydney on Saturday afternoon. She died on Saturday night at St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst from multiple organ failure. Friends told police that she took just one and a half pills, believed to be MDMA. Adelle Robinson, who runs Fuzzy - the company who organised the festival - told The Daily Telegraph she was devastated, and described the tragedy as the worst thing that's ever happened during her time in the music industry. Scroll down for video . Georgina Bartter, 19, died from a suspected drug overdose at Harbourlife music festival in Sydney on Saturday . 'It’s just awful, I’m a mum and I can’t imagine how the family are feeling,' she said. Ms Robinson also revealed that she was notified as soon as paramedics arrived on the scene and was kept updated on Ms Bartter's condition through the night. 'We had police on site for the duration of the event as well, they had a command centre next to our control room and I was being given 10-minute updates until we found out that she passed away,' she told the publication. Fellow promoter John Wall said he believed they had done all they could in terms of preventing partygoers taking drugs at the festival, and denied they were 'turning a blind eye to anything'. He added that with police presence and sniffer dogs there was little more they could have done in terms of prevention. A person who witnessed Georgina Bartter's collapse at a dance festival was disgusted that at least five bystanders were videoing the 19-year-old as paramedics tried to save her life. The teenager was the oldest of three children and believed to be studying accounting. She finished Year 12 in 2013 at Wenona, a private girls' high school in North Sydney. A witness has told Daily Mail Australia of his distress when he realised strangers were filming Ms Bartter after she collapsed on the dance floor. 'I was five metres away from her when she collapsed. She was in the middle of the crowd and people had their phones up, pointed at her while medics worked on her,' he said. 'It was just sick. I saw about five guys filming. You can tell the difference between somebody texting and somebody videoing.' The witness says Ms Bartter was on the ground and unresponsive while at least five men nearby filmed her. Promoters of the event have revealed their heartache over the death of Ms Bartter, who reportedly took one and a half pills . 'One of my friends grabbed the phone out of someone's hands and yelled, ""what are you doing?""' 'You wouldn't think people can be so low.' A close friend, who spent most of the day before and during the festival with the 19-year-old, told Daily Mail Australia that he first noticed something was wrong when she started shivering uncontrollably at around 4pm. 'She seemed fine for a while and then she started shivering as if she was getting cold', the friend revealed. 'She started going downhill from there.' Despite friends giving her water and trying to warm her up, Ms Bartter continued to deteriorate. 'I was with her for a while, just me and her, and I was there trying to give her a hug and keep her warm', the friend said. As she got worse another friend and his girlfriend were caring for the teenager from Longueville in Sydney's lower north shore before she started convulsing around 4.40pm. The same pair then travelled in an ambulance to hospital with Ms Bartter, where she died later that night. 'It's been pretty tough for all of us,' the friend said, describing Ms Bartter as a 'bubbly' and 'friendly' girl. Another man was introduced to Ms Bartter at around 4pm by a mutual friend, and said the 19-year-old was shaking very badly. The Sydney girl, seen here with family members, was remembered by friends at a service at her high school Wenona on Monday . 'I shook her hand ... Her hand was shaking really really bad, but she was smiling, she said ""Hi I'm Georgina"",' he told Daily Mail Australia. He said although she seemed unwell he noticed no signs that she was about to collapse. 'If I had of looked at her and she'd been uneasy on her feet or looked like she was swaying we would have helped her ... If we had seen any sign that she was about to collapse we would have done something.' 'It's an absolute tragedy', he added. On Monday, a service was held in the 19-year-old's memory at Wenona, the high school Ms Bartter attended until her graduation in 2013. It's understood Georgina Bartter's younger sister currently attends the private girl's school. 'We have had a beautiful service for Georgina today with our Senior College students, and our younger girls have met with staff and counsellors,' said Dr Briony Scott, the school's principal. 'As parents and teachers, we will continue to walk alongside our young people, focusing onhope, and helping them come to terms with this loss.' Dr Scott says the school community is 'terribly sad' by the death of 'this gorgeous, funny, bright young woman' 'She will be remembered for her scholarship and for her active and friendly approach to life. She had an infectious sense of humour and we will miss her enormously.' 'I thank our community for their kind words and offers of help, which we have passed on to the Bartter family.' The teenager, seen here with her father, dropped to the ground on the dancefloor at the festival and was then rushed to hospital . 'Our hearts and our prayers go out to them at this time.' The head of St Vincent's Hospital's Emergency department, Dr Gordion Fulde told Triple M that everything was done to save the economics student, who was in a critical condition when she arrived at the hospital. 'Ultimate tragedy, a teenage girl dies,' said Dr Fulde. 'As she was critical, within minutes, the intensive care consultant and team were mobilised and rushed down.' 'It was quickly evident the only chance of survival was to put her on a heart lung machine. This equipment mechanically gives her blood flow and oxygen,' said Dr Fulde. Operating equipment was moved down to the emergency ward as Ms Bartter's condiiton was quickly deteriorating. 'The cardiothoracic surgeon and operation theatre staff and the hi-tech machine were brought.' 'Despite care only available in a few hospitals worldwide a lovely girl died.' Dr Fulde says the team at St Vincent's Hospital remain devastated after witnessing the family's intense grief. 'The grief and devastation of the family, of the mother was indescribable.' The family of the teenager released a statement on Sunday remembering her as a 'beautiful young woman'. The statement also remembered her as 'vibrant' and said the teenager's behaviour was out of character, Nine News reported. 'She was a beautiful and vibrant young woman, who was much loved and will be sadly missed, the statement read. 'She had allergies, and it was extremely out of character.' Promoters of Fuzzy - the company that organises Harbouside - said they were devastated over the tragedy . The family reportedly said, 'Georgina was allergic to drugs and never would have knowingly taken them', according to Channel Seven. An autopsy will be carried out to determine what was in the pill that contributed to her death. Officers were alerted to the unconscious 19-year-old woman as they carried out a drug operation at the event. Witnesses recall seeing Ms Bartter 'collapse' in the middle of the dance floor and begin frothing at the mouth. 'She was dancing next to us when she collapsed on the dance floor. I thought she was pretty hammered but then she just dropped to the floor,' one witness told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was shocking, you just don’t know what to do. We were all waving our arms around for a paramedic.' Witnesses told of how Ms Bartter was shaking uncontrollably while paramedics tried to revive her . The three witnesses were distressed to learn that the young woman had died, but say that night they knew something was drastically wrong. 'Medics were trying to resuscitate her and she was frothing at the mouth,' the witnesses, who wished not to be named, explained. 'When she got carried out she wasn't well. Her eyes were in the back of her head and her friends were freaking out.' The organisers of Harbourlife, Fuzzy Events, extended their sincere condolences to the young woman's loved ones and assure the public patron safety is a priority in a statement released on Sunday. 'Right now our thoughts are with her family – we can hardly imagine the pain and heartbreak they must be feeling, and they have our deepest sympathy,' the statement read. 'Harbourlife has been held annually since 2003. It has a fully equipped first aid tent with an emergency doctor, 2 paramedics, 3 first responder medics, 2 supervisors and a communications officer.'

"This tiny feline could be about to enter the record books as the world's shortest cat.

Trouble: Pixel's owner says she has to take extra special care to avoid treading on her Munchkin cats . Ms Kjeldergaard said her family of Munchkin cats 'win hearts over like crazy.' She said: 'Even people that aren't cat people go crazy for them. They say about how cute they are and how they want to take them straight home with them.' A relatively new breed which was only recognised by The International Cat Association in 1995, Munchkin cats are characterised by their short legs, which are caused by a naturally occurring genetic mutation. They was controversy when they first emerged, with some critics voicing concern over potential health problems. But Ms Kjeldergaard dismissed those concerns. 'People who don't understand the gene consider it a genetic defect or mutation or something of an abomination,' she said. 'It's very unfair for them to say that. It's natural for these cats to be this tall, just like it's natural for some people to have brown eyes - it wouldn't be wrong for them to have blue eyes.

'You can't leave doors open, you can't close refrigerator doors too quickly because one of them may have snuck up at the bottom of the door and stuck their head in,' she said. 'We have to move very slowly when we walk so we don't step on anybody. 'Everyone of them has been stepped on or kicked once because it's just what happens in a house of munchkin cats.'

Humpbacks are often seen in Monterey Bay in the late Summer months, where gray whales can also be found. The humpbacks live in the bay between April and December, feeding on schooling fishes and krill. They often use a 'bubble net' to catch their prey, blowing bubbles that surround the school so it cannot escape before swooping through with their mouths wide open. Killer whales often lurk just outside of the bay, hoping to catch the gray whales when they migrate north. The acrobatic humpbacks can grow up to 50ft long, and have a reputation for throwing themselves out of the water despite weighing up to 40 tons.

She also claims Mr Sisely did not cover her traveling expenses, or give her the $780,000 paid by Natsu; and she now believes that 'Natsu' doesn't exist, and that the auction was simply a ploy to gain media coverage for the documentary. Tricked? The physical education student claims she has not received the money promised to her by filmmaker Justin Sisely, and believes the auction was simply a publicity stunt for Australian documentary, Virgins Wanted . 'I . agreed to go along with [the auction], because Justin said it would be . the best way to draw attention from the media about the project,' she said. Mr Sisely, who first announced the documentary in May 2010 and said it would conclude with both of the virgins having sex, denies her claims. 'We have the footage to prove otherwise,' he explained. In a bid to avoid prostitution laws, Miss Migliorini was to be . 'delivered' to her buyer on board a plane between Australia and the U.S. - being interviewed before and after the sexual act. The intercourse itself would not be filmed, said Mr Sisely, . and Natsu would retain a right to be anonymous, without his picture . appearing in the media. In exchange for her participation, Miss Migliorini said she was promised 20per cent of documentary sales and all money from the winning auction bid of $780,000. Neither has materialized, she claims. Miss Migliorini previously said she wanted to give 90per cent of the final auction sale price to a non-governmental organization constructing modern houses in her southern home state of Santa Catarina. She signed up to the project three years ago when she saw an advert by Thomas Williams Productions looking for a virgin to film.

"A Chilean teen sold her unborn baby on Facebook for just £68, police said. The 18-year-old woman, named as Veronica Carrera Chaparro, was arrested alongside her mother and sister who are accused of helping her with the sale. Police claim that Chaparro found out she was two months pregnant in February 2013. Veronica Carrera Chaparro (center), was arrested for allegedly selling her newborn daughter on Facebook . She told her then 17-year-old boyfriend and made him promise to keep the news quiet. But he broke the secret and told her family. Chaparro's 42-year-old mother Angela Chaparro, and her 24-year-old sister Daniela Perez reportedly gave her three options. 'Sell it, abort it or give it up for adoption,' is what police chief Miguel Ampuero said she was asked to decide. The as yet unborn baby was put up for sale on social networking site Facebook, and attracted immediate interest from a couple in the city of Concepcion. However, the parties could not negotiate a deal. A family from the Santiago neighbourhood of Puente Alto then got in touch, who offered to pay the child's $1,135 formal registration fees. The baby was eventually born on November 4 and, the following day, the husband of the buyers allegedly paid the sum to authorities. The unborn baby was put up for sale on social networking site Facebook, and attracted immediate interest from a couple in the city of Concepcion . He then handed over the much-smaller amount to the birth mother, who lived in the Maipu district of the capital, reports Cooperativa. Chaparro, her mother and sister were all arrested and charged in connection with the sale . They appeared before a court in Santiago on Sunday. Judge Ernesto Silva said the case was 'very serious'. But he revealed that it could prove 'complex' because under Chilean law it is 'not a crime to offer over the internet the delivery of a newborn, even though financial compensation is offered.' The buyers were also detained and will appear before a court on Monday.","The 18-year-old woman has been named as Veronica Carrera Chaparro .

"A hilarious new video shows three grandmothers as they smoke weed for the first time. The women, who all live in Washington where the drug is legal, say they have been too busy raising children, and grandchildren, to take some time to enjoy the previously illicit substance. Or, as one woman puts it; 'We had our cigarettes and our cocktails and we were happy.' Scroll down for video . Let's get it started: Three grandmothers in Washington recently smoked weed for the first time . Late developers: As one grandmother explained, they were too busy raising children and grandchildren to smoke before now . Self-medicating:  Another said they did not need weed because they had 'cigarettes and cocktails' Helping hand: The only complaint the women had of the bong was that thye smoke burned their throat . That may all change for this trio though, as the ladies seem to have a fantastic time smoking first out of a bong and then out of a vaporizer. The vaporizer, as one of the ladies points out, looks like a 'dildo.' What in the...: One woman said the vaporizer looked like a 'dildo' Easy burn: The women seemed to enjoy that the vaporizer had far less smoke . From there they enjoy some laughs, a touch of paranoia and a case of the munchies, nibbling on cookie and later Doritos. In fact, the only complaint they seem to have is that the smoke from the bong burns their throat. They also have some game time, at first trying to play Jenga and then settling in for a nice long round of Cards Against Humanity. Game time: The woman soon started on a game of Cards Against Humanity . Giggle fits: Then the laughter slowly started among the three . Hunger pangs: Finally, the ladies munched on cookies and Doritos . And though they may be grandmas, they are just as filthy when playing the card game as anyone else. In the end they say they would probably smoke again - and then enjoy another bag of Doritos.","A new video shows three grandmothers enjoying weed for the first time in Washington, where the drug is legal .

"A police officer in Florida made an incredibly generous gesture this week after it appears some creep did the unthinkable: Stole the wedding ring of an elderly Alzheimer's patient who is sedated in a hospital. The yellow-gold diamond engagement ring has been on the hand of 87-year-old Betty Wagner for the last 67 years - after her husband, Arthur Wagner, bought it for her in the summer of 1946. 'She said, ""Yes."" I remember I bought it at Zales jewelry. I paid $400 for it,' Arthur Wagner told a local news outlet. 'I came in the morning, and I'm holding her hand, talking to her, and the ring is gone.' Love birds: Arthur Wagner remembers the day 67 years ago when his wife, Betty, said yes to his marriage proposal . Hero: When Plantation Police Officer Laurie Graber was assigned the case she was heartbroken for the elderly couple . When Plantation Police Officer Laurie Graber was tasked with investigating the apparent theft at the Westside Regional Medical Center in Plantation, she was overcome with grief over what had happened to the still-beaming couple. 'After 67 years of that ring being on her finger, she still looked at him . like he was her knight in shinning armor, and he looked at her like she . was still his young bride,' Graber tells WSVN. So Graber did what she could to replace Wagner's ring. 'I went to J.C. Penney, and I bought a small ring, and I took it back to the hospital, and I left a little note,' the officer says. Thief: Authorities say bruising on Betty Wagner's finger indicate that the ring was pulled off and stolen rather than simply lost . When Arthur Wagner showed up to the hospital the following day, the nurses told him that Graber had stopped by and left something for he and his wife. 'A promise kept for 67 years is worth something,' the note read, and with it was the small ring. 'I just couldn't imagine what kind of depravity you would have to have to . take something off of someone so vulnerable,' said Graber. Investigators believe the ring was stolen rather than lost because of injuries found on Betty Wagner's hand. Crime scene: Police are reviewing surveillance footage to see if it gives them any help in finding who stole Wagner's ring . 'From the bruises on her finger that looked like both rings were pulled . off, and the wedding band was put back on,' said Wagner. 'I just tear . up. It was tough.' Police say they are checking the hospital's surveillance video to see if they can identify a suspect. Anyone with information about the stolen ring is asked to call Broward County Crime Stoppers at 954-493-TIPS. Tipsters can stay anonymous and may be eligible for a reward.","Arthur Wagner bought the ring for his wife, Betty, in the summer of 1946 .

"Convicted: Jordan Horner, 20, is one of a group of Sunni Muslims facing jail for attacking a group of Shi'ites in what is believed to be the first case of Muslim sectarian violence on the streets of Britain . Radical Sunni Muslims are facing jail for attacking a group of Shi’ites in what is believed to be the first case of Muslim sectarian violence on the streets of Britain. Violence broke out on London’s Edgware Road, a well-known Shia area, on May 10 last year during a protest organised by radical preacher Anjem Choudary calling for jihad in Syria. Two men were beaten to the ground with placards and wooden sticks. One was so badly injured he had blood streaming down his face after being kicked in the head as he lay helpless on the floor. Ginger-haired Jordan Horner, 20, part of the Sunni sect, attacked a man after calling him a 'kuffir', or non-believer. Other members of the Sunni group including Mohammed Almagir, 34, Mirza Ali, 38, Mohad Uddin, 36, and Kamran Khan, 29, also joined in. Alex Chalk, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey that the group were shouting 'Shias are kuffirs. They are the enemy within. They are evil' as they carried out the attack. He said: 'This is a case about sectarian violence in west London. 'On Friday May 10, 2013, these defendants attended an unauthorised anti-Shia march advertised on Twitter. 'The protestors, several of whom were carrying banners bearing inflammatory anti-Shia slogans, passed along Edgware Road - an area well known for its established Shia community. 'They were carrying placards calling for jihad in Syria and were publicising their intention to march to the Syrian Embassy. 'Shortly after the marchers turned around at the Marble Arch end and retraced their steps northwards, violence broke out. 'Two men were assaulted with fists and flagpoles. One was beaten on the ground, and the other, Fahad Fahad, was left with blood streaming from a wound to his head.' The violence broke out while Anjem Choudhary was being interviewed on camera by a journalist. The court heard a group of up to 50 protestors congregated outside London Central Mosque after the conclusion of Friday prayers at 2pm. That afternoon Mohammed El-Hariri, a Shia Muslim who has run a business in the area for 12 years, was walking along Edgware Road on his way to meet his friend, Fahad Fahad. He noticed a large group dressed in Islamic salaffi dress. Violence: Other members of the Sunni group including Mohammed Almagir, 34, (pictured) joined in after Horner attacked a man calling him a 'kaffir', or non-believer . They were protesting against Shia Muslims, chanting sectarian slogans and carrying inflammatory banners. The banners were in Arabic and contained phrases including ‘Shias are unbelievers’ and ‘Shia will destroy Islam and Muslims.’ Other banners condemned Alawites, the Shia denomination of the Syrian leader, Bashar Al-Assad. Mr . El-Hariri started to talk to one of the group of protesters - in . particular Horner, who he described as a white male with a shaved head . and a ginger beard. As he . did so he was attacked while another man poured water on him. He was . then punched repeatedly by other members of the group. Guilty: Mohan Uddin (left) and Mirza Ali (not pictured) were also convicted of violent disorder, while Kamran Khan (right) was convicted of affray over the incident. His friend Mr Fahad was hit with a flagpole and kicked in the face, head and arms. As he was set upon Mr Fahad could hear his attackers saying: 'This is what is going to happen to all Shia.' Mr Chalk said: 'Mr Fahad feared for his life, until he was dragged to safety. He was covered in blood.' Horner, Ali, Almagir and Uddin were convicted of violent disorder, and Kamran Khan was convicted of affray over the incident. Protest: The violence broke out during a protest organised by radical preacher Anjem Choudary (pictured) calling for jihad in Syria . They are due to be sentenced tomorrow at the Old Bailey. Uddin and Khan will also be sentenced, along with eight others, for their part in an attack on a white man in Oxford street on May 18 last year. On that occasion the victim, Andrew White, was attacked with a hospital crutch before being kicked and punched to the ground. Postman Khan faces a separate charge of stealing mail for which he will also be dealt with by Judge Paul Worsley QC.","Violence broke out during protest organised by preacher Anjem Choudary .

"This is the moment police busted an illegal immigrant who'd risked life and limb trying to enter Spain by stowing away next to the propellers of a ferry. The desperate Algerian man, 48, had clambered on to the vessel in Tangiers, Morocco, on Saturday - clinging on for dear life for more than two hours as the boat crossed the Straits of Gibraltar. He had planned to jump into the water, as the ferry came close to shore, and then swim to land. Scroll down for video . Desperation: A simple slip would have led to the death of the Algerian man, who attempted to enter Spain by clinging onto a ferry right next to the deadly propellers . The desperate man would then evade a border check point and illegally enter the country by jumping over a 10ft fence. But National Police officers heard of his plot and were waiting for him as the ferry was about to dock in Tarifa. The man was arrested and taken to an immigration detention centre. It is not the first time a foreign national has stared death in the face trying to get into a country. The 48-year-old was going to jump into the sea close to the blades and swim to shore - an incredibly risky plan . Busted: Officers lead the man away. He was taken to an immigrant detention centre by Spanish National Police . In June 2010 a stowaway hid in the undercarriage of a jumbo jet and survived temperatures of -41c at 25,000ft during a free flight into Britain. The jobless Romanian crouched in the rear-wheel compartment during an extraordinary 800-mile trip from Vienna to London on a Boeing 747 owned by the Dubai royal family. Airport officals say the man could easily have been crushed by the plane's wheels or killed by a lack of oxygen and was 'incredibly lucky' to be alive. He was taken to Heathrow police station but because he was apparently of previous good character, he was given a police caution and released from custody at 2.47pm on Monday. The man was carrying ID and immigration officials were satisfied he was Romanian and entitled to stay. Records collated by the US Federal Aviation Administration suggest that at best one in four stowaways survives, but many others die or fall in transit. Survivors rarely escape unscathed and frostbite claims many limbs. In 2009 an illegal immigrant smuggled himself into Britain underneath a coach full of Border Agency officials. The immigration officers were not aware of the stowaway until they had completed their journey through the Channel Tunnel from France and had arrived at their depot in Folkestone.","The 48-year-old clung to rear of ferry right next to the churning blades .

"The International Organization for Migration says about 500 migrants are feared dead after their boat was deliberately rammed, causing it to sink off the Malta coast last week. Christiane Berthiaume, spokeswoman for the organisation, said witnesses claim  that the boat left Damietta in Egypt earlier this month with Syrians, Palestinians, Egyptians and Sudanese on board. It sank last Wednesday  after a group of human traffickers deliberately rammed it with another boat when the passengers refused to transfer on to smaller vessels, she added. News of the shocking incident comes as dozens died when a boat carrying at least 250 Africans to Europe capsized before it even managed to leave the Libyan coast this morning. Scroll down for video . Luck: News of the incident in Malta comes as dozens died when a boat carrying at least 250 Africans to Europe capsized before it even managed to leave the Libyan coast this morning. Pictured are some of the survivors . Saved: The incident in Libya occurred near the capital Tripoli this morning. Those rescued from the sea are pictured here being treated for their injuries at a building run by the Libyan coastguard . Ms Berthiaume said two Palestinian survivors claim there was a violent confrontation between the migrants and traffickers who wanted to move everyone on to one of their smaller vessels. She says the traffickers subsequently 'used one boat to knock the other' - severely damaging the migrants' vessel and causing it to sink, killing hundreds. Only nine people are believed to have survived the shocking incident, with most of these transported by helicopter for treatment in Greece. The news comes as dozens of people died when a boat carrying at least 250 African migrants to Europe capsized before it even managed to leave the Libyan coast this morning. The incident occurred near the  capital Tripoli this morning according to Qassim Ayoub, the spokesman for Libya's coastguard. He said divers are still retrieving bodies floating roughly 11 miles off the coast of Tripoli's Tajoura district, adding that 36 migrants, including three women - one of them pregnant - were saved. Divers are still recovering bodies from the sea - roughly 11 miles off the Libyan coast. Pictured are some of the injured but living survivors from the capsized vessel, which is believed to have been making its way to Italy . Discovered: The intended destination for many of the migrants is more often than not is Southern Italy - particularly the island of Lampedusa and the coastline of Ragusa province in Sicily - and in nearby Malta . Libya has grown increasingly lawless since the 2011 overthrow of dictator Moammar Gadhafi, making it a migration hub for sub-Saharan Africans seeking a better life. Thousands are killed every year on the dangerous cross-Mediterranean journey to Europe on board massively overcrowded ships that are often old and in poor condition - causing many of them to sink. The intended destination more often than not is Southern Italy - particularly the island of Lampedusa and the coastline of Ragusa province in Sicily - and in nearby Malta. Refugee numbers have since swelled as thousands of people flee conflicts in Syria, Iraq and across the Middle East and Africa, boarding unsafe smugglers' boats in Libya. So far, nearly 110,000 people have been rescued since January, but at least 1,889 others have died making the perilous crossing, the U.N. refugee agency said.","Criminals deliberately rammed boat packed with migrants in Mediterranean .

"Young mother: Janine Mallett was discovered on Saturday morning by the main beach of San Antonio, Ibiza . A British mother of two who drowned after going for a late night swim in Ibiza had taken a cocktail of illegal drugs, it has emerged. The body of Janine Mallett, 31, was found washed up on S’Arenal - the main beach of party resort San Antonio - at 11am on Saturday. Preliminary autopsy results published by the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Ibiza revealed the cause of death as drowning. But a urine sample also revealed she had taken four different drugs - cocaine, MDMA, amphetamines and methamphetamine -  in the preceding hours. Blood and urine samples are now being sent to the National Institute of Toxicology and Forensic Science in Barcelona to confirm the findings. Police initially launched an investigation into Mrs Mallet's death at the weekend. But it is understood they have since ruled out foul play. The Diario de Ibiza website reports that Mallett, from Stockton-on-Tees, was staying with friends in a holiday apartment in San Antonio. For reasons currently unknown, Mallet became separated from the group and ended up on the beach alone. She is believed to have gone into the sea for a swim at around 4am. She was found seven hours later at 11am. Previous reports revealed that Mrs Mallett lived with electrician husband Iain, 30, and her two children - a three-year-old boy and six-year-old girl. Her mother, Colleen Hadfield, 62, said: ‘She was the most lovely person. She was beautiful. We are just waiting to see when we can bring her home.’ Neighbour Pauline Kelsey, 61, who lives two doors down said: ‘I have known Iain and his family since he was a kid. Janine has got two children - a boy and a girl. Tragic discovery: Mrs Mallett's body was found at S'Arenal beach, where Spanish police are investigating why she decided to go for a midnight swim . ‘They are beautiful. She would do anything for anyone. She is beautiful, she has always been really nice. There is nothing you can say, is there. It is total devastation.’ She said: ‘They are a young family - I can’t believe it. She would help anybody, she was that kind of young lady. She was always very smart.’ Her husband Bob Kelsey, 63, a professional driver, said: ‘You couldn’t ask for better neighbours. We are totally shocked. She is only a young girl. You don’t expect things like this.’ A female friend of married Janine, who had flown to Ibiza with her on Thursday, has told police she lost sight of her during the night while they were out partying. Party town: San Antonio where the two friends were on holiday is the clubbing capital of Ibiza . Her body was discovered on Saturday morning just before 11am off S’Arenal beach, the main beach of party resort San Antonio. A source said: ‘Janine was with a female friend. They went out and got separated from each other and the friend went back to the hotel alone just before 1am on Saturday morning with no idea where Janine was. ‘They hadn’t spoken about going swimming as far as I know so it’s a mystery as to how Janine’s body came to be in the sea. The friend is obviously devastated.’ A spokesman for the Foreign Office said ‘We can confirm the death of a British national in Ibiza .We are offering consular assistance to the family.’","Janine Mallett and her friend lost each other while out partying .

"A couple's 26-year bid to learn the truth about their son’s disappearance could soon be over. Police reviewing the case of school boy Lee Boxell have arrested three men and a woman on suspicion of his murder. Lee was just 15 when he disappeared in 1988, and his parents Peter and Christine have been seeking an explanation ever since. Lee Boxell (above) was just 15 when he was last seen on Sutton High Street in Croydon in September 1988. Police believe his disappearance could be linked to an unofficial youth club run at the time in the grounds of St Dunstan's Church (above left) Battle: Peter Boxell, 67 and Christine Boxell, 72 from Sutton holding a picture of their son . At the time of his disappearance, there was a £20,000 reward for anyone knowing any information that may lead to his whereabouts. Arrests has finally been made, the first arrests since the investigation started. The teenager was last seen in Sutton high street 26 years ago, but his parents have never given up the search, and they now believe the recent developments could finally give them the truth about their son . Mrs Boxell, right, said that since their son disappeared, their lives have been 'horrendous' and they are preying the new developments will bring results . Last night the pair told the Daily Mail the development could finally solve the mystery of what happened to their son. Police . enquiries have focused on a church building in the area near where he . was last seen, which has since discovered to have been a haunt of . paedophiles – with detectives saying the teenager could have been killed . to keep him quiet. One of the three men arrested is 78, meaning he was 52 when Lee vanished. The . other two men are 41 and 42, and the arrested woman is 42 making three . of those being questioned a similar age to Lee at the time. Lee’s . mother Mrs Boxell, 72, who still lives at the family home in Cheam, . south-west London, said: ‘I’ve wanted this for so long – we’ve got to . know what happened to him 25 years ago. Specialist search teams spent 12 months searching the church yard for any sign of Lee Boxell . Lee's mother Christine Boxell said police spent £1 million searching the graveyard for evidence 'and literally left no stone unturned' 'In the back of my mind I have to hope that he will still come back - that’s how I keep going. 'I remember that day on September 10, 1988, like it was yesterday. 'Our life ever since has been horrendous.' She added: ‘I just hope these four people arrested will say something.’ And . Lee’s father Mr Boxell, 67, said of the arrests: ‘I think it’s a . fantastic development and I just really hope and pray it will result in . us finding Lee. Police believe an outbuilding at the church yard known locally as 'The Shed' may have been used by a paedophile ring to target children . ‘We’ve known for some months the arrests were going to happen, it had all been planned.’ Lee’s . parents have not changed his bedroom since the day he disappeared, . refusing to give up hope, and have never stopped searching for him. The . teenager was last seen in Sutton high street and police assumed he had . gone to watch a football match at nearby Selhurst Park – but that was . ruled out. The Metropolitan Police has confirmed it has arrested three men aged between 41 and 78 in connection with Lee Boxell's murder. A 42-year-old woman has also been arrested for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and indecency with children . It was then . realised he used to spend time in a building at St Dunstan’s church, . nicknamed ‘the Shed’, which is now known to have been a gathering place . for teenagers, who became a target for sexual predators. Last year Detective Inspector John McQuade said: ‘Some of them were as young as 12 or 13. 'There are people out there like Jimmy Savile who will take advantage of people like that.’ Among . a number of paedophiles now known to have been operating in the area at . the time, one, William Lambert, was three years ago convicted of . abusing four girls in the 1980s and jailed for 11 years at the age of . 75.

Crimewatch appeal was made by Mr and Mrs Boxell, who also have a . grown-up daughter called Lindsey, and are grandparents to a . three-year-old girl and six-year-old-boy. They worked with the Metropolitan police to launch a fresh campaign with a £20,000 reward. At the time of the appeal Mr Boxell said: ‘We, Lee’s family, need answers to what happened to [him]. 'Someone in this community can give us those answers. Please help us bring Lee home.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Lee Boxell vanished from Sutton High Street in September 1988 .

"Civil servants put £1.1billion on taxpayer-funded credit cards last year despite David Cameron’s pledge to curb their use. More than 137,000 Whitehall officials, quangocrats and town hall chiefs used the cards to splash out on plush hotels, gourmet meals and fine wines. The bill for 2012-2013 was four times that of 2002. It was also no lower than in Labour’s last year in power – even though the number of civil servants has fallen. Home Office staff spent £1,655 staying at the luxury Hilton Rose Hall resort and spa in Jamaica's Montego Bay . The money spent on the ‘government procurement cards’ would have paid for 52,000 new nurses. Officials at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport signed off £927 on a single picture frame and the Planning Inspectorate spent £646 on a chair. Home Office staff spent £1,655 on a stay at the luxury Hilton Rose Hall resort and spa in Jamaica’s Montego Bay. Another £10,000 a month was spent by the Department for Education on a staff rewards scheme. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: ‘We investigated this issue last year and were assured things were getting better. ‘The idea that people are drifting back into old habits is so depressing. Civil servants have got to start walking the walk and not just talking the talk on this.’ The senior Labour MP said the committee might probe the issue again. Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘The Government pledged to reduce the amount spent using taxpayer-funded credit cards yet the bill still isn’t falling. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said people drifting back into old habits is depressing . ‘These cards are a great way for taxpayers to scrutinise how their cash is spent but only if itemised bills are published, not just what the authorities want us to see. ‘It’s about time officials remembered who picks up the tab when they use the cards in luxury resorts or on extravagant picture frames.’ Mr Cameron made a high-profile pledge to crack down on the use of plastic just before the 2010 election – the year it emerged that more than £1billion a year was going on the cards. In the leaders’ televised debate, he said: ‘Civil servants have been given credit cards, funded by the taxpayer, to go out and spend that on food and wine, and on other things, and that’s cost a billion pounds. Giving up waste would be good for our economy.’ Exactly what the money is being spent on is becoming harder to scrutinise. Buying Solutions, the agency previously responsible for the charge cards, displayed charts and tables on its website but these are no longer available. In April, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office spent £4,774 on alcohol in the United Arab Emirates – where drinking is illegal. The ‘beer, wine and liquor’ money was used for a ‘re-stock of Embassy drink store for use at official events’. Last June, a damning report by the public accounts committee recommended a ban on buying alcohol on the cards and cutting back on five-star hotel bookings. Mrs Hodge said: ‘The controls are not strict enough to deter and prevent inappropriate use.’ Yet despite this, £530 was later spent at the five-star Hyatt Regency in New Delhi in February – a hotel which boasts of its ‘benchmark of excellence for fine dining’. The spending data also reveals the Department for Education used the card scheme to clock up £10,000 a month on shopping vouchers for staff. The ‘instant reward’ scheme was set up by DoE  officials as an incentive for workers and operates through the love2reward.co.uk website. Staff who work at the Home Office (pictured) splashed out on a stay at a luxury holiday in Jamaica . The data – revealed under a freedom of information request – showed departments even used the cards to pay each other, with the Cabinet Office sanctioning a £1,290 payment to the Environment Agency. An explanation of the spend read: ‘Payment for CO2 emissions allowances, as required by the Government Carbon Reduction Commitment.’ The Cabinet Office also regularly paid out for chauffeur-driven cars for permanent secretary Ivan Rogers, the Prime Minister’s adviser on Europe and global issues. In January alone the mandarin clocked up £6,922 in journeys courtesy of the Government Car and Despatch Agency. And civil servants showed they were not afraid to pay for the smallest items on the cards. In March an official at the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council paid for a £4.55 meal at Burger King while another spent £1.35 at Starbucks. Civil servants have been given credit cards, funded by the taxpayer, to go out and buy food and wine . The cards are issued to enable officials to buy ‘high volume, low value goods and services – from office supplies to taxi fares’. But they also let holders directly buy flights, hotel accommodation, and business breakfasts and lunches as well as cover ‘entertainment’ costs. Applicants can use vague headings such as ‘travel’, ‘subsistence’ and ‘other’. The Government Procurement Service refused to disclose the departments with the largest spend under the scheme despite doing so in previous years. Instead it boasted of savings in a series of web ‘case studies’ – including one where it trumpeted a £650,000 reduction in printer cartridge costs. It failed to show the details of the millions of annual transactions. Many departments choose only to itemise spending at £500 or above and checks on the data.gov website shows many records are not regularly updated. Research has shown that 94 per cent of transactions on the cards are below the £500 threshold. The pitfalls of issuing the cards were highlighted in February when a £2,000 ‘fraudulent use of card reported’ showed up in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office data. A month earlier ‘cloners’ were responsible for siphoning off a further £500, the data showed. Last night a spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: ‘Procurement cards allow public sector workers to pay for low value items in a controlled, secure and efficient way – when used effectively, they save organisations money. ‘Since May 2010 we have tightened the controls on the use of cards and implemented new cross Whitehall standards, a taskforce to tackle fraud, and a group that monitors the spend and activity on cards.’","The bill for 2012-2013 was four times that of 2002 .

"A Spanish politician has been busted staring at pictures of naked women when he should have been focusing on a political debate. Miguel Angel Revilla, former President of the Autonomous Community of Cantabria, was photographed ogling over a guitar-playing beauty during a regional parliamentary session on Monday. The 71-year-old was snapped by photographer Andres Fernandez from the local El diario Montañes newspaper. Damning evidence: Miguel Angel Revilla was caught looking at a naked woman in a magazine he appears to be hiding inside an official folder during a regional parliamentary session . He appears to be covering up his copy of the magazine Interviu, which often features scantily-clad models, with official binders. The picture was uploaded to Twitter and soon went viral, with many slamming the politician for perving while earning public money. Red-faced Revilla, however, has played down the incident. The Regionalist Party of Cantabria leader claimed he was simply flicking through the pages to find a specific article about the fate of former Caja Madrid bank President Miguel Blesa. 'Very interesting article in Interviu about Blesa, I'm sure they caught me reading it,' he tweeted soon after he began trending on the micro-blogging site. 'I asked for Interviu in the session to read the report on Blesa and ""wow"", the picture is national news,' he added.","Cantabria politician seen looking at naked women during debate .

"The leader of the Greek church has warned rising poverty in the country caused by budget cuts could trigger a 'social explosion'. The government's cost-cutting reforms were creating deprivation not seen since the Second World War, Orthodox church leader Ieronymos wrote to Prime Minister Lucas Papademo. His warning came as German Premier Angela Merkel visited China where she sough to give reassurances over the debt crisis in Europe. 'Homelessness and even hunger have reached nightmare proportions,'  said the Greek religious leader. Health sector personnel shout slogans during a protest against austerity measures outside Health Ministry in Athens today . Striking steel workers shout slogans outside the Labour Ministry in Athens opposing proposals to cut their wages and employment rights . 'Patience among Greeks is running out, giving way to a sense of anger, and the danger of a social explosion cannot be ignored any longer.' He added: 'The medicine we are taking has proved fatal for the nation. More painful, and more unjust measures are now set to follow along the same, hopeless course.' Greece is promising rescue creditors tougher austerity measures as it nears agreement for a second bailout worth 130bn euros with its partners in the 17-nation eurozone and the IMF, and a related deal with private creditors that will see 100bn euros wiped off the national debt. Without those agreements, Greece faces bankruptcy next month as it is unable to cover a 14.5bn bond repayment due on March 20. Under pressure from the government and rescue creditors, leaders of Greece's unions and employers resumed talks to slash labor costs in the private sector. Debt inspectors from the EU, IMF and European Central Bank - know as the troika - are currently visiting Athens, and insist the cuts are needed to boost Greece's sluggish competitiveness. German Chancellor Angela Merkel tours Nanluo Guxiang in Beijing today on her visit to reassure China over the eurozone crisis . German Chancellor Angel Merkel, right, and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao review a guard of honour during a welcome ceremony in Beijing . 'This is a very difficult negotiation and of course there are differences of opinion, so we will see where that leads,' Greece's government spokesman Pantelis Kapsis told private Mega television. 'As a country, we have reached the brink of official bankruptcy. We have been borrowing for so many years and now we have our backs to the wall, so we have difficult decisions to make.' The Greek church has stepped up a charity drive this week, during a cold snap that left much of the country in sub-freezing temperatures and a growing number of homeless people at risk. Europe needs to double the size of its bailout fund to 1trillion euros if it is to shore up its banking system and stop the spread of its spiraling debt crisis, according to a paper published today by the economic organisation that represents developed countries. The paper, written by Adrian Blundell-Wignall, who is the special adviser to the secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, laid out a list of steps Europe has to take 'if a fracturing of the euro is to be avoided.' It includes making sure banks have enough money to weather the storm and forcing them to reduce their holdings of risky assets; making the banking system more secure by separating retail banking - the practice of lending to customers - from investment banking - a riskier business that involves making bets on investments; forcing Greece's private bondholders to take at least a 50 per cent loss on the debt; and increasing the size of the bailout fund, which will have 500bn euros when it comes into effect later this year. The list is not new - many analysts have suggested similar remedies - but it comes from a respected source and added to the pressure on European governments to act. European countries are already trying to shore up their banking system, and though they have long been reluctant to expand their bailout fund, that looks to be changing. Unemployment in Greece has surged to 19.2 per cent, with the jobless rate for people under age 25 at 47.2 per cent, according to figures for October from the EU statistics agency, Eurostat. Also today, workers from the state-run national health service gathered in protest outside the Health Ministry to protest spending cuts in health care, including a new round of wage reductions which took effect on February 1. One group of protesters carried an empty coffin outside the central Athens building. Meanwhile, China's premier said today that Beijing might contribute to European bailout funds during a visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Merkel was on a visit to reassure Beijing about Europe's financial health following agreement this week on a European treaty on government spending that its leaders hope will end their debt crisis and revive economic growth. Premier Wen Jiabao, China's top economic official, repeated pledges of support for Europe, his country's biggest trading partner, but made no financial commitments. 'It is very urgent and important to resolve Europe's debt crisis,' he said during a joint appearance with Merkel. 'China is considering greater involvement in resolving Europe's debt crisis by participating in the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Stability Mechanism.' European leaders want China, with $3.2 trillion in foreign reserves, and other global investors to contribute to expanding the EFSF and the 500 billion euro ($650 billion) ESM, due to begin operation in July. Merkel is the first of several European leaders to visit China this month for talks expected largely to focus on the economic crisis. Europe is China's biggest export market and Beijing's stake in its financial health is growing as Chinese companies expand there. China's biggest producer of construction equipment announced this week that it was buying Germany's Putzmeister, a maker of concrete pumps.'Whether we can maintain the stability of the financial system and stable economic growth and facilitate integration not only concerns the future of Europe but also has a great impact on China,' Wen said.

"Supply teacher David McNally told pupils 'Hitler wasn't all bad - he killed the Jews, the gays and the disabled' A teacher has been struck off for after telling pupils that 'Hitler wasn't all bad - he killed the Jews, the gays and the disabled'.

The supply teacher was found to be unfit to teach at a GTC hearing today. The comments were brought to light when pupils complained to their parents, who contacted the school. Mr McNally did not attend the hearing but accepted he had made the remarks in his written submission to the hearing. He said that he was having a 'particularly bad day' and had made the comments in a 'general sense'. The GTC panel rejected his suggestion. The Hitler comments were said to a class in which he also asked pupils: 'Did you have sex at the weekend?' The GTC panel heard that he told a third-year class: 'I love my mobile phone because I can sit and watch porn on it.' He was also reported to have said: 'I have a part-time job at a children's home - they have taught me how to whip a child with a wet towel without leaving a mark.'

"Theory: Mathematics professor Jordan Ellenberg says it is better to arrive later at an airport and risk missing a flight, rather than wait for hours for a plane . It is a question that can leave many holidaymakers baffled. Is it better to arrive at the airport early and while away hours in Duty Free, or set off late and risk missing the flight? Now a mathematician says he has hit upon the formula for the optimal time to arrive at the airport that minimises wasted time at the airport, yet also ensures passengers will only have a one or two percent chance of missing their plane. According to American mathematics . professor Jordan Ellenberg, every hour a passenger spends at the airport . rather than in the comfort of their own home is a negative unit. In . his new book How Not To Be Wrong - The Hidden Maths Of Everyday Life, . Prof Ellenberg instead recommends that holidaymakers and business . travellers leave it later to catch their flights, even if that means . potentially missing the plane, so as not to amass too many wasted hours . over the course of a lifetime. Former child prodigy Prof Ellenberg, who teaches mathematics at University of Wisconsin, says the optimal time to arrive 'depends on how you personally feel about the relative merits of missing planes and wasting time,' according to the Sunday Times. 'But if in the course of a lifetime you never miss a flight then you may not have the best strategy.' In the book, released on Tuesday, Prof . Ellenberg sets out to show how mathematics can impact on, and explain, a . host of every day occurrences. Whiling away the hours: Prof Ellenberg says every hour spent waiting in the lounge or wandering through Duty Free is a negative unit . Prof Ellenberg argues that 'if you've never missed a flight, you're not doing it right'. He says that although passengers who arrive at the airport three hours before their flight will never miss it, they will spend numerous 'negative units' of time waiting in a lounge, or wandering through Duty Free. The professor says the optimal time to arrive gives passengers a one or two percent chance of missing the plane, but reduces this wasted time. How long passengers are prepared to leave it is up to them, says Prof Ellenberg . He tackles a number of dilemmas and issues including why tall parents have shorter children, what is the best way to get rich by playing the lottery and why women might struggle to find their perfect man. Prof Ellenberg also weighs in to a debate on how governments will never be able to completely cut out money wasted, as doing so will result in politicians spending too much time fighting against waste. 'You can't do calculus by common sense,' he writes. 'But calculus is still derived from common sense - Newton took our physical intuition about objects moving in straight lines, formalised it, and then built on top of that formal structure a universal mathematical description of motion. 'Once you have Newton's theory in hand, you can apply it to problems that would make your head spin if you had no equations to help you.'","Jordan Ellenberg says passengers should leave it later to catch a flight .

"The man accused of killing both his son and his first wife to cash in on insurance policies is heard on tape admitting he accidentally caused a truck to fall on his son, which crushed him, and then left him to die, it emerged today. Karl Karlsen, 52, from Waterloo, New York, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder and insurance fraud last year after his second wife Cindy - fearing for her life - agreed to wear a wire while talking to him about his son's death. A judge ruled recently that the never-before-heard tapes could be used as evidence against him in his trial. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Accused: Karl Karlsen is on trial for second-degree murder in the death of his son Levi, who was crushed to death by a truck . Tragic loss: After ten hours interrogation by police, he finally admitted he had been there when the truck fell on his son Levi and had accidentally caused it to happen, before leaving him to die . Second wife: Knowing about the insurance payout on his son, when Cindy, pictured, found out her husband took out a $1.2million policy on her, she grew suspicious and feared for her life . Before the death of his son Levi in . 2008, for which he received a $700,000 life insurance payout, his first . wife Christina perished in a house fire after getting trapped in the . bathroom in 1991. Karlsen cashed in on a $200,000 life insurance policy soon after. On the tapes, obtained by ABC's Nightline, the 52-year-old can be heard telling Cindy while they were in a restaurant that he had removed his truck's front tires and raised it on a single jack before Levi volunteered to do the repair. 'I . didn't push the truck, I said,' Karlsen said after Cindy asked him for . the truth in Levi's death. 'No, I said I had nothing to do -- . but I said I took advantage of the situation once it happened.' Police arrested Karlsen soon after and interrogated him for ten hours, in which he denied killing his son 75 times. In . the police interrogation tapes, also obtained by ABC News, he said: 'I . found him dead. I f***ing panicked. I don't know. I don't know. I left . him.' Confession: After ten hours of interrogation by police, Karlsen finally admitting playing a part in his son's death and leaving him to die . Suspicious: Karl Karlsen's first wife Christina perished in a house fire after she became trapped in the bathroom - the windows of which, Karlsen had boarded up with wood and 17 nails just days before . Finally he told police he had been there when the truck fell on his son and caused it to fall. 'I . opened the truck door because I had to get inside to move the linkage . for the truck, and when I did, it tipped, and it just, whoosh, f***ing . fell over,' Karlsen said. He maintains it was an accident, but did admit that he left his son to die. 'He . did admit that he caused the truck to fall on his son. He did admit . that he left his son on the floor dying, but he never admitted that it . was a planned, deliberate act,' said Seneca County Lt Investigator John . Cleere.

Knowing . about the insurance payout on his son, when Cindy found out her husband . took out a $1.2million policy on her, she grew suspicious and feared for . her life. Wire-tapped: Karl Karlsen was recorded by his wife explaining how a truck his son was working on was precariously balanced . That's what prompted her to work with . police, leading to second-degree murder and insurance fraud charges . against Karl Karlsen in the death of his 23-year-old son, Levi. And . New York and California authorities are now taking a new look at the . circumstances of the 1991 death of his former wife, Christina Karlsen. Cindy . Karlsen's cooperation evolved from an unnerving revelation a year . before she came forward. She learned Karlsen had invested some of the . insurance money from his son's death into a life insurance policy on . her. ‘I would be worth $1.2 million dead to Karl,’ she testified during a pretrial proceeding. After speaking to sheriff's investigators last year, she agreed to wear a wire to secretly record her husband. She made several recordings, the first three using a digital gadget hidden in her bra. The final recording took place in a . crowded restaurant in New York's picturesque Finger Lakes region in . hopes of getting him to confirm her suspicions about the death of his . son. ‘I led him to believe . our marriage had a chance if he came clean,’ Cindy Karlsen said in a . recent hearing, the husband she is now in the process of divorcing . sitting in prison orange just a few feet away. ‘I told him he could . trust me.’ The wire picked up Karl Karlsen . telling Cindy how he'd removed his truck's front tires and raised it on a . single jack before asking Levi to repair the brake and transmission . lines. Levi Karlsen, father of two young children, was crushed to death by a pickup truck at his family's farm . Suspect: Karl Karlsen arriving for a court appearance at the Seneca County Courthouse in Waterloo, New York, last December . ‘It was so wobbly,’ Karlsen said, according to a recording of the conversation, heard . against the backdrop of restaurant noise, played recently in court. Tell the truth, Cindy Karlsen implored. ‘It was never meant to be,’ he said. ‘It was never planned from Day One to ever go that way.’ Karlsen . was charged a week later. The 52-year-old has pleaded not guilty to the . second-degree murder charge in advance of his trial scheduled for next . month. If convicted, he could get up to life behind bars. In . an interview with The Post-Standard of Syracuse a month after his . arrest, Karlsen said his ex-wife's death, his son's death and even a . 2002 fire at his Seneca County farm that killed his Belgian draft . horses, for which he collected $80,000 (£50,000) in insurance money, . were all just coincidences. But . Art Alexander, Christina Karlsen's father, told The Associated Press . from his Murphys, California, home that he didn't think bad luck had . anything to do with it. ‘I . think it's a very greedy man with a very cold heart,’ said Alexander, . who has long suspected that his son-in-law and former business partner . was responsible for his 30-year-old daughter's death. Karl Karlsen has been charged with murdering his son and will be reinvestigated for a fire that killed his first wife. He collected insurance payouts on both occasions .

Alexander was told, was trapped in the bathroom after spilled kerosene . was ignited by a faulty electric light. Although Karl Karlsen is . credited with getting Levi and their other two children out safely, . Christina was unable to escape through the bathroom window because . Karlsen had boarded it up from the outside days before, saying it was . broken. ‘Seventeen nails were in that board,’ Alexander, 73, recalls. The . insurance policy, he said, had been taken out just before Christmas. The fire happened New Year's Day. Karlsen's abrupt move to New York and . away from scrutiny further stoked the father's suspicions.

The 47-year-old met Christine Bell, who was burgled by Gilbert twice, and said he will never steal from another house again. Serial burglar Martin Gilbert has vowed to turn his life around after meeting Christine Bell, one of his victims . Martin Gilbert climbing through the window of a property and escaping with a laptop. Gilbert was jailed for three-and-a-half years in November 2011 for a burglary spree during which he raided 18 homes . Gilbert said: 'I just want to say sorry to everyone I have burgled. 'At the time I didn't think about the victims at all, I was so off my head on drugs and alcohol. 'I was in a bad state and was just doing it for money to feed my habit. I just needed money. 'But I've realised now and I'm just really really sorry for all the pain and hurt I have caused.' Gilbert was jailed for three-and-a-half years in November 2011 for a burglary spree during which he raided 18 homes, stealing cash and jewellery worth almost £30,000, predominantly from elderly people's bungalows and during broad daylight. He was eventually caught by police when he was caught on CCTV using residents' own tools to smash his way into their homes. At one house he even took socks off the washing line to cover his hands to prevent fingerprints. At Newcastle Crown Court Gilbert, whose son Paul was murdered in 2008, pleaded guilty to raiding four homes in the Gosforth and Jesmond areas, and asked for a further 14 burglaries to be taken into consideration by the court. Gilbert glances into the camera during the theft, which took place in daylight . The burglar was released from prison on licence in July last year, after serving 21 months behind bars. And as part of his rehabilitation the probation service, now know as the Northumbria Community Rehabilitation Company, offered him the opportunity to take part in a 'restorative justice' programme. The scheme gives victims the opportunity to meet the offenders that targeted them to explain the impact the crimes had on their lives. It also means the criminals can make amends for what they have done by apologising and being held to account. 'I just wanted to see the other side and see what my victims had to say,' he said. 'I have been in and out of prison most of my life, but this time I just thought; ""I don't want to end up back here. I need to change my ways"".' The past is in the past: Gilbert, who has two daughters and is a grandfather, is now determined that his most recent spell in prison will be his last . Ms Bell agreed to take part in the scheme and come face-to-face with the thief. The 55-year-old said: 'I said yes straight away. I just thought I could do that and there was a little bit of me that was curious about who did it and why.' Gilbert first broke into the home Christine shared with her children and husband Terry, 56, in March 2011. The break-in prompted them to ramp-up security at their Jesmond bungalow installing sophisticated CCTV and bars on the windows. When he decided to try his luck again, in September, he was caught on camera spending an hour breaking into the home by prising open a window and squeezing through. 'When I met him I asked him why he did it. He said he wanted money for drink and drugs,' said Christine, who works as a court usher. 'I started to understand that what he took was just a means to any ends for him. I said he didn't realise what it must have been like to me. 'He apologised honestly and said how sorry he was and I believed him. I felt it was genuine. 'Saying sorry doesn't make anything better. But if meeting me does make him see that it was a horrible thing to do to someone and stops him doing it again it'll be worth it. 'I hope he gets a job and I hope things work out for him.' Mother-of-two Christine also told Gilbert of her heartache at losing her daughter Leonie, in 2012. The 20-year-old died after suffering an epileptic fit in her bedroom. Gilbert says Christine's understanding and forgiveness has helped motivate him to go straight. 'I was a bit worried at first. I was half expecting her to jump over the table and hit me,' he said. 'But when I met her I couldn't have asked for a nicer woman. We talked about how what I did had affected both of us and our families. She broke down and I was breaking down. 'Since the burglary she has had bars put on her windows and that she was nervous going into the house. That was a real shock to me to know she didn't feel safe because of me. 'I had to reassure her that I would never burgle her house again, I said: ""I'm really sorry and you have got nothing to worry about"". 'If I'm ever tempted again I will think of her.' Gilbert, who has two daughters and is a grandfather, is now determined that his most recent spell in prison will be his last. 'I realised I needed to make some big changes,' he said. 'I'm now drug free and I have got new accommodation and hopefully I'll have my own place soon. 'I would love to have a job. I have never worked before and don't know what it's like to have wages coming into the bank every month. 'I don't want to spend any more time in prison. I have wasted most my life'","Martin Gilbert has vowed to never burgle again after meeting Christine Bell .

"Seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry will not be returning to the professional tour in order to try and qualify for this year's tournament, but has not ruled out doing so in the future. The Scot, considered by many as the greatest player of all-time, retired in 2012 but has spoken several times since of being tempted to play again. He was one of three men to be offered a free wildcard to qualify for this year's Crucible showpiece, with active players Steve Davis and James Wattana the others. Former snooker No 1 Stephen Hendry will not be competing at this year's snooker World Championship . Hendry makes an appearance at the 2014 Dafabet Masters at Alexandra Palace, London . The 46-year-old is applauded by his peers at the Crucible after announcing his retirement in 2012 . Hendry is not planning on using his this time around, though. Speaking to talkSPORT he said: 'I'm not going to play this season, I'm not playing the World Championship this season, definitely not, but I think I will definitely play a tournament again in my lifetime. 'I'll definitely play again because I just love snooker and don't see a reason why I wouldn't play again at some time. Hendry claimed the first of his seven World Championships as the youngest ever winner in 1990 . 'I'm not ready. Unless I can do myself justice and play well I'm not going to play. There's no point me turning up at the World Championship just as a publicity stunt and then lose 10-3 to someone who shouldn't tie my shoelaces. I will play again.' Hendry saw his record of 775 career centuries beaten by Ronnie O'Sullivan last month, and with 39-year-old O'Sullivan still playing and on five world titles, some think he could also take Hendry's other major record. 'I don't think that'll go, I don't think he'll win three more,' Hendry added of his seven world crowns.

"Health officials have admitted their response to the potential Ebola outbreak in Texas has been ‘rocky’ - amid growing concern over how a patient with the virus was able to get through customs, was initially turned away from hospital with painkllers and Hazmat teams then took five days to properly quarantine his relatives. Dr Anthony Fauci, a director at the National Institutes of Health, told reporters at the White House that there were 'things that did not go the way they should have in Dallas', but insisted they had prevented an outbreak. However, during the press conference he also said things did go right - mentioning that Thomas Eric Duncan was now in isolation and being treated properly. But he ignored the length of time of the response and the fact that hundreds of people may have been unnecessarily exposed to the infected patient. Scroll down for video . Dr Anthony Fauci, a director at the National Institutes of Health, told reporters that the response to the Ebola case in Dallas was 'rocky' and admitted things 'did not gone the way they should have' 'There were things that did not go the way they should have in Dallas, but there were a lot of things that went right and are going right,' Dr. Anthony Fauci, a director at the National Institutes of Health, told reporters at the White House. 'So, although certainly it was rocky in terms of how people perceived the response, the reason I said there wouldn't be an outbreak is because of what is going on right now,' Fauci said. The handling of the Dallas case in the early stages of Duncan's illness has raised questions about how prepared local and national health officials were to handle that case and whether people were unnecessarily exposed. Fauci said although it 'may be entirely conceivable' that there would be another Ebola case in the United States, the strength of the healthcare infrastructure 'would make it extraordinarily unlikely that we would have an outbreak.' Dr Fauci said contact tracing of people who may have been exposed to Thomas Eric Duncan is 'now' going on, five days after he was hospitalized . Authorities have narrowed their focus to about 50 people who had direct or indirect contact with the infected Liberian visitor, including 10 at high risk who are being checked twice daily for symptoms. Dr Fauci said contact tracing is 'now' going on, five days after Duncan was hospitalized. Officials were asked at a news conference why the patient was able to get past screening in his journey from Liberia on September 19 and then be sent home after telling a Dallas hospital a few days later about his travel to a country where there had been an Ebola outbreak. The case has put authorities and the public on alert over concerns that the worst epidemic of Ebola on record could spread from West Africa, where it began in March. The World Health Organization on Friday updated its death toll to at least 3,439 out of 7,492 suspected, probable and confirmed cases. The epidemic has hit hardest in impoverished Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. At Friday's news conference, White House adviser Lisa Monaco was asked whether she would recommend to President Barack Obama that he impose a travel ban on West Africa, as some public officials have called for. 'Right now we believe those types of steps actually impede the response,' Monaco said. Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins leads one of the quarantined patients out of the property in Ivy Apartments. He was critizied earlier this week for the response to the Ebola case . U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, urged Obama to order U.S. airports to screen travelers coming from Ebola-hit countries. As part of the U.S. effort to help contain the spread of Ebola, the Pentagon on Friday said the number of military personnel that could be deployed to West Africa could reach nearly 4,000, more than earlier estimates of about 3,000. A cleanup crew was decontaminating the Dallas apartment where Duncan had been staying before he was admitted to the hospital five days ago. Four people close to Duncan who were quarantined in the apartment in a northeastern section of the city have been moved to an undisclosed location, said Sana Syed, the public information officer for the City of Dallas. A clean-up crew did not decontaminate the apartment Duncan had been staying for five days after he had been hospitalized. Four family members were quarantined inside until it was deemed safe . Out of 100 people who had direct or indirect contact with Duncan, health officials are monitoring 50 on a daily basis and closely watching 10 people at higher risk, said Dr. David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services. The observations include fever checks at least twice daily. Ebola, which can cause fever, vomiting and diarrhea, spreads through contact with bodily fluids such as blood or saliva. Sheets and other items used by the man in the apartment have been sealed in plastic bags, but questions have been raised about the delay in sanitizing it. Dr Fauci said the 'good things' about the response were that Thomas Eric Duncan (pictured) is now in isolation and is being treated . A crew from the Cleaning Guys, a hazardous materials cleanup company, garbed in yellow hazardous material suits and masks, went inside the apartment and packed the soiled sheets, Duncan's luggage and other personal items into blue barrels, the county fire marshal said. The mattress was being cut into pieces to fit into the barrels. Another official said the cleaners would take the containers to a secure location. Since Duncan's diagnosis, people have visited hospitals in a few states and were checked for Ebola symptoms. On Friday, Howard University Hospital in Washington said it admitted and isolated a patient with possible symptoms who had recently traveled from Nigeria 'in an abundance of caution.' The CDC says outbreaks in Nigeria and Senegal appear to have been contained. In Congress, U.S. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, a Republican, and ranking Democrat Nita Lowey set an Oct. 17 deadline for the Obama administration to provide details of its plan to deal with the outbreak, including how each agency is contributing and monthly costs. The critical issue of how hospitals in the United States should handle and dispose of medical waste from Ebola patients is being addressed, the government said. The U.S. Department of Transportation said it expected to release new guidelines on Friday that would allow Texas hospitals to dispose safely of Ebola-infected medical wastes. NBC News said on Thursday that one of its freelance cameramen, Ashoka Mukpo, 33, had contracted Ebola in Liberia, the fifth American to be diagnosed after being infected in West Africa. NBC has said the entire reporting crew would return to the United States under quarantine for 21 days, the maximum incubation period for Ebola. The Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha said in a statement that an Ebola patient was scheduled to arrive for treatment on Monday morning. Mukpo's father, Mitchell Levy, told Reuters his son was going to Nebraska for treatment.","Dr Anthony Fauci said  'things that did not go the way they should have'

"Country singer Billy Ray Cyrus honored a Nevada teacher killed by a 12-year-old student in a schoolyard shooting last year, calling him a 'true American hero.' Cyrus praised Michael Landsberry and presented a memorial plaque to his widow, Sharon, during a concert Saturday night in Incline Village, a Nevada community on north shore of Lake Tahoe. Police say Landsberry, a 45-year-old ex-Marine, tried to talk the shooter, 12-year-old Jose Reyes, into turning over the handgun before he was shot in the chest Oct. 21 at a middle school in the Reno suburb of Sparks. The student wounded two classmates before taking his life. Hero: Billy Ray Cyrus meets with the widow of Michael Landsberry, whom the country star lauded as a hero on Saturday . 'Tonight we are here to honor a true American hero,' Cyrus told a crowd of over 1,000. 'Michael Landsberry made the ultimate sacrifice to save his students after serving three terms in Afghanistan.' Cyrus said Landsberry also represented the courage of the Vietnam veteran honored in his patriotic song, Some Gave All. With a large photograph of Landsberry in the background and the math teacher's widow on stage, Cyrus led the crowd in singing the song. Cyrus said he was moved by the story of Landsberry's actions in the school shooting and decided to recognize him when offered a chance to perform at Lake Tahoe. He and his father, Ronald Ray Cyrus, made similar presentations honoring American heroes for more than a decade, and this marked the first time the country star has done so since his father's 2006 death. 'Just about every year, my dad and I would find an unsung hero and present them with a Some Gave All' award,' he told The Associated Press. 'I kind of play everything by ear, and I thought sometime when the time is right, I would love to recognize the sacrifice Michael made,' he continued. Marine: Landsberry, a former Marine, tried to get Jose Reyes to put the gun down before the 12-year-old killer fatally shot him . Sharon Landsberry thanked Cyrus and said his tribute moved her and their two daughters, Alisa Cook, 25, and Andrea Cook, 18. Alisa Cook also attended the concert, while Andrea Cook offered a videotaped message from an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, where she serves in the Marines. 'We all love him today. ... He lives within all of us,' Sharon Landsberry said of her husband. Cyrus, who rose to fame in 1992 with the hit song Achy Breaky Heart, also gave her a 'financial gift.' The amount was not disclosed. Interviews with Reyes' parents, teachers and classmates and the boy's own writings paint a portrait of a child troubled by depression and feelings of inadequacy at home and tormented by a school life in which he was mocked, teased and mistreated. Some warning signs were there. His father had taken him to a psychotherapist just three days before the shooting and the doctor proscribed an antidepressant after the boy told of being teased at school, called 'gay' and accused of peeing in his pants. His mother had done research on autism after Jose showed signs of it. 'True American hero': Cyrus mentioned Landsberry's three tours in Afghanistan when honoring the 'true American hero' A look at his phone and his video viewing habits was more troubling. In addition to phone images of the two teens who committed suicide after killing 13 at Colorado's Columbine High School in 1999, Sparks Police Chief Brian Allen said Tuesday investigators found searches on the Reyes family laptop in both July and October for 'Super Columbine Massacre Role Playing Game.' Forty-seven of the 69 video games in the boy's collection were 'violent themed first-person shooter or shooter type games' such as Grand Theft Auto V,  Assassins Creed and Call of Duty 4. The youth who had wrestled with speech problems since kindergarten, who students told police been called 'stupid' and/or 'retard' in the hallways and poked by others in the side, tried to explain in separate suicide notes that offer insight and contradiction. In one to 'teachers and students,' Allen said the boy 'clearly expressed anger ... over his belief that he was embarrassed and mistreated at school' and 'indicated he would get revenge.' Reyes wrote that he'd been called gay, lazy, stupid, an idiot, had his money stolen and been accused of wetting his pants. Killer: 12-year-old Jose Reyes showed several signs that he was capable of violence - investigators discovered the boy's admiration for the Columbine High School killers . 'Well that all ends. Today I will get revenge on the students and teachers for ruining my life,' he wrote, adding that he would bring a pistol and rifle to school 'to shoot you and see how you like it when someone (sic) making fun of you.' 'Have a great death at school,"" he said on the one-page note of spiral notebook paper he closed with a drawing of a tombstone that read: 'Sparks Middle School 1965-2013.' But in the second contradictory note to his parents, he said 'this shooting is not because of the shooting games, bullying or other stuff.' He said it was because 'some bad things in the past cause of me.' 'And now I'm just a monster,' Reyes wrote. 'If you hate me and my family doesn't love me it's okay. I know that I'm just an idiot. But I love you and I wish the past would be good and better someday.' Police learned one of the students shot during the rampage had teased Reyes about not having muscles during a physical education class, had called him names and may have played a part in pouring water on him when he was accused of wetting his pants. The mistreatment didn't rise to the level to merit bullying charges, Allen said. Terrifying: Two other students were wounded before Reyes killed Landsberry and then took his own life . Police earlier said Reyes' parents could be charged if they knowingly made the 9 mm pistol available to the boy. But Allen said Tuesday the investigation turned up no evidence that Jose and Liliana Reyes were aware that their son knew where the 9 mm pistol was kept in a kitchen cabinet. Ken Robison, a Reno lawyer for the parents, said prosecutors indicated to him earlier they would not be charged, but Tuesday's announcement brought a 'sense of relief.' Allen said the boy acted alone and did not communicate his plan to anyone. 'We will never know the complete motive or intent behind this tragic incident as the only person with the true knowledge felt acting out in violence and taking his own life was the best course of action,' he said. 'That in itself is a tragedy.'","Michael Landsberry was fatally shot by a 12-year-old student at Sparks High School in Nevada on October 21, 2013 .

"Lynette Nock died after taking the banned party drug GBL during a wake for her friend who was killed by the same lethal substance hours earlier . A successful accountant died after taking a party drug during an impromptu 'wake' for her friend who had been killed by the same substance just hours earlier, an inquest has heard. Aston Martin engineer Carl Fearon, 24, was found dead on a friend's sofa after taking the banned drug GBL. Just hours later his friend Lynette Nock, 28, took the same drug -  which is sold as an alloy wheel cleaner - during an impromptu wake held in his honour at her home. She lost consciousness and was rushed to hospital but died later the same day. An inquest heard the pair were part of a group of 'ravers' who used recreational drugs including horse tranquilizer Ketamine and Mephedrone at weekends. Recording a verdict that both friends had died of drug-related deaths, the senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull Louise Hunt issued a grave warning to people taking legal highs. She said: 'This case highlights the very extreme risks that people take when using legal highs, particularly in combination with alcohol. 'These substances shouldn't be taken and they do have a traumatic effect which your family is living through for the rest of their lives.' Mr Fearon, from Kings Norton, Birmingham, had returned to his friend Matthew Hayes' flat in the city centre on April 27, 2012 when he began 'swaying' and collapsed, the inquest heard. Mr Hayes told the inquest: 'He fell against the other wall and I grabbed him and lay him on the settee. 'We'd seen it a thousand times before with everybody else. It was normal.' The friend said he checked he was breathing before going to bed but was shocked to discover him dead when he returned from a trip to the shop the next morning. He added: 'I checked his pulse but there was nothing. I tried everything to make him wake up.' Mr Fearon's father Brian told the inquest he had spoken to his son on the morning before his death and warned him not do anything 'daft'. He said: 'He said he was going out with the lads for a drink. I said ""don't do anything daft"" and he said ""I won't dad"". 'We were aware that he took recreational drugs. I'd spoken to him various times about it. 'Carl's idea of recreational drugs was that they were safer. As he put it, more people die from drinking than smoking or recreational drugs. 'As far as I'm aware, for almost four months he hadn't taken anything. He was full of beans, full of life.' Miss Nock collapsed just hours later at her home in Northfield, Birmingham. Doctors worked on her for 45 minutes after she was rushed to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham but couldn't save her. Aston Martin engineer Carl Fearon, 24, was found dead on a friend's sofa after taking the banned drug GBL . The inquest heard a toxicology report found Ketamine and small amounts of methadrone were also found in her system along with GBL. Her boyfriend Graeme Cooper described her as a 'free spirit' and said he had warned her against taking any legal highs. He told the hearing: 'Before I left, the last thing I said to her was not to take any of it. 'Those were my last words to her. When I came back she was completely unconscious.' Detective Constable Julia Woodall said witnesses told them Lynette had begun to behave erratically at the wake, falling over and 'spinning around a washing pole'. The West Midlands Police officer said an extensive investigation had traced the drugs to a German supplier, who has now been shut down. She added: 'It was very cheap to buy and import in large quantities and you take it in a very small dose.' Mr Fearon, from Kings Norton, Birmingham, had returned to his friend Matthew Hayes' flat in the city centre on April 27, 2012 when he began 'swaying' and collapsed, the inquest heard . Two other men also needed medical treatment after the wake. Paying tribute to Lynette after her death in 2012, her devastated parents Dave and Tracie said: 'She was really bright, in fact school was too easy for her. 'She was like an agony aunt and was so kind that she would get into trouble with debt collectors because she would lend her friends money. 'The whole family is in shock. It's just tragic when parents lose a child.' Friends of Mr Fearon, nicknamed 'Fee', also paid tribute to him on a Facebook memorial page. The Class C drug GBL, which has a similar effect as ecstasy and alcohol, was banned in December 2009 following a spate of deaths. Nicknamed 'Coma in a Bottle', it is illegal to take as a stimulant but can be imported from Europe for its intended use as an industrial cleaner. A close relative of GBL is also used by date rapists to spike drinks because it is odourless and colourless and can be out of a victim's system within 12 hours.","Aston Martin engineer Carl Fearon, 24, was found dead on a friend's sofa .

DNA result for the bolognese sauce but a spokesman added: ‘We have no . positive test results for horse DNA in any of the other products but we . feel it is the right thing to withdraw them as a precaution.’ Supermarket giant Asda announced it had . withdrawn its 500g Beef Bolognese Sauce, left, from sale after tests . indicated the presence of horse DNA. Its 600g Beef Broth Soup, right, . was also withdrawn as a precaution . Concerns: The supermarket chain also withdrew . its 500g Meat Feast Pasta Sauce, left, as a precaution as well as the . 400g Chilli Con Carne Soup, right . Sainsbury’s said it was carrying out . tests for the presence of horse DNA but added that Greencore used a . different beef supplier for its products. A spokesman said: ‘Greencore makes . some of our pasta sauces. We are testing those that contain beef. However, we know that our beef is from a different supplier to that used . by Asda. 'Ours is from a British supplier, . Asda’s is from southern Ireland. We have already carried out tests on a . range of our beef products including burgers, ready meals and minced . meat and no trace of horse DNA has been found in any of our products.’ The Co-op said Greencore supplies six pasta sauces to the company, but none of these include beef. Meanwhile, Morrisons has removed two . beef salami products from 11 stores as a precaution while tests are . carried out. There is no evidence the products contain horse meat. The . manufacturer says the lines are made in the UK from British beef. Held: Dafydd Raw-Rees, owner of Farmbox Meats, pictured today, was arrested this evening . In custody: The owner of Welsh factory Farmbox Meats, which is at the centre of the horsemeat scandal, was tonight arrested by police. The factory is pictured today . The move came as the millionaire owner . of a meat processing factory was among three people arrested as part of . a fraud investigation linked to the horse meat scandal. Yesterday’s arrests are the first in . the UK as part of a joint investigation by the FSA and the police into . alleged criminal attempts to pass off horse meat as beef. It is understood that Dafydd Raw-Rees . and Colin Patterson, of Farmbox Meats, based near Aberystwyth, and . slaughterman Peter Boddy, from West Yorkshire, were taken into custody. Earlier this week, the police raided . the Welsh factory and an abattoir operated by Mr Boddy. Mr Raw-Rees, a . former Lib Dem councillor and president of the local golf club, . defiantly told journalists how his staff were still preparing  horse . meat for a foreign company – despite an order to cease operations – and . declared his innocence of any breaches of food safety. Mr Boddy has been accused by the FSA . of providing horse carcasses to Farmbox Meats which were subsequently . processed and passed off as beef. Worrying: Supermarket giant Asda announced it had withdrawn its 500g Beef Bolognese Sauce from sale after tests indicated the presence of horse DNA. Three other products were also withdrawn . Meanwhile, the French government named . a company called Spanghero as being guilty of ‘an economic fraud’. It . said the firm had knowingly imported horse meat from Romania before . re-labelling it as beef and sending it on to firm Comigel, which used . the meat to make meals, including lasagnes for Findus, Tesco and Aldi. Speaking about this evening's arrests, a Dyfed-Powys Police spokesman said: 'Dyfed-Powys Police have today made . arrests at both meat plants inspected by the Food Standards Agency on . Tuesday. 'At Farmbox Meats near Aberystwyth, Dyfed-Powys Police have arrested two . men aged 64 years and 42 years, and in a simultaneous operation police . arrested a man aged 63 at the Peter Boddy Slaughterhouse in Todmorden, . West Yorkshire. 'Approvals for both operations were suspended yesterday by the FSA so neither firm was operational. 'Dyfed Powys Police can confirm the three people have been arrested on . suspicion of offences under the Fraud Act and they are being detained at . Aberystwyth Police Station where they will be interviewed jointly by . Police and FSA staff in what has this afternoon become a joint . operation.' Mr Raw-Rees has denied any wrongdoing and says he is fully licensed to process horsemeat at his plant. He claims horse carcasses are shipped in from Ireland to be boned and cut up before being packed and sent to Belgium. Mr Raw-Rees, a former county councillor, employs 14 staff at the plant which has ceased production during the investigation. He has also been revealed as a millionaire who enjoys a jet-set lifestyle. The 64-year-old has been pictured holidaying on a yacht and at a star-studded ball in Abu Dhabi, where he once attended the local Grand Prix. Defiant: Mr Raw-Rees, pictured here on a yacht, has previously denied any wrongdoing and says he is fully licensed to process horsemeat at his plant . Last night, the French government accused Spanghero of . knowingly selling horsemeat masquerading as beef which ended up on . British plates. The firm was accused of being ‘guilty of an economic fraud’ and the French government said it was ‘well aware’ that the Romanian ‘beef’ they were dealing in was in fact horse. The firm, which had repeatedly denied knowing its meat was horse, immediately had its licence to trade withdrawn. Speaking at a press conference in Paris,  France’s consumer affairs minister Benoit Hamon unveiled a hard hitting initial report into the European-wide scandal. Mr Hamon said that companies from . Romania, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and France were all . involved in the supply chain that resulted in horsemeat reaching British . supermarket shelves. Spanghero, which is based in the rural south west near Toulouse, exported . their Romanian meat to the French frozen food giant Comigel. It was . eventually sold on to British companies including Aldi and Tesco. Accused: Major French food company Spanghero was today officially accused of knowingly selling horsemeat masquerading as beef which ended up on British plates . Scandal: Meat from Spanghero found its way into Findus beef lasagne in Britain . Mr Hamon said that Poujol, the holding company of Spanghero, ‘acquired the frozen meat from a Cypriot trader who had subcontracted the order to a trader located in the Netherlands, who in turn was supplied by an abattoir in Romania.’ Mr Hamon said a ‘fraudulent trade’ in ‘beef’ had been going on since at least August, with receipts suggesting that it has been worth around 300,000 euros. He suggested that some of the . consignments of meat Spanghero were dealing in were ‘100 per cent . horse’, yet they continually denied trading in it. Earlier, it emerged that Spanghero was billed for 42 tonnes of low grade horsemeat on January 4. Le . Parisien newspaper published a bill that was made out to Spanghero and . printed on the headed paper of Draap Trading, the Dutch-run which is a . Cyprus-based intermediary which sourced meat in Romania for Spanghero. Not for sale: This Tesco Everyday Value spaghetti bolognese was withdrawn from Tesco shelves after it was also supplied with meat which came from Spanghero . The . bill contains the numbers 0205 0080 – the international code for frozen . horsemeat – and related to the fat, tendons and other pieces left over . after the horse has been deboned and the prime cuts removed. Romanian . officials have been angered by what they see as an attempt by the . French companies involved in the scandal to point the finger of blame at . their abattoirs. They . insist horsemeat leaving their slaughterhouses would have been clearly . labelled as such and that the fraud must have occurred further along the . food chain. Spanghero, which is based in . Castelnaudary, near Toulouse, said in a statement earlier this week that . it did not ‘sell, re-sell or process horsemeat in any form.’  Spanghero . denied receiving any bill for horsemeat from Draap Trading. Spanghero . is a subsidiary of Lur Berri, a Basque agricultural cooperative which . has 5000 farms supplying it, and which has a turnover of close to 1 . billion pounds a year. Food scandal: The company has been accused of being 'guilty of an economic fraud' Under pressure: Spanghero exported its Romanian meat to the French frozen food giant Comigel. Its offices in Metz, eastern France, are pictured . Just 20 months ago Spanghero was at the centre of a major E.coli scare, when inspectors feared that some 12 tonnes of beef mince from its plant was riddled with the potentially lethal bacteria. Spanghero, which was founded in 1970 by Claude and Laurent Spanghero, two former France international rugby players, insisted that it had been given a clean bill of health following the E.coli scare. Despite Spanghero’s multi-million pounds profits, its pre-cooked meals are widely mocked in a country which takes its food extremely seriously. There is a Facebook page dedicated to the ‘inedible products’ of Spanghero, and it has more than 25000 members, many of them French people who object to flagship products including veal in champagne sauce.

"A British man has been stabbed to death on the Caribbean island of Barbados, it has been claimed. The victim, who has not yet been named, was reportedly stabbed in the chest early yesterday morning following an altercation with a local man in St Lawrence Gap, Christ Church - a neighbourhood popular with tourists. The man, understood to be a telecommunications worker, was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in nearby Bridgetown, where he later died from his injuries. Mulligan was stabbed following an altercation with a local man in tourist hotspot, St Lawrence Gap. The neighbourhood is less than three miles from the capital, Bridgetown . The stabbing took place in the centre of the St Lawrence Gap neighbourhood, according to Barbados Today. Police information suggests the man was an employee of LIME - the Caribbean's leading telecommunications company, the newspaper claimed. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Barbados on June 15. 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this sad time.' Stabbed: Brian Mulligan was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital but died from his stab wounds . St Lawrence Gap is a one mile stretch of coastal road in the centre of the parish of Christ Church in south west Barbados. Commonly referred to as 'The Gap', the neighbourhood is dominated by the tourist industry, with lively bars, restaurants and nightclubs open until the early hours of the morning. The area is roughly three miles from Bridgetown - the capital of Barbados and the location of LIME's office on the island. The company, which dominates the landline, broadband and mobile phone industries throughout the Caribbean, is owned by UK-based Cable & Wireless Communications.","Man was stabbed in the chest following altercation in St Lawrence Gap .

"Jose Mourinho cut a confident figure on declaring that leaders Chelsea would definitely win the title in any other country from this commanding position. The Blues comfortably beat a gallant Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park to maintain their blistering start to a season which some believe could end with them emulating the Arsenal 'Invincibles' of a decade ago. Looking as relaxed as he has done all year, Mourinho had two words to describe why Chelsea didn’t succumb to defeat as they did at Palace in March, scribbling ‘big balls’ on a pad of paper. He had written ‘balls’ to sum up what they had lacked on losing four months ago. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Chelsea manager Mourinho having journalists in stitches . Jose Mourinho scribbled 'Big Balls' on to a journalist's note pad before signing it after his side's win . Mourinho celebrates Chelsea's 2-1 win at Crystal Palace which saw them remain top of the Premier League . Cesc Fabregas' temper got the better of him during a flare-up with Palace striker Fraizer Campbell . Mourinho - who has already manufactured a five-point gap over champions Manchester City - was mindful of respecting the competition, although it is clear that anything other than clinching a first title since 2010 would be deemed a failure. They may have to do that while constantly managing the fitness of Diego Costa, who is ruled out of the Champions League clash against Maribor on Tuesday. Once again the manager chose to snipe at the way in which Spain have treated his star striker. ‘If you were in another league I would say immediately “yes, we’ll do it”. In the Premier League the only thing I can say is that we can do it,’ Mourinho said. ‘In the Premier League it is stupid to say you’re going to do it because there are so many good teams and a long way to go - some very difficult runs in front of us. Cesc Fabregas celebrates scoring Chelsea's second goal in the win at Selhurst Park . Oscar (left) celebrates his opening goal from a free-kick with team-mate Eden Hazard . Diego Costa takes on Manchester City's Eliaquim Mangala earlier in the campaign, with the Chelsea striker's injury a cause of much frustration for Mourinho . ‘What is obvious - what you all feel - is that we are a better team than last season. There is a clear evolution. It’s not based on the fact that we bought two fantastic players [Costa and Cesc Fabregas].’ Costa was absent for the first time this campaign and remains a doubt for next Sunday’s trip to Manchester United. ‘After Arsenal he went to the national team, played two big matches against Slovakia and Luxembourg and has come back in a condition where he isn’t available for his club,’ Mourinho added. Asked if he had spoken to the Spanish medical staff, the 51-year-old was sardonic in reply. ‘For what? To spend money on calls? No. Mourinho makes a point with the fourth official during the Selhurst Park clash . Palace boss Neil Warnock greets Mourinho before his side's 2-1 defeat at the hands of Chelsea . Warnock was furious with the decision to send off of Damien Delaney (not pictured) ‘I think he’ll be in great condition in mid-November to be back for the national team. We’ll take good care of him. He’ll play for me when he has free time from the national team.’ Despite Mourinho's humorous scribblings it was no laughing matter for Neil Warnock, who bemoaned big-club bias after claiming a number of Craig Pawson's decisions were unfair on the Eagles. ‘Half the team surrounded the referee,’ he said. ‘I thought they influenced him at times today. I thought John Terry should have been booked early on [for a late challenge on Fraizer Campbell]. He left a lot to be desired - the ref has had better days.’","Blues beat Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park to maintain unbeaten start .

"This is the scene at the heart of the Ebola crisis sweeping West Africa, which this week crossed the Atlantic and brought the first confirmed case to the United States. The epicenter of the deadly virus is in impoverished Liberia, from which Thomas Duncan made his journey to Texas last month. Dying patients are wheeled from the spots in the street where they fell to medical centers unable to cope with the constant tide of sufferers. Scroll down for video . Stricken: A health worker sets down a woman thought to be suffering from Ebola outside a treatment center in Liberia . Barely coping: A patient waits on a mattress as a health worker approached with a thermometer - using a sheet of torn-up cardboard to carry the device, rather than his hands . Dying: The disease - which is almost always fatal - has affected thousands in West Africa. Above, health workers check on a patient who has been left suffering on a mattress in the treatment center . Overstretched: Government facilities in Liberia are struggling to cope with the ever-increasing number of patients . The latest figures from the World Health Organization show that the disease has now infected at least 7,423 people, with 3,355 confirmed deaths. Because of the difficulties getting and organizing reliable data on the disease, the true figures are likely to be much higher, officials have admitted. Many patients are not counted because they never get medical help, perhaps hidden by fearful families or turned away by overwhelmed clinics. Some villages have turned into 'shadow zones' where villagers' resistance or the remote location makes investigating numerous deaths impossible. Last week the U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimated there would be 8,000 cases reported in Liberia and Sierra Leone by September 30, but said the true figure would likely be 21,000 after correcting for under-reporting. Tainted home: Ebola workers carry a dead victim out of their home in Monrovia . Up close: Ordinary Liberians look on as a dead body is carried out of a house in the capital city . Death march: Workers in protective gear carry the corpse of an Ebola victim away for burial in Monrovia, Liberia . The outbreak has crippled already poor healthcare systems in countries such as Liberia, where Ebola patients are dying on the street and ambulances, medical staff, hospital beds and basic health kits are in short supply. The World Health Organization updated its death toll on Friday to at least 3,439 out of 7,492 suspected, probable and confirmed cases.Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea are the worst-hit nations. There had been 739 deaths in Guinea and 623 deaths in Sierra Leone by the end of Oct. 1, and 2,069 deaths in Liberia by Sept. 30, the data showed. There have also been eight deaths in Nigeria, the U.N. body said. Twenty cases have been recorded in Nigeria, one in Senegal and one in the United States. Quarantined: A Liberian health worker speaks with a family in a holding center for suspected Ebola cases . Infected? The virus, transmitted through bodily fluids, has killed thousands in Africa - and health officials think death tolls may be much too low . Worry: A mother and her three children wait in the center to see whether any of them have contracted the deadly virus . It came as the UN pledged an extra five helicopters, as well as a new fleet of vehicles and motorbikes to move around patients and reach remote communities. 'We have to as fast as we can because every day longer that it takes, more people die and that is not acceptable,' said Antony Banbury, the American diplomat who heads the United Nations Mission on Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER). He said: 'Nobody should be under the illusion that it will be easy. Thousands have died and more will die tomorrow.' Dangerous material: A health worker looks on at bags of contaminated trash . Danger: Dozens of health workers have died from exposure to the patients they were trying to save . Warning: A man passes a mural set up to warn people about the disease in Monrovia . The WHO has declared the Ebola epidemic an international public health emergency, and governments from the United States to China, Cuba and Britain have sent troops and medics to help contain the disease. As part of the U.S. effort to help contain the spread of Ebola, the Pentagon said on Friday the number of military personnel that could be deployed to West Africa could reach nearly 4,000, more than earlier estimates of about 3,000. British charity, Save the Children, said on Thursday that five people in Sierra Leone were contracting Ebola every hour and warned that could double by November if urgent actions were not taken. Outside: A charity worker speaks with quarantined orphans in Unification Town, 25 miles east of Monrovia. The children were quarantined when one of their number started showing signs of the disease .

"Some games from childhood last a lifetime and the 1990 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Crystal Palace is one that has stayed with me. I remember coming in from playing Sunday League football and being completely stunned that Liverpool could lose 4-3 to opponents like Palace. It was a defeat that stripped Liverpool’s aura of invincibility and, I felt, started the club’s demise. There is no doubt Palace have been a bogey team for Liverpool. They shattered Brendan Rodgers’ hopes of bringing the title back to Anfield and the effects of that 3-3 draw were still being felt all the way through to last November, when Liverpool folded at Selhurst Park and were beaten 3-1.

"The best in the world? For £5.136billion, the astronomical numbers from the latest TV deal, it would be easy to say that about the Barclays Premier League. But is it really ‘the best’? At this moment, I have to say no. We absolutely have the best football product in the business and that’s why the fight between TV companies to secure the rights was ferocious. On the day the deal was announced, Liverpool and Tottenham conjured up a thrilling contest, advertising all that is good about the Premier League, but, in terms of pure quality, I don’t think we can make the boast of being the best.

Mario Balotelli (centre) celebrates with his Liverpool team-mates after scoring the winner against Spurs . With the money that has flooded in, our teams should be carrying all before them in Europe. In the not-too-distant future, some clubs will be in a position where they will not only be able to get into bidding wars with Real Madrid and Barcelona but actually trump them. At the minute, however, we don’t have the strength and depth of other leagues on the continent and the resumption of both European competitions next week brings that sharply into focus. With the financial power English clubs have, we should be favourites to do a clean sweep. The Europa League, in particular, is something we should be stamping our presence all over. That tournament gets criticised but I believe it is the real indicator of how strong a country’s league is. England’s performance in the last 15 years has, frankly, been awful. Only Liverpool (2001) and Chelsea (2013) have lifted the trophy; Middlesbrough (2006) and Fulham (2010) are the others who have contested the final. Spanish teams, in the same period, have provided six winners and three other finalists. We have grossly underperformed. Chelsea players celebrate after beating Benfica in Amsterdam to win the 2013 Europa League . Robbie Fowler and Sami Hyypia hold up the trophy after Liverpool won the UEFA Cup in Dortmund in 2001 . Jamie Carragher (left) and Fowler pose for the cameras with the UEFA Cup trophy in 2001 . The Sevilla players and staff celebrate after beating Benfica in Turin to win the Europa League last year . It is the same in the Champions League. With Borussia Dortmund in the bottom three of the Bundesliga, Germany only has one team (Bayern Munich) capable of winning it. With the threat from Italy and France also minimal, the path should be clear but, of our three remaining candidates, only Chelsea look capable of going all the way. So it throws up the question of how clubs are investing their riches. And that is one of my big concerns: recruitment. Have these incredible figures put agents and players around the globe on alert that England is the place to come and make a killing? This is not just a deal for English football. Some will see it as a deal for world football but will our clubs now get kidded when they go looking for players? Only Chelsea have recruited well recently. Can Liverpool, Tottenham or Manchester United say the same? Is it too easy for these clubs to say ‘we’ve got the money’ rather than scouting properly? Do not confuse this for me saying clubs should only be buying British: I want to see clubs continue to buy stars such as Diego Costa, Alexis Sanchez and Angel di Maria; performers like Marco Reus and Paul Pogba would be welcome additions in the future and we want the best managers here, too. Diego Costa (left) in action for Chelsea against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium last month . Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez (right) looks to put in the challenge on Leicester City's Danny Simpson on Tuesday . Angel di Maria (centre) skips away during Manchester United's match against Burnley on Wednesday . My worry is we will see an influx of dross arriving, players who know they will get lavishly rewarded for not doing much but will block the development of young local talent. They are the most worrying transfers. Clubs cannot fall into a trap of thinking success will come just by throwing money around. I spoke to a respected figure who works in development football and he conducted a study of the top Premier League clubs’ use of players within their 25-man squads; essentially, there tends to be 14 or 15 players within each group — the mainstays — who play 75 per cent of all matches. We want the best players coming in to challenge them, the concern is the players who occupy the other eight to 10 places. We don’t want players to come in and snuff out the chances of local kids at the club, just because they have cost money. They add nothing and stop progress. Watching Jordon Ibe and Harry Kane in midweek put that into focus. Both players have had spells out on loan and such moves are becoming increasingly crucial in a young player’s education as they are competing against men for points and fighting to show they are good enough. With that experience, they should be given the chance to support the regulars. Only rarely do we get young English stars such as Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney or Raheem Sterling, who go straight into the team as a teenager. Clubs have a duty to give those who have put 10 years or more in at an academy a proper opportunity to succeed. Liverpool's Jordon Ibe (right) takes on Tottenham Hotspur's Ryan Mason during the Premier League clash . Kane (centre) fires a long-range effort towards goal to net the equaliser for Spurs at Anfield . Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas (right) looks towards Everton pair Steven Naismith and Gareth Barry . One aspect that should be looked at accordingly is the ‘homegrown’ rule. It is a nonsense that players such as Wojciech Szczesny and Cesc Fabregas, for instance, can be classed as being locally produced even though they were recruited from abroad. The added spin-off of that will help benefit the England team in the long term. I’ve heard it said that the Premier League has hindered England’s performances in the last two decades but let’s not kid ourselves on that — England were struggling at tournaments long before 1992. What we should not lose sight of, either, is how supporters should be treated and surely now is the time for clubs to give something back to those who have stood by them through thick and thin? Can clubs find a way of providing subsidies for away travel and agree that £20 for an away ticket is the top limit? Why can’t the 20 chairmen make that the fair price? For the money they are going to earn, any fall in gate receipts would be minimal. They are all issues that, in time, will be addressed. The Premier League is the best concept in football, one that we should be proud of. But is it the best in all areas? No. Not yet. RODGERS MUST FACE DOWN BOGEYMEN .

Manchester United's manager came in for criticism this week for how he handled some barbs from Sam Allardyce after the sides drew 1-1 at Upton Park. As soon as Van Gaal started handing out sheets at his conference before the game with Burnley you could hear people say ‘he’s lost it’, because it’s not something you see a manager do every day.

Full marks to Van Gaal for standing up for himself and having a go back at one of his rivals. He didn’t overstep the mark, he just argued for what he believed in. Van Gaal is not afraid to speak his mind and though he is still trying to find a way to get United playing dynamic football, he has added to our game with his pre- and post-match observations and there was nothing wrong with the way he answered back to Allardyce.

"Whoever struck the deal to sell David Luiz for £50million deserves a knighthood. That fee allowed Chelsea to buy Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas and improve.

His presence makes Chelsea even more difficult to break down and allows Nemanja Matic to show a different, dynamic side to his game. A word too on Matic’s influence.

They are such a powerful side, with players such as Ivanovic, Matic, John Terry and Gary Cahill. They are monsters in the air and could destroy teams who fail to cope with their physicality. Chelsea were overloading the area every time they had a wide free-kick or a corner. With their big men such as Ivanovic, the London side's scorer, Chelsea have great weapons at set pieces . Ivanovic was the man to find the net this time but Matic, John Terry and Gary Cahill also flood the box . PSG have a lot of big names but Marco Verratti put them all in the shade at times. The little Italian is a wonderful midfielder. He takes chances occasionally with how he uses the ball but you can see he is a classy little player and will continue to be an influence in this tie. Little Italian Marco Verratti is a wonderful midfielder and stands out even more than PSG's superstars . Verratti attempts to keep close tabs on Chelsea's danger man Eden Hazard during the 1-1 draw . Chelsea were knocked out of the Champions League last season, in part, because Eden Hazard failed to track back in the semi-final against Atletico Madrid. The same frailties were exposed here and Laurent Blanc clearly spotted that weakness. Maxwell, Gregory van Der Wiel and Blaise Matuidi all overlapped to great effect and it will have driven Jose Mourinho to distraction. Gary Cahill has been a stalwart and I’m a fan of his, but Kurt Zouma’s emergence seems to have rattled him. There comes a point in every player’s career when a young lad emerges to put pressure on you and Cahill’s frustrated reaction to the PSG equaliser was telling.","The £50m deal for David Luiz's move from Chelsea to Paris Saint-Germain allowed the purchase of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas... genius .

"Chelsea did the best business in the transfer window with Juan Cuadrado signing and Andre Schurrle and Ryan Bertrand being sold, according to Paul Scholes - but the former Manchester United midfielder had a warning for the new £27million signing. Scholes was giving his views in his weekly column in The Independent and praised his old team's rivals for the nature in which they go about their business - and also the ruthlessness Jose Mourinho shows in handling out of form players. 'As usual it looks like Chelsea have done the best business,' Scholes said. 'They seem to be clinical about it these days. You knew that if it was Juan Cuadrado they wanted, they would get him. Jose Mourinho (right) signed Colombia international Juan Cuadrado (left) for £27million . 'Looking at his stats, I’m not sure that over the course of his career he is an outstanding goalscorer or maker of assists,' Scholes explained. 'What is clear at Chelsea, however, is that if you do not perform you do not last long in the squad.' Colombia international Cuadrado put pen to paper on a four-and-a-half year deal after his big-money switch from Fiorentina and winger Mohamed Salah moved the other way on loan. Paul Scholes has praised Chelsea for their work during the January transfer window . World Cup winner Andre Schurrle (left) was sold by Mourinho to German side Wolfsburg for £24m . Furthermore, Andre Schurrle was sold to Wolfsburg for £24m and left back Ryan Bertrand converted his loan switch into a permanent deal at Southampton for £10m.

"Snubbed: Joanna Mobed was stunned when researchers from ITV's Alan Titchmarsh Show changed their minds her taking part in a debate because she was a woman . As the president of the Cambridge Union, Joanna Mobed is one of the best young debaters in the country. So the 20-year-old felt more than capable of taking part in a current affairs discussion when a TV show contacted her. But she was left stunned when researchers from ITV’s Alan Titchmarsh Show had a change of heart – because she was a girl. They explained that since the debate . was about national service, they wanted two men to take part and asked . her if she knew any male debaters instead. Yesterday, Miss Mobed, a linguistics finalist at Murray Edwards College, said she was upset by the treatment. ‘Being . a woman should not disqualify me from speaking on that motion,’ she . said. ‘I was disappointed by the decision to take the programme in this . direction.’ But last night . ITV defended its decision, saying male debaters were needed because the . discussion had been about ‘reinstating national service for men’. However, the Bill before Parliament regarding national service also applies to women. After Miss Mobed – who is expected to . get a first when she graduates next year – agreed to take part in the . feature, she received an email telling her she was no longer needed. The . male researcher wrote: ‘This afternoon I thought I had finally got . everything sorted and would be able to come back to you with the debate . motion and all the details. ‘However, . my executive producer has decided she wants the debate to be a specific . way so all my plans have got [sic] out of the window. She would like . two men to debate the motion, “This house would reinstate national . service” so would it be possible for you to find me a guy who would be . willing to take part? It would also be best if he was British. ‘If you could let me know as soon as you can if this would be OK and the details of who you would like to put forward.’ Miss Mobed, who has also represented the university in cross-country running and completed several summer internships in banking and finance, was upset by the email. ‘I was also a bit surprised by the request for a British speaker,’ she told student newspaper The Tab. Change of plan: Producers of the Alan Titchmarsh Show had had wanted to pit the presidents of the Oxford Union and Cambridge Union against each other, but when Miss Mobed agreed to take part she was told she was no longer needed . No girls allowed: ITV has defended its decision, saying male debaters were needed because the discussion had been about 'reinstating national service for men' ‘When debating, what matters is a person’s ability to think through and understand the issues involved. ‘Gender and nationality should not be a consideration in this matter.’ Conservative MP Philip Hollobone has proposed legislation that would make it mandatory for anyone aged 18-26 –regardless of sex – to spend a year doing charity work, caring for the elderly or serving in the armed forces. According to the Bill which is currently under consideration by Parliament, participants would be paid the minimum wage and would be required to live away from home, although accommodation and food would be paid for. Academic: Miss Mobed is expected to get a first when she graduates in linguistics from Murray Edwards College, University of Cambridge . The Alan Titchmarsh Show is made for ITV by production company Spun Gold. Last night an ITV spokesman said: ‘As a TV programme we cast contributors in accordance with the subject matter. ‘For this particular item we wanted to debate the motion of reinstating national service for men and so we were looking to cast two men who would explore both sides of the argument.’ Earlier this year, the Cambridge Union became involved in another sexism row after one of its female students was subjected to heckles during a debate at Glasgow University. Since it was founded in 1815, the student-run institution has hosted many powerful figures such as Ronald Reagan and Winston Churchill.","Joanna Mobed asked to take part in debate on ITV's Alan Titchmarsh Show .

"Christian Eriksen believes that for Tottenham to qualify for the Champions League this season, their record needs to improve against the Premier League's big hitters. Spurs finished sixth in the Premier League last season, but their record against top-four clubs was diabolical, as they picked up just a single point in eight games, scoring just two goals and conceding an almighty 27. And of particular damage were the 6-0 defeat away at Manchester City, and the 5-0 loss at home to Liverpool that cost Andre Villas-Boas his job.

"Members and alumni of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity at Wesleyan University have filed a discrimination lawsuit against the Connecticut school over a recent decision that requires all residential fraternities to become coed within three years. Wesleyan announced the policy in September after several highly publicized issues at fraternity houses, including allegations of sexual assault. Delta Kappa Epsilon said in a statement Thursday that it is seeking a temporary injunction in Superior Court after learning that students would not be given the option of housing at on-campus single-sex fraternities during the 2015-16 school year. Lawsuit: Members of Wesleyan's Delta Kappa Epsilon chapter (pictured) are suing the school for discrimination after being forced to accept women in order to remain on campus . Wesleyan requires that all undergraduates live on campus. A spokesman for the fraternity's alumni chapter calls the school's decision 'political correctness gone wrong.' The frat points out that Wesleyan has a number of other housing options that let students live together based on 'shared hobbies, experiences, cultural interests and identities.' The lawsuit cites several examples of undergraduate Program Houses that Wesleyan sponsors on campus, including the Light House, for Christian students, and the Women of Color House. Wesleyan's refusal 'to permit male fraternity brothers to reside in single-sex housing' is contradictory to their 'willingness to allow many other diverse groups to reside by choice with members of the same sex, ethnicity, national origin, religion, culture, sexual orientation, sexual identification and the like,' the fraternity's press release stated. Delta Kappa Epsilon began working toward the school’s demand to go co-ed last year and developed a plan that would allow a female organization, such as a sorority, to offer residency within the fraternity’s house. Coed: The lawsuit comes after the frat was told by the school that its members couldn't live at their frat house for the 2015-2016 academic year, according to a press release from Delta Kappa Epsilon's Wesleyan chapter . Bathrooms and sleeping areas would be separate from the female organization’s, and common areas would be shared, according to the plan described in the suit. In January, the university demanded that the fraternity begin providing a minimum of three residential rooms for women and details of an agreement to partner with a female residency organization by February 6, 2015, according to the suit, which seeks an injunction to block the housing ban. While the fraternity said it agreed to provide bedrooms for women, it hadn’t yet received a firm commitment from a partner female organization to share its building within three years. The lawsuit comes in the midst of a huge debate over Greek life, student behavior and sexual assaults on campus, with everyone from President Obama to congressional leaders to student activists . A Wesleyan spokeswoman says the school will have a statement later this week.","Members of Wesleyan's Delta Kappa Epsilon chapter are suing the school for discrimination after being forced to accept women .

"Virtual currency Bitcoin could be regulated in Britain to make it easier and safer to use, George Osborne signalled today. The Chancellor said the world of finance 'is changing in front of our eyes' and laws had to keep pace with technology. A major review will examine how alternative payment systems could be used to boost the economy and help shoppers in Britain. Chancellor George Osborne announced a review would examine what regulation is needed to make it easier and safer to use virtual currencies in Britain . Unlike traditional currencies like the pound or dollar, Bitcoin exists outside the control of any central banks or laws. Instead it is traded entirely online, often anonymously, leading to its association with the internet drugs market. It is also volatile, with its value 18 months ago just £8 and increasing to more than £645 late last year. It now trades at £352. But now it is gaining credence as a viable alternative for the costly wire transfers of an estimated £350 billion in remittances to families in the developing world. In a speech on how to bolster the FinTech sector, Mr Osborne said: 'The world of finance as we know it is changing in front of our eyes. 'I can today announce that the Government will start a major programme of work exploring the potential of virtual currencies and digital money. Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer . digital currency that functions without any central authority, such as . the Bank of England. The currency was launched in 2008 and is traded within a global network of computers. Miners operate the computers that keep . track of bitcoins and create additional coins. They pool their computing . power to spread the financial risk of their operations. Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. But critics say that also makes bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities. The value of bitcoins has fallen six per . cent in a week to around $600 (£354), although the decline is within the range of normal . fluctuations for the volatile currency. A . bitcoin investor, Norwegian Kristoffer Koch, recently made more than . half a million pounds after he forgot he bought £17 of currency four . years. 'These alternative payment systems are popular because they are quick, cheap, and convenient – and I want to see whether we can make more use of them for the benefit of the UK economy and British consumers.' Aides to the Chancellor stressed that any move to regulate Bitcoin would be designed to make it easier and safer for people to use, rather than to drive it out of Britain. Mr Osborne added: 'I want to be alert to the risks that accompany any new technology.' The review will 'look into whether regulation of the sector is required, so that virtual currency business can continue to set up in the UK, and for people and businesses to use them safely', he said. As part of the other measures new rules will force banks that reject loans for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to ask the firms whether they want to be referred to alternative lenders, including crowd-funders, peer-to-peer lenders and invoice financiers. Mr Osborne said: 'Key to the Government's long term economic plan is cementing Britain's position as the centre of global finance. 'That's why I'm delighted to announce a series of major steps today to help our FinTech firms continue to grow and succeed.' Britain's alternative finance market is expected to be worth £1.6bn in 2014, the Treasury said. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'Forcing banks to refer businesses to alternative lenders is something I've been determined to make happen. 'It's good that more SMEs are making use of alternative finance but the big banks still dominate and small businesses often give up if they're turned down for finance by their bank. 'The UK needs a diverse and competitive business finance market like Germany and the US if our SMEs are to thrive, and that is why the Business Bank is so important. 'Money is already reaching small businesses, but my ambition for the Business Bank is to radically alter the overall market landscape.' Other measures announced included a consultation on digital communications, a review of the part technology will play in the future of the FinTech sector, a £100 million extension to investment for smaller businesses, a push to promote Britain in overseas markets and awards for those who come up with solutions to help small businesses access finance.","Chancellor announces review of the rules governing virtual currencies .

"This is terrible scene when the parents of two-year-old Rushona Kurbonava look on in horror as their daughter's body is recovered from a New York lake. The toddler's mother, Yulduz, is consoled by a NYPD sergeant as the youngster's body is brought to the shore. Rushona went wandered off during a family barbecue with her young cousin when she fell into the algae covered lake in Prospect Park, Brooklyn on Saturday afternoon. Scroll down for video . Yulduz Kurbonava, pictured, collapsed as she witnessed her daughter's body being recovered by divers . NYPD divers draped Rushona Kurbonava's body in a grey blanket before bringing her to the surface . Rushona's father, Dilshod, covered his eyes with his left hand as his daughter's body was brought to shore . Relatives found the young boy, whose clothes were soaking wet, but were unable to find Rushona because of the green algae covering the surface of the lake. A major rescue operation was launched, with the NYPD deploying their specialist sub aqua unit as well as a helicopter which hovered low over the lake in a bid to blow away some of the algae. Tragically, divers found Rushona's body at 6.06pm on Saturday and carefully brought it to the shore, covered in a grey blanket. Rushona's family were celebrating the July 4 holiday weekend and were grilling kabobs in the park overlooking the lake when she went missing. The medical examiner's office ruled the tragedy a case of accidental drowning. Her mother, pictured, was treated for shock by paramedics at the scene before being taken to  hospital .

Officers combed the 585-acre park from bicycles and helicopters and underwater as members of the public also joined the search. Rushona Kurbonova's body was recovered by NYPD divers after she wandered off during a family picnic in Prospect Park, Brooklyn and drowned in the lake .

She said: 'My . whole church family was looking for this baby, and we were praying out . here,' Ms Dillard said Rushona's 37-year-old mother paced by the lake as the massive search was underway. 'She was frantic,' added Ms Dillard. As the dive team brought Rushona's body to the shore, her mother collapsed and was taken to hospital suffering from shock. Brooklyn Borough president, Eric Adams said: 'No parent should ever have to bury a child. We all have a part to play in promoting safe play conditions.' Zada Bacoj, superintendent of the tragic family's Brooklyn apartment building told the Daily News that the toddler was 'a little angel. 'What bigger heartbreak than this?' he added. The family were described as incredibly hard working with Rushona's father driving a taxi. The parents were described as devoted to their three children. Rushova went missing around 1pm, launching a frantic five-hour search, combing the 585-acre park. Another . witness, Angela Peterson, said she saw an older boy she believed to be . the girl's older brother running though the park shouting in another . language as the mother frantically trailed after him. She said: 'I heard the mother say, ""Oh my god! Oh my god!"" She was so distraught,' Peterson recalled. A person called 911 saying a woman approached her shouting 'my babies!' 'She . didn’t speak much English. 'The mother was in a . terrible shock — that feeling when you lose something and you go numb.

"Theo Walcott is in contention to start against Middlesbrough on Sunday as Arsenal attempt to retain the FA Cup following last season's triumph against Hull. The Arsenal winger will be eager to help his side progress to the latter rounds of the competition after missing last season's 3-2 win at Wembley due to a knee injury. Walcott has spoken to BT Sport 1 about his love for the FA Cup, opponents Middlesbrough and his relationship with his Arsenal team-mates away from the pitch in the build up to this weekend's action. Arsenal winger Theo Walcott insists his side's FA Cup clash against Middlesbrough will not be an easy task . Walcott speaks to BT Sport's Rachel Stringer for Matchday Live with Fletch and Sav, see the full interview from 3pm (BT Sport 1) on Saturday . What does the FA Cup mean to you? To me, being English it’s been one of the traditions, I always used to watch with my Dad. I love the fact big clubs go to the lesser teams, no disrespect to them. And the fans get to see the premier players come to their grounds. A lot of fans always want the home matches but I quite like going away from home just for a different experience. It’s nice that fans get to see us in the flesh and to show our stuff and you never know, maybe cause an upset at times. Last season Arsenal won the FA Cup - you weren’t in that side, but what was it like for the team to win a trophy after nine seasons? Even though I wasn’t there I was part of the whole setup from the start from the Spurs game which was probably the biggest fixture up till the final. It had been a long time since not winning a trophy and when you go 2-0 down things might not happen for you. You’ve got to give credit to the players and everyone out there who dug deep and that’s why the FA Cup is special because it just shocks you at times, with the fact that four big teams went out a few weeks back, no one would have expected that at all. And with the final, no one would have expected Hull to go 2-0 up, so to be fair to them they gave a good game. It was a great watch for the neutral, not for me watching back at home, I was pretty nervous. Walcott scored in Arsenal's 3-2 win against Brighton in the fourth round of the FA Cup . Did you feel part of the celebrations? I noticed that Carl (Jenkinson) had his phone with him straight after the game so I tried calling him and he had a missed call, and then he face timed me and so I managed to get a bit of face time of the guys with the Cup, so it felt like I was there. Obviously I had personal things going on at the time so I couldn’t be there but it was nice to know they were still thinking about me. In the dressing room afterwards it was like I was next to them. We had some nice screenshots on the iPhone, so those memories will always stick with me. Now that you are the holders, is that adding more pressure this time or is it better? There’s always pressure in every game anyway, I can’t remember the last time it has been retained so there’s always going to be pressure with us being one of the favourites to win it again. We’ll deal with that. We deal with pressure in every game. No game is different. We’ll just have to get on with things and continue playing our football and we’ll be fine. The England international miss last season's FA Cup run due to the knee injury he sustained in January 2014 . You’re facing Middlesbrough next – what are you expecting? I’m expecting very similar to the Leicester game – they’ve been doing very well in the Championship. They’ve got a good balance between the way they attack and defend. They beat Manchester City away from home, they’re going to be a good team, so you can’t take anything for granted. It’s the FA Cup, there’s always several shocks so we need to completely ready. The last game or two we haven’t started particularly well so we’re going to have to be completely ready because Middlesbrough are challenging to be in the Premier League next year. They are a big club, so we need to not take that for granted. What is it about the FA Cup that makes is so magic (with some of the recent FA Cup shocks)? When I saw the results I was cheering to be fair because it’s always great to see a lower team do well and progress because they have to start a long way back. A lot of people tend to forget the smaller clubs play a lot of games so you’ve got to give credit to them. The teams that the opposition put out they were strong teams. So it’s not as if they were going to make up the numbers. There’s always something that happens. Arsenal will be hoping to retain the prestigious trophy after their FA Cup final win against Hull in May . There’s been quite a few changes in the team, you came back with quite a few new players in the team – how was that for you to come back into that squad? Change is good. The players that have come in have done very well very quickly. It’s always difficult to settle in the Premier League. I was here every day pretty much throughout the whole summer so I was sensing the changes and the dressing room is no different, still a great family club. So they seem to have settled in. And that’s important, if you settle in very quickly, it seems to happen on the pitch for them. Do the ex-Southampton crew stick together? Yeah me, Alex and Calum do. I sit next to Alex in the dressing room. I remember when Alex was yay big and his dad was coaching me at Southampton and he used to kick the balls and stuff. So I remember, it was brilliant. Walcott has revealed he is close friends with fellow former Southampton player Alex Oxlade-Chamberlian . Now Lukas Podolski has gone who is the biggest joker? Alex has got some good stuff. Good banter. (Wojciech) Sczenczy is not bad as well. Nacho (Monreal) and Santi (Cazorla) as a duo are very good. We call Nacho 'Crouchy' because of the resemblance of him and Peter Crouch, sorry Crouchy. Which players do you hang around with off the field? Aaron Ramsey I tend to play a bit of golf with if I can. I try and get Gibbs and Alex out but they’re fair weather players, they only like to play when the sun shines. Me and Aaron are die-hards. But things have changed now for me slightly with my first born so I won’t be able to get on the course as much which is fine as he (son) is a great laugh anyway.

"A senior police officer who warned that vulnerable children were being sexually groomed says she was ignored because her bosses were more interested in fighting car theft. Detective Inspector Meriel Buglass, who headed a unit dealing with sex offences, claimed her superiors failed to act on her findings for eight months, during which girls continued to be abused. In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, Ms Buglass, now retired, blames the ‘target-driven culture’ that existed at Greater Manchester Police. Detective Inspector Meriel Buglass claims her concerns over child abuse were ignored by superiors at Greater Manchester Police . To meet performance targets, she says officers were urged to concentrate on ‘acquisitive’ crimes rather than sexual offences. Details of how white children were groomed for sex by predominantly Asian gangs in Rochdale were included in a report Ms Buglass submitted in April 2010, which included a desperate plea for more resources. ‘I had many sleepless nights over this. We tried our best but the fact is the police failed those girls,’ she said. ‘I could not have been more vocal about the threats and risks... but I was appalled at the response. ‘Management appeared not to be interested, they were only interested in targets, it was a completely target-driven culture. 'The main priorities were acquisitive crime – robbery, burglary and car theft. Money was being piled into [the investigation of] these crimes.’ And just as political correctness was partly blamed for failing abuse victims in Rotherham – where it emerged last month that 1,400 children were sexually exploited between 1997 and 2013 – Ms Buglass says it stymied her work in Rochdale. ‘They didn’t want to class the abuse as Asian on white girls. They didn’t want to cause a fuss,’ she said. ‘I took the view that this wasn’t about racism, it was about child abuse – but political correctness and cultural sensitivities were important to management.’ After submitting a report which detailed child abuse, Ms Buglass said she had a meeting with Superintendent Martin Greenhalgh (pictured). But when she raised the subject, she claims he used words to the effect of: 'If I choose to investigate it, we will' Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk said: ‘The scandal of how police and other agencies failed children being raped on an industrial scale is getting worse every week. Police leadership have completely lost touch with ordinary people’s values.’ Ms Buglass, who ran Rochdale Police’s public protection unit, collated intelligence from many sources and sent her report to her superiors, who reported to Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney. Ms Buglass claimed work at Greater Manchester Police was target driven . It contained details of about 35 children along with ten perpetrators and 40 others suspects. The day after she submitted the report, she had a meeting with Superintendent Martin Greenhalgh. But when she raised the subject, she claims he used words to the effect of: ‘If I choose to investigate it, we will.’ Ms Buglass replied: ‘This is huge, there are massive threats and it will come back to bite us if you don’t do something!’ But she claims she was told to concentrate on domestic violence because the crime ‘featured on performance targets’. She said she was so frustrated that she took the matter further and was promised help – yet it wasn’t until eight months later that the investigation was taken up. ‘And then it was taken away from me,’ said Ms Buglass. In 2012, nine men from Rochdale and Oldham who ran the child sexual exploitation ring were given sentences ranging from four to 19 years. Some of the girls were as young as 13. The Mail on Sunday revealed two weeks ago that police are poised to arrest hundreds of suspected child abusers in a ‘day of reckoning’. Greater Manchester Police said yesterday it has ‘recognised that it could have done more to support the victims of child sexual exploitation in Rochdale’. It said in a statement: ‘Since 2010 we have moved considerable resources into child protection and the investigation of sexual exploitation. We have learned from what happened.’ It added that the Home Office put the force under pressure to cut acquisitive crimes five years ago – but targets were removed in 2012.","Detective Inspector Meriel Buglass says concerns were ignored .

"Paris riot police fought back crowds who pushed their way onto Paris’ landmark Champs-Elysees avenue today as part of a huge protest against a draft law allowing same-sex couples to marry and adopt children. Up to 300,000 people - conservative activists, children, retirees, priests - converged on the capital in a last-ditch bid to stop the bill, many bussed in from the French provinces. The lower house of France’s parliament approved the 'marriage for everyone' bill last month with a large majority, and it’s facing a vote in the Senate next month. Scroll down for video . At least 300,000 people converged on the centre of Paris in a protest opposing the bill that will allow homosexual couples to get married and adopt children . Riot police spray teargas on demonstrators during clashes on the Champs-Elysees avenue in Paris . A protestor appears to throw a traffic cone at a line of riot police during the demonstration . Both houses are dominated by French President Francois Hollande’s Socialist Party and its allies. Sustained protests led by opposition conservatives in this traditionally Catholic country have eroded support for the draft law in recent months, and organizers hope Sunday’s march will weigh on the Senate debate. The first few hours of the protest were peaceful. But as it was meant to be winding down, about 100 youths tried to push past police barricades onto the Champs-Elysees, the avenue that cuts through central Paris and draws throngs of tourists daily. In an indication of the sensitivity of the issue, protesters had been barred from marching on the Champs. Christine Boutin, leader of the French Christian Democratic Party, was pictured lying on the ground in the Champs-Elysees, after being teargased by police during the demonstration. Last year she said that she remained strongly opposed to same-sex marriage and claimed that it would lead to polygamy. Many people were bussed in from the provinces to try and boost numbers before the protest turned violent .

"Wasting money: Eric Pickles says translating is doing more harm than good by holding people back from integrating into society . Eric Pickles has attacked a council for spending nearly £700,000 on translation services for immigrants. The Communities Secretary said the money should have been spent on frontline services and keeping the council tax down in Sheffield. The council spent £555,331 on face-to-face and phone translation from 2011 to 2014, and £131,785 on documents. Some of the 44 languages translated include little-used Dari, Karen, Lingala, Oromo and Tigrinya. In 2013, Mr Pickles told all councils to stop translating documents as it was rarely needed and discouraged migrants from learning English. He said: 'The Government guidance I've issued is crystal clear, councils should stop wasting taxpayers' money by translating into foreign languages. 'Translation holds people back from integrating into British society - if they can't speak English, they're not going to get on in life. 'This shows how political correctness does more harm than good. The money used can be used to protect frontline services and keep council tax down. 'Such translation services have an unintentional, adverse impact on integration by reducing the incentive for some migrant communities to learn English and are wasteful where many members of these communities already speak or understand English.' Sheffield Council said the costs mostly relate to services it has to legally provide, like child protection and housing, and translating leaflets was not standard practice. A council spokesman said the bulk of its costs are linked to providing services that it has to provide by law. Frontline services: Communities secretary Eric Pickles has attacked Sheffield City Council for spending nearly £700,000 on translation services for immigrants at the expense of frontline services . 'Whilst we have reduced the costs of providing interpretation significantly in recent years under law we are required to ensure that children are safeguarded and where interpretation is needed to do this we have to provide it to ensure we have met our obligations. 'We restrict translation and interpretation services to essential matters such as signs up and serving legal notices. We always review how we can reduce our costs and this is something we have been doing for some time. 'We do not print leaflets in different languages as standard practice.'","Some of 44 languages include Dari, Lingala, Tigrinya and Oromo .

"Actress Samantha Morton is being urged by police to officially complain about the sexual abuse she endured in a children’s home as a teenager. Detectives spoke to the Bafta and Golden Globe winner twice last week but say she did not ask them to take the matter further. The 37-year-old actress revealed in a newspaper interview yesterday that she was abused by two residential care workers who came into her bedroom at night. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Actress Samantha Morton pictured with husband Harry Holm (left) and (right) in the 1995 TV series Band of Gold . It happened at the Red Tile Home near Nottingham when she was 13. Some time afterwards she recalled being taken by her mother to a police station to report it. After making a statement at Oxclose Lane police station in Nottingham she was placed in another home. No further action was taken and the men stayed in their jobs. But Nottingham Police said yesterday they had checked their files and found no record of her complaint. And they said it was made clear to Ms Morton last week that detectives could not launch an investigation without her blessing. ‘But she has not, during either of those conversations, confirmed to us that she does wish to take this matter further,’ said the force in a statement. Police tried to call her again on Friday night and left a message ‘inviting her once again to make arrangements to speak to us’. The statement added that her allegations had to be made formally ‘not only to help Ms Morton obtain justice but also to assist others who may have been victims and to protect children who may still possibly be at risk’. Her parents separated when she was two – her father was violent and her mother had a breakdown – and she went on to spend much of her childhood in foster and children’s homes. Aged 11, she was moved permanently into the council-run Red Tiles, in Bulwell, four miles north of Nottingham. ‘I was very innocent and went to church. People called me a Bible-basher,’ she told The Guardian. The home was small, with just nine children. She recalled being singled out for preferential treatment by her abusers, who made her feel special. ‘I thought they were really nice, so I was really shocked when it happened. And, ultimately, nobody would have believed me, because they’re the coolest, nicest people.’ Samantha Morton, pictured 'In America', revealed in a newspaper interview yesterday that she was abused by two residential care workers . At first, they abused her individually. Then they both entered her bedroom at night and assaulted her. The former Band of Gold actress said: ‘It’s a shock when someone does things to you, things you’re not expecting. It isn’t that people suddenly become the bogeymen. Abuse of children is gradual, this is why we now understand the term grooming.’ Not wishing to get the men ‘into trouble’ she didn’t report the abuse immediately, but eventually went to social workers ‘who did nothing’. She said ‘there was no support, no offer of counselling, no wanting to delve deeper. A lot of people who abused my friends were people in very, very top jobs within the social services. Nottingham was rife with that then.’ The actress said she was speaking out following a report that detailed the sexual abuse of 1,400 children in Rotherham over 16 years and the ‘blatant’ collective failures to deal with the issue. The actress called for investigations to be launched in other towns and cities. Police are investigating claims of historic abuse at nine care homes across Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, but have not received any allegations in relation to Red Tiles, which is now closed. Steve Edwards, of Nottinghamshire social services, said: ‘We applaud Samantha for coming forward and talking about her time in the care system. We would welcome the chance to meet her so that we can discuss her concerns and progress our investigation further.’ Last night Ms Morton appeared to be completely at odds with Nottinghamshire Police over the complaint. Her spokeswoman insisted the actress was told last week by Superintendent Helen Chamberlain that ‘there was a historic police record of a complaint’ to the police. ‘Ms Chamberlain, who was most helpful, took a verbal statement from Samantha, who is now away filming, and it was agreed that this was an ongoing communication,’ she said. ‘Ms Morton is more than happy to co-operate with Nottinghamshire Police and social services in whatever way she can.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Actress Samantha Morton, 37, is being urged by police to officially complain about sexual abuse she endured as a teenager in a children's home .

"A controversial Stanford professor has claimed overpopulation could lead to humanity having to eat the bodies of the dead. Paul Ehrlich, best known for his prediction of human 'oblivion' 46 years ago, says that current population trends are on a course that could leave cannibalism as one of the only options. Ehrlich claimed that scarcity of resources will get so bad that humans will need to drastically change our eating habits and agriculture. Ehrlich claimed that scarcity of resources will get so bad that humans will need to drastically change our eating habits and agriculture - and even consider eating the dead. Researchers are developing new ways to grow meat in the lab. Last year, Mark Post, a professor of tissue engineering at Maastricht University, the Netherlands, presented the first lab-grown hamburger. To great the burger, stem cells are cultivated in a nutrient broth, allowing them to proliferate 30-fold. Next they are combined with an elastic collagen and attached to Velcro 'anchor points' in a culture dish. Between the anchor points, the cells self-organise into chunks of muscle. Electrical stimulation is then used to make the muscle strips contract and 'bulk up' - the laboratory equivalent of working out in a gym. Finally thousands of beef strips are minced up, together with 200 pieces of lab-grown animal fat, and moulded into a patty. Ehrlich claimed that scarcity of resources will get so bad that humans will need to drastically change our eating habits and agriculture. 'We will soon be asking is it perfectly okay to eat the bodies of your dead because we’re all so hungry?,' he told HuffPost live host Josh Zepps. He added that humanity is 'moving in that direction with a ridiculous speed. 'In other words between now and 45 years from now, 2.5 billion people will be added to the planet. 'We are moving towards resource wars. Ehrlich is widely known for his 1968 publication of 'The Population Bomb' which called for 'population control' to prevent global crises from overpopulation. 'In the 1970’s the world will undergo famines - hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death,' he predicted. 'our children will inherit a totally different world, a world in which the standards, politics, and economics of the 1960’s are dead.' Population crisis: Between now and 45 years from now, 2.5 billion people will be added to the planet, Ehrlich  claims . Ehrlich claims that the dangers of overpopulation are once again growing, blaming Republicans and the media for failing to take action. 'We all have to eat, and it's very destructive. The ethical issues around the way we raise cattle are important, but relatively trivial compared to the wrecking of our life support systems. 'I can much more about people, because I'm a person.' In his new book, called 'Hope On Earth,' Ehrlich worked with Michael Tobias. 'There's a tremendous amount of optimism in the book,' said Tobais. 'I really think we have  a capacity to come to the aid of individuals.' Tobias believes that young investors could hold the key to solving the problem, by investing in technologies to solve the problem.","Stanford professor Paul Ehrlich predicts population increases will lead to food crisis .

"A taxi driver travelled all the way to Amsterdam after accidentally breaking a souvenir that one of his passengers brought back from their holiday. Cabbie Kevin Gregg, 52, travelled 450 miles from Newcastle to the Dutch capital in pursuit of the irreparable windmill ornament for customer Hazel Lindley. He was under strict instructions from East Coast Taxis' managing director Paul Irwin who, after hearing what had happened, delivered an outstanding display of customer service. Taxi driver Kevin Gregg travelled to Amsterdam and back to buy a replacement windmill souvenir for Hazel Lindley after he accidentally broke the item . Kevin Gregg was amazed he managed to find the souvenir shop so quickly in Amsterdam . 'I heard the crack as I put something down on top of her bag and I immediately felt sick as I didn't know what it was', Kevin said. 'Hazel said she would just glue it but it stayed on my mind for the next few days. 'I was shocked at first as no taxi company ever does this but I was over the moon when Paul told me I could go and find a replacement, it was unbelievable. 'It was a bit scary at first as I kept thinking what if I can't find it or what if the market is closed. 'Luckily, I found it quite quickly, I got off the bus and bought a map and although it was on an awkward street, I asked a passer by who spoke English and found it. 'I couldn't believe it was that easy, especially as the picture Paul had given me was in black and white! 'Once I had it, I guarded it more than I would guard my own kids!' Pensioner Hazel, who lives at Felton, near Morpeth, Northumberland, said: 'They really made my day. 'I couldn't believe the level of customer service they have shown. I'm sure other firms would simply have apologised and left it at that.' EastCoast Taxis decided to go above and beyond to replace a passenger's souvenir one of their drivers had accidently damaged . She was returning from a short break in Amsterdam when her taxi driver packed the car and inadvertently placed a heavy item onto a bag containing a wooden souvenir windmill. The windmill was damaged beyond repair leaving Hazel upset and the taxi driver embarrassed and apologetic. When Tyneside based EastCoast Taxis' managing director Paul Irwin heard about the accidental damage caused he decided to put things right. He said: 'With more than 200 taxis on the road carrying 70,000 passengers every week, we do expect the odd mishap but at EastCoast we like to look after our customers. 'We know that the souvenir windmill wasn't expensive but the fact is that Hazel couldn't get a replacement anywhere other than Amsterdam and that was the challenge.' Mr Gregg left his home of Whitley Bay to travel to Amsterdam in Holland for a special journey . Kevin, of North Parade, Whitley Bay, was 'over the moon' that he was able to successfully replace the ornament. 'When I saw Hazel, we just cuddled, she reminded me of my nana, she kept apologising for the hassle she thought she had caused. 'I'm just delighted that I was able to get her a replacement, but I don't want anything to break in my taxi again. 'Unless I have to go to America!

"The best friend of a newlywed who drowned on her honeymoon said the woman's husband used her funeral to show pictures of his late wife standing next to a 'Caution: Drowning' sign. Gabe Watson, 34, is suspected of killing his wife Tina during a scuba diving trip nine years ago in Australia after he turned off her air supply, the prosecution claimed. He is facing a life sentence without parole. Amanda Phillips, who was Tina's maid-of-honour at the wedding, told the court in Alabama today that she had initially been convinced that her friend's death, 11 days after she married, was a tragic accident. Scroll down for video . Happiness: Gabe and Tina Watson on their wedding day in 2003 - 11 days before Mrs Watson drowned during a honeymoon diving trip . Ms Phillips struggled to contain her emotions as she spoke of first hearing of her friend's death. According to ABC, she told the court that she had initially believed Gabe Watson's version of events. She said: 'He [Gabe Watson] says he made a split decision to leave her. He thought it was better to get help.' Following the funeral, Ms Phillips said her suspicions were raised by Watson's actions. At his home after the service, he showed pictures of his late wife next to a sign which read 'Caution: Drowning'. Ms Phillips added that she may have seen other photographs of the holiday but that these were what she remembered. Loss of a friend: Amanda Phillips cries on the stand today as she describes being told that her best friend Tina Watson had drowned . The defence claims Mrs Watson panicked during the dive and knocked off . her husband's mask and air supply, forcing him to surface for help . because the current had carried her away from him. Evidence showed Watson was certified as a rescue diver in 1999, about . four years before his wife drowned in October 2003. She was a novice . diver, the court heard. The newlyweds were . in Australia on their honeymoon and were on the first day of a week . long diving trip off the coast of Queensland when she died. Watson . told police 'five to seven minutes' into their dive over the SS Yongala . shipwreck they struggled against a strong current. He said Tina Watson got into difficulty and at one point banged his mask and air regulator. He said he thought he kicked his wife with his fin to get some space from her and she floated away from him. Last week a doctor told the court he was convinced Watson was trying to save his wife when she became distressed . underwater. According to Dr Stanley Stutz, an . emergency room physician from Chicago, Illinois, Watson had wrapped his arms around his wife Tina moments . before she sank to the ocean's bottom. But prosecutors contend Dr Stutz witnessed the woman's murder on the . Great Barrier Reef. Waiting game: Gabe Watson, right, along with his new wife Kim, left, sit in the courtroom of the Mel Bailey Criminal Justice Center during a break in his capital murder trial in Birmingham, Alabama last week . The words of Ms Phillips came at the beginning of day five of the murder trial. The . prosecution alleges that Watson plotted his wife's death to collect . $130,000 in an insurance payout. Watson served 18 months in prison in Australia after pleading guilty to a . manslaughter charge in his wife's death. The charge involved . negligence, not premeditated murder like the Alabama charge. Watson said he swam down to get his new wife but decided against chasing her to the seabed and instead headed for the surface. 'I remember shouting through my regulator ''Tina, Tina, Tina'',' Watson told police at the time. Beautiful bride: Tina Watson drowned in 2003 after becoming distressed during a scuba diving trip. Gabe Watson is standing trial for her murder at an Alabama court . The jury of eight women and six men also looked at a haunting underwater photo taken by another diver of the death scene. It showed Tina sprawled in deep water as Watson swam to the surface. Prosecutors appeared to attempt to cast doubt on Watson's version of what happened. They believe Watson turned off his wife's air supply while both were underwater and held her in a bear-hug until she lost consciousness - before turning the air back on and letting her sink. Horrific death: Tina Watson is seen lying on the bottom of the sea in this chilling photo as a rescuer rushes to save her in October 2003 - this photo was shown in court.

The great migration: The herd travel over 3,000 kilometres every year . The 'great migration' is the world's largest migration of land mammals, which sees the mass movement of wildebeest. The herd travel 3,000 kilometres every year, in search of new grazing territory in March, and back south to give birth around October. According to the Wildlife Photographer of the Year entry, 10,000 wildebeest can cross the Mara River in half an hour. It is estimated that up to 250,000 of the mammals perish during the migration every year, and the Mara crossing is the most dangerous part of the journey.

"A groom played the ultimate prank on his unsuspecting bride as he threw her up in the air for a fun wedding photo - and then dropped her into the freezing cold North Sea. Richard Hay, 33, decided to throw his bride Lysa up in the air during a post-wedding photo shoot at South Beach, Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear. But instead of catching her, the cheeky groom - who is lucky to still be married - took a step back to let her fall into the freezing cold water as family and friends watched on.

An American tradition called 'trashing the dress' has become hugely popular in recent years with brides dreaming up ever more extreme ways to destroy their wedding gowns. But Lysa, 39, had no idea what her husband intended to do - and ended up wearing a wedding gown that turned see-through when damp in front of her nearest and dearest.

She said: 'With wedding dresses, people wrap them up, they put them in the loft, and they never get used again whereas looking at it now we are fortunate to have fantastic photos and something quite unusual. It was worth it for that.' Lysa added that she wasn’t surprised by the prank played by her husband who has a reputation for being a joker. Lysa said: 'He’s always at it. When he went on holiday he filled his friends’ suncream bottles with toothpaste. 'I will get him back though, I don’t know how or when, but I will get him back.' Mr Hay added: 'I took the opportunity . to give her the dunking of her life. Watching everyone’s reactions was . quite satisfying. It was like winning the FA Cup. The highlight of the . year.'

The photo shoot includes five young Indian acid attack victims photographed by Rahul Saharan in Rupa's clothing collection, called Rupa Designs. Rupa, Rita, Sonam, Laxmi and Chanchal have all been the victims of horrendous acid attacks. Scroll down for video . Inspirational: Acid attack survivors pose as models for a fashion shoot (from left to right: Laximi, Rita, Rupa) They have spent years hiding their faces - until now. United, they have come forward and decided to take part in the fashion shoot. Rupa, 22, said: 'I always wanted to be a designer but after the attack there was a pause in my life. I was so insecure and embarrassed by my scars I used to cover my face with a scarf. I always hung onto my dream but I never knew that one day it would be possible and I would be launching my own label.' Rupa (right) has designed the collection of clothes for the shoot and says she refuses to let her attack destroy her dreams of becoming a designer . Rupa and Rita have spent years hiding their faces but have now bravely come forward for the shoot . But these young women have now shown their attackers they will no longer hide their faces and deserve to live a life of dignity. Rupa, who dropped her surname after she disowned her father for supporting her stepmother after she attacked her with acid, teamed up with a charity campaign Stop Acid Attacks and decided to fight for justice for herself and other acid attack fighters. Stop Acid Attacks work extensively with acid attack survivors, helping them back into society and bolstering their self-esteem. Laximi poses in Rupa's colourful designs in an inspirational photo shoot . They have also created Chhaon, a support centre for acid attack survivors. It's a clean, safe and comfortable environment for them to spend time in while they receive medical aid. Chhaon has also become a meeting house for all survivors where they chat, sing, dance - and laugh. Rupa was asleep in August 2008 when her stepmother threw acid on her face. She was found guilty and sentenced to prison but India's poor judicial system has meant she is now free and living her life with no signs of remorse after serving just 18 months. Rupa said: 'Chhaon has helped me feel confident again and believe in myself. I have always loved fashion and tailoring but I never thought I could start my own label. This is the first time I have presented my clothes and I am glad to see them being appreciated. ' Stop Acid Attacks have also started a project called  Chhaon, which is a support centre for acid attack survivors . Photographer Rahul Saharan helped Laximi (left) and Rita (right) feel confident enough to be photographed . Rahul told the girls that they mustn't let people tell them what beautiful is and says that he is glad to be supporting all of the victims of acid attacks . The charity asked photographer Rahul Saharan to get involved and together helped the girls feel confident enough to be photographed. 'It was a wonderful shoot. I'm a very shy girl, but Rahul made it easy and comfortable for us all to face the camera with pride,' Rupa added. Rahul, 24, from Delhi, is overwhelmed with the response to his work. He said: 'I have been associated with Chhaon for the last two-and-half years but this is the first time I feel like I've put my skills to good use to help these lovely girls. I feel blessed to have got this exclusive opportunity.' Rahul, who worked free of cost for the shoot, added: 'I kept telling the girls ""don't let others tell you what beauty is, you yourself are beautiful, every woman is beautiful"".' Rupa says that Rahul made her feel comfortable enough to be able to face the camera with pride . He is now hoping to organize a photo exhibition to help the acid attack survivors with the proceeds. 'This photo shoot is my tribute to all the brave women across the globe who have gone through this gruesome torture. I'm glad that I could do my part in supporting them,' he added. Rupa has already sold three orders to a US tourist for Rs 1,500 (around £15) and has got an order from an Indian businesswoman for a traditional dress. 'I just hope the orders come in, it would be a dream come true to make this my work. The last six years have been tough so if I can set up my own boutique and work towards becoming financially independent then anyone can. I never imagined my dreams could come true but now I believe anything is possible.' To support these girls please visit stopacidattacks.org .

"The Obama administration urged calm over the single case of Ebola in the United States, seeking to reassure the American public that there was little chance of an outbreak of the disease in this country. At the same time, the military said it had begun the long-awaited aid to disease-ravaged Liberia, with medical testing at two new labs and construction of treatment centers. The administration has long contended that the best way to contain Ebola is to attack it at its source. Scroll down for video . Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco gives a press briefing on the government's response to the Ebola outbreak, reassuring the public that the government is taking steps to deal with the disease . The Pentagon's spokesman said Friday that up to 4,000 troops could be deployed to West Africa, a number that has been slowly climbing as military leaders arrive and assess the need. But in the U.S., 'we need to get the information out because there is a lot of fear,' said Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious diseases chief at the National Institutes of Health. 'Our health care infrastructure in the United States is well-equipped to stop Ebola in its tracks.' The unusual high-level briefing at the White House Friday reflected the administration's urgency in seeking to reassure the public that a wide-spread outbreak of Ebola in the U.S. was unlikely. Fauci was one of five senior administration officials who briefed reporters Friday, including Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell and Lisa Monaco, President Barack Obama's top homeland security advisers. Monaco said the U.S. was not considering a travel ban to prevent people from the hardest-hit West African countries from coming to the U.S. and said efforts were instead focused on identify high-risk individuals before they leave the outbreak zone. Dozens and dozens of people have been stopped from getting on flights in the region, she said. 'The most effective way to go about controlling this is to prevent those individuals from getting on a plane in the first place,' she said. The first person diagnosed with Ebola in the nation went to a Dallas hospital last week but was mistakenly sent home, despite revealing he was visiting from Liberia, before returning by ambulance days later. Texas officials now are monitoring 50 people, 10 of whom they consider at high risk, who came into the contact with the man. They've had to quarantine four of them, and even had problems getting rid of the infectious waste left in the apartment where the patient stayed. 'There were things that did not go the way they should have in Dallas,' acknowledged Fauci, director of NIH's National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 'But there were a lot of things that went right and are going right.' The White House said Obama planned to meet with his national security advisers Monday to discuss the Ebola outbreak and the administration's response. Back at the Pentagon, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby said the military has begun medical testing for Ebola at two new labs in Liberia. Also, service members are starting to build two treatment centers there for victims of the deadly disease, he said, and a hospital for infected medical personnel should be finished by the end of the month. The unusual high-level briefing at the White House Friday reflected the administration's urgency in seeking to reassure the public that a wide-spread outbreak of Ebola in the U.S. was unlikely . Kirby said that the service members are not going to treat patients and are not expected to come in contact with anyone who is infected. But he said the military is training the troops about how to avoid getting Ebola, and also setting plans in place to deal with any service member who might get infected. 'We're going to train them up on what Ebola looks like, feels like, does. While they're there, they're going to be constantly monitored on a regular, frequent basis,' Kirby said. 'There will be a screening process to make sure that once they're no longer there, that we're able to stay in touch with them, make sure that they haven't ... felt or experienced any symptoms.' He added that troops will also have personal protection equipment if needed and will be trained in how to use it. He said he is unaware of any special staffing or other changes at military hospitals in the United States to prepare them for caring for Ebola patients. There are about 230 U.S. troops deployed for the Ebola mission now. About two dozen are in Senegal setting up a transportation center and the rest are in Liberia. The Army on Friday said that up to 3,200 soldiers from various units around the country will be going to Liberia, including 1,800 from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, who will arrive late this month. Others from Fort Hood and Fort Bliss, Texas, and Fort Bragg, North Carolina, are also being deployed, along with support units from Fort Benning and Fort Stewart, Georgia, and Fort Eustis, Virginia.

"A grandmother has been charged with the murder of her granddaughter after she allegedly hit the baby with a sledgehammer as she lay sleeping before slitting her throat. Alfreda Giedrojc, 61, is believed to have killed six-month-old Vivian Summers on Sunday morning, authorities said on Monday. The grandmother, of Oak Lawn, Illinois, allegedly placed the baby on the floor of the suburban home and hit her repeatedly with the sledgehammer.  She then retrieved a carving knife from the kitchen and slit the baby’s throat. Brutal death: Baby Vivian, pictured with her parents Amy and Joel, was allegedly murdered by her grandmother . Killer: Alfreda Giedrojc is accused of murdering her granddaughter using a sledgehammer and a carving knife . Giedrojc has been charged with . first-degree murder and held without bond in the Cook County jail. The alleged killer is the maternal grandmother of baby Vivian. Giedrojc's daughter Amy has been married to Joel Summers since September 2009. A message left at a phone listing for Giedrojc in Oak Lawn was not immediately returned. Oak Lawn Police Chief Michael Murray called the baby’s death 'a tragedy'. Giedrojc, who is originally from . Poland, had been left alone with baby Vivian while her husband Bill and . their son-in-law left to help a family member with household repairs. Vivian had been asleep on the sofa at her grandparents home in Oak Lawn, a suburb to Chicago, when Giedrojc went to fetch a sledgehammer which she had hidden in her closet the night before. Placing the infant on the floor, Giedrojc repeatedly hit Vivian over the head and body with the hammer and when the child did not die, Giedrojc picked her up and slit her throat with a carving knife taken from her kitchen. Upon his return to the house, Giedrojc's husband made the gruesome discovery and called police. Vivian was pronounced dead in hospital on Sunday afternoon. Tragedy: Little Vivian's parents had left her alone with her grandmother while the father and the grandfather helped out a neighbor, believed to be Vivian's uncle . Horror find: The six-month-old's body was found by her grandfather Bill who called the police on his wife . ‘The defendant took the victim off of the couch where she had been sleeping and placed the baby on the floor and retrieved a sledgehammer from her closet, which she had placed there the night before,’ said Michael Deno, Assistant Cook County State's Attorney told the Chicago Tribune. ‘The defendant then hit the victim repeatedly in the head and body with the sledgehammer. Since the victim was still crying and moving the defendant went into the kitchen and retrieved a large carving knife. 'The defendant then picked the victim up, held her, and then slit her throat with the knife,’ Mr Deno said. Giedrojc is being held without bail after appearing in court on Monday. Despite having lived in the U.S. for 30 years, Giedrojc needed a Polish translator. Giedrojc is due back in court on October 28, 2013.

The reality TV star quit I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here last night after only three days, moaning that she had never been so unhappy. She can cheer herself up, though, with the knowledge that she will still pocket an estimated £40,000 for her brief time in Australia, despite appearing in just three episodes of the ITV show. Scroll down for video . All cried out: Gemma Collins quit I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here last night after only three days . She can cheer herself up, though, with the knowledge that she will still pocket an estimated £40,000 for her brief time in Australia, despite appearing in just three episodes of the ITV show . Miss Collins will, however, miss out on her full appearance fee, thought to have been almost £100,000. Her agent dismissed rumours that a clause in her contract would entitle her to the full amount so long as she stayed at least 72 hours, adding: ‘The show is three weeks long and Gemma was in Australia for around five days, therefore she will receive a percentage based on that.’ Her replacement Edwina Currie has already fallen foul of the local wildlife. As she prepared for her entry to the jungle later this week, she was introduced to a koala – which promptly urinated on her. The former Tory health minister boasted that she already knows exactly how she wants to spend her own huge appearance fee. She revealed she is taking part to pay for an extension to her home and is so delighted that she bought herself a T-shirt with a slogan boasting ‘Nice work if you can get it’. She said: ‘We need a new extension and this would pay for it – just about. We could have wrought iron balconies and everything now.’ Miss Collins will, however, miss out on her full appearance fee, thought to have been almost £100,000 . The Only Way Is Essex star Miss Collins struggled from her first day on I’m A Celebrity when she refused to get into a helicopter and moaned about the lack of food. The 33-year-old said she felt ‘panicked and stressed’. Explaining her decision to quit last night, she said: ‘I’m not cut out for this. I’m not having a diva fit… I love myself too much to put myself through this.’ Mrs Currie, who confessed in a book to a four-year affair with Sir John Major when both were members of the Thatcher government in the 1980s, appeared to have no qualms about swapping the political jungle for the reality TV version. She said she had no fear of encountering rodents because ‘I used to meet a lot of rats in politics’. The 68-year-old, who has competed in Strictly Come Dancing, insisted she would not talk about her affair with Sir John while in the jungle, even if asked by BBC journalist Michael Buerk.

In 2012, Mrs Currie criticised Tory MP Nadine Dorries, who was temporarily suspended by her party when she took part in I’m A Celebrity. Mrs Dorries has now described her as a hypocrite for taking part despite disparaging the show in the past. But Mrs Currie brushed off the remark, saying: ‘I make it up as I go along. What did I say?

"The BBC has told its journalists not to describe Abu Qatada as an extremist. Corporation bosses said reporters should avoid making a ‘value judgement’ – and that he should be referred to as radical instead. This is despite the fact Qatada was known as ‘Al Qaeda’s spiritual leader in Europe’. Dangerous: BBC bosses have discouraged staff from describing Abu Qatada as an extremist. They have also been told to avoid using pictures of him in which he looks fat . BBC staff have also been advised . against using images of the preacher looking fat. He is apparently now . much slimmer than he used to be. The instruction from BBC news bosses . was described as ‘beyond belief’ by one MP and the Corporation was again . accused of trying too hard to be politically correct.

Once out of jail, he has a judge’s . permission to do the school run – but is still considered such a threat . he will be allowed to walk the streets for only two hours a day. The BBC has told its journalists that the label of extremist should be avoided or only used if attributed to someone else. The guidance was issued at a newsroom . editorial meeting held at 9am on Tuesday, which was reportedly chaired . by senior manager Andrew Roy. The Ten O’Clock News on Tuesday night duly labelled Qatada as an ‘Islamist cleric’. But its report did refer to the bail . conditions that he was facing on release as ‘extreme’, pointing out he . will face a curfew for 22 hours a day. According to notes of the meeting, . seen by the Daily Telegraph, BBC staff were told: ‘Do not call him an . extremist – we must call him a radical. Extremist implies a value . judgement.’ Last night MPs were left speechless at the edict, which has also mystified members of the BBC’s own staff. Philip Davies, an MP who sits on the . culture, media and sport select committee, said: ‘I thought it was a . joke. You really can’t make it up. BBC journalists were told that they should avoid making 'value judgments' when describing the radical preacher . Justice Secretary Ken Clarke said Qatada hadn't committed a crime . Abu Qatada 'has not committed any crime' and we cannot blame European human rights for his release, Ken Clarke has said. The Justice Secretary said it was a British judge who granted him bail, and it did not have 'anything to do with the European Court'. Speaking at the Oldie magazine awards in central London, Mr Clarke told The Daily Telegraph: 'I don’t think it has anything to do with the European Court, it is a question of how long you can detain someone who is not accused of committing a crime and no body intends to charge him with anything.' Qatada is wanted in Jordan to stand trial for his alleged involvement in a Millennium bomb plot. Mark Pritchard, Tory MP for The Wrekin . in Shropshire, said: ‘This is a tragic paradox where a media . organisation seems to be curbing freedom of expression and choice of . words in news reporting. ‘Some senior BBC personnel need to stop…assuming everyone is as highly sensitive and politically correct as they are.’ Yesterday the corporation released a statement saying it did not ban words.

"The disgrace of Britain’s most senior Roman Catholic was complete last night as Cardinal Keith O’Brien admitted to sexual misconduct. In a shock statement, Cardinal O’Brien effectively admitted that allegations that he made homosexual approaches to young trainee priests were true. Until a week ago Cardinal O’Brien, 74, had been preparing to help choose the next Pope. But last night he admitted his ‘sexual conduct’ had ‘fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest, archbishop and cardinal’. He said sorry and added that he was retiring from public life. The former archbishop will face a Vatican investigation into his behaviour and could be subjected to further punishment if evidence of wrongdoing is found. Apology: Keith O'Brien has admitted his 'sexual conduct fell well below the standards expected of a priest' His admission left the Roman Catholic church in both England and Scotland in deep crisis over sexual standards and apparent hypocrisy on the part of its most senior priest. It meant the troubles in the church in this country will be at the heart of the disputes in Rome as the 115 most senior cardinals begin the process of picking the new Pope. The conclave – which does not now include any representative from Britain – will have to cope with both the fallout from years of sex-abuse allegations and the dramatic new evidence that even the most senior Roman Catholics do not always practise what they preach. The allegations against Cardinal O’Brien, made public eight days ago, came from three priests and a former priest, who complained to the Vatican’s representative in Britain, Papal Nuncio Archbishop Antonio Mennini. Admission: Cardinal O'Brien in the office at his official residence in Edinburgh last week . The force of the complaints became apparent last Monday when Pope Benedict XVI ordered Cardinal O’Brien to retire immediately. The cardinal, who had offered his retirement to the Pope in advance of his 75th birthday this month, obeyed the instruction and offered an apology ‘to all whom I have offended’. Yesterday’s statement said: ‘In recent days certain allegations which have been made against me have become public. Initially, their anonymous and non-specific nature led me to contest them. ‘However, I wish to take this opportunity to admit that there have been times that my sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest, archbishop and cardinal.’ He added: ‘To those I have offended, I apologise and ask forgiveness. To the Catholic Church and people of Scotland, I also apologise. I will now spend the rest of my life in retirement. I will play no further part in the public life of the Catholic Church in Scotland.' If, as is likely, the Church launches an inquiry into the allegations, it will be conducted at the Vatican under the aegis of the new Pope, rather than by Scottish officials. The investigation's findings might never be made public. Three of the four men who complained about Cardinal O’Brien’s behaviour are still priests in the diocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh, where until last Monday, the cardinal was archbishop. The church in Scotland is now under the temporary leadership of Archbishop of Glasgow Philip Tartaglia, who does not hold the rank of cardinal and so cannot take Cardinal O’Brien’s place in the papal conclave. No English cleric is qualified to join the conclave. In . the Observer, which first reported the story last week, the former . priest who made the accusations and remains anonymous, today said he had . been 'disappointed' by the church's reaction. He . said: 'There have been two sensations for me this week. One is feeling . the hot breath of the media on the back of my neck and the other is . sensing the cold disapproval of the church hierarchy for daring to break . ranks. I feel like if they could crush me, they would. Resignation: The 74-year-old Cardinal pictured with Pope Benedict XVI and the Duke of Edinburgh . Position: The Archbishop was the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland and the UK's senior priest . 'The vacuum the church has created has . allowed whimsy and speculation to distort the truth, and the only . support I have been offered is a cursory email with a couple of . telephone numbers of counsellors hundreds of miles away from me.' The former clergyman claimed that . when he was a seminarian at St Andrew's College, Drygrange, in 1980, . Cardinal O'Brien made an inappropriate approach to him after night . prayers. Another priest . said the Cardinal visited him at his parish and that inappropriate . contact took place between them, while a third complainant alleged that . he was subjected to 'unwanted behaviour' from the cleric in the 1980s . after some late-night drinking. Accused: The allegations of 'inappropriate' behaviour have been made by three priests and a former priest . The . cardinal has also been accused by another member of the clergy of using . night prayers as an excuse for inappropriate contact. After stepping down, Cardinal O'Brien . became Archbishop Emeritus of St Andrews and Edinburgh but had no role . in the governance of the diocese. The Scottish Catholic Media Office made no comment today, but last week its director Peter Kearney said the Cardinal's resignation had not been accelerated because of the allegations. He said: 'The timing is very unfortunate and it does appear as if one has followed the other, which in terms of chronology one has followed the other, but that's not the same as saying one caused the other. 'When it comes to responding to the allegations I think what he will do is act on his legal advice, and the legal advice at the moment would be to not publicly engage with the detail as it stands of the allegations.' Another priest has called for the Catholic Church in Scotland to be more open in dealing with complaints. Father John Robinson said: 'If the Catholic Church in Scotland is to heal itself, we need transparency and understanding. 'We need to learn lessons from the mistakes we have made in the past and move on to become a more loving and understanding church which does not condemn victims or even abusers.' Cardinal O’Brien’s apology follows growing controversy over his leadership in recent weeks. The vehemence of his public stand against same-sex marriage led to condemnation by the gay lobby. However, in a surprise move just a day . before the sex scandal broke, he upset traditionalists by calling for . priests to be given the right to marry. In Rome: The Cardinal had been due to travel to the Vatican to take part in the forthcoming papal conclave . Senior church figures are expected to . go at 75, but the Vatican often allows leeway of a year or two. Following news of the sex scandal over the weekend, the Pope gave . Cardinal O’Brien no choice. ‘The Holy Father has now decided that . my resignation will take effect today, 25 February 2013, and that he . will appoint an Apostolic Administrator to govern the Archdiocese in my . place until my successor is appointed,’ Cardinal O’Brien said. The Cardinal said in his statement: ‘I . thank Pope Benedict XVI for his kindness and courtesy to me and…I wish . him a long and happy retirement. ‘I also ask God’s blessing on my . brother Cardinals who will soon gather in Rome to elect his successor. I . will not join them for this conclave. I do not wish media attention in . Rome to be focused on me – but rather on Pope Benedict XVI and on his . successor.’ Speaking on today's Radio 4 programme, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, the former Archbishop of Westminster, said: 'It is clearly very sad. The person involved has apologised. He is now going to leave public life. For me my thoughts and prayers are with everyone. 'The church has been on a learning curve. It has made quite sure that in the future there will be transparency and that procedures are put in place for safeguarding children. 'There has always been sinners in the church but there has always been saints. The fact it hasn't failed indefectibly says something about the mystery of the church. 'In society today there are things that are wrong and for which people need to repent. Sometimes it is the weakness of an individual. 'The vast majority of priests and bishops are good and faithful men who are faithful to what they do, to what they preach and their way of life. 'To say that this has sort of infected everywhere is just not true.' 'In regards to child protection the church itself has ensured if there are allegations made they are dealt with severely and transparently. 'As the church goes through history it develops and faces new challenges and new questions and has to do so. But to change everything, I just don't agree.'

"A 28-year-old math teacher has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting three male students at a California school. Melissa Nicole Lindgren is accused of sexually assaulting students at Nicolas Junior High School in Fullerton, where she worked for six years before her arrest in February. The victims, ranging in age from 13 to 15 years old, claim the teacher molested them and sent them sexually explicit texts. Court appearance: Lindgren appeared in court Wednesday and pleaded not guilty to sexually molesting her students . Lindgren is charged with five counts of lewd acts on a child, two counts of lewd acts on a child younger than 14 and three counts of distributing pornography to a minor in incidents that occurred both on campus and off. She was arrested on school grounds on February 21 after one of the victims reported being sexually assaulted to the Fullerton Police Department and released on $100,000 bail. According to the Los Angeles Times, Lindgren is accused of sexually touching and kissing one boy in her classroom, a second boy on the school campus and a third student in her car. She also sent sexual text messages to all three the boys, say prosecutors. The incidents occurred between 2012 and 2014. 'The students, parents, faculty and staff of Fullerton School District came together to overcome the difficulties surrounding the acts of this teacher,' Superintendent Bob Pletka said in a prepared statement. Accused child molester: Melissa Nicole Lindgren faces more than 16 years in prison if found guilty . 'This matter is now being addressed by the judicial system, and we trust that justice will be served.' Students told KTLA that the allegations didn't come as a surprise. 'She was a great teacher, she was really nice,' said one. 'It surprisingly didn't really surprise me. She used to be a little flirty sometimes with the other male students... She would joke about going on some dates with students.' Another student said Lindgren would make risque jokes and say 'the b-word' in class. 'She was trying to be cool with the kids.' If convicted, Lindgren faces a maximum sentence of 16 years and four months in prison and will be forced to enter the sex offenders registry.

Guilty: Jack Wall, 22, faces life behind bars after a jury found him guilty of murdering his ex-girlfriend Amelia Arnold (left) He snapped during an argument while he . was moving his things out of their flat, a day after she told him she . was leaving him for good. With the help of his uncle, Joe . Potter, he cleaned the scene to destroy incriminating . evidence, before rolling her body up in a carpet and dumping it in a . field. He handed himself into police three . days later, but was so high on cannabis that detectives had to wait . until the following day to interview him. Judge Aidan Marron QC said Wall used . ‘gross, savage violence’ to kill Miss Arnold, and ordered him to serve . at least 19 years of a life sentence. ‘You took a dumbbell and hit her with terrifying force, fracturing her skull and causing fatal damage to her brain’, he said. ‘You then went on when you thought she may be alive to apply further violence to finish her off.’ The killer, who had stormed out of the . dock when he was convicted following a two-week trial on Friday, looked . on impassively as the sentence was handed down at Blackfriars Crown . Court. Abandoned: The body of Amelia Arnold was dumped in a woodland by Wall in Hatfield . He had admitted manslaughter, but . denied murder, claiming he lost control when Miss Arnold threatened to . call the police during their row. Following the verdict, her father . Laurence said: ‘Nothing is going to bring Amelia back to us - we will . never get over this tragedy.’ Prosecutor Jane Bickerstaff QC said: . ‘This murder took place in the victim’s own home in the presence of her . and the defendant’s child, who of course is now left parentless. ‘There’s clear evidence that the . defendant intended to kill, as demonstrated not only by the number and . ferocity of blows he delivered to the back of the head of the victim. ‘He indicated he thought she was playing dead so he hit her some more and strangled her. ‘When he heard a noise come out of her . mouth when he folded her up, he himself said he thought she was alive . and it scared him, so he shoved a sock into her mouth.’ Potter, 41, admitted helping his nephew dispose of the body and trying to stop it ever being discovered. Clues: Police set up a cordon at Miss Arnold's house to find evidence, but did not discover her body until four days after she disappeared . The court heard he was a career . criminal, with a string of convictions including for theft, burglary, . escaping from custody, drug dealing and violence which sate back to . 1987. He had been trying to move away from crime when he helped Wall. Judge Marron said: 'I accept without . any reservation at all that whenever you came out from home in the . Milton Keynes area to Stevenage, you had no idea of the task which . awaited you.' He said Potter had done his best to redeem himself by helping police, but added a prison term was inevitable. Potter was jailed for two and a half . years concurrently on both offences of perverting the course of justice . and obstructing a coroner. The murder took place at Ms Arnold’s rented home in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, on November 8 last year. The teenage mother had previously . complained to her mother and a GP about Hall’s abuse, and the day before . her death met a domestic violence officer at Hatfield Police Station - . but made no formal complaint. Giving evidence her mother, Amanda . Joy, said her daughter, regularly complained of Wall’s behaviour in the . weeks before the murder. Disappearance: The teenager from Stevenage was missing for four days before police discovered her body in a wood . ‘Once Amanda started to go out with . Jack Wall, her personality seemed to chance and she became moodier, . argumentative, aggressive, and confrontational’, she said. 'When she came to me, all she moaned about and all she complained about was Jack.' But she added the teenager ‘wanted to keep giving him one more chance’ despite the violence. Her body was discovered in Hatfield . Woods, Hertfordshire on November 11, while a blood-stained carpet was . found in Hollybush Lane, Welwyn Garden City. The shallow grave was coated in disinfectant to deter animals from digging up the corpse. Both Potter and Wall also admitted obstructing a coroner. Wall was jailed for life with a . minimum sentence of 19 years for murder, and a concurrent sentence of . four and a half years for obstructing a coroner. Potter was jailed for two and a half years concurrently for perverting the course of justice and obstructing a coroner.","Jack Wall jailed for minimum of 19 years after being found guilty of murder .

"Scientists have used light brighter than 10 billion suns to examine the cracks, fractures and breaks in the bones of a 150 million-year-old dinosaur. Researchers said their groundbreaking work - using synchrotron-imaging techniques - sheds new light on the healing process that took place when these animals were still alive. The study took advantage of the fact that dinosaur bones occasionally preserve evidence of trauma, sickness and the subsequent signs of healing. Giant meat-eating dinosaurs were a hard bunch capable of taking punishment as well as dishing it out, research suggests. Scientists used synchrotron-generated X-rays to analyse the chemical structure of a foot bone from Allosaurus, a two-legged carnivore that lived 150 million years ago to make the finding . Diagnosis of such fossils used to rely on the inspection of gnarled bones and healed fractures, often entailing slicing through a fossil to reveal its secrets. In another dino-study released today, an international team led by scientists at Oxford University and the . Royal Ontario Museum estimated the body mass of 426 dinosaur species . based on the thickness of their leg bones. The team found that . dinosaurs showed rapid rates of body size evolution shortly after they . appeared around 220 million years ago. However, these soon slowed and only the evolutionary line leading to birds continued to change size at this rate. This continued to happen for 170 million years, producing new ecological diversity not seen in other larger dinosaurs. But the synchrotron-based imaging, which uses light brighter than 10 billion suns, meant the team could tease out the chemical ghosts lurking within the preserved dinosaur bones. The impact of massive trauma, they discovered, seemed to be shrugged off by many predatory dinosaurs. Fossil bones often showed a multitude of healed injuries, for example, most of which would prove fatal to humans if not medically treated. Dr Phil Manning, one of the paper's authors based in Manchester's School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, said: 'Using synchrotron imaging, we were able to detect astoundingly dilute traces of chemical signatures that reveal not only the difference between normal and healed bone, but also how the damaged bone healed. 'It seems dinosaurs evolved a splendid suite of defence mechanisms to help regulate the healing and repair of injuries. 'The ability to diagnose such processes some 150 million years later might well shed new light on how we can use Jurassic chemistry in the 21st Century. 'The chemistry of life leaves clues throughout our bodies in the course of our lives that can help us diagnose, treat and heal a multitude of modern-day ailments. 'It's remarkable that the very same chemistry that initiates the healing of bone in humans also seems to have followed a similar pathway in dinosaurs.' This is an artist's illustration of the Allosaurus the scientists investigated. Preserved dinosaur skeletons show signs of injury that the scientists were able to detect using state-of-the-art imaging techniques . Bone does not form scar tissue, unlike a scratch on the skin, so the body has to completely reform new bone following the same stages that occurred as the skeleton grew in the first place. This meant the researchers were able to tease out the chemistry of bone development through such pathological studies. 'It's exciting to realise how little we know about bone, even after hundreds of years of research, said co-author Jennifer Anné. 'The fact that information on how our own skeleton works can be explored using a 150-million-year-old dinosaur just shows how interlaced science can be.' Professor Roy Wogelius, another co-author from The University of Manchester, added: 'It is a fine line when diagnosing which part of the fossil was emplaced after burial and what was original chemistry to the organism. 'It is only through the precise measurements that we undertake at the Diamond Synchrotron Lightsource in the UK and the Stanford Synchrotron Lightsource in the US that we were able to make such judgements.' The findings are published in the Royal Society journal Interface.","Scientists used state-of-the-art techniques to study dinosaur bones .

"Whitehall bureaucrats with just a few hours training have been drafted in as Britain's first line of defence against Ebola. Around 80 civil servants will carry out checks for the deadly virus on passengers arriving at Heathrow, it has been revealed. The volunteers will use a gun-style thermometer to take travellers' temperatures from a safe distance without physical contact. Scroll down for video . British civil servants will be equipped with gun-style thermometers used here by a Moroccan health worker to test a passenger at the arrivals hall of the Mohammed V airport in Casablanca earlier this month . Screening started at Heathrow a fortnight ago, but there are not enough trained staff to man the border, the Mirror reported today. The new border bureaucrats will question travellers from countries such as Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea and take their temperatures. They have been drafted in to get the system up and running while Public Health England recruit staff to work in the screening rooms. Shadow Transport ­Secretary Mary Creagh said it was 'more evidence of this government's shambolic handling of this serious issue'. The Labour MP added: 'Public health should not rely on people's goodwill. If there is a job to do, it should be done by properly-trained staff.' But the Cabinet Office said the civil servants were working alongside trained medical experts who take over as soon as anyone is suspected of carrying the disease. The government also insisted that the volunteers had been given proper training. Health workers carry the body of an Ebola virus victim in the Waterloo district of Freetown, Sierra Leone . A billboard with a message about Ebola is seen on a street in Conakry, Guinea in the Ebola-stricken West African country . Civil servant sent to questions travellers from West Africa will be told about how the virus is transferred and the risks they face. Officials also insist the threat of catching the disease are 'very low'. A spokesman said: 'This Government's first priority is the safety of the British people. Trained civil servants are helping staff screening rooms as a short-term measure to deal with a serious public health issue.' But Shadow Health minister Jamie Reed said: 'If screening at airports is going to work, Ministers must make sure there are enough health workers. A lack of staff cannot mean something so serious is left to volunteers.' More than 10,000 people have now been infected with Ebola worldwide and around half have died, global health chiefs said over the weekend. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt sparked confusion when he suggested that travellers would have to volunteer to be tested. But Downing Street said the checks were compulsory. Experts said tests are unlikely to detect infected travellers but they do provide an opportunity to tell anyone who might develop symptoms the importance of seeking medical help.","Around 80 volunteers to carry out checks for deadly virus  at Heathrow .

"The friend of Texas Ebola patient, Thomas Duncan, who visited the man on the day he was admitted to hospital has been told he can return to work as a nursing assistant. But the agony of uncertainty is not over for Aaron Yah, 43, and his family. In a confusing twist his wife, Youngor Jallah 35, Mr Duncan’s stepdaughter, as Ms Jallah and the couple’s four children aged between two and 11 have been told they must remain in quarantine with only Mr Yah free to come and go. Scroll down for video . Allowed out: Aaron Yah, 43, will be released from his quarantine to work as a nursing assistant . Speaking to MailOnline at their small apartment in Dallas last night, Mr Yah revealed that CDC and State Health Authority officials had finally visited the family late yesterday evening. The family had been left a full 24 hours without information and cut off from all communication due to power cuts brought on by the violent electrical storms that hit the city on Thursday. He said: ‘I have been told I can go back to work but they will decide if there are duties I can do and duties I cannot. ‘They will give me a clearance document and speak to my employer. But they will still monitor me every day.’ It is a strange halfway house for the family, all of whom have been exposed to Mr Duncan during his most violent phase of symptoms. Mr Yah explained, ‘Youngor must stay here with the children because she had more contact than me. She was in the ambulance and she helped clean it and she tended to her father.’ Ms Jallah, also a nursing assistant, sat on a fold up chair outside the front door of the apartment that has been the family’s holding cell since Mr Duncan’s diagnosis last week. She expressed relief for her husband’s situation and explained the conflicting news delivered by the CDC officials who had left just moments before MailOnline arrived. She said: ‘They have said he can go out. I can sit here and the children can come outside this far but that we cannot go downstairs or any further than this.’ She gestured, drawing an imaginary boundary on the exterior stairwell, two chairs’ breadth from the apartment’s front door. The children, aged two, four, six and 11, smiled broadly, clearly delighted with even this small freedom. Danger: Thomas Duncan (left) is still being treated for Ebola in Texas, and Youngor Jallah must remain in isolation at home because she touched Duncan - her stepfather-to-be - when she gave him tea in hospital . Sanitizing: A Hazmat team finally arrived to Duncan's flat yesterday to sanitize the premises . Earlier Ms Jallah had appeared sticky eyed and congested but as dusk crept in she looked simply weary and glad for the fresh air now afforded her and her children. Ebola is only contagious when the infected person is exhibiting symptoms. But it can then be transmitted by an exchange of body fluids including blood, saliva, semen and feces if contact is at a point of entry like a cut or graze, mouth, nose or eyes. The entire family has had exposure during the time when Mr Duncan was exhibiting increasingly violent symptoms. Both Mr Yah and Ms Jallah visited the sick man on the day he was taken into hospital and the children all spent the night in the apartment where their grandmother often cared for them while their parents – both nursing assistants – worked. They are among the ten considered high risk by health officials yet the extent to which they have been left adrift in the midst of this crisis is breathtaking. Yesterday Ms Jalllah’s mother, Louise Troh, along with the other quarantined occupants of the Ivy Apartments unit in which Mr Duncan briefly stayed, was finally moved to another location as Hazmat suited teams moved in to begin the two phases of cleaning and securing the contaminated apartment. In a brief telephone conversation with MailOnline shortly before the family were moved Ms Troh insisted, ‘I am fine. Thank God we are all fine.’ She would not comment on her worries for the man who had travelled to this country from Liberia to marry her and who now lies in a hospital bed, too weak to pray or communicate with family. Ms Jallah last saw her mother when she visited the now empty Ivy Apartment last Sunday. She told the Washington Post that she found him in bed, fully dressed and shivering. After going to buy him a blanket she brought the man she calls Daddy some hot tea when she noticed redness in his eyes, a well publicized sign of Ebola. Evacuated: There are ten people who are considered high-risk, and were moved to an isolated apartment . Moving: Here an official can be seen leading a young man from the block in Dallas, Texas, to transportation . With his temperature at 102F, Ms Jallah who, like her husband Mr Yah is a nursing assistant, called 911. When the ambulance arrived Ms Jallah brought the blanket in which she had wrapped her stepfather to the hospital. Earlier this week Mr Yah told MailOnline his own brief conversation with his friend that day. He said, ‘The last time I saw Thomas was Sunday, the day he went to hospital. I had seen him after he went to hospital the first time and he was looking fine, he had been just fine. ‘But that day I passed by on Sunday he was lying down on the bed in the room and I asked him how he was. He said, “I’m not okay.” ‘He said he had been having diarrhea all night.’ Mr Duncan was diagnosed on Tuesday, and Mr Yah said that he was told the news the very day he was supposed to go back to work at the Meadows Nursing home. Last night, though visibly relieved at the news he had received from CDC and State Health officials Mr Yah said that he did not intend to return to work for several days at least. He said, ‘I am glad but right now I want to be here for my family. I need to look after them. Money is not easy but sometimes things are more important than money. ‘Family is more important.’","Aaron Yah, wife Youngor Jallah and four children ages 2,4,6, and 11 have been quarantined .

"Public opinion about the First World War is too influenced by the sitcom Blackadder, the minister in charge of marking the centenary of the conflict has warned. Defence minister Dr Andrew Murrison said commemorations next year were an opportunity to ‘balance’ the way the Rowan Atkinson series distorted the reality of the Great War. But he insisted that the government was not trying to dictate ‘approved versions of history’. Sitcom: The BBC comedy Blackadder Goes Forth, starring (left to right) Tim McInnerny, Rowan Atkinson, Stephen Fry, Tony Robinson and Hugh Laurie, gives a distorted view of the First World War, MPs were told . An ambitious £50million programme of events is planned to mark 100 years since the outbreak of war in 1914. Schoolchildren from every state secondary school will travel to the First World War battlefields as part of the commemorations, with communities across the UK urged to organise events. During a Commons debate on the plans today, Dr Murrison said the events were a chance to ‘improve’ the nation’s ‘grasp’ of World War One. He singled out Blackadder, and the 1960s Dirk Bogarde musical Oh! What A Lovely War, for distorting what people thought really happened on the frontline. Dr Murrison, who was a surgeon commander with the Royal Navy serving in the Gulf War between 1990/91 and in Iraq in 2003, told MPs: ‘Improvement of our grasp of the causes, conduct and consequences of the First World War must be at the heart of the centenary that is about to break upon us. Events: Defence minister Dr Andrew Murrison, a Royal Navy surgeon, said he wanted to rebalance what people knew of the war . ‘Because there are those who are asking what's the point of it all, we risk disconnection from a defining event of our time and an opportunity, perhaps, to balance the Oh! What A Lovely War/Blackadder take on history, that has sadly been in the ascendant for the past 50 years. ‘And in its place I hope we will have a richer, deeper and more reflective legacy.’ Last month Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman said it was ‘astonishing’ that children were being shown Blackadder Goes Forth in school to teach them about the First World War, Jeremy Paxman. He said he thought it was because ‘it is much easier to imagine the First World War with the help of other people’s imaginations’. The Newsnight presenter said he believed people’s difficulty in understanding the war originated in the fact ‘we have been accustomed to seeing the First World War as poetry rather than history.’ In the Commons Dr Murrison said the events were even more important because there were no surviving veterans from the battlefields. ‘We must commemorate this centenary because with the passing in 2009 of Harry Patch, Bill Stone and Henry Allingham, our last tangible links with the First World War are retreating into the shadows,’ he said. But he insisted that government would not dictate the terms of any such debate regarding the nation's understanding of war. ‘The role of government in the centenary, is to lead, encourage and help make it all happen, whilst avoiding the temptation to prescribe. ‘It is emphatically not the place of government in our 21st century liberal democracy handing down approved versions of history.’ Memories: The deaths of WWI veterans (left to right) Henry Allingham, Harry Patch, and Bill Stone broke the 'last tangible link' with the conflict, Dr Murrison said . Labour’s shadow defence minister Dan Jarvis said commemoration not celebration was the appropriate tone for events. He added: ‘The facts of World War One cannot be counted in terms of just battlefield casualties or military innovations. ‘By dint of its influence and its timing, and the wider social change it brought about, it is the single most significant event of the 20th century. ‘As such, it is something we must commemorate, we must learn from, and we must educate our children about. ‘But above all we must remember, because it is only through remembering we will truly understand the impact World War One has had on British society and in doing so understand what it means to be British.’","Dr Andrew Murrison wants events to 'balance' views of BBC sitcom .

"Gordon Brown's closest aides prepared him for the Prime Minister's job by hurling abuse like 'Sod off you Scottish Git' at him, it was revealed today. His former special adviser Damian McBride said he and other colleagues would scream insults to 'get under the skin' of the former Labour leader, who would shout back the mantra 'I will do my utmost'. Mr Brown took the abuse in his office as he readied himself to replace Tony Blair on June 27, 2007. Partnership: Damian McBride, front left, screamed at Gordon Brown, right, to help him prepare for the top job . In a blog posted today, exactly five years after Mr Brown entered Number 10 Downing Street, Mr McBride wrote that these heckles were designed to reproduce what he would face in the top job. Protesters were hanging outside Downing Street calling Mr Blair a war criminal as he left office, he said, so Mr Brown also needed to be prepared for receiving the most upsetting remarks. 'It’s not often you’re paid to hurl abuse at someone who’s about to become the most powerful man in the country, but that’s how the day started,' he said. 'Given Iraq war protestors were already gathering at the Downing Street gates to see off Tony Blair, we suggested he do a few run-throughs with us heckling him so he could get used to the distraction he’d experience later. Historic: This is the moment Tony Blair handed over power to Gordon Brown in the hall of Downing Street in 2007 . 'I did always wonder what any Treasury officials passing outside the room would have thought hearing Gordon booming out: ""I will do my utmost"" while I shouted back at him: ""Sod off, you Scottish Git!"" 'Sue’s (Nye, fellow adviser) heckles were from the Father Ted school (""Booo!"", ""Hiss!"", ""You’re a very bad man!"", etc.), but I tried to get in the spirit a bit more: 'Blood on your hands, Brown!', You’re a murderer, Brown!' 'Every so often, I’d shout something that would get under his skin, and he’d stop his speech and just give me a long, deathly stare. I’d protest: “Well you can’t do that if someone says it in the street”, which got me another stare,' he wrote. The blog gives a fascinating insight into what happened on that historic day. But Downing Street Press adviser Mr McBride was later forced to resign . after a series of emails he sent from No10 to fellow Labour spin doctor . Derek Draper. Battle: Mr McBride's blog also reveals that Mr Brown wanted to scrap tuition fees but feared reprisals from Blair's supporters . In the emails, Mr McBride, one of the Prime Minister’s most loyal and . trusted advisers, reportedly made ‘vile’ and false allegations against . Mr Osborne and Mr Cameron concerning their private lives. Mr McBride's piece also details how hard Mr Brown tried to get Tony Blair's staff to work for him, which Mr McBride described as 'humiliating'. It also revealed that he would have scrapped tuition fees but feared a backlash from Tony Blair's supporters. 'If he’d succeeded,' McBride said, 'it would have strengthened his hand to make major departures from Blair policies in his early days. 'Proposals such as scrapping tuition fees which had been high on the list of planned announcements were shelved because Gordon didn’t feel secure enough against a Blairite backlash.' And his fate was sealed because he did not take across enough staff from his Chancellor's office in the Treasury, he said. 'In No. 10, he inherited equally-brilliant, equally-expert civil servants, but – because there was not the same level of trust and confidence on his side, and the same knowledge of how best to work with him on theirs – the micro-manager within Gordon re-surfaced,' he said.","Special adviser Damian McBride has admitted he screamed insults at Mr Brown to 'get under his skin'

"If you’re planning to update your iPhone or iPad to the latest iOS 8 software, you may be in for a shock. Although the update files themselves take up less than 1GB of space, the total software needs between 3GB and 5GB of storage to complete the install, depending on how up-to-date the device is. This means that if you don’t have enough space on your device, you may need to get rid of photos, videos, files and apps just to make room. Scroll down for video . Apple released iOS 8 (pictured) worldwide on Wednesday. Although the update files themselves take up less than 1GB of space, the total software needs between 3GB and 5GB of storage to complete the install, depending on how up-to-date the device is . Apple unveiled iOS 8 in June and released it worldwide on Wednesday, and although the size may seem substantial, it is average for mobile software of this kind. Design-wise, iOS 8 looks similar to iOS 7, with flat icons and menus. The search function on Apple’s Photos app has been improved to make it easier to find photos, based on location, dates, or album name. The Messages app in iOS 8 now lets users capture sounds to send in conversations, including voice notes, ambient sounds and music. The new Messages app also takes on Whatsapp by additionally letting users send videos, start group conversations and enable Do Not Disturb to hide group notifications until a later time. Elsewhere, users can send their location to friends, which appear on an interactive map, and send multiple photos and videos from the Camera Roll. Although the size of the software may seem substantial, it is average for mobile software of this kind. However, if users don’t have enough space on their device, they may need to get rid of photos, videos, files and apps just to make room . Users can upgrade to iOS 8 by opening Settings, General, and Software Update. If users need to clear space, they can begin by uploading photos and files to iCloud. If the Photo Stream feature is enabled, there may be duplicate photos in the Camera Roll and iCloud. Once the photos are backed up, these duplicates can be removed. Backups automatically take place when the feature is enabled - in Settings, iCloud, Storage & Backup - and the device is plugged into the mains, and connected to Wi-Fi. Files can also be transferred to a laptop or PC by connecting the device to the computer. To delete apps, press and hold the icon on the homescreen and click the cross. Apps that are removed from the device are still accessible from iCloud. Once the software is installed, if there is enough room, users can then re-download any apps they removed. Be aware that when apps are deleted, typically their data is removed as well, which won’t be recoverable. In addition to deleting photos and videos, messages equally take up storage space and full, unwanted conversations should be removed to make room. Clearing cookies used to store data on Apple’s Safari browser will also make space. This can be done in Settings, Safari, Clear Cookies and select Data. These new features need room on the device, but during the install, Apple also needs somewhere to temporarily store iOS 7 while it is being replaced. It also needs room to unpack software files, before compressing them, which means that although the update may need a certain amount of space, the final space it occupies should be less. Users can upgrade to the software by opening Settings, General, and selecting Software Update.

"Scientists have created the first viable alternative to antibiotics, marking the next step in the fight against drug-resistant superbugs . Scientists have created the first viable alternative to antibiotics, marking the next step in the fight against drug-resistant superbugs. A small test study has found the new drug is effective at targeting the bacteria that causes MRSA. Researchers believe the likelihood of the bug developing a resistance to the new drug is 'very limited'. A version of the drug is already used in specialist creams to treat conditions including acne, eczema, rosacea and skin irritations. Dutch biotech firm Micreos claims Staphefekt is the first endolysin - a bacteria-killing enzyme - available for use on human skin. While targeting MRSA and other strains of bacteria resistant to antibiotics, the drug's make up means it leaves 'good' bacteria unharmed - important in the case of long-term use. The firm unveiled its discovery at the EuroSciCon meeting, Antibiotics Alternatives for the New Millenium, in London yesterday. CEO Mark Offerhaus hailed it as a 'new era in the fight against antibiotic resistant bacteria', and said 'millions of people stand to benefit'. MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, is a potentially deadly bacteria which causes serious infections of the skin, blood, lungs and bones. It is resistant to antibiotics and poses a serious threat in hospitals and nursing homes. Across the EU and USA the death toll runs to nearly 50,000 a year, inducing healthcare costs of around £14billion, according to the World Health Organisation. Such is the concern over antibiotic resistance that earlier this year, Prime Minister David Cameron warned of the 'very real and worrying threat' that could send medicine 'back to the dark ages'. In May, chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies echoed health secretary Jeremy Hunt's concerns, warning resistance of antibiotics is one of the greatest threats to modern health. Staphefekt is based on naturally occurring enzymes called endolysins, which are found in viruses and kill bacteria. Endolysins originate from bacteriophages (phages) - microorganisms that target bacteria. In nature, phages use bacteria to replicate, in the process destroying the bacterial cell wall with endolysins. The working mechanism is very different to that of antibiotics, meaning even strains of bacteria resistant to antibiotics are susceptible to the new drug. Staphefekt exhibits several other characteristics including rapid killing of the target bacteria. And the likelihood of emerging resistance to the drug is 'very limited', because it works independent of the bacterial metabolism - which harbours the ability to resist - and targets a region of the bacterial cell wall less susceptible to mutation. In addition the drug has been found to only target specific bacteria, leaving those beneficial strains unharmed. Addressing the World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, Dame Sally said: 'If we don't take action, in 20 years' time we could be back in the 19th century where infections kill us as a result of routine operations.' Last month Dame Sally put the threat in perspective, warning it is 'as big as terrorism', and could result in minor scratches or routine operations becoming fatal. The new drug is based on naturally occurring enzymes called endolysins, which are found in viruses and kill bacteria in a different way to antibiotics. In an observational study, Staphefekt killed MRSA in five out of six people suffering skin conditions including dermatitis and eczema. Clinical biologist Dr Bjorn Herpers told the conference: 'The results are exciting, and demonstrate the potential this technology has to revolutionise the way we treat certain bacterial infections. 'With the increasing prevalence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria, new strategies for the treatment of bacterial infections are needed. 'As well as being less prone to resistance induction than antibiotics, endolysins (enzymes) destroy only their target bacterial species, leaving the beneficial bacteria alone.' A small test study has found the new drug is effective at targeting the bacteria that causes MRSA, pictured under the microscope . Scientists have hailed the discovery as a 'new era in the fight against antibiotic resistant bacteria', and said 'millions of people stand to benefit' The ability of the new drug to leave beneficial unharmed is also a major step forward. A side-effect of broad spectrum antibiotics is that they can change the body's normal microbial content by attacking indiscriminately both the pathological and naturally occurring, beneficial or harmless bacteria, found in the intestines, lungs and bladder. The destruction of the body's normal bacterial flora can provide an opportunity for drug-resistant micro-organisms to grow, leading to secondary infections including Clostridium difficile, and thrush. Brendan Wren, an expert in infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told The Times: 'We are all aware that the post-antibiotic apocalypse is upon us, where we won't be able to use antibiotics because of resistance, and one could argue that this is more acute than concerns such as climate change. 'We're so desperate for new alternatives and this one looks like it's at the leading edge.' The firm is to conduct clinical trials of Staphefekt and is looking to expand them internationally.","A small test study found Staphefekt is effective in targeting MRSA .

"If Ted Cruz isn't running for president, his closest friends are setting up a super PAC for nothing. The 'Stand for Principle' PAC filed papers with the Federal Election Commission on Friday, and the organization's founder says it will be the go-to financial behemoth supporting the Texas senator in 2016. Super PACs can raise unlimited amounts of money as long as they don't coordinate their activities with political campaigns. The emergence of a funding stream set up by Cruz supporter Maria Strollo Zack signals that the tea party firebrand is laying the groundwork for an announcement – and Zack plans to raise a ton of money. 'We'd like to be $50 million by the end of March 2016, going into Super Tuesday,' she told MailOnline on Wednesday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO AND THE FEC FILING . NEXT UP, 2016: Ted Cruz spoke at a Texas Republican victory party after the GOP's historic Nov. 4 Senate gains, but has his eyes fixed on 2016 and the presidency . THE CRUZ-WHISPERER? Maria Stroll Zack (third from right in blue) helped Newt Gingrich win the Republican primary in his home state of Georgia in 2012 . Stand for Principle isn't a so-called 'draft committee'; like those bearing the names of Hillary Clinton on the left and pediatric surgeon Ben Carson on the right. Cruz's office in Washington declined comment. While Cruz can't legally partner with Zack, his close lifelong friend David Panton gave the project a nod and will be its most visible volunteer. A source close to the Stand for Principle PAC's formation told MailOnline that Panton, a Jamaican Rhodes Scholar who once roomed with Cruz at Princeton, chose the name. Zack, the PAC's chairwoman, is a Georgia business development executive who said her firm's primary purpose is to help startup companies get off the ground. That firm, The Strollo Group, also has a small government affairs arm that lobbies in Georgia. The new political vehicle, she said, is the first effort supporting Cruz to get off the ground, and will enjoy the support of his closest friends and allies, mostly on the Republican Party's right wing. MASTER OF RHETORIC: Cruz was quick to frame the White House's latest Internet policy in a way that connects it to the president's increasingly unpopular medical insurance overhaul . 'The reason we're starting it,' Zack said, 'is that America craves, thirsts and hungers for strong, bold, principled conservative leadership.' She was former House Speaker and fellow Georgian Newt Gingrich's southeast political director during the 2012 presidential primaries, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's state co-chair in 2008. BFF: David Panton was Cruz's college roommate and one of only two black presidents of the Harvard Law Review – the other was Barack Obama . 'Both campaigns won Georgia' in the Republican primaries,' she told MailOnline. And now both Gingrich and Huckabee loyalists, she said, are 'looking for the right leaders who can win a general election.' Huckabee may take another bite at the presidential apple himself in 2016, but he's considered a long shot. Cruz, by contrast, is poised to be a major player when the primary season gets off the ground just months from now. He spent the 2014 election season building alliances with Republican leaders in key early states and storing up chits with members of Congress. And his communications shop is a reliable source of daily-churning quotables written to keep him in the spotlight. On Monday when the White House announced its support of a 'net neutrality' policy that the FCC has been working on for years, Cruz quipped that the idea was like 'Obamacare for the Internet.' Super PACs became a liberal playground in the 2014 election, but their incessant ad buys had little effect on Republican-friendly results in marquee U.S. Senate races. TEXAS RED: Cruz, who would be America's first Hispanic president, is among America's most consistently conservative national political figures . The Center for Responsive Politics reports that liberal super PACs raised more than $337 million during the 2014 election cycle – 58 per cent more than their conservative counterparts. Left-wing super PACs accounted for the three largest fundraising totals, $158 million in all. The two largest individual donors since 2013 were global warming warrior Tom Steyer and gun control advocate Michael Bloomberg, who put a combined $93 million into liberal super PACs. Those numbers could all pale in comparison to what's about to begin. In the 2012 presidential contest, super PACs raised more than $858 million. Two groups supporting Mitt Romney raised nearly one-third of the total. Cruz has emerged as a rock star on the political right, calling for a total repeal of the Obamacare medical insurance overhaul law and loudly opposing President Barack Obama's promised 'amnesty' for millions of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. A 'Draft Ted Cruz for President' super PAC was formed eight months ago, but has raised less than $380,000 and only has $15,708 in its bank account, according to FEC records. Its online petition has collected fewer than 18,000 signatures. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has at least seven separate super PACs jockeying for position. The biggest, 'Ready for Hillary,' has raised more than $10.2 million and spent 93 per cent of it already. But even that pile of cash is one-upped by the $11 million raised by the 'Draft Ben Carson for President' committee, a group that the conservative doctor has disavowed.

"Scroll down for video . The First Lady's trip to China has hit a slight road bump after one of their highly-awaited guests appears to have missed a formal dinner. The Obamas were expected to meet the highly-reclusive Chinese princess Xi Mingze during a formal dinner on Friday night during their tour of China but she was nowhere to be seen. Much about Xi Mingze has been kept a secret to Chinese and foreign media but she is believed to be a student at Harvard University now and there were reports that she would travel to her homeland to meet Mrs Obama, her mother and her daughters because Harvard is in the middle of their spring break. Law enforcement sources originally reported that that Xi Mingze, 22, whose nickname is 'Muzi,' was believed to have returned to China from her off-campus apartment in East Cambridge that she rents under an alias, but she has not been seen since her alleged arrival. A welcomed visit: First Lady Michelle Obama toured the Summer Palace on Saturday (pictured), which marked the third day of her trip to China with her daughters and mother . US First Lady Michelle Obama prepares to delivers a speech at the Stanford Center at Peking University in Beijing on March 22, 2014. On display: They Malia (center) and Sasha (right) were at their mother's side as they watched the Peking Opera troup perform during the tour . Enthusiastic: Mrs Obama showed some spirit at one point in the performance on Saturday . Xi Mingze – who has never appeared in  public with her parents in China, according to Chinese media reports –  moved to the off-campus apartment this semester, says one law enforcement source who has been briefed on the significant security around s daughter, told MailOnline exclusively. The 'unassuming' only daughter of Chinese President Xi Jinpingi, who is also the leader of the Communist Party, lived in a Harvard University dorm under a pseudonym while surrounded by a phalanx of 'Chinese students' who are part of her around-the-clock security detail, said the source. ‘She is very-low key and her security detail are here masked as fellow students so they blend in,’ said the law enforcement source. Harvard classmates describe her as ‘studious and discreet’. Key seating: Mrs Obama and her entourage rode a boat during the visit at the Summer Palace . Far from home: She met with a group of American students who traveled to China on their spring break . It remained unclear if Princess Xi . Mingze was part of that tour, but the law enforcement source said police . were briefed on the Chinese First Daughter’s  whereabouts before spring . break began Monday. Muzi’s mother, Peng Liyuan is a . renowned honey-voiced megastar of popular Chinese folk music known for . her fashion and glamor, much like her guest, Michelle Obama. Peng . guided the First Family through the Forbidden Palace and showed off her . calligraphy talents with an entourage of admirers and photographers in . tow. ‘She was expected to return to China to attend a dinner for Michelle Obama,’ the source said. Friends at Harvard say she devotes . herself to her courses, which include political studies. She attended a . discussion last spring about the political tumult convulsing China's . Communist Party, where she reportedly listened 'intently' from the top . row of the lecture hall. Meeting fans: The First Lady met with students at the Stanford University Center at Peking University in Beijing later on Saturday . Avoiding controversy: Mrs Obama has tried to keep the trip apolitical, and when she has spoken out it is in favor of widely-accepted topics like the importance of studying aboad . Xi . Mingze has maintained a low profile at Harvard University, unlike . Michelle Obama’s husband President Barack Obama, who graduated from . Harvard Law School. Harvard graduate student and PhD . candidate Jennifer Yum, 30, said she was not surprised that the leader . of China’s Communist Party would send his only daughter to Harvard. Yum . was interviewed at Harvard’s Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies on . Cambridge Street, which just last September hosted a lecture event . titled: ‘Xi Jingpin and China’s Future: The Critical Issues’. ‘Harvard is where the powerful come to study. If you are an elite in the world, you study at Harvard,’ said Yum. Yum, . like other students interviewed, said that she was aware that Xi . Mingze’s father has prohibited many of the very elements of free speech . that are encouraged at Harvard. ‘I . still don't think it's hypocritical that the President sent his . daughter here’, Yum said. ‘Maybe she can learn how to be a better . leader.’ The daughters who showed up: Sasha (far left) and Malia joined the American Ambassador Max Baucus and Mrs Obama for their meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan on Friday . Formal: The President's greeting came as something of a coup since he was not expected to appear since President Obama is not a part of the trip . Tourist: Michelle Obama visits the Forbidden City with Peng Liyuan (2nd right), the wife of President Xi Jinping . Say cheese! Sasha, Malia, Mrs Obama, Peng Liyuan, and Marian Robinson pose for a photo in front of the Forbidden City on Friday . First ladies: Mrs Obama and her daughters will dine with her Chinese counterpart, Peng Liyuan (pictured) and her rarely-seen 22-year-old daughter . One of the most controversial talking . points that Mrs Obama addressed was when she spoke to students on . Saturday came when she touched on freedom of speech. China blocks many foreign news sites and social media services such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Its army of censors routinely filters out information deemed offensive by the government and silences dissenting voices. Though . not likely to be well-received by the government, Mrs. Obama's remarks . may not draw any strong protest because her speech and a subsequent . moderated discussion among 50 students - sitting in two identical . conference rooms in Beijing and Palo Alto, California, but connected via . modern technology - focused mainly on the value of educational . exchanges. Mrs. Obama . said the free flow of information is crucial 'because that's how we . discover truth, that's how we learn what's really happening in our . communities and our country and our world.' 'And . that's how we decide which values and ideas we think are best - by . questioning and debating them vigorously, by listening to all sides of . every argument and by judging for ourselves,' she said.","Not much is known about Xi Mingze other than she transferred to attend college at Harvard about two years ago .

"A new high speed rail line between London and the north is needed to allow thousands of southern Manchester United fans to get to the game more quickly, the project's boss suggested today. High Speed 2 chairman Sir David Higgins said the current two hour trip between London and Manchester meant people had to 'allow for a full day' if they wanted to get to Old Trafford. But he said a new £50billion line would slash journey times in half, adding: 'If you knew guaranteed that a train was going to take an hour to get from London to Manchester you could get up for a football game or for a meeting and be back and save the rest of the day.' Scroll down for video . David Higgins, the chairman of HS2 Ltd (left), with the Chancellor  George Osborne (right), said football fans would be able to get to the game much quicker with a new rail line . Mr Higgins' came after he unveiled plans for a new £7billion 'HS3' to improve journeys between northern cities. Backed by Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, HS3 would mean journey times between Leeds and Manchester could almost be cut in half. Journeys between Leeds and Birmingham, Leeds and Sheffield Meadowhall, York and Birmingham and Nottingham to Birmingham could also be reduced by a half or more, and many more journeys across the country substantially shortened. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir David said his plans for HS3 were 'a start of a conversation'. He said: 'This is not just a single project. It's more than the eye-catching journey-time reductions. HS3 will give northern England rail services twice the capacity and much more reliability.' Phase one of HS2 involves a new high-speed line from Euston in London passing through Tory heartlands in the Chilterns to Birmingham, with Sir David saying today that its completion would be in 2027. A new high speed rail line between London and Manchester will cost around £50billion . Manchester United fans in the south of England will be able to travel to watch the game in just an hour, Sir David said this morning . Phase two would see the line extended north from Birmingham in a Y-shaped route going to Manchester and Leeds, with Sir David saying this would be completed in 2033 . The project is strongly supported by the Government but is bitterly opposed by some councils and residents along the phase one route. Mr Cameron said: 'Improving connectivity and reducing journey times between our great northern cities is a crucial part of our long-term economic plan for the north to boost businesses and create more jobs and security for hard-working people. That's why we are backing HS3. 'I welcome Sir David Higgins' report, which will help our work to create a northern powerhouse and ensure that HS2 delivers the maximum economic benefits.' Mr Osborne said: 'The vision I set out earlier this year of the northern powerhouse we could build is rapidly taking shape. 'I asked Sir David to look at how we deliver the better transport links across the North that would make a reality of that powerhouse. 'I'm delighted with the rapid response and the report. Today we take another big step forward in delivering both the HS2 links from north to south and the HS3 link across the Pennines.' Sir David's report said there was a need to take forward both legs of the proposed HS2 Y-network as the alternatives would not bring the same capacity, connectivity and economic benefits; . For HS3, the journey from Leeds to Manchester could be cut from today's average of more than 55 minutes to somewhere between 26 and 35 minutes and the number of trains could be doubled. Sir David said: 'Improving connectivity is vital if Britain is to compete in the knowledge economy in which this country has a competitive advantage, but in which ease of travel is an essential element. 'On the back of new transport infrastructure, science investment and civic leadership, we are well on our way to turning the northern powerhouse into reality.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander also welcomed the report, as did House of Commons Transport Committee chairman Louise Ellman. She said: 'HS2 is important strategic infrastructure but must be linked with improvements in the classic rail network to bring maximum benefit.' The Rail Delivery Group, representing Network Rail and rail operators, said the report 'underlines how HS2 will become the backbone of Britain's growing railway'. Stop HS2 campaign manager Joe Rukin said HS3 would be even more expensive per mile than HS2. He added that Sir David's report 'showed that the original plans for HS2 weren't thought through properly'. Mr Rukin went on: 'Changing the mess that is phase two doesn't change the fact that phase one is still a complete mess, as is the entire concept of HS2.' Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: 'Hard-pressed travellers in the North will judge David Cameron on his actions, not words.' Leaders of councils in northern England welcomed the report, with Keith Wakefield, leader of Leeds City Council, describing HS2 as 'the key to transforming the future economy of Leeds and the north'. The RMT transport union said it was 'cynical in the extreme that the cheerleaders behind today's announcement are threatening to devastate (northern railway) jobs and services'.","David Higgins said people had to 'allow for a full day' to get to Manchester .

"In the early 1930s, scientists were fairly confident they understood subatomic physics. That was until dozens of new elementary particles were discovered in the 1950s, forcing scientists to rewrite their models. Now a new particle, first detected in 2007 but not confirmed until now, could send them back to the drawing board as they try to figure out what’s going on at a subatomic level. Confirmation of a new 'exotic hadron' by the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb, pictured) experiment at CERN in Switzerland could require scientists to rewrite their current models of subatomic physics . This particular discovery delves into a particularly complex branch of physics. It was made by physicists at the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) Collaboration at Cern in Geneva, Switzerland. LHCb is a multinational experiment designed to identify new forces and particles in the universe. The finding confirms the discovery of a so-called ‘exotic hadron.’ Atoms are usually made of protons, neutrons and electrons . These are made of even smaller elementary particles. Elementary particles, also known as fundamental particles, are the smallest particles we know to exist. They are subdivided into two groups, the first being fermions, which are said to be the particles that make up matter. The second are bosons, the force particles that hold the others together. Within the group of fermions are subatomic particles known as quarks. When quarks combine in threes, they form compound particles known as baryons. Protons are probably the best-known baryons. Sometimes, . quarks interact with corresponding anti-particles (such as . anti-quarks), which have the same mass but opposite charges. When this happens, they form mesons. Mesons . often turn up in the decay of heavy man-made particles, such as those . in particle accelerators, nuclear reactors and cosmic rays. Mesons, baryons, and other kinds of particles that take part in interactions like these are called hadrons. These are types of matter that cannot be classified within the traditional quark model that is currently used. Previously it was thought that quarks - subatomic elementary particles - could not occur in groups of more than three . This classification remained virtually unchallenged until 2007, when an international team of 400 physicists and engineers, known as the Belle Collaboration, discovered an exotic particle called Z(4430), which appeared to have two quarks and two anti-quarks. The discovery of a particle made essentially of four quarks does not fit with our current model of physics. Until now the discovery of Z(4430) in 2007 was highly controversial, with physicists divided on whether it could exist or not. The recent confirmation of the particle using the LHCb proves beyond any reasonable doubt that it exists. ‘We've confirmed the unambiguous observation of a very exotic state—something that looks like a particle composed of two quarks and two anti-quarks,’ says Tomasz Skwarnicki, a specialist in experimental high-energy physics and one of the lead authors on the new paper detailing the discovery. ‘The discovery certainly doesn't fit the traditional quark model. ‘It may give us a new way of looking at strong-interaction physics.’ The discovery of a four-quark hadron was first hinted at in 2007 but it was not until recently that an international team from CERN was able to confirm the discovery beyond reasonable doubt . The Large Hadron Collider accelerator at CERN has seven particle physics detect experiments, including LHCb (pictured), that are studying physics at a subatomic level . Subatomic particles can be largely classified in two groups: Fermions, which include quarks and leptons, are those that make up matter, while bosons are said to be the 'force' particles . Quarks are elementary particles, the smallest particles we know to exist. When they combine they form compound particles known as hadrons. Quarks are said to have six ‘flavours’: Up, Down, Charm, Strange, Top and Bottom. Combinations of quarks within these flavours gives rise to the ‘larger’ particles. Groups of three quarks are known as baryons. An example of a baryon is a proton, which is made of two 'Up' quarks and a 'Down' quark. One of the most significant consequences of this discovery is that it may question our understanding of neutron stars. Previously it was thought that neutron stars, as their name implies, are made solely of neutrons. The discovery of a four-quark hadron, known as a tetraquark, challenges that theory. Neutron stars, the remnants of supernovas, are the densest stellar objects known to exist with masses several times greater than the sun squashed into a city-sized area. Under these extreme conditions, it could be possible for neutrons to create tetraquarks. This would require a new classification of star known as a quark star. In turn, this would require our current theories for the interiors of neutron stars to be re-examined. And it may just be one consequence of this discovery. Ultimately, our models and assumptions of subatomic physics may need to be re-evaluated.","Scientists at CERN have confirmed the existence of a new 'exotic' particle .

"White voters of all ages were less likely to back Democrats this year than in elections past, helping Republicans nationwide but most acutely in the South - and overpowering Democratic efforts to turn out their core supporters among blacks and Hispanics. In a nation growing ever more diverse, political forecasters repeatedly warn Republicans they must improve their appeal among minorities in order to remain competitive in the long term. But for the Democrats, dominating the vote among minorities isn't enough to win elections today - and it won't be in the future if the GOP is able to run up similar margins among whites, who still make up a majority of voters in every state. Wrong strategy? It was a mistake for Democrats to distance themselves from the president, said Erik Smith, a former Obama campaign adviser and Democratic strategist . 'The rule of thumb was Democrats could win with 90 per cent of the African-American vote and 40 per cent of the white vote,' said Merle Black, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta. 'But now very few Democrats could think about getting 40 per cent of the white vote. They're trying to get 30 per cent. 'In the Deep South states, from South Carolina to Louisiana, it's very hard for the Democratic candidate to get 25 per cent of the white vote.' Republicans running for seats in the House won 60 per cent of the white vote, while Democrats won the backing of 89 per cent of African-Americans and 62 per cent of Hispanics. Those margins are nearly identical to the 2010 midterm elections. But Democrats won more of the white and Hispanic vote in 2006, the last midterm elections in which the party won control of the House. White voters last tilted in Democrats' favor in a midterm in 1990, and were a swing group in the 1980s. The data on voters come from exit polls of voters nationally and in 27 states that were conducted for The Associated Press and the television networks by Edison Research. Polling power: Voters wait in line to cast their ballots at  the University of Texas at Austin campus . Most interviews were conducted among randomly selected voters at precincts nationwide and in each state. Outside the South, whites broke for Republicans by an average of eight percentage points on Tuesday. But in ten Southern states with an election for Senate on the ballot, Republicans won the white vote by an average of 42 points. Democrats garnered so little support among whites in Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas that a majority of those voting for the Democratic candidate were non-white. In North Carolina, though incumbent Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan was widely credited with running a solid campaign, she carried just 33 per cent of the white vote - down from 39 per cent in 2008 - and lost. White voters under age 30 backed Hagan by close to a 2-1 margin six years ago as they helped sweep President Barack Obama into office. This time, in a midterm election, the younger white voters who cast ballots in North Carolina broke just as decisively for Hagan's Republican opponent, state House Speaker Thom Tillis. Steve Rosenthal, president of the Organizing Group, a Democratic-leaning consulting firm, said he's been jokingly calling this election the Seinfeld election for Democrats: They had no national message that resonated with their voters. 'It was an election about nothing. Republicans made it an election about President Obama. That was their goal,' he said. 'Their mission was to turn out people who were angry, people who were displeased with the job the president has done.' It was a mistake for Democrats to distance themselves from the president, said Erik Smith, a former Obama campaign adviser and Democratic strategist. Democratic voters are not motivated to help candidates who were happy to be with Obama two years ago, but tried to avoid his presence this year, he said. 'I'm sure (it) led a lot of these voters to say, ""How is this candidate going to treat me in two years?""' he said. The only states in which Democratic Senate candidates improved their overall support among whites were Minnesota, Oregon and Mississippi, a Southern state where Travis Childers managed to grow the Democratic share of the white vote from eight percent in 2008 to 16 per cent. Democratic voters were especially less engaged in states where there were not supposed to be competitive elections, said Michael McDonald, an associate professor of political science at the University of Florida who tracks voter turnout. Democratic voters are traditionally more likely to stay home if the midterm races are uninspiring, while Republican voters - who tend to be older, wealthier and more educated and also are more likely to be white - generally come to the polls anyway, he said. 'The poster child for this would be Virginia. It's an uncompetitive race, according to all the polls. In that environment, who sits out the election? It's predominantly Democrats,' McDonald said. Two days after the election, while the heavily favored incumbent, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, had a lead of a few thousand votes out of more than two million cast, the race remained too close to call.","Merle Black, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta, said the party struggled to get 25 per cent of the white vote in the deep South .

"Discovery: Police have found a body on a beach close to where deputy headteacher Mark Bushnell (pictured) was last seen . Police searching for the deputy headteacher of a £25,000-a-year boarding school have found a body on a beach. Mark Bushnell, a 50-year-old married father of three, parked his car at a seaside picnic spot two weeks ago, having left the family home in Durham, and has not been seen since. The body was spotted close to where the deputy head of 600-year-old Durham School was last seen. He had worked at the school for 20 years. The police said formal identification had not taken place but the family of Mr Bushnell had been informed. A Durham Constabulary spokesman said: 'Police searching for missing Durham teacher Mark Bushnell have been alerted to a report of a body on the beach close to where Mr Bushnell was last seen. 'The report came from a member of the public and police are currently at the scene close to Blackhall Rocks in Peterlee. 'A formal identification has yet to be carried out and Mr Bushnell's family have been informed.' Specialist search officers have previously been searching the area. Stretches of railway line were also included in the search efforts and assistance was given by HM Coastguard, the National Police Air Support helicopter and volunteers from Teesdale and Weardale Search & Mountain Rescue. Earlier this month when the search was on-going Martin George, the headmaster of Durham School, whose alumni include actor Alexander Armstrong and British Lions player Geoff Parling, spoke of the school's 'deep concern' over Mr Bushnell's disappearance. He said at the time: 'Mark is a highly respected colleague and friend at Durham School, as deputy head he constantly works for the benefit of pupils. 'The whole school community is deeply concerned for his welfare and would urge him to contact his family as a matter of urgency. 'We would also ask any members of the public who may have seen Mark to contact police immediately.'

"Liverpool legend John Aldridge has heaped praise on Reds keeper Simon Mignolet, insisting the Belgian has been the club's most consistent performer in 2015. Mignolet came under fierce criticism earlier in the season following a number of high-profile mistakes, with him subsequently getting dropped for Brad Jones. However, the 26-year-old has impressed on his return to the starting 11 following an injury to the Australian - keeping five clean sheets in his last nine games in all competitions. Liverpool legend John Aldridge believes Simon Mignolet is now . Aldridge told the Liverpool Echo: 'He (Simon) had some dark days earlier in the season, but Mignolet has been a shining light in the last month. 'In fact, I think he's been Liverpool's best, most consistent player since the turn of the year. 'He was excellent against Palace, and deserves huge credit for turning around his season so spectacularly. Mignolet has kept five clean sheets out of his last nine games for Liverpool . The 26-year-old has regained Liverpool No1 spot under Brendan Rodgers following an injury to Brad Jones . 'I've always been a fan of his, even when he was struggling.

"Pope Francis lived up to his role as the shepherd of God's flock when he was given a lamb to carry on his shoulders. The pontiff was visiting the parish of St Alphonso Maria de ‘Liguori, in the district of Justine, on the outskirts of Rome when an onlooker placed the animal over his neck. He was at the site to spend the afternoon of the Epiphany festival there where parishioners had set up a special nativity scene. Holy: Pope Francis, the shepherd of God's flock, had a real lamb draped over his neck when he visited a nativity scene . Cheerful: The head of the Catholic church grinned as a woman dressed in her nativity costume presented him with the tiny creature during the visit to Justine on the outskirts of Rome . Local people had recreated Bethlehem at the time of Jesus's birth, with shops, stalls, inns and other scenes of everyday life. Pope Francis ended his visit with a visit to the stable where he blessed a two month old child in a manger. Epiphany . is a joyous day for Catholics in which they recall the journey of the . three kings, or Magi, to pay homage to Baby Jesus. The Vatican's Secretary of State sent a letter to its embassies asking them to inform bishops' conferences of the change. From now on, the Vatican reported Tuesday, only diocesan priests who are 'chaplains of the Holy Father,'  can use the honorific, and then only after they turn 65. Bishops, vicars and archbishops still get to be called 'monsignor' and Holy See officials will have the title if their office warrants it. The Vatican noted that Pope Paul VI reduced the number of ecclesiastic honorifics in 1968 and that Francis' decision 'should be taken in this vein, as a further simplification.'

"Brussels has sparked outrage in Denmark by proposing to outlaw their traditional pastries. Christmas festivities have been dampened in Copenhagen by the prospect that this could be the last year its citizens will be able to eat their kanelsnegler or cinnamon rolls. The end to the beloved pastries comes from EU limits on the amount of coumarin, a naturally occurring toxic chemical found in the most commonly used type of cinnamon, cassia. The European Union has angered Denmark by proposing to outlaw the country's traditional pastries . Kanelsnegler - very popular in Nordic countries - contain high amounts of cinnamon. But the ban is not expected to affect British lovers of Danish pastries, because the types we get here do not contain such high levels of cinnamon. Hardy Christensen, the head of the Danish Baker's Association, said: 'It's the end of the cinnamon roll as we know it. 'Cinnamon rolls are of course a traditional Danish baked product. We've been making bread and cakes with cinnamon for 200 years.' The proposed ban follows plans by Denmark's food safety agency to implement the EU regulations on the amount of 'everyday fine baked goods' - limiting coumarin to 15mg a kilo. The ban is not expected to affect British lovers of Danish pastries, as the types we get here do not contain such high levels of cinnamon . Paul Nuttall, deputy leader of UKIP, said: 'An average person would have to eat so many Danish pastries in order to affected' But in Sweden, the government has . classed their cinnamon pastries as a 'traditional and seasonal dish' - . allowing them to use cinnamon at over three times higher, 50mg per kilo. There is anger in Denmark that its government has not stuck up for its cinnamon pastries as much as the Swedish government. They have simply given kanelsnegler a temporary reprieve until February. Paul Nuttall, deputy leader of UKIP, said: 'An average person would have to eat so many Danish pastries in order to affected, they would certainly die of obesity before being hurt by a low level of cinnamon. 'We don't need the nanny state or the EU to tell us what to do and certainly not how many Danish pastries we should eat for Christmas.' British research has concluded that 'the extent to which coumarin is bad for the health' is debatable. And the CBI has advised cinnamon importers into Britain that: 'Research has shown that the average dietary intake of the UK population does not exceed safe limits.' A study for the UK Food Standards Agency in 2010 found that the average dietary exposure to coumarin in the UK was 55 times less than the EU's definition of the 'tolerable daily limit' of 0.1mg per kilo of body weight.","End to Denmark's beloved pastries comes from EU limits on coumarin .

"This is the grandfather who confronted two vandals causing havoc in his local park and was so savagely beaten he feared he would be murdered. Account manager Mark Earnshaw was almost left in a coma after he went outside his Blackpool home to remonstrate with youths who were overturning bins. The 51-year-old was then punched and kicked, which left him nursing two black eyes, broken nose, a badly bruised jaw and a gaping wound to the side of his face after his teeth tore through his cheek during the beating. Terrible: Mark Earnshaw pictured a few minutes after being attacked by youths who he confronted in his local park . Hurt: The grandfather has been left with a broken nose, two black eyes, impaired vision and a hole in his face . Today as police hunted the two criminals, Mr Earnshaw, who had just celebrated . becoming a grandfather to twins, said next time he would have ignore the problem. His shocking case is similar to that of Gary Newlove, who was murdered after being kicked to death by a gang of youths when he confronted them as they damaged his wife's car outside their Warrington home. The 47-year-old father of three suffered a massive brain haemorrhage and died in hospital two days after the attack in August 2007. Mr Earnshaw said: 'I won't bother tackling them next time - I don't want to be another Garry Newlove. 'Obviously I don't like the senseless damage of things and it annoys me people get a kick out of smashing up the park. 'Then you then hear about what happens to other people like Garry . Newlove who lost his life doing something like I did - and I think that . could have been me. 'If I'd fallen to the ground unconscious and been beaten some more, my wife may have been going to a funeral this week. 'I went out without really thinking about the consequences. Unfortunately now I would let them get on with it next time. It's not . worth risking my own life tackling these people in future.' Scene: Mr Earnshaw was attacked in Anchorsholme Park, Blackpool, but the culprits have not been caught . Before: Mark and his wife Angela on holiday, but he now admits that if he saw trouble again then he would have to ignore it . The incident occurred at 2am on March 9 after Mr Earnshaw said he had been dropped off at home by taxi after a birthday party at a social club. Bins had been overturned at the entrance to Anchorsholme Park opposite and feared vandals were about to damage flower beds and the bowling green, as well as the children's play area. Murder: Garry Newlove was kicked to death in 2007 after he confronted youths outside his home . But when the yobs became very abusive and angry, he turned to walk away, but as he did he felt a great heavy blow from behind. He said: 'They came out of nowhere saying they were doing it because they had nothing else to do, then one of them squared up to me saying, ""go on touch me"". 'The best thing I thought to do was just a walk off, but I must have taken about three steps when I felt a hard thump from behind. 'He hit me again and my glasses went onto the floor. I could hardly see where they had landed so bent down to pick them up. 'They started punching and kicking me - I just thought to myself I had to stay on my feet, it was my only chance otherwise they would knock me into a coma. 'I heard my nose crack twice, the pain was unbelievable. Blood was streaming down my face, it was just pouring out. My right eye was bleeding too and I could feel it closing up. 'I was bent over trying to fend them off, shouting, 'I've had enough, leave me alone', but it just carried on.' Mr Earnshaw eventually escaped and ran back into the safety of his home, but he was followed and the same two yobs began smashing up his neighbour's car. Mark was taken to Blackpool Victoria Hospital and then transferred for special surgery at Preston Royal Hospital to stich up the hole in his cheek. 'You could have stuck your little finger through my cheek, I couldn't believe it when I looked in the mirror, I was a mess. 'It frustrates me that these thugs have ruined what was supposed to be a happy time in our lives - the birth of our two grandsons who were born earlier that evening. I haven't even met them yet - I don't want to be bruised and battered in their first photograph with me', he said. Recovering: Mark is still battered and bruised, while struggling to see out of one damaged eye . Local Tory councillor Tony Williams, ward councillor for Anchorsholme, said: 'I'm shocked a good neighbour's act has turned into violence by mindless idiots. 'As much as I understand Mr Earnshaw's great deed it shows how dangerous it can be when you try to stop mindless thugs. Lancashire police are now hunting two people in connection with the attack. Police said one was aged 17 to 21, of skinny build, between six feet and 6ft 3in tall, with short dark hair and wearing grey tracksuit bottoms. The second youth is believed to be the same age and build, between 5ft 9in and 5ft 11in, has a reddish face and was wearing white Adidas trainers. Det Sgt Jane Atkinson said: 'This was a nasty, unprovoked assault and we're doing all we can to find the two people responsible.'","Mark Earnshaw asked youths to stop overturning bins in Blackpool .

"A 'terrifying' mid-air incident which resulted in Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall's helicopter being forced to make a 'hairy' emergency landing was yesterday blamed on a tiny broken metal ball. The royal couple were en route to the Hay-on-Wye Literary Festival in Wales in May last year when their Sikorsky S-76C suddenly began to veer - or yaw - to one side. With neither pilot able to balance the aircraft properly, its 53-year-old captain was forced to declare what is known as a 'Pan' emergency- one below a Mayday- and attempt to land at a nearby aerodrome. Safe: Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and the Prince of Wales after another flight . A report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) into the episode, which was made public for the first time yesterday, said it was caused when a minute metal ball - just 2mm in diameter - housed in the system which controlled the helicopter's dynamics shattered. This caused an internal leakage of hydraulic pressure which in turn led to the helicopter's yaw control system being dramatically restricted. The report said the ball was 'mostly likely' to have fractured after the second in line to the throne and his wife took off from London. A royal aide described the incident as being 'pretty hairy' and sources close to Camilla, who is a nervous flyer at the best of times, have since told the Mail that she was 'terrified'. 'It was genuinely terrifying' said one. 'The helicopter veered and there was apparently nothing they [the pilots] could do about it. It was a heart in mouth moment. The Duchess was very, very shaken.' Remarkably, however, Charles and Camilla insisted on continuing their journey to Hay-on-Wye by car, arriving three hours late and, apparently, with smiles on their faces. Prince Charles, Prince of Wales (right) meets well-wishers on May at the Hay-on-Wye, Wales. On his way there he was involved in a 'terrifying' mid-air incident . Neither alluded to their in-flight drama during the engagement and were reported look relaxed. Aides said they were determined not to let down members of the public waiting for them. 'They were unflappable despite what they went through. If anyone else had gone through what they did they would have cancelled their day,' said one well-wisher. The 2009 manufactured helicopter, which contained the royal pair and four other passengers, including their bodyguards, as well as the two-man crew, left London at 9.30am on May 23 last year. According to the AAIB report, it began to yaw to the right as it approached Denham aerodrome in Buckinghamshire. The pilot immediately realised the helicopter to be 'out of balance' and conducted several checks on the system. But when they realised there was nothing they could do to control it he decided to declare a Pan emergency - a less serious declaration than a Mayday - and briefed his royal passengers. The two pilots attempted a 'running landing', which is often conducted if an aircraft has developed problems. They managed to carry it out successfully and ground-taxied with the helicopter still yawing to the right. The AAIB explained: 'A detailed metallurgical analysis of the ball by the (USA) National Transportation Safety Board is continuing. However, the most likely cause of the ball fracture was an anomaly in its heat treatment process during manufacture.' The report said the part in which the ball had split - which was only fitted to the helicopter in February last year, three months before the incident - had been replaced after the Denham incident and the helicopter had subsequently flown 'without further incident'. The AAIB said Sikorsky was in the process of issuing a safety advisory and a flight manual revision 'to inform operators of the symptoms of a PDTA fault and actions to be taken by the crew'. Clarence House declined to comment further last night.","Royal couple were en route to the Hay-on-Wye Literary Festival in Wales .

"Plunging: Alina Kabayeva, pictured in 2004, who is widely believed to be Vladimir Putin's mistress. She revealed she has met a man whom she 'loves' The glamorous young Olympic gymnast at the centre of speculation over Vladimir Putin’s marriage breakdown has spoken of her longing to marry and have children. Alina Kabayeva, 30, who was first named as the Russian president’s mistress five years ago, revealed she has indeed met a man ‘whom I love very much’. ‘Sometimes you feel yourself so happy that you even feel scared that you are so happy,’ she said. Miss Kabayeva, a gold medal-winning . rhythmic gymnast who is now an MP in Mr Putin’s United Russia party, had . denied a relationship. Yet . the speculation in Moscow has continued unabated, with claims Mr Putin, . 60, and Miss Kabayeva already have a secret family of one, two or even . three children. The . rumours coincided with the almost total eclipse of Mr Putin’s wife, . Lyudmila, 55. Some reports have even suggested she now lives as a . recluse in a monastery. The rumour mill intensified last week as Mr Putin and his wife announced they are to divorce. Despite . denials from Mr Putin’s spokesman, many Russians believe it is only a . matter of time before Miss Kabayeva is gradually unveiled at his side. Marriage to Mr Putin  would enable her formally to take her place as . Russia’s youngest first lady since Tsarina Alexandra, the ill-fated wife . of the Kremlin’s last royal monarch, Nicholas II. In revealing recent television . interviews, she never once named Mr Putin. Instead of denying a . relationship, her mannerisms – coquettish laughter and hand nervously . brushing through her hair – if anything suggested the opposite. She . also made clear that marriage is definitely on her mind, that she has . found her Mr Right and that she does not yet have  children. ‘Of course I . want to get married, have my family .  .  . and children,’ she told a . group of young interviewers. Asked . who she wanted to marry, she giggled and replied: ‘You know I’ve never . thought about it .  .  . but life is such a thing that .  .  . you live . and everything is fine with you and then you see a person you like. Everything about him you like. This will be the kind of person I will . marry.’ Had she met this . person? ‘Erm’ .  .  . (laughing) .  .  . yes I have .  .  . (laughing . more and now beaming with happiness).’ The young audience broke into . applause, with few viewers not aware of the name no one appeared brave . enough to mention. In fact, the interviewer on this occasion did bravely press her for the identity of her man. Cue more coquettish laughter and nervous fidgets with her hair before she replied: ‘You’ve managed to ask THAT question. Well done.’ She laughed again rather than answer it directly but promised he is ‘a very good, excellent man who I love very much’. Mr Putin with Miss Kabayeva in 2001: The gold medal-winning rhythmic gymnast, who is now an MP in Mr Putin¿s United Russia party, has denied a relationship. Yet the speculation in Moscow has continued unabated . Body language: The Russian president pictured last year with his wife Lyudmila, 55, who has almost totally disappeared from public life. Some rumours suggest she has gone to live as a recluse in a monastery . A stronger indication of the true situation may have been a TV hagiography devoted to Miss Kabayeva marking her 30th birthday last month on Russia’s main channel – in which she was surprisingly candid on her personal dreams. Asked about her desire for a family, she flashed her smile to the camera, saying emphatically: ‘Of course, I am dreaming about having children, it’s true. ‘Although the whole country – and perhaps now other countries too –  write I’ve already got two or three children. Sadly, I don’t have children yet. But, of course, I want to be a mother. Still, I’m not yet.’ In May 2009 a newspaper had claimed she had given birth to a  boy during that month, not naming the father. Supple: Miss Kabayeva pictured competing for Russia at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. She took gold four years later in Athens . Her gymnastics coach Irina Viner, the wife of billionaire Arsenal Football Club shareholder Alisher Usmanov, said at the time: ‘When Alina finds the right time, she will say it herself. And I’m just happy for her.’ Whispers of one or two other children have surfaced but no scrap of hard evidence has emerged from behind the well-guarded walls of Mr Putin’s palatial homes. Miss Kabayeva is an accomplished athlete, one of the most decorated gymnasts in the world, taking gold at the 2004 Athens Olympics. As an MP now, she is dogged in pursuing Mr Putin’s agenda but also has a law to her name designed to protect the privacy of children. Some observers have noticed a strange . irony in the Kabayeva  whispers and denials appearing in the media. In . spring 2008, a newspaper called Moskovsky Korrespondent first published . the story that Mr Putin had divorced Lyudmila and was to marry Miss . Kabayeva that June. It was . the first time the subject had come to public attention. The owner of . the paper, Alexander Lebedev, once a KGB colleague of Putin’s who later . bought the London Evening Standard and the Independent titles, insisted . he knew nothing of the report ahead of publication as he had been away . on a fishing trip and incommunicado. The editor resigned, though others at the paper insisted: ‘We had information, and we reported it.’ Within . days, Mr Lebedev had closed down the paper. He is now on trial in . Moscow – and facing up to five years in jail after a fracas in a TV . studio when he punched fellow businessman Sergei Polonsky. Mr Lebedev said he felt ‘half rehabilitated’ over the divorce announcement. But if he is jailed, he may rue that fishing trip which meant his newspaper was the first to tell the world about Miss Kabayeva’s supposed relationship with Mr Putin.","Alina Kabayeva, 30, told TV show she 'has met the person she will marry'

"Country Life featured Ella Clark on its frontispiece after a letter from her fiance Ian Fortune . Country Life's legendary 'Girls in Pearls' are often the daughters of the aristocracy. So this month's frontispiece, personal trainer Ella Clark – and especially the manner in which she was chosen for the slot – makes a refreshing change for the 117-year-old magazine. The former RAF officer, 29, was picked when her fiancé – a squadron leader – contacted the magazine's editor after being wounded by a bullet during a tour of Afghanistan. In a heartfelt letter, Ian Fortune, 32, explained what it would mean to have his fiancée in the quintessentially English magazine's pages and an unlikely plot was hatched by its editor. Secret arrangements were made for a three-day photoshoot in rural North Yorkshire and Miss Clark was whisked away and given a makeover. She told the Telegraph: 'It was a bit of a shock when I ﬁrst found out what he had done but I am always up for trying these things. 'It was amazing, all a bit overwhelming but really good fun. They were really nice people and the weather from the ﬁrst day was really nice so it was great to be involved – and Ian loves it, which is the most important thing.' Sqn Ldr Fortune said: 'The mere sight of Ella takes me back to those timeless frontispiece girls in pearls. Everything Ella and I stand for, our love for the country, the countryside, to keep this country protected and great for future generations seem to be embodied in Country Life.' Mr Fortune added that he had ordered the magazine for his unit – 27 Squadron RAF – during its tour of duty in the wartorn country because it 'gave us all a tangible link with home – no mean feat given we were in a war zone 4,000 miles away'. Already a devoted reader, he said he found it especially comforting during the months he spent recovering from a Taliban bullet that hit him above the eye. The Chinook pilot was injured while ﬂying wounded soldiers back to Camp Bastion in 2010 and won the Distinguished Flying Cross for his bravery as a result. Flight Lieutenant Ian Fortune was presented with The Distinguished Flying Cross by the Prince of Wales after he was injured while flying wounded soldiers back to Camp Bastion, Afghanistan in 2010 . Mark Hedges, the magazine's editor, said Mr Fortune's letter was so moving that he immediately made arrangements to feature Miss Clark. He said: 'When I got that letter from Ian it just melted my heart. Here was a guy who had been injured in Afghanistan and the first thing his team bought him in hospital were his pyjamas and a copy of Country Life. 'We send a lot of issues to Afghanistan and at one point they were using it as a way to teach the interpreters English. 'It is heartening to know that image of the green and pleasant land which is captured by the magazine still strikes a chord with our servicemen and women abroad.' Famously known as the 'Girls in Pearls' page because many of its early debutante models wore pearls, it aims to show upper class British rural life in its most ideal light. The pair, who live near Farnham, Surrey, will marry later this month in Yorkshire.

"Manchester City defender Matija Nastasic is poised to wrap up his move to Schalke over the coming days. Sportsmail revealed Schalke's interest last month and that of AC Milan. The Italians have failed to follow up with any substantial bid as they push their finances towards other priorities and Schalke are hopeful of concluding an initial loan with a view to a permanent £10million signing. Nastasic, 21, has 16 caps for Serbia and was considered to have a promising future when he arrived from Fiorentina for £12m. However, he has failed to establish himself and the arrival of Eliaquim Mangala has limited his prospects further. Manchester City outcast Matija Nastasic is poised to join German side Schalke over the coming days . Arsenal and Inter Milan showed interest initially but Schalke coach Roberto Di Matteo has pressed for Nastasic and the German side will conclude a deal shortly. City are continuing to look for a left-sided defender but that is more likely to be for the summer. They remain confident of James Milner signing a new contract with them and are waiting for Aston Villa to improve their offer for Scott Sinclair. Manchester City are waiting for Aston Villa to improve their offer for winger Scott Sinclair . Chelsea starlet Lewis Baker has joined Sheffield Wednesday on loan after they won a three-way tussle for his signature with Bolton Wanderers and Nottingham Forest. The England Under 20 international is one of Chelsea's brightest prospects and the three Championship sides were eager to add him to their squads to improve their chances of promotion. Jose Mourinho said that he would have failed as a coach if Baker, 19, did not become an England international under his management. The stylish midfielder has been a key member of Chelsea's U21 side, where he acts as a midfield general cajoling and pushing his side forward with simple, effective passing and good movement. He made his senior debut a year ago against Derby County in the FA Cup as a late substitute. Sheffield Wednesday beat Nottingham Forest and Bolton Wanderers to loan signing of Chelsea's Lewis Baker . Chelsea's Todd Kane  signed for Forest on Thursday. Meanwhile, Barnsley are discussing a deal for former Chelsea forward Milan Lalkovic. The 22-year-old Slovakia U21 international was born in Kosice but was signed by Chelsea at 16. He never made an appearance but had various loan spells before moving to Czech side Mlada Boleslav and Danny Wilson is keen to bring him back to England. Inter Milan are continuing to press for Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva. Inter Milan, managed by former Man City boss Roberto Mancini, are pressing for Liverpool's Lucas Leiva . The Brazilian is on around £85,000 a week and has a lengthy contract. Inter, who are ready to offload troublesome striker Dani Osvaldo, are close to signing Xherdan Shaqiri from Bayern Munich but want a reliable midfielder like Lucas to protect their defence. Liverpool have been linked with a move for Roma's Miralem Pjanic but initial signs are the midfielder is not keen on a move to Anfield. Roma's Miralem Pjanic has been linked with Liverpool but doesn't fancy a move to the Anfield club . Arsenal have gone cool on a deal for St Etienne's Loic Perrin after his club asked for £8m for the 29-year-old defender. Villarreal's versatile defender Gabriel Paulista has since been put forward to Arsene Wenger and is a player all the scouting staff like but a work permit would seem improbable. The 24-year-old Brazilian has not been capped by his country and reportedly has no dual passport. He is expected to join Brazil's future squads but that will struggle to get him past an appeal. His team-mate Bruno Soriano has also been discussed. Arsenal have been told any deal for West Ham United's Winston Reid would cost them £7m in a transfer fee and they are weighing up their options. Arsenal are weighing up defensive options having been told West Ham United's Winston Reid will cost £7m . Eccentric Sampdoria owner Massimo Ferrero wants Samuel Eto'o from Everton. Ferrero, a film producer, has cut a controversial and sometimes comical figure in the Italian media with outspoken comments and marketing ideas. He has attempted to engineer a return to Italy for Mario Balotelli with his out-of-contract goalkeeper Sergio Romero going the other way and is now looking at Everton striker Eto'o. After the recent match against Lazio, representatives from the club met with the player's agent, Claudio Vigorelli. The Everton striker, who also has tentative interest from Valencia, is understood to be willing to listen to their offer as he considers whether to remain at Goodison Park for another season. The big obstacle for Sampdoria is his wages with 33-year-old Eto'o reputed to be earning £2.35m a season. Sampdoria's eccentric owner Massimo Ferrero (right) is keen to sign Everton forward Samuel Eto'o . Blackburn Rovers are looking for around £6m for striker Rudy Gestede as West Browmich Albion show interest. The 6ft 4ins striker has scored 12 goals in 23 games this season which prompted Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp and Kevin Bond to check on him when Blackburn played at Brentford last month. He scored again but QPR decided, with their transfer budget, that Gestede was not for them. Tony Pulis, however, believes he may be a player worth taking a chance on. Gestede's team-mate Jordan Rhodes continues to draw scouts to Ewood Park also but the likes of Southampton have yet to follow up with a bid. Albion, meanwhile, have also checked on Sheffield Wednesday's French defender Claude Dielna, 27, who can play centre back and le t-back. He scored his only goal in the 2-1 win over Blackburn last month. West Bromwich Albion have shown an interest in Blackburn Rovers striker Rudy Gestede . Tottenham Hotspur are willing to make an offer for Burnley striker Danny Ings in this window but Sean Dyche is hopeful the England U21 international will still see out his contract. Leicester City have already bid £8m for the 22-year-old but the prospect of moving to Tottenham now is more tantalising. Burnley would still make £3m in compensation should Ings leave at the end of his deal in the summer but the player is having to consider whether Tottenham will move on to other targets by that stage. Tottenham expect to lose Kyle Naughton to Swansea City and are waiting for West Brom and others to place serious bids for Aaron Lennon. Albion and Southampton also have an interest in Ings. Burnley will announce the permanent signing of Michael Keane from Manchester United over the next 24 hours. Tottenham's former striker Jermaine Defoe is training with the club's development squad for the next week 'to maintain fitness during MLS close season'. Tottenham are interested in Burnley's Danny Ings but Sean Dyche hopes the striker will see out his contract . Leicester and Wolverhampton Wanderers are keeping a check on Basford United winger Blair Anderson. The Midland FL Premier Division club are managed by former Stoke City striker Martin Carruthers and Anderson has ex-Aston Villa midfielder Lee Hendrie playing alongside him. Scouts from League One clubs have also been following his progress this season and believe Anderson can make the step up into league football. Rotherham have completed the signing of Leicester's Jack Barmby, 20, on loan for the rest of the season. Rotherham have completed the signing of Leicester City's Jack Barmby on loan for the rest of the season . Red Star Belgrade are close to signing former QPR winger Josh Parker. The 24-year-old has had a colourful career. He was born in Slough but has been capped by Antigua and Barbuda and has been playing for Domzale in Slovenia where his return of 14 goals in 42 games caught the attention of scouts and Red Star, now known as Crvena Zvezda, have offered him a contract. Millwall are in discussions to sign Wales and Charlton striker Simon Church on loan. Portsmouth and Mansfield Town are interested in taking Oxford United midfielder Alfie Potter on a permanent deal. The 25-year-old has made over 130 appearances for Oxford since joining from Peterborough. He has scored three goals this season. Newport striker Christian Jolley is attracting interest from Dover Athletic and Eastleigh.

"Whether it's camping in the UK, or on a luxury break in the Caribbean, Stacey Solomon is a keen traveller. The mother-of-two reality TV star, who rose to fame on the X Factor, says she's at home anywhere - naming the stunning Rhossili in Wales as her favourite beach in the world. However, as is fitting for a queen (of the jungle, Stacey won I'm A Celebrity...), the 24-year-old, from Dagenham, Essex, doesn't shy away from five-start treatment - citing the five-star Atlantis in Dubai as the best hotel on the planet. Family holiday: Stacey cuddling up to her sons Zachary and Leighton on a sun lounger during in Marbella . Perfect travel partner: Stacey says she'd love to go away with David Attenborough, pictured right . Here, the singer, who is due to release her debut album, talks to MailOnline . Travel about her holiday plans for this year, her most embarrassing holiday horror, and how to keep children happy when travelling. If the weather is going to be as warm in England as everyone keeps saying, I’d like to do a camping trip along the British coast. It would be great to pack up the car with all our essentials and drive somewhere to enjoy the seaside with the children (Zachary and Leighton). I loved a trip to Mersey camping with my brothers and sisters when I was younger. I was about 12 and I enjoyed cooking our own food, sleeping in a tent and toasting marshmallows on a camp fire. We spent the week having good old fashion fun and playing cards. Chill out time: Busy mum Stacey enjoys a cold drink at the bar in Marbella with son Leighton . Dream trip: For a two-week holiday, the Caribbean is Stacey's choice for a top sunshine holiday . When you have a two-week holiday, you can afford to go somewhere further without feeling like you lose too much time travelling. My top choice would either be somewhere in Mexico or the Caribbean. My . favourite beach is Rhossili beach in Wales. We went there a lot when I . was younger and it has the BEST sand dunes. We never got bored of . rolling down them, day after day. Seaside fun: Stacey in Marbella wearing a pink bikini while holding son Leighton . Top choice: Stacey's favourite beach of all is Rhossili Bay, on the Gower Peninsula in Wales . Diving equipment. I’ve been diving a couple of times in Egypt and the equipment costs a bomb. My favourite attraction in the UK has to be Legoland. At the moment my children aren't old enough for the big theme park rides so Legoland is perfect. We can spend hours looking at all the fab Lego structures.

I . took Zachary to Barcelona a couple of years ago and thought it was . fantastic. The harbour was beautiful and the city is full of history, we . had such fun exploring. The Spanish are so friendly and love children . so it was a great place to take him. There was a park on every road . which meant he was a happy boy. Having been caught out in rental cars without a booster seat, I now always travel with an inflatable BubbleBum booster seat, as they’re easy to pack and squeeze in your handbag. Favourite attraction: Stacey reveals she likes to take her children to Legoland . A favourite travel experience was meeting a group of inspiring women in Malawi . I visited Malawi where I met a group of women who were amazing. They had all recently lost children, none of them had a proper home and they were struggling to gather food and water. Despite their troubles they all remained positive and didn’t take anything for granted. They spent the whole day dancing and singing and smiling. They told me about all of the good things that were going on in their lives. They are the most interesting and inspiring people I have ever met on my travels. Keeping kids entertained on car journeys makes family travel much less stressful and much more enjoyable, so preparation is key. I take books and games to keep my children occupied and lots of snacks to distract them.","I'm A Celebrity... queen Legoland is her favourite UK attraction .

"Proud: James Yuen, with his father Samuel, has won one of only four scholarship places at Eton College . A 12-year-old maths prodigy who lives with his parents above their Chinese takeaway has won a £32,000-a-year scholarship to study at Eton. James Yuen is one of only four state school pupils, out of hundreds who applied, to win a place at the prestigious school. From September he will be swapping the flat above Hong Kong Takeaway in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, for an Eton dormitory. James secured his place after achieving an A grade in GCSE maths at the age of 10, followed by an A at A-Level last year at Westcliff High School for Boys. Famous Old Etonians include author George Orwell, actor and comedian Hugh Laurie, Princes William and Harry, and Prime Minister David Cameron. Proud father Samuel Yuen, 39, said his success is to hard work and focus: 'He applied to take the exams, we encouraged him but didn't push him. 'I told him to go and to try his best, and that if he didn't make it, it didn't matter, because he already goes to a very good local school. 'Anyone could have applied, and there were lots of boys there at the open day. He will now have to knuckle down for the next five years in order to maintain his focus and good work.' After attending an open day and sitting . gruelling entrance exams James was granted a scholarship to the famous . college in Windsor, Berkshire. There are only four of the New Foundation scholarships available to boys who have been educated in state schools. The intellectual standard expected by the college is described in its prospectus as 'very high' and 'fully on potential rather than knowledge'. Hardworking: James Yuen achieved an A at GCSE Maths when he was 10 and an A at A-Level last year . Prestigious: Some of Eton's former pupils include George Orwell and Prime Minister David Cameron . James attended an open day in early November, followed by round one of assessments. He was then shortlisted and invited to take part in the scholarship examinations, which take place over a three-day period and involved a two-night stay in a boarding house at the college. This was followed by a further interview. James currently attends Westcliff High School for Boys, an academy grammar school that boasts exceptionally high exam results both at GCSE and A Level. He will finish this academic year at Westcliff before starting at Eton College in September. Headteacher Michael Skelly said: 'James was very keen to pursue this, and he has been successful. Eton college is a very fine school, and I wish him all the best for the future.' James Courtenay, the Tory councillor responsible for children and learning, said: 'I would like to offer my congratulations to James for his achievement, as it is an achievement for any child to be able to further their education at such a fine school as Eton. 'I would also like to extend my thanks to the staff at Westcliff High School for Boys for supporting James in his decision, and I wish him every success in his education.'","James Yuen one of only four state school pupils to win place .

"A New York State police officer has been suspended after a video was posted online capturing him allegedly slapping a young man he had pulled over. The driver did not want to have his car searched by the officer who had spotted a rifle on the back seat and so a standoff ensued during which time the cop became extremely agitated. The video was captured by the drivers' friend who was sitting in the passenger seat of the car throughout the encounter. Caught on camera: A New York sheriff's deputy has been suspended after a video captured him cursing at a young man and apparently slapping him . Slap happy: The strike can be heard but isn't seen. The deputy then tells the friend he could 'rip your ... head off.' Sgt. Shawn R. Glans, 48, who has been a police officer for 27 years, was suspended without pay pending an internal investigation. His superior Sheriff Michael Zurlo on Saturday said he was 'very disturbed' by what he saw on the video. 'I really am,' the sheriff said. 'I don't condone activity as it's portrayed and we're going to look into it and we'll handle this quickly and swiftly.' Sgt. Glans confronted the pair on Friday in the sleepy town of Half Moon. The men were walking back to their car when the officer noticed a .22-caliber rifle in the rear. The sergeant said they were wearing dark clothes and acting suspiciously, although they broke no laws. As the young man questions the deputy's intention to search the car, the officer replies, 'We'll get a f****** search warrant.' In trouble: 48-year-old Sgt. Shawn Glans was suspended Saturday over the encounter Friday in the town of Halfmoon . Recorded: It shows Glans cursing at the young man and insisting that he has a right to search a vehicle. The deputy also apparently slaps the young man; the strike can be heard but isn't seen . 'I wasn't in my car when all this was happening,' the young man says. 'Like, why don't you want to search, like, my house or something?' The sergeant becomes frustrated as he asks to see the man's keys. 'Why?' the young man asks. 'You can't do that.' 'Because we're searching your f****** car, that's why,' Glans says. The deputy then apparently slaps the young man as he says: 'You want to (expletive) resist?' The sound of the slap can be heard but is not captured on the video because the camera was pointing away from the action. It's unclear from the video if another deputy is involved. Glans then tells the young man, who remains calm throughout the ordeal, that 'if you've got nothing to hide in there ... we'll be on our (expletive) merry way.' Smirk: The young man's friend filmed the encounter. Saratoga County Sheriff Michael Zurlo calls the video disturbing . The driver's friend who is filming the incident throughout tells the sergeant that what just happened was 'intense' and asks the officer if he's going hit him next. The sheriff's sergeant responds that he could 'rip your f****** head off and s*** down your neck' 'You like that, huh? I can get a lot more intense,' the sergeant tells the young man. 'You saw the video. It doesn't look good,' Glans told the Times Union. 'I'm all about doing the right thing. I had to go to that point because of the factors that came into play. There was a gun that was involved (that) I spotted in the vehicle.' He acknowledged that he did not know the incident was being videotaped. 'I was concerned. It was a public safety issue,' the sergeant said. 'If I had to do it all over again ... I'd probably do the same thing. If I knew the camera was there, no, because it does look bad.' The young man who filmed the incident said they parked their car at the business and walked to a nearby party. They had purchased a .22-caliber rifle earlier that day and had a receipt for the weapon. They were finally let go after showing the deputy the receipt. It's not the first time the Sergeant has had a brush with the law he is supposed to uphold. In 1999, the town of Wilton, Saratoga County paid $6 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the family of a 45-year-old man left paralyzed when a patrol car being driven by Glans smashed head-on into the other car. Douglas H. McEachron suffered critical brain injuries and a federal jury found Glans was negligent in the crash. The deputy was responding to a 911 call and driving close to three times the posted speed limit around a sharp curve on Smith Bridge Road in Wilton when he lost control of his vehicle. Glans crossed into the oncoming lane and smashed head-on into McEachron's car.","Sgt. Shawn R. Glans, 48, has been suspended without pay .

"Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester, has demanded instant access to medical records of victims of domestic abuse . The police should have instant access to the medical records of women thought to be victims of domestic violence, even against their wishes, a senior officer said yesterday. Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester, added that public services were required to safeguard the vulnerable, even if victims did not wish to complain. He also called for access to confidential information about other vulnerable groups, including the elderly, those with dementia, suspected drug or alcohol abusers, and troubled families. ‘We could do a better job if we have greater access to information which it is currently hard for us to get,’ he said. ‘It would give us a deeper understanding of those we are expected to help.’ The demand raises questions about patient confidentiality and also means that those who speak openly to social workers or teachers – for example mothers in troubled families – could find themselves facing police investigations against their will. In an interview with The Guardian, Sir Peter said state agencies and doctors should rethink the way they work and break confidentiality to prevent harm, for example in the case of women suspected to be victims of domestic violence. He added that officers would avoid heavy-handed action in such circumstances. ‘The alternative is the woman continues to suffer,’ Sir Peter said. ‘There should be the ability to share the information, against the woman’s wishes, to solve the problem, without a criminal justice system approach. ‘Society has matured – there is a far greater expectation on public services to safeguard vulnerable people. Twenty years ago, with domestic abuse, it was seen as one of those things. ‘Now there’s a greater expectation agencies will safeguard the victim, whether or not they wish to make a complaint and enter the criminal justice system.’ Sir Peter said that with an ‘industry of case conferences and referral forms’, getting information was a drain on time and resources amid budget cuts. Dr Tony Calland, of the British Medical Association, said: ‘The essential principle that runs throughout the recording of medical information is that of confidentiality and trust. ‘The checks and balances in the current legal position are satisfactory and whilst the current law may cause some difficulty for the police, the case has not been made to recommend a substantial change in the law.’ The demand raises questions about patient confidentiality and also means that those who speak openly to social workers or teachers could find themselves facing police investigations against their will (picture: model)","Sir Peter Fahy said public services were required to safeguard vulnerable .

"Actress Misty Upham has been missing for more than a week, and her frantic family believe police in suburban Seattle are not doing enough to locate her. Upham's father, Charles Upham, told KIRO-FM that his daughter was upset and erratic and had stopped taking medication for anxiety and bipolar disorder. The 32-year-old Native American actress was reported missing by her family October 6, a day after telling police she was suicidal. Her father told the station he doesn't believe his daughter would kill herself. Scroll down for video . Family speak out: Parents of actress Misty Upham, 32, who has been missing since October 6, say police in Auburn, Washington, are not taking her disappearance seriously . Ms Upham, a member of the Blackfoot tribe, is best known for her roles in August: Osage County, Frozen River and Django Unchained. She has been listed as missing in the Washington Crime Information Center database. The family said Upham had moved to the Seattle area to help care for her father, who's recovering from a stroke. She had been staying at a relative's apartment on the Muckleshoot reservation. Police Commander Steve Stocker told The Seattle Times Upham is not considered an endangered missing person because her disappearance has to be unexplained, involuntary or suspicious. But Misty's father said his daughter was in a 'psychotic' state when she left her house with only the clothes on her back and without her medication. ‘It wasn't like she just decided to take time off,’ he said. ‘She's out there, she's missing, she needs help.’ Despite previous statements, Charles Upham said he does not believe his daughter would take her own life. ‘She has said suicidal things in the past but never followed through,’ he said. ‘She doesn't believe in killing herself. She believes that is a sin and she would never do that.’ Speaking to HollywoodLife.com, Mona Upham, Misty's mother, accused the Seattle area police of not doing enough to find her daughter. Phone Call: Upham's father recently revealed the last conversation he had with his daughter where she said that he and her mother didn't 'have to worry about her anymore . Where is Misty? Upham's parents have been canvassing their town and hanging 'missing' posters . 'We are disappointed that the police are not doing more to help find Misty,' she said. 'Right now the only people looking for her are myself, my husband and son and daughter. Mrs Upham attributed the police department's alleged inaction to her daughter's Native-American background. 'I think if Misty was different-looking they would be doing a lot more to help find her,' Mona Upham said. 'Missing person': The police did not comply to Upham's father's request to have his daughter listed as a 'missing person.' The mother went on to say that their family cannot afford to hire a private investigator to look for Misty, so they have been canvassing the neighborhood on their own and hanging 'missing' posters. They believe the 32-year-old is still alive but needs help. In a statement posted Sunday to the actress' Facebook page, Charles Upham wrote that as a father, he does not fear she committed suicide. ‘I think Misty may have walked into nearby woods and got hurt and can't reach help or I think she may have had an encounter with someone who may have caused her harm. I believe she would contact us if she could,’ he stated. Upham was last seen near her Auburn home October 5. Police responded to a suicide call at her apartment, People magazine reported, but when they arrived, Upham was not there  and officers were not able to contact her. This is not the first time Upham has reportedly left her home without notice, and it is also not the first time police have responded to suicide calls at her residence. The magazine reported that in the last year, police have responded to Upham's apartment four times following suicide calls. Upham's father recently told The Hollywood Reporter that he fears his daughter is suicidal. 'She had recently changed her medication, so she was sort of having erratic behavior,' Upham's father told THR. 'She told me and her mom that we didn't have to worry about her any more. … I thought it sounded suicidal myself, so I called the police. 'She's always been a suicidal person.' Charles Upham went on to say that Misty sometimes made suicide threats, but 'never went through with it.' People reported that Upham may have been under a lot of stress prior to her disappearance. A source reportedly told People that Upham was struggling financially and sometimes had trouble paying her rent. One day after Upham went missing, her father went to the police asking that his daughter be listed as a 'missing and endangered person.' The police did not comply, saying that Upham's case did not meet the criteria because her disappearance was not 'unexplainable, involuntary or suspicious,' according to USA Today. Facebook: With police putting no resources into her case, Upham's family took to Facebook to enlist the help of the public in finding Upham . Therefore, the Upham family took to Facebook and local media to alert the public about their missing daughter and to enlist the public's help in finding her. In a Facebook post on Upham's page, the family stated: 'We have been consumed by chasing down leads and doing ground searches in the area she was last seen. It is only her family searching right now, hanging posters, checking with shelters, hospitals, and asking people in the area if she has been seen. We are asking for help from people who live in the area to search the wooded areas near the Muckleshoot casino.' The post stated that the police are not looking for Upham. Another post revealed that Upham's family has no income. '[The] father is recovering from a recent stroke and is disabled.,' the post reads, '...mother is disabled with congestive heart failure...the family is dependent on donations. The family wrote in the post that they are 'doing everything within our means to bring our daughter home safe.' Upham is best known for her role in the 2008 independent film 'Frozen River,' for which she received an Independent Spirit Award nomination. She recently played a house keeper in 'August: Osage County.'   Her next onscreen role will be in 'Cake' with Jennifer Aniston and Anna Kendrick.

"Nestled beneath a stretch of earth in a quiet Swedish village, archaeologists have uncovered a treasure trove of hand-carved figurines. No less than 29 of these so-called guldgubbars, which means 'Gold Old Men', were unearthed in the southern region of Blekinge and each are thought to have been made using 6th Century Roman coins. The figurines are most commonly found at sites of ritual and worship as devotions to the gods, and because they were discovered alongside the ruins of houses and a forge, archaeologists now believe the area may have been home to an Iron Age cult. No less than 29 so-called guldgubbars, pictured, were unearthed in the southern region of Blekinge in Sweden. Each of the figurines are around two centimetres tall and were made using 6th Century Roman coins hammered into the elaborate shapes . ‘Without a doubt, the place was important during the Iron Age for several hundred years,’ said lead archaeologist Mikael Henriksson. ‘Clearly, we can start a new chapter in the study of the Blekinge Iron Age.’ The hoard of gold, said to be one of the largest discoveries of guldgubbar in the whole of Sweden, was found during excavations of the site being carried out by the Blekinge Museum. Each of the figurines is thought to date back to the 6th century AD and each measure two centimetres tall. Guldgubbars are also known as Gold Old Men or Gold Wives because they are shaped like men, pictured left, and women, right. They're commonly associated with places or political or religious significance and are thought to have been created as gifts for the gods in certain cults . The figurines were found at a site in the west of Vang, a village in Blekinge, pictured, on the south coast of Sweden. Researchers have suspected the area was an Iron Age settlement for some time since finding a 3rd century bronze bust in the same region back in 2004, and more recently, unearthing the ruins of houses . ‘The discovery of gold from this period shows that people in the area served as soldiers in the Roman Army,' said Björn Nilsson, of Södertörn University College. ‘Up here in the Nordic countries the gold coins that had been paid to the soldiers were melted down and formed into guldgubbar and guldkoner.' Guldkoner refers to the female figurines, also known as Gold Wives. The theory about the site being an . Iron Age settlement were bolstered by the discovery of glass beads and . other bronze household items as well as pottery, animal bones and clay. ‘Gold Old men are most commonly found at sites associated with power or religious rites,’ continued Henriksson. ‘Maybe the site has been used as a place of worship but as yet we can only speculate. ‘What we now know about the place is that it was a certainly a settlement in the Iron Age.’ The discovery of the gold figurines, . alongside bronze busts and signs that a community once lived in the . region, has led archaeologists to believe an Iron Age cult once lived in . the area. Guldgubbars, also known as Gold Old Men or Gold Wives, are commonly associated with places or political or religious significance.

Hoards of objects such as these, as . well as the bronze objects found in the same region, may have been . buried as gifts to the gods. Metal during the Bronze and Iron Age was deemed valuable enough for objects made from it to serve as a sacrifice. The vast number of guldgubbars discovered in Vang, said to be the third largest hoard ever found in Sweden, additionally suggests this area could have been a region of great religious significance. This is bolstered by the various ruins of houses and other findings hinting that a settlement would have been set up in the region and survived for hundreds of years. Archaeologists have known for some . time the region once held Roman significance.

"A millionaire pharmaceuticals entrepreneur deliberately gave her eight-year-old son a lethal dose of prescription drugs and exchanged goodbyes but later tried to revive him, she told jurors on Thursday. Gigi Jordan told her murder trial she heard her son, Jude Mirra, struggling to breathe: 'My heart started pounding,' she testified. 'I raced over to him. I was crying and sobbing,' she said. 'I was crying and calling, 'Jude! Jude! Jude!' And then I started to attempt CPR.' Mother's confession: Gigi Jordan, right, pictured in court in 2011 with her attorney Alan Dershowitz told jurors on Thursday that she gave her son a lethal dose of painkillers but tried to revive him afterwards . Her tearful account provided a stark contrast to the prosecution's portrayal of her as a dark woman coolly killing her only son. Jude was found dead of a drug overdose in a pill-strewn, deluxe Manhattan hotel room in February 2010, with Jordan on the floor. Emergency responders' accounts of her condition have varied from incoherent to composed. Jordan says she set out to take her life and her son's for a complex set of reasons: Some ominous occurrences had convinced her that one of her ex-husbands would have her killed to keep her from raising allegations of financial malfeasance, and she felt that without her Jude would be unable to avoid a man she says sexually abused him. 'I couldn't see any way out of the situation,' she said. Both men have denied her allegations. Neither has been charged with any crime. Mother and son: Prosecutors maintain Jordan (right), 54, forced a cocktail of crushed pills and vodka with orange juice down the throat of her eight-year-old son, Jude Mirra (left), in a $2,300-a-night hotel suite . Standing trial: As Jude (right) lay dying on the bed next to her, Jordan (pictured, left, in court) then reportedly emailed adviser Patrick Walsh, saying: 'Hi Pat, can you please wire $125,000 to Bruce as requested below?' Prosecutors say Jordan had no right to kill Jude, whatever her reasoning. They say Jordan climbed on top of her son and pried his mouth open — so forcefully that she left bruises on his face and chest — and plunged a deadly combination of painkillers, other drugs, vodka and orange juice down his throat with a syringe. Then she got on her computer and transferred money out of her son's trust fund, Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Matthew Bogdanos has said. She also wrote a suicide note. The nonverbal, often tormented-seeming Jude was initially deemed autistic but later was diagnosed with immune-system abnormalities, post-traumatic stress disorder and other problems, according to Jordan. Aim: Jordan hoped to siphon cash from her son's trust into one of her business accounts, prosecutors said . Scene of the crime: Although Jordan has never disputed feeding the drugs to Jude, she has described her actions in the luxury hotel room on Fifth Avenue as a 'mercy killing'. Above, the Peninsula on Fifth Avenue . Devastating: Prosecutors said the pharmaceutical executive's emails contradicted her  lawyer's assertions that she was 'emotionally distraught' at her son's autism. Above, emergency crews take away Jude's body . Allegations: In addition to his medical condition, Jordan alleges that her son's (pictured) biological father, and her second husband, Emil Tzekov, had been sexually abusing the boy since he was an infant . Nonetheless, she says, Jude disclosed the abuse to her with gestures, his few words and, later, by typing on computers in a technique known as facilitated communication, with her touching his arm. Various authorities rebuffed her requests to investigate the abuse allegation, she said. One of her inquiries instead ended with her hospitalized for a psychological examination in 2008. She was released within days. During their last weeks together, she said on Thursday, Jude tapped out messages supporting her plan to kill them both. And on the final night, 'Jude and I were typing to each other and saying goodbye to each other,' she said. She denied forcing the drugs down his throat and said the bruises reflect her effort to revive him.","Gigi Jordan, 54, denied force-feeding her son, Jude Mirra, a fatal cocktail of pills and vodka mixed with orange juice .

"Ben Richards has opened up about his battle with bowel cancer, saying he dismissed unusual symptoms because he was a 'typical man' and dreaded the idea of going to a doctor about 'that part' of his body. But six months after ignoring the tell-tale signs he was undergoing emergency surgery as well as having chemotherapy and radiotherapy for aggressive bowel cancer. ‘I was just a total bloke about the situation,’ says Ben, 41, who has recently become ambassador for Bowel Cancer UK. Ben is pictured surrounded by nurses in March 2012 while undergoing chemotherapy for his bowel cancer at the Spire Harpenden Private Hospital in Hertforshire . ‘Like most men I didn’t want to even . think about going to a doctor and it wasn’t until my . then wife Helen nagged me that I eventually saw my GP.’ Ben, who has starred in Footballers Wives, Holby City and The Bill, had been suffering with a small amount of blood in his stools and had noticed his bowel movements had changed. But he presumed that the blood was down to internal piles and his irregularity was due to the fact he had been travelling around India. In January 2012, Ben eventually listed the symptoms to his doctor, and he recommended Ben see a specialist as a matter of urgency. By chance Ben managed to get a last minute appointment with a private doctor within a few hours. The specialist advised a colonoscopy, to take a tissue sample from the bowel, and a CT scan. Ben felt well and never thought for a second that his minor symptoms could be the signs of something as deadly as bowel cancer . A week later, Ben went for his tests at the Harpenden Spire Private Hospital. The scan immediately showed up a 6cm tumour in his bowel and he was diagnosed with cancer on the spot. ‘I couldn’t quite compute what the doctor had told me,’ remembers Mark. ‘It was terrifying and cancer had always been something that happened to other people, not me. Ben had been scheduled to take time out from his role playing Franklin Hart in Dolly Parton’s musical, 9 To 5, and to fly to Los Angeles for ‘pilot season’ - when actors promote themselves aiming for career success Stateside. 'I had no family history of the disease . either, so it never occurred to me that symptoms I had mistaken . for IBS and piles could be something so serious.' When Ben first opened up about his battle, he referred to wife of nine years, Helen, as his 'rock'. She had been having fertility treatment and they were desperate to start a family after losing  babies due to a rare genetic bone and cartilage condition. Bowel cancer affects 40,000 Britons and kills 16,000 each year. It usually starts in the large bowel but can rarely begin in the small bowel. Symptoms usually include abdominal pain, blood in the stool, unexplained constipation or diarrhoea and unexplained weight loss. It is the third most common cancer in the UK, but is the second most common in women. Around 72 per cent of cases occur in those aged over 65 but numbers of young people developing the disease are rising rapidly. Age, a low-fibre diet, being overweight, high alcohol intake, smoking and a family history of the disease puts you at an increased risk. The disease is usually treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Early detection and treatment usually results in a cure but late diagnosis only has a five year survival rate of 6 per cent.

Ben had been due to visit LA for work, but he was forced to cancel his plans to undergo emergency surgery. 'Surgeons were forced to remove almost half my bowel which was incredibly painful,' says Ben. 'The whole combination of treatments was a shock to the system and to be honest I felt awful.' He also underwent a number of six-week cycles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Despite minor complications, he has made a full recovery and has been in remission for four months now. In .

"Doctors fear a large outbreak of mumps may follow the latest measles epidemic - because of a generation who missed out on MMR jabs. Health chiefs have warned students in South Wales to get vaccinated against the highly contagious mumps virus. Today Cardiff University put out an official warning to all students. The email to students read: 'Public Health Wales has had increasing . numbers of notifications of mumps in the University population. Cardiff University has sent an email to students asking them visit their GP if they have not had their MMR jab because the number of mumps cases ha started to rise . 'It is therefore advisable if you are not vaccinated to contact your GP as soon as possible to arrange vaccination. 'As you may be aware there is a large outbreak of measles predominantly, but not exclusively, in the Swansea area. 'If you have not had two doses of MMR vaccine you are advised to contact your GP and make an appointment.' Medical advisors say mumps can lead to infertility and even death in the most severe cases. And they fear a repeat of the measles outbreak which has already hit 1,039 people in the South Wales area - with 85 patients hospitalised. Dangerous: The mumps virus can cause infertility and even death . Mumps is a contagious viral infection that used to be common in children. It causes painful swellings at the side of the face and under the ears. Other symptoms include headache, joint pain and a high temperature. It is spread by infected droplets of saliva. There is currently no treatment but symptoms usually pass within two weeks. Complications are rare but mumps can lead to deadly viral meningitis, as well as swollen testicles and ovaries which cause infertility . The MMR vaccine now gives children 95 per cent protection against mumps. Before it was introduced in 1988, mumps was responsible for 1,200 hospital admissions every year. A spokeswoman for Public Health Wales said: 'We want to encourage everyone who is eligible for the vaccine, including students, to come forward. 'Two doses of MMR give you 99 per cent protection against measles, mumps and rubella.' 'These are all highly contagious and could spread quickly in closed communities such as schools and universities. 'Students should get the vaccine as a matter of urgency and those in doubt should receive the MMR again as a precaution.' The measles epidemic, which started in October, has been blamed on a scare about MMR vaccine which led many parents to decide not to immunise their children. Many of those children are now at university and could be coming into contact with people infected with the illness. Those who haven’t had the vaccine can easily contract mumps which can lead to meningitis, encephalitis, pancreatitis, deafness and painful swelling of the testicles .","Cardiff University has sent email out urging students to get MMR jab if they have not already done so .

"A volunteer on a charity sanitation project in Madagascar almost died after tapeworms burrowed into her brain. Sherry Fuller, 40, is thought to have picked up the worms from contaminated food or water. When she returned to England she began to suffer with intense headaches that developed into frequent seizures, but doctors were baffled by her condition. Eventually, a consultant neurosurgeon diagnosed neurocysticercosis, a rare condition in which a person becomes infested with pork tapeworm. Sherry Fuller, 40, is thought to have picked up the worms from contaminated food or water - they caused her to suffer headaches and seizures . The worms get into the intestine and migrate to the muscles and brain where they form cysts. In Ms Fuller’s case, she was found to have larvae in her brain that were the size of a 5p coin. ‘We were working with children and there was nowhere for them to wash their hands,’ said Ms Fuller, an information officer with Southend Council, Essex. ‘When I got home, I started having headaches but did not really realise anything was wrong with me. ‘Then I started to have seizures. They were passed off as panic attacks. ‘I was having four or five seizures a day. I went to my doctor who looked into my right eye. Part of it was black because of the swelling. Doctors initially thought she had a brain tumour or HIV before tropical medicine specialists got to the bottom of the problem. She is pictured volunteering in Madagascar where she picked up the worms . ‘I was sent for a scan. At first, it . was thought I had tumours. It was a miracle how well I was doing given . how much of my brain was swollen.’ Ms Fuller was sent from Southend Hospital to the Royal London Hospital to see a neurological specialist. He reassured her that she did not have a brain tumour but suggested that it could be HIV or TB. Eventually, however, tropical medicine experts diagnosed her with neurocysticercosis. The worm (pictured) caused sacs containing parasite larvae to form in her brain - these were cured with a worming tablet . She said: ‘That was after three weeks which was a really frightening time. ‘I was so unwell. My brain was not working and I was traumatised by the whole ordeal. ‘It was a long time before I could sleep because I was worried I would not wake up again.’ Ms Fuller, of Westcliff, Essex, says that she was strangely relieved to be told that she had tapeworm as it meant she could be cured. She said: ‘The larvae in my brain were about the size of a 5p which was why it was causing me a problem. ‘The doctors gave me a worming tablet which kills the larvae.’ It is a infection caused by the larval cysts of the pork tapeworm - these are sacs containing the immature parasites. These cysts can affect various parts of the body - when they form in the brain it is known as neurocysticercosis. When the brain is affected it can cause seizures and can be fatal. The condition is caught by eating the microscopic eggs excreted by a person who has an intestinal pork tapeworm. For example, if a person eats undercooked, infected pork and develops a tapeworm they can excrete eggs and may contaminate food or surfaces by not washing their hands properly. Once inside the body, the eggs hatch and the larvae find their way to the brain. However, Ms Fuller’s ordeal was not to end there. Her body reacted badly to the treatment and her arms, legs, and back swelled. She was given steroids to deal with the side effects and anti-epilepsy drugs stopped her fitting. Making a full recovery has taken her two years. ‘I had a lot of anxiety,’ she said. ‘I don’t know if that was from the damage to the brain or from the trauma of the experience. ‘I had problems which are often associated with a brain injury. I could not switch off from sound and was over-sensitive to noise. ‘I remember coming back home from hospital and sitting in the garden thinking it would be relaxing. ‘It was overwhelming, horrendous. It is quite common to lose the sound filters. ‘When I went back to the office I had no filter at all. I could hear all the voices, the photocopier, everything. I just sat at my desk and cried. ‘I could also not make decisions. I could do logic puzzles but if someone asked me to make a decision about the smallest thing, it would throw me into a panic. ‘My concentration would waiver. It was obvious to other people I was different but I was oblivious.’ In hindsight, Ms Fuller wishes she had had the support of an organisation like Headway Essex, which cares for survivors of brain injuries, so she is now raising money for the charity.","Sherry Fuller, 40, caught pork tapeworms from contaminated food or water .

"Long before Ernest Hemingway wrote his first story, his mother was busy writing about him, in a series of scrapbooks documenting the future author's childhood. Starting Sunday, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in . Boston will make the contents of five Hemingway scrapbooks available . online for the first time, giving fans and scholars the chance to follow . the life of one of the 20th century's literary greats from diapers to . high school degree. Grace Hall Hemingway began the series of scrapbooks by describing how the sun shone and robins sang on the day in July 1899 when Hemingway was born. Family history: Grace Hall Hemingway added her new son Ernest's birth certificate and a family photograph to her scrapbook when her son was born and continued to document his life . Close bond: A photograph of Hemingway's mother Grace Hall Hemingway . Hemingway Collection curator Susan Wrynn said much of the content hasn't been made available to the public before and only a few researchers have seen it in its entirety. The fragile leather-bound volumes have been kept in a dark vault for about four decades to keep them from falling apart. Literary great: The young Hemingway showed an early talent for writing and storytelling that lead to worldwide recognition as adult . The release of these records from the archive, home to 90 per cent of existing Hemingway manuscript materials, will come on what would have been the scribe's 114th birthday. 'I think it will be a very rich resource for people interested in learning about this period of his life,' Sean Hemingway, the author's grandson, said in an interview with The Associated Press. 'He had tremendous talent. It must have been there from the beginning. So I'm sure there are clues in there to that.' Pennsylvania State University professor Sandra Spanier, who is general editor of a project that will publish Hemingway's letters in more than a dozen volumes, said the scrapbooks the author's mother created offer details of his daily life up until age 18 that don't exist anywhere else. 'She almost made their lives into a story... and I think that carries over into his life and his fiction,' she said. There's a scribbling from when Hemingway wasn't quite three years old that the future war correspondent and novelist - who later won a Pulitzer Prize for 'The Old Man and the Sea' - told his mother depicted the roaring sea. Other early passages also hinted at the writer Hemingway would become. Before he was four, Hemingway was trooping into the woods to go hunting with his father and 'using long words' and making 'sage remarks,' according to his mother, who enclosed photos of her son trout fishing and holding his own rifle. 'Can cock my own gun,' one of her captions read. Mea culpa: A 13-year-old Hemingway admits to bad behavior in church but promises to improve in this handwritten note . Early life: Hemingway (left) kept up correspondence when he joined the army as an ambulance driver at 18; Curator Susan Wynn (right) displays one of the scrapbooks of his life made by Ernest Hemingway's mother . By the time Hemingway was five, his mother noted that he was collecting war cartoons and had an appreciation for characters with courage. 'He loves stories about Great Americans,' she wrote. The scrapbooks have a plethora of family photos from the Hemingway family's home in Oak Park, Illinois, and their vacation cottage on a lake in Northern Michigan, including shots of a bare-bottomed baby Hemingway playing in the water by a canoe. They include letters to Hemingway and others he wrote as a child, including a note of contrition in which he confessed to bad behavior in church. 'My conduct tomorrow will be good,' 13-year-old Hemingway promised. History: Rynn holds a letter from Ernest Hemingway to his mother, Grace Hall Hemingway . The scrapbooks also contain childhood paintings and tell of Hemingway playing the cello, suiting up for a 'lightweight' football squad and taking up boxing. During his junior year of high school, he was on his school's prom committee and, according to a report card note from his Latin teacher, showed 'improvement both in attitude and work.' As Hemingway matured, the scrapbooks showcased his earliest attempts at the craft that would come to define his professional life. Among them were a short story from his high school's literary magazine, clippings from some of his first assignments as a high school newspaper reporter and a sonnet in which 16-year-old Hemingway seemed to poke fun at himself. 'Nobody likes Ernest, that, is straight stuff,' he said, 'and when he writes stories - we all cry ""Enough.""'The scrapbooks are part of the collection that Hemingway's widow, Mary, gifted to the JFK Library and Museum after the author's 1961 suicide. Sean Hemingway said he's excited by their public release and called them one of the ways he's become familiar with a grandfather he never met. 'He died before I was born,' the 46-year-old said. 'Looking at these kinds of things... I feel like I have gotten a chance to know him a bit.'","Hemingway's mother kept detailed scrapbooks documenting his childhood .

"Superfluous: The new reforms to stamp duty 'has made Miliband's mansion tax redundant' Labour's flagship mansion tax policy has been rendered effectively redundant by George Osborne’s recent stamp duty reforms, a report claims. Ed Miliband would impose an annual tax of thousands of pounds on people living in homes worth more than £2million to raise an estimated £1.2billion a year. But the Chancellor’s reforms have already increased the tax burden on high value homes by £1.1billion a year and mean the top 1.6 per cent of households – with homes worth more than £1million – now pay 45 per cent of all stamp duty, the Centre for Policy Studies says. The think-tank claims any further taxation on high-value property owners would be ‘difficult to justify on grounds of fairness’. Its study says ‘any justification for a mansion tax has been significantly eroded’ by recent stamp duty increases on high-value properties. While the reforms mean the majority of buyers save money, those purchasing homes costing more than £937,500 will pay a higher tax bill. The maximum stamp duty charge, levied on homes costing more than £1.5million, is now 12 per cent compared to 7 per cent previously. Separate changes have closed a loophole which allowed people to avoid paying stamp duty on an expensive home by purchasing it through a company, rather than as an individual. The report said these two changes meant the top 1.6 per cent of households pay almost half of all stamp duty collected by the taxman. It said Labour’s mansion tax proposal was crude, would take no account of an individual’s ability to pay, would be expensive to administer and would raise insignificant revenues. Labour’s £1.2billion a year estimate is equivalent to less than one-quarter of 1 per cent of current tax revenues. The think-tank warned that the tax would seriously undermine the attraction of investing in the UK to rich overseas buyers, risking a ‘wider economic impact’. It also claimed the tax would suppress property values at the top end of the market, diminishing tax receipts for inheritance tax and stamp duty. At least £1 in every £6 raised by a mansion tax would be lost this way, it said. Tim Knox, of the Centre for Policy Studies, said a mansion tax was ‘unfair, complex, uncertain and inefficient’. George Osborne's reforms to stamp duty have already increased the tax burden on high value homes by £1.1billion a year and mean the top 1.6 per cent of households now pay 45 per cent of all stamp duty . He said: ‘Ultimately, the proposed mansion tax is little more than an appeal to envy’, adding that it would drive ‘cash poor, asset rich, households to sell their houses’. Property lawyer Tom Moran, at Charles Russell Speechlys, said it would hit the middle classes. He said: ‘A mansion tax, by itself, is unlikely to faze wealthy international buyers and ultra-high net worths buying in London and across the UK. ‘It is actually a levy on the capital’s middle classes, particularly baby boomers who bought big cheap houses until the 1990s. Many of these cash poor but asset rich older people will sell up and downsize.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has said people in homes worth £2million to £3million would pay £3,000 a year in mansion tax, with the charge for properties worth more than that being revealed after the election. Economists claim that it could average £24,000 a year. Some Labour MPs have publicly criticised the plans and party grandee Lord Mandelson has said it would end up ‘clobbering’ people. But last night Labour said a mansion tax would help pay for 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more GPs, 5,000 more home care workers and 3,000 more midwives. Those who could not afford the tax upfront could have it rolled up and paid from their estate after their death.","New stamp duty reforms have made Miliband's tax policy 'redundant'

"Staff in one government department in Sweden are to work six-hour days on full pay to see if it makes them happier than those working for seven hours . Hundreds of Swedish workers are trialling a six-hour working day in the hopes that it will cut sick leave and save the country money. In an experiment, workers in one government department in Gothenburg are to be put on to six-hour days on full pay, while workers in another department will work a standard seven-hour day. Mats Pilhem, Left Party deputy mayor of Gothenburg, hopes the six-hour staff will take fewer sick days, and have better physical and mental health as a result. Speaking to The Local, he said: 'We think it's time to give this a real shot in Sweden. 'We'll compare the two afterwards and see how they differ. We hope to get the staff members taking fewer sick days and feeling better mentally and physically after they've worked shorter days.' He claimed that a car manufacturer in the city had trialled the six-hour day with promising results. He added that in other sectors, such as social care, the problem was not a lack of employees but people working inefficiently over the course of a long shift. However, opposition politicians blasted the move as a cheap trick to win favour ahead of elections, and said the policy had be trialled before with no success. For 16 years around 250 staff at Kiruna council worked a six-hour shift, but the policy was abandoned in 2005 after a report found that it had no impact on health. The trial, announced by the deputy mayor of Gothenburg (pictured), has been dismissed by opposition politicians as a cheap trick to win favour ahead of upcoming elections . Another trial in on staff in one hospital department in Stockholm had to be abandoned after workers in other departments became resentful, and a third on childcare workers was scrapped because it drove up costs. However, Pilhem dismissed the criticisms, saying: 'We've worked a long time on this, we've not planned it to be an election thing. These people are always against shortening hours.'","Government staff in Swedish city of Gothenburg to take part in trial .

"Google's Glass 'eye wear' could be potentially dangerous, leading professors have warned. The revolutionary 'wearable computer' could disrupt crucial cognitive capacity and distract wearers to the point where they miss things which are 'utterly obvious', they say. Daniel J. Simons, is a professor of psychology and advertising at the University of Illinois and Christopher F. Chabris, is a professor of psychology at Union College. The revolutionary 'wearable computer' Google Glass could disrupt crucial cognitive capacity, two leading experts have warned . Google Glass is a wearable computer with a head mounted display. It can connect with the internet via voice command and display information on the glass 'screens'. In a piece for the New York Times, the two experts examine the dangers the real-time digital distraction could pose. They write: '...most agree that a smartphone-linked display and camera placed in the corner of your vision is intriguing and potentially revolutionary — and like us, they want to try it. 'But Glass may inadvertently disrupt a crucial cognitive capacity, with potentially dangerous consequences.' Earlier this year Sergey Brin, one of Google’s founders, said safety had actually been a motivation for the new product. He said: 'We questioned whether you should be walking around looking down at a smartphone.' He said designers wanted to make something that freed both the hands and the eyes. But the professors say when the mind is engaged, wearers could fail to see something that would 'otherwise be utterly . obvious.' They write: 'Google Glass may allow users to do amazing things, but it does not abolish the limits on the human ability to pay attention.' Google is already facing a growing backlash over its ‘Glass’ eyewear, with cafe owners in the US banning the technology from their premises. Earlier this year Sergey Brin, one of Google's founders, said safety had actually been a motivation for the new product . Dave Meinert, who runs the 5 Point Cafe in Seattle, said those wearing the spectacles will have to remove them if they want to come in. He has put up a sign on the wall which reads: ‘Respect our customers’ privacy as we’d expect them to respect yours.’ The move comes after it emerged people wearing Google Glass could be banned from American cinemas, casinos and even parks because owners don’t want filming there. The glasses, which cost $1,500 a pair (£980), are currently on limited release to 2,000 customers but will be more widely available later this year. A camera next to the wearer’s eye, which can take photos or record video without a red light or a shutter sound to tell others that it is working, has caused concerns for privacy. Casinos said the futuristic eyewear could help cheaters to win unfairly and cinemas said they could be used to illegally record films and sell pirate copies. Lap dance clubs said that they would treat those wearing the Internet-connected specs the same as anyone caught filming a stripper with a cameraphone - and would kick them out.","Revolutionary 'wearable computer' could disrupt crucial cognitive capacity .

"An American theatre is the latest to offer so-called 'Tweet seats' where audience members are encouraged to post comments about the performance on the social messaging site. The Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis, Minnesota, has formalised a growing trend in theatre audiences to use their phones from within auditoria by giving obsessive tweeters a section of their own. Its management have roped off a special balcony-level section of the theatre 'that will not be disruptive to other patrons' for the latest run of The Servant With Two Masters. Scroll down for video . ROFL at Hamlet! Tweet seats are the latest craze to take over U.S. theatres as arts bosses give into to customers who just can't put down their smart phones . The Guthrie is not the first arts institution to cater specifically for, and even encourage, Twitter users. The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, Palm Beach Opera in Florida and the Public Theater in New York have all reportedly experimented with special sections for visitors who can't keep off their phones. The trend has also even threatened British threatres, with critics expressing mixed feelings about the increasing tendency of audiences in London's West End to reach for their phones during performances. 'There's little doubt that it disturbs other audience members, and probably even cast members,' wrote David Lister in The Independent recently. Some days in life will always be remembered, whether it’s your wedding day, the birth of a child or a perfect holiday. Other days - a family row, a stressful time at work or last-minute Christmas shopping - are probably best forgotten. But for a growing band of ‘lifeloggers’, every single day is recorded in minute detail and stored for future reference. Fans say lifelogging allows them to create a perfect digital archive which can be accessed at any time, whether it’s to recall a favourite moment in exact detail or simply check where they left their car keys. But critics argue it is a self-inflicted form of the Big Brother dystopia predicted by George Orwell’s novel 1984, in which every word and movement could be seen and scrutinised. Lifeloggers seek to capture daily details, either through pictures and video stored on the internet or by recording the patterns of their mood, sleep, exercise or diet. So far, only a handful of users have broadcast their lives on the internet for others to see, but the popularity of blogging sites like Twitter suggests that others will not hesitate as the technology becomes more available. 'And, of course, one hopes that people are too busy concentrating on the action to fish their mobile out of their pocket or bag. 'On the other hand, they are engaged enough to want a post a review.' In a classic case of 'if you can't beat 'em, join 'em', theatres and auditoria offering tweet seats make an effort to locate them in an area where smartphone glow will not distract other customers. Forward-thinking arts executives believe that social media could even be enrich the experience offered by the production. Guthrie External Relations Director Trish Santini said: 'If there were ever a Guthrie show to host Tweet Seats, it's The Servant of Two Masters. 'This cast is an incredible ensemble of comedians, and night after night they're riffing and improvising-it's the kind of show that makes you ask, ""Did they just say that?"" 'Usually they did - and tweeting should be a great way to talk about it.' However, if past experience is anything to go by, there are unlikely to be too many insightful comments winging their way across the Twittersphere. Peter Funt wrote on the subject in the New York Times: 'According to actual postings during a concert featuring works of Mozart, furnished by the Cincinnati Symphony, withak53 wrote: “Music hall looks a lot prettier from the top balcony.” 'And hippielunatic tweeted: “Star spangled banner always chokes me up a bit in music hall.”'",Twitter users given their own special section where they can't disrupt other patrons with the glow from their phones .
"Manchester City are considering a move for Southampton striker Jay Rodriguez despite closing in on a £30million deal for Wilfried Bony. City are wary of interest from Liverpool and Tottenham – who are both monitoring Rodriguez closely – and are keen to beat them to his signature. Rodriguez has a significant new contract offer on the table from Southampton, who are urging him to extend his stay on the south coast. Manchester City are considering a bid for Southampton striker Jay Rodriguez . Southampton are adamant they will not sell Rodriguez, but an offer over £20m will tempt them into letting him talk to another club. The 25-year-old has no intention of making a decision on agreeing to those terms with the club until he is back fit and playing again. Rodriguez has been out since April after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament in a Premier League match against City. The injury wrecked his chances of going to the World Cup with England, which he looked certain to after earning his first call-up to the national team that season and being on a run of scoring five goals in four games before the devastating blow. Last season, he netted 17 times in 40 games in all competitions and was in the best form of his Southampton career since his £6m move from Burnley in 2012. City manager Manuel Pellegrini believes Rodriguez would be a useful addition to his squad . Rodriguez, seen here playing against Arsenal last January, has been out since April through injury . City are also closing in on the £30m signing of Swansea City striker Wilfried Bony .

"Continental cafe culture is often held up as a model of responsible drinking. But adopting it in Britain would have a detrimental effect on the nation’s health, an expert warned yesterday. While the UK has some of the highest levels of binge drinking in Europe, the overall amount of alcohol consumed by the average Briton is lower than that drunk by people in many continental countries. No better: The continental 'cafe drinking culture' practiced in France and Spain, pictured, can be just as harmful as binge drinking . As a result, the number of alcohol-related deaths in Britain is lower than in countries such as France, Portugal and Spain. Dr James Nicholls, research manager for the charity Alcohol Research UK, said the idea that continental-style daily drinking is healthier than binge drinking is a myth. ‘In public health terms, making alcohol part of our everyday life in that way is not going to help at all,’ he said. ‘If anything, it will make matters worse and cost the NHS even more. ‘There is this assumption that there are a number of Mediterranean countries we should look at as a model for drinking, such as France, Portugal and Spain. ‘But their overall levels of alcohol consumption are higher than Britain. There is this view that the regular continental approach does not cause harm. Binge Britain: The UK's high levels of binge drinking is often mocked in other European countries, but experts say that the idea that daily drinking of smaller amounts is healthier is myth . ‘In fact it does, but it is just less visible. It is not the public order harm that is associated with binge drinking, but the damage to health is just as pronounced, if not more so. ‘We need to get away from the idea that there is either binge drinking or continental-style daily drinking. There is harm associated with both.’ A study published last year found that overall individual alcohol consumption was higher in Austria, Germany, France, Portugal and Spain than in the UK. The number of alcohol-attributable deaths was also higher in all these nations, with more than 15 per cent of male deaths linked to drinking in France and Portugal, compared with around 8 per cent in Britain. The researchers, from the University of Toronto in Canada, classified alcohol-related deaths as including cases of liver disease, chronic pancreatitis, alcohol poisoning and fatal injuries. Worse: Researchers found that in countries with 'cafe culture' drinking such as France, pictured, overall individual alcohol consumption was higher than in the UK . The Government is expected soon to announce plans for a minimum price for a unit of alcohol. Dr John Holmes, from Sheffield University, has investigated the likely effect of a 40p minimum price. His team’s research found that such a policy would have minimal effect on moderate drinkers, costing them less than £7 annually, but would cut consumption by almost 5 per cent for harmful drinkers, and reduce deaths by almost 10,000 in a decade. He said implementing the plan would almost certainly force supermarkets to end ‘three bottles for £10’ offers on wine and cheap deals on crates of beer. A 40p minimum unit price would reduce overall alcohol use by 2.4 per cent, leading to a crime reduction rate of 10,100 annually, while the saving to the NHS would be £626million over ten years, he added. Figures out yesterday show that men are twice as likely as women to die from alcohol-related causes. In 2011, two-thirds of the 8,748 alcohol-related deaths in the UK were men and a third were women, the Office for National Statistics said.","Britain should not try to import 'cafe drinking culture' from the continent .

"If you are struggling to stick to a diet of carrot sticks and lettuce leaves, news of the latest weight loss technique to be sweeping Japan could be music to your ears. Former actor, Miki Ryosuke, claims to have lost two stone and five inches from his waist in seven weeks by following his Long Breath Diet. Mr Ryosuke, 55, claims that followers of the diet just have to spend two minutes a day concentrating on taking long breaths and then exhaling aggressively. Scroll down for video . Former actor Miki Ryosuke claims to have lost two stone and five inches from his waist in seven weeks by following his Long Breath Diet which he discovered by accident . The dieting guru says that he invented the diet by mistake while practicing breathing techniques in an attempt to reduce his back pain, Oddity Central reports. While he was practicing the breathing techniques, Mr Ryosuke noticed that he was losing weight. As a result of the discovery, he drew up the Long Breath Diet which involves the dieter taking a specific position before inhaling for three seconds and then exhaling powerfully for seven seconds. Mr Ryosuke claims that people who practice this breathing technique for two to five minutes a day will see rapid benefits. Oddity Central reports that there are two ways of practicing the diet. The first involves tensing the buttocks while standing with one foot in front of the body and placing most of the body’s weight on the back foot. Mr Ryosuke claims that followers of the diet just have to spend two minutes a day concentrating on taking long breaths and then exhaling aggressively . In this position, the dieter is encouraged to inhale for three seconds while lifting their arms above their head. They are then told to breathe out while tensing all of their muscles for seven seconds. The second way of practicing the technique involves the dieter standing upright while tightening their buttocks and placing one hand on their stomach, and the other on the bottom of their back. They are then told to inhale for three seconds before breathing out for seven seconds, all of the time holding in their stomach. Jill Johnson, creator of the Oxycise, another weight loss programme based on breathing, told Oddity Central: ‘Fat is made up of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. When the oxygen we breathe reaches these fat molecules, it breaks them down into carbon dioxide and water. ‘The blood then picks up the carbon dioxide – a waste product of our bodies – and returns it to the lungs to be exhaled. Therefore the more oxygen our bodies use, the more fat we will burn.’ The Long Breath Diet is believed to increase a dieter’s muscle strength and to boost their metabolism by increasing their blood oxygen levels. However, most experts believe that practicing it for just two minutes a day is not sufficient to see any significant weight loss. Richard Godfrey, chief physiologist at the British Olympic Medical Centre, says the effectiveness of the technique is highly doubtful. He said: 'Medium to high intensity work out - such as rowing, brisk walking, or running - over a long period is the only way to burn up fat and elevate metabolism. 'Deep breathing and gentle exercises for five minutes a day is not going to burn up enough calories to transform body shape.' The Long Breath Diet involves the dieter taking a specific position before inhaling for three seconds and then exhaling powerfully for seven seconds . In fact, Professor Ian Macdonald, professor of metabolic physiology at the School of Biomedical Sciences in Derbyshire, warns breathing too deeply can do more harm than good. 'Inhaling and exhaling too deeply can disturb the balance between carbon dioxide and oxygen in the body needed to neutralise the blood. This can cause light headedness and even make someone faint.' And, he doubts simply breathing will turn fat into fuel. 'Contraction of muscles caused by exercise mobilises fat stores. But it is only vigorous aerobic sport that triggers enough energy to turn fat into fuel. Deep breathing alone will burn up fat by two per cent at best.'","Miki Ryosuke says he lost two stone in seven weeks on the Long Breath Diet .

"A teen has been accused of murdering an eight-year-old Virginia boy who was trying to protect his older sister from being raped. Mairese Washington, 16, was charged Monday with second-degree murder and malicious wounding and strangulation in the May 1 death of Martin Cobb, court records showed. Washington will be tried as an adult in the case and has a prior violent criminal record, WTVR reported. The Richmond teen was arrested two days after the killing but not immediately identified because he is a minor. Scroll down for video . Hero: 8-year-old Marty Cobb, pictured, reportedly was killed while trying to fight off a 16-year-old boy from raping his 12-year-old sister . Documents from an unrelated 2010 case showed that Washington previously was charged with malicious wounding after attacking a three-year-old boy with a hammer, according to the station. The baby survived, according to WWBT, but family told the station they are 'shocked' he was able to attack another young child. 'It brings chills to my spine. It makes the hairs on the back of my neck standup,' said the previously attacked boy's mother, Heather Arrington. 'It's just something you don't want to go through.' It was only in June that a judge decided Washington would be charged as an adult, which allowed media to publicly identify him. His indictment comes almost two months to the day after the heroic Cobb was buried in a somber funeral. The young boy was reportedly buried in a new . suit, along with a bag of potato chips and a teddy bear, WTVR says. It was packed with rows of mourners, and purple and white flowers near the young boy's casket, footage from WWBT showed. The . 12-year-old sister that Cobb died trying to protect was unable to come . to her brother's funeral - and has not been back to her home since the . assault because of her case with the Department of Social Services, . according to an earlier report by the station. 'She . ain't going to be able to come to her brother's funeral,' mother . Sharain Spruill told the station on Thursday. 'That's wrong.' NBC12.com - Richmond, VA News . Mommy's hero: Sharain Spruill (left), whose daughter was allegedly raped and her son Marty Cobb (right) killed last week (shown here at a May 3 vigil) revealed that the suspect initially told her that a white man was to blame for the attacks . Cobb's actions were even praised on Capitol Hill by Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA). 'At . 8 years old, he may have been small in stature, some say he looked no . older than 4 or 5, but in his last moments, Martin showed he was a . bigger man than most men ever dream to be,' he said, according to NBC12. Spruill earlier revealed more horrific details of the night she lost her brave boy. She recounted . the horrifying moment on May 1 when a 16-year-old boy carried her . bloody daughter, 12, to her home claiming she and little Marty Cobb had . been attacked by a white man. But . it was that same boy, whose name has not been released, who's now been . formally charged with strangling Marty and beating him to death, . possibly with a brick. The horrifying details came as Spruill addressed reporters and community members outside the Richmond house Marty once called home and described her daughter's horrified tears as she revealed the boy was dead. Family and friends say are hailing Martin as a hero, saying he tried to protect his big sister. 'As . soon as he could talk, I told (him) he's the man of the house. That's . what he did. He's a hero,' his mother told The Associated Press. 'I told . him he's the man of the house.' His . mother, sitting on the front steps of her home, said her son was a . second grader and 'a mama's boy' who didn't talk much to other people. His tiny stature masked a fighting spirit, she said. A . few feet away in the front yard, a memorial carried that message, . saying in part: 'A Real Hero Lived, Fought and Died Here.'The wooden . sign was draped with the boy's parka, surrounded by stuffed animals and . toys. His mother said her son had open-heart surgery when he was 3 months old and doctors said he wasn't going to make it. Neighbor Andrew Patillo, said the boy looked more like he was 4 or 5 years old. 'He had a big heart to be that small,' said Patillo. She said she was sitting outside her . Richmond home when a 16-year-old neighbor walked into the front . yard carrying her daughter, weeping and wearing only a T-shirt, on his . back. The teenager, who is black, told her a white man had attacked the . girl. The girl also initially blamed a white man and said he had raped her. The boy then soon appeared at an initial court hearing in which a judge deemed he would remain in custody. He was later identified as Washington. Too young: Martin's family say the little boy (pictured) tried to intervene in an effort to protect his big sister when he was killed . Authorities . said he intimidated and threatened the girl and she initially gave . authorities the wrong description of her attacker. Pitchford described Cobb as warm-hearted and friendly and said he was often playing with his sister outside. 'I'm proud of him. I'm proud that he stuck up for his sister. He did what he was taught,' she said. Pastor . Dr. Theodore L. Hughey of the Abundant Life church said the boy, also . known as 'Marty' and 'Little Martin,'and his sister were inseparable and . 'always in and out' of the church. 'You saw one. The other was there. They were never apart,' Hughey said. 'He had a heart of a lion,' said neighbor Andrew Patillo. 'He stood so tall, to be so small.' Before the vigil began, loved ones gathered around a sign in Martin's yard near the church.

"A woman killed her kitten by cooking it in a microwave for five minutes, a court has heard. Unemployed Laura Cunliffe, 23, from Hoyland near Barnsley, is said to have put four-month-old Mowgli in the microwave after it attacked her pet goldfish. Cunliffe then set the controls to cook for five minutes - Barnsley Magistrates were told. Laura Cunliffe (pictured) has pleaded guilty to cooking her pet kitten in a microwave for five minutes . Remarkably, the black and white female was alive when Cunliffe finally removed it from the machine - but she died shortly afterwards. Cunliffe pleaded guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal and was granted unconditional bail. She will be sentenced on March 13. Brian Orsborn, prosecuting for the RSPCA, told the court that Cunliffe had had the kitten since it was a few weeks old. He said: 'The kitten was in a distressed state when Miss Cunliffe took it out of the oven. She took the animals to a relative’s home. 'The kitten could not get its breath . and died about ninety minutes later. Miss Cunliffe made arrangements for . the body of the kitten to be taken away to be buried. 'The RSPCA became involved and was able to trace the man who carried out the burial.' These two horrific RSPCA photos show the dead animal and its burnt paws. The kitten died around 90 minutes after it was put in the microwave by Cunliffe, a court heard . Mr Orsborn said that Cunliffe disclosed what she had done three days later when she was at Barnsley Hospital. She said the kitten had attacked her goldfish. After the hearing Lynsey Harris, RSPCA deputy chief inspector said: 'In the 13 years I have been in the job I have never dealt with a case like this before. 'It is particularly horrendous because of the period of suffering for the kitten which would have been awful.' She said that the exposure to the radiation in the microwave would have cooked the animal’s internal organs. She said: 'It is an horrific case in the fact that the death of the cat would have been prolonged and it is unimaginable what it would have gone through taking some time to die. 'The main reason the RSPCA  took this case in order to achieve disqualifications in order to protect animals and prevent further suffer in the future.' Alan Greaves, defending said Cunliffe’s problems included psychosis and depression. He said Cunliffe had been sectioned under mental health legislation several times.

"Iranian authorities previously executed Delara Darabi, 17, in 2009 after she was convicted of murder despite strong international protests . A former child bride who was forced to marry at 14 and became a mother the following year is facing execution in Iran for murdering her husband. Razieh Ebrahimi was 17 when she shot her husband in the head while he was sleeping and burying his body in the back garden. The mother-of-one, 21,  is 'at imminent risk of execution' according to Human Rights Watch. Ebrahami is in prison in the south western Iranian city of Ahvaz after she pleaded guilty to her husband's murder, although she claimed he had subjected her to years of physical and verbal abuse. She has spent the past four years on death row. Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director of Human Rights Watch, condemned the planned execution. 'Every time an Iranian judge issues a death sentence for a child offender like Ebrahimi, he should remember he is flagrantly violating his legal responsibilities to administer justice fairly and equitably. 'Iran’s judiciary should reverse its execution order of a child bride who says she was battered.' An Iranian judge passed the death penalty despite Ebrahimi being aged 17 at the time of the murder. According to Human Rights Watch, Iranian courts can pass a death penalty when a boy is older than 15 or a girl has reached the age of nine if the court accepts evidence from a forensic doctor if they understood the consequences of their action. Under Iranian law, the victim's family is able to pardon the killer if they accept compensation, however, the husband's family want the execution to continue. The mother of murder victim Abdolah Hosseinzadeh, right, pardoned her son's killer seconds before he was due to be executed in the northern city of Nowshahr on April 15 . Since 2009, Human Rights Watch believes that Iran has executed at least 10 child offenders. Mr Stork added: 'Iran’s judiciary should prove its commitment to protecting children – the most vulnerable members of its population – by calling a halt to death sentences for child offenders.' According to a report on Iranian news agency Mehr, Ebrahimi told investigators: 'I married our neighbour's son when I was only 14 because my dad insisted. 'My dad insisted I should marry him because he was educated and was working as a teacher. I was 15 when I gave birth to my child. 'I didn't know who I am or what is life all about. My husband mistreated me. He used any excuse to insult me, even attacking me physically.' On April 15, the mother of murder victim Abdolah Hosseinzadeh dramatically pardoned her son's killer moments before he was due to be executed.","Human Rights Watch said Razieh Ebrahimi is 'at imminent risk' of execution .

"From 250 to 271 AD up to 5,000 people died each day in Rome not from war and famine, but from a deadly pandemic that would later be known as the Plague of Cyprian. And now archaeologists have found the remains of what appears to be victims of the widespread disease, in a pit in Luxor, Egypt. Kilns used to produce lime to cover the victims were also found, alongside a bonfire where stricken people were burned in order to stop the spread of the highly infectious disease, dubbed the 'end of worlds' pandemic. Archaeologists in Egypt have found the remains of victims that were struck down by the Plague pf Cyprian in the latter half of the 3rd century. The victims were burned and covered in lime to prevent the deadly disease from spreading. Here can be seen two skulls, two bricks and a jug at the burial site . The find was made by the Italian Archaeological Mission to Luxor (MAIL) team, reported Live Science. Smallpox was an ancient disease caused by the variola virus that resulted in a . nasty rash where lesions were filled with fluid and pus. The highly contagious disease was fatal in up to 30 per cent of cases. It . spread through contact . between people and saliva droplets in an infected person's breath. More than 300 million people died from smallpox in the 20th century alone. But vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries ultimately led to its eradication in 1979. It is one of only two infectious diseases to have been completely destroyed, the other being rinderpest in 2011. The eradication of smallpox is regarded as one of humanity's greatest accomplishments. SOURCE: WHO . The team, led by Francesco Tiradritti, excavated the tomb, known as the Funerary Complex of Harwa and Akhimenru, from 1997 until 2012. The monument had been built for an Egyptian grand steward named Harwa in the 7th century BC and it was continually used until it became a plague-burial site in the 3rd Century AD - and was then never used again. Writing in the Egyptian Archaeology magazine, Tiradritti said using the tomb to dispose of infected corpses ‘gave the monument a lasting bad reputation and doomed it to centuries of oblivion until tomb robbers entered the complex in the early 19th century.’ The Plague of Cyprian raged until 271, by which time it claimed a quarter of Rome’s population - and countless lives elsewhere. It spread across what is now modern-day Europe and into Africa. Now believed to have been caused by smallpox, the plague was so devastating that it led the bishop of Carthage at the time, Saint Cyprian for whom the pandemic is named, to lament that it could signal the ‘passing away of the world’. The find was made at a funerary complex, or tomb, in Luxor, Egypt. In the time of the Romans this city was known as Thebes and, from 250 to 271 AD it, like many other regions, was ravaged by smallpox in a pandemic that is now called the Plague of Cyprian . The kilns to produce lime to cover the bodies were fuelled by the remains of old wooden coffins, such as the one shown here. The find was made by the Italian Archaeological Mission to Luxor (MAIL) team after 15 years of excavations from 1997 to 2012 . Oil lamps discovered near the lime kilns, shown here, were used by the stokers who kept the kilns burning to see in the dark. Stokers would have had to keep the kilns burning around the clock for several days in order to produce the lime necessary to cover the bodies . Of the . plague, Cyprian explained the rather gruesome ways it would ravage its . victims in his essay De mortalitate (On the plague). 'The intestines are shaken with a continual vomiting’ and ‘the eyes are on fire with the ejected blood,’ it read. In some cases victims would also lose limbs to the disease, while many also eventually died. The remarkable artefacts found by the archaeologists show the level of fear and panic the plague induced in the locals. This best disinfectant known at the time was lime, which involved heating limestone to huge temperatures of up to 1,000°C (1,800°F). The large temperatures, though, required huge amounts of fuel, and in order to produce enough  lime to cover all the bodies it seems the locals at the time used coffins, and other artefacts, they found in this tomb to burn. Bodies were covered with a layer of lime, used as a disinfectant, and kept inside a pillared hallway shown at 1. The three kilns are shown at A, B and C, in part fuelled by both coffin and mummy remains stored at 4. Water was added to the lime at niche 3, while the bonfire to burn the bodies is at 2 . Here can be seen a close-up view of lime kiln C, which has a double chamber. It was built along with the other two kilns in order to produce enough lime disinfectant to cover the multitude of human remains that had died in the plague that struck the ancient city of Thebes, now Luxor . Seen here is the location where bodies were stored on the northern aisle of the monument's first pillared hall and covered with lime. The Plague of Cyprian raged until 2071, by which time it claimed a quarter of Rome's population . At the . time of the outbreak, it was said people were quick to turn over their . friends and even family to the authorities in the hope they could avoid . the deadly plague themselves. The streets were strewn with carcasses, many of which were burned to try and destroy the disease. In . 270 the pandemic claimed the life of emperor Claudius II Gothicus and . is thought by some to have contributed to the eventual fall of the Roman . Empire. There are many other incidents of smallpox breaking out around the world through human history, until the deadly disease was eradicated in 1979 after a widespread vaccination campaign. This area was used to 'slake', or add water to, the lime. The lime production capabilities show just how fearful the locals were of the disease. Now believed to have been caused by smallpox, the plague was so devastating that it led Saint Cyprian to lament that it could signal the 'passing away of the world' Before becoming a burial chamber for those killed by the Plague of Cyprian, the funerary had been built for an Egyptian grand steward named Harwa in the 7th century BC. Shown here is a grey fragment of decoration from within the monument found inside of the lime kilns . It seems when it came to disposing of the plague victims the 3rd century Egyptians did not hold back in desecrating previous burials and tombs in their panic. Here is seen the face of a second century coffin that was stored as fuel in the entrance of the monument .","Italian archaeologists have revealed an ancient burial plot in Luxor, Egypt .

"Opting for cheap supermarket tea bags over artisan blends could have long-term health consequences, according to new research. A study has found that cheap tea bags from supermarkets including Asda, Sainsbury's and Tesco can push a person's fluoride intake over daily recommended levels and put them at a higher risk of bone and dental disease. Experts have now called for supermarkets and tea manufacturers to consider . stating fluoride concentration as part of the nutritional information . found on food packaging. Time to splash out? A study has found that cheaper tea blends from supermarkets can push people's fluoride intake over daily recommended levels and put them at a higher risk of bone and dental disease . Levels of fluoride found in 38 tea products were compared by PhD student Laura Chan, Professor Aradhana Mehra . and Professor Paul Lynch from the University of Derby. Using Ion Selective Electrode analysis – which analyses trace . elements, such as fluoride, in a liquid – of the dry tea, and of the tea . infusions brewed with boiling water for two minutes, the researchers . compared the fluoride levels consumed by someone drinking the average intake of four cups or a litre of tea a day. It is recommended that an adult does not . consume more than three to four mg of fluoride per day. Yet researchers discovered that economy blends of tea contained . between 75 per cent and 120 per cent of the recommended daily intake. On average, a litre of cheap supermarket tea contained six mg of fluoride. They found significant differences in fluoride levels when economy . black tea blends from supermarkets Asda, Tesco, Morrisons and . Sainsbury’s were compared with branded black tea blends such as PG Tips, . Twining’s and Typhoo. Value brands from Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury's were among those found to have surprisingly high levels of the substance. Experts are now calling for manufacturers to state levels of the chemical on the box . They also found significant differences in fluoride levels between green tea blends including Clipper Organic . leaf, Green Twining’s bags; pure blends such as Assam, Dilmah and . Ceylon; and Oolong and Pu’er blends from India and Sri Lanka. Economy black tea blends, such as Asda Smartprice, Tesco . Value, Morrisons Value, Sainsbury’s Basics, and Waitrose Essential, were . found to have the highest concentration of fluoride – an average of six mg per litre. The tea plant . accumulates fluoride as it grows, with mature leaves containing the most fluoride. When tea is harvested, the older leaves are used to produce lower . quality, stronger teas such as economy teas. The bud and newer . top leaves are used in the  higher grade and speciality . tea products. It is suggested that an adult consume no more than three mg of fluoride a day. The new study showed that on average, four cups of cheap supermarket tea provided six mg of the substance. Excessive intake of fluoride can cause a variety of health problems including joint pain, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, brittle teeth, kidney problems and has even been linked to cancer. Waitrose Essential was . significantly lower in fluoride compared to the other economy black . blends, however. Infusions of green tea blends had the next highest concentrations of the substance, . followed by branded black blends such as PG Tips, Twining’s and Typhoo, . with an average of 3.3 mg per litre, compared to pure blends. More specialist teas such as oolong and pu’er had the lowest concentrations of fluoride with an . average of 0.7 mg per litre. Excessive intake of fluoride can cause a variety of health problems. In addition to tea, fluoride can be . found in some seafood, fluoride-enriched toothpaste, drinking water in . some areas of the country and in processed foods using fluoridated . water. Less seriously dental fluorosis can occur, which causes white and brown spots appear on the enamel of the teeth, and results in an unsightly 'mottled' effect. This can be the first sign that fluoride has poisoned enzymes in the body. But it can also cause skeletal fluorosis, a crippling disease that causes symptoms including bone and joint pain, muscle weakness and gastrointestinal disorders. This tends to occur in people who have routinely consumed 10 to 20mg of fluoride per day for 10 to 20 years or  2.5 to five mg per day for at least 40 years. In the most severe cases, the spine becomes completely rigid. Excessive fluoride consumption has also been linked to osteoporosis. A higher incidence of kidney . stones has also been recorded in areas with high fluoride levels in drinking water. Of the value tea bags tested, Waitrose had had the safest levels of the fluoride. More expensive brands including PG Tips, Twinings and Typhoo contained even less of the substance . Research has also linked excessive fluoride exposure to bone cancer in young men. A 1992 study found that osteosarcoma rates were three to seven times higher in fluoridated water areas than non-fluoridated areas. Ms Chan said: 'The tea plant, Camellia sinensis, is a fluoride . accumulator, with mature leaves accumulating most of the fluoride. Excessive intake of fluoride can cause a variety of health problems including  osteoporosis (affected bone, pictured) 'When tea is harvested, these older leaves may be used to produce lower . quality, stronger teas such as economy teas, whereas the bud and newer . top leaves are used in the manufacture of higher grade and specialty . tea products. 'Although fluoride is considered an essential micronutrient for human . health, in the prevention of tooth decay and promotion of healthy bone . growth, excess fluoride in the diet can have detrimental effects. Dental . fluorosis, the mottling of tooth enamel, and skeletal fluorosis, pain . and damage to bones and joints through calcification, can occur. 'People may be drinking excessive volumes of tea in addition to other . dietary sources of fluoride and may not realise these potential health . implications. 'Indeed, there have been cases, in both the UK and the USA, . of skeletal fluorosis in individuals who drank more than the average . amount of economy tea,' added Ms Chan. 'All tea products should be considered as a main source of fluoride in . the diet, and we would urge supermarkets and manufacturers of tea to . consider stating fluoride concentration as part of the nutritional . information found on food packaging,' added Ms Chan. The study is . published in journal Food Research International.","Fluoride is essential for bone and .

"Bethan Robertson-Smith has mercifully few memories of the car crash that almost killed her. But one thing she can never forget is the moment she realised, after waking from a two-week coma, that she could not move any part of her face. ‘I was in my hospital room, peering into a tiny mirror trying to smile, and this blank face looked back. I couldn’t do anything.’ Bethan examined her frozen face for just a few seconds before returning to her bed. Yet, strangely, she didn’t panic or cry – having suffered horrific head injuries, her motionless features were the least of her worries. Mona Lisa smile: Following her operation, Bethan is trying to raise awareness about facial palsy . ‘I was having to learn to talk, walk and eat again so this was just another thing on top of it all,’ she says. ‘The whole time in hospital was like being stuck in a bad dream. Each day I just thought, “Tomorrow I’ll wake up.” ’ She was suffering from bilateral facial paralysis, meaning in that single moment of impact, every one of the 40 muscles in Bethan’s face had been paralysed. Her mouth was permanently open and dry, one eyelid was constantly closed while the other was stuck open. A staggering 100,000 Britons suffer from facial paralysis, usually affecting just one side. It condemns them to a world without  the myriad expressions we communicate through our face. For Bethan, the accident, which occurred in 2008 when she was 22, left her with a skull fractured in four places, a bleed on the brain and traumatic injuries to the base of her skull that meant she had to be induced into a coma for 13 days. Although she recovered, the paralysis was to become the most enduring legacy of the crash. It is only now that Bethan can show her happiness once again thanks to an extraordinary ten-hour ‘smile transplant’ operation. Before and after: Bethan in 2007 before her crash, left, and four years later suffering from facial palsy, right . Until the accident, Bethan, from Trefeglwys, mid-Wales, had everything to look forward  to. She was pretty, popular and bright. She had left school at just 17, gone travelling in Australia and returned to fulfil her dream of training to become a veterinary nurse. During the second term of her university course, she decided to drive home for a weekend but skidded across a wet road, straight into the path of oncoming car. When she woke from the coma, everyone was just relieved Bethan was alive. Then they were relieved that despite her brain injury, she was able to move and to communicate, albeit with extreme difficulty. No one was overly concerned by her motionless face which doctors hoped would naturally heal itself. After two months in hospital, Bethan was sent to a brain rehabilitation unit. Within three months of the crash she was discharged from NHS care and sent home to her mother Beryl’s house. But by the fourth month of her recovery, the paralysis had begun to upset her. ‘I realised my face wasn’t getting better. I had no advice, no support, nothing. I didn’t know what was going on. I was very depressed, very anxious and by this stage both  eyes were stuck open and had to have drops put in all the time.’ Procedure: How the operation was carried out . It may seem extraordinary that a patient could be left with their eyes permanently open, but when her facial nerve was crushed, it meant the muscles that shut her eyes stopped working. Facial palsy patients are usually able to open their eyes because this is a reflex controlled by a different part of the brain. But closing them requires muscles that are controlled by the facial nerve, which in Bethan’s case had been badly damaged. This meant her open eyes became dry and extremely sore, and often became infected. Bethan tried to tape them down to sleep, then tried to cover them with an eye mask, but nothing worked. Eventually she learned to roll her eyes up into her head so that she could sleep. Although her mother was extremely worried and Bethan was seen by an opththalmologist, at the time nothing was done. Unfortunately, she now has blurred vision  in her left eye, which may be as a result of the multiple infections. Locked in a face that couldn’t transmit even the slightest emotion was crippling for a once outgoing young woman. ‘It was horrendous being at home all the time, unable to go out because people would just stare at me in the street,’ she says. After eight months, she went to see a neurologist who said nothing could be done for her facial palsy. Sadly, Bethan is not alone in enduring such a desperate and lonely time following paralysis of the face. It takes almost six years for the average patient with facial palsy to be diagnosed and offered appropriate treatment. Many have already been through horrific experiences that triggered their condition, such as accidents, cancer, stroke, and the most common cause – Bell’s palsy. Others are simply born with it. Even when a diagnosis is made and patients are offered one of the main types of treatments – physiotherapy, injections such as Botox to relax overactive muscles, or transplant surgery – many health authorities refuse to pay because the procedures are deemed cosmetic. Last week, a charity called Facial Palsy UK was launched by surgeon  Charles Nduka to help these vulnerable patients get the care they need. It aims to educate GPs about the condition so it can be diagnosed faster, and also to create specialist teams in every region who can see patients and assess which treatments would suit them best. Mr Nduka, a consultant plastic surgeon . at the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, West Sussex, says: . ‘These patients deserve better. They have already been through terrible . accidents or survived cancer. What they need now is not a fight with the . NHS to get treatment.’ While . Bethan refuses to condemn the doctors who repeatedly failed to tackle . her facial palsy or the health trust that tried to refuse funding for . her eventual surgery, she concedes there were critical delays. It was . not until two years after her accident, and while visiting Australia . that she learned of a treatment that may have offered real hope. Finally smiling: Bethan after her operation, now able to smile and properly close her eyes . In Sydney, a friend took her to see an expert who told her there was an operation that might restore some function to her face. But on her return to Britain, Bethan was given the devastating news that she had missed the window to have this surgery. The facial nerve, which runs up through the base of the skull and controls every muscle in the face, splits into two, controlling the left and right side of the face. In most people, only one side is damaged and only half of the face paralysed. To have both sides affected, as in Bethan’s case, is incredibly rare. The only movement she had regained was an ability to lift the left side of her mouth by a centimetre. In some cases, patients can have the pressure on the nerve relieved using steroids to reduce inflammation or possibly with surgery. However, this operation has to be done quickly before the nerve is completely lost. This is usually within a year of facial paralysis. The surgeon had to tell Bethan she had arrived a year too late. ‘I just couldn’t believe it. Not one doctor told me, not one person seemed to know,’ she says. Luckily, Bethan was introduced  to Mr Nduka, who offers specialist ‘smile transplants’. He carried out a lengthy operation called a Labbe procedure, during which the muscle that runs from the temple down to the jaw – the temporalis – is detached at the bottom. This is then rerouted and connected to the sides of the mouth. The temporalis is not the only muscle involved in jaw movement, so chewing and talking are not significantly affected. Physiotherapy has helped Bethan learn to gently raise the corners  of her mouth using the redirected muscles, giving her what Mr Nduka describes as a ‘Mona Lisa’ smile. It might not be the beaming grin she once had, but with just two muscles she is learning to create a smile that most of us create with 14. Bethan has also had surgery to insert a small platinum ‘chain’ a few millimetres long into her eyelids to help them close. Alternatively, patients can have a tiny gold weight inserted into the eyelid. Bethan says it’s just the start. Although her brain injury means she cannot work because she still suffers from migraines and exhaustion, she is planning a move to Bristol to start a new chapter in her life. ‘The other day I saw a woman at the supermarket and she smiled and I managed to smile back,’ she says. Still, she is far from cured. She cannot pronounce the letter ‘B’ without pressing her hand to her mouth to create the right sound, a cruel twist for a girl called Bethan. She still struggles to move her lips and one of her biggest worries is that when she falls in love, will she ever be able to kiss the man of her dreams? There are more operations ahead too, as her face will age differently to most and may start to sag. But although life is far from perfect, Bethan has agreed to be a spokeswoman for Facial Palsy UK. ‘I want people to know about this condition and I want patients to get the support that wasn’t there when I needed help. Being part of this charity means I now have a positive reason for working harder and helping other people with facial palsy.’ facialpalsy.org.uk .","Bethan Robertson-Smith suffered full facial paralysis, but can now close her eyes and smile .

"With a healthy, organic image, cheese and milk from British goat farms have become popular items on our shopping lists. Now scenes we might imagine of free-range herds grazing on lush fields have been rocked by claims of animal cruelty. Undercover filming at two of the largest goat farms by animal campaigners Viva, shows images of kid goats having the tips or buds of their horns burned off with a metal tool. The painful procedure stops horns growing, so avoiding injury during clashes in adulthood. Exposed: Undercover footage led to claims of cruelty behind Britain's booming goat herds . Cruel: A farm worker carries a goat by the front leg during more footage which emerged . But animal welfare rules state this should be done by vets under anaesthetic. One of the farms, Upper Enson Farm at Sandon, Staffordshire, which has around 2,000 goats, does not take these safeguards. The farmer said he did not have the cash to use vets because the goat industry was ‘on its knees’. The farm supplies a dairy which sells products in major supermarkets including Sainsbury’s and Co-op. Footage from the farm also showed the carcasses of dead nanny and kid goats. The farmer later admitted the farm had suffered an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis, which can kill younger goats. Viva warns that cramped conditions can encourage diseases to spread. Filming at another business, Bromes Farm, near Taunton in Somerset, which supplies Tesco among other retailers, revealed some conditions in which the animals are not free to go out into the fields. Ranks of goats were also shown connected to milking machines at the farm. Viva condemns industrial-style milking parlours, which can cause the goats to suffer from sore udders because of the high quantities of milk produced. Shocking: Footage from the farm also showed the carcasses of dead nanny and kid goats . Bromes Farm did not respond to requests for comment. Viva said the raising of goats increasingly involved factory farming techniques. Director Juliet Gellatley said: ‘Ethically minded consumers who have been shocked by increasingly intensive methods of production in the dairy cow industry have been switching to goats’ milk under the mistaken belief that it is more humane.’ Nick Brandon, owner of Upper Enson Farm, admitted he was operating outside the rules on removing or disbudding horns. He said: ‘The disbudding is not quite as it should be and we are consulting with our vet to decide how to move forward.’ Asked why he has not used a vet, he said: ‘It is not economical for the number of goats we have got. 'The industry is on its knees. Goats’ milk and cheese is becoming more popular, but the price people pay in the shops is not filtering back to farmers.’ He added: ‘Our milking goats and older youngstock graze outside for eight to nine months of the year and have access to their shed in rain.’","Farm filmed supplies Sainsbury's and Co-op .

"Ahead of this week's Champions League action, Sportsmail will be providing you with all you need to know about every fixture, with team news, provisional squads, betting odds and Opta stats. Here is all the information you need for Barcelona's clash with Paris Saint-Germain... Barcelona vs Paris Saint-Germain (Nou Camp) Team news . Barca will be without suspended Brazil right back Dani Alves but Luis Enrique refused to be drawn on who might replace him in the starting lineup. Adriano is the obvious choice, or Martin Montoya, although the latter has barely featured this term. Barca have not failed to win their Champions League group since 2006-07 and have won 22 of their last home games in Europe's elite club competition, losing just once. Lionel Messi (second from left) and his Barcelona team-mates stretch during training on Tuesday . Paris Saint-Germain . Team news . After Chelsea lost last weekend in England, PSG is the only unbeaten side in Europe's biggest leagues. PSG hasn't played sparkling football, but the individual qualities of its creative players have made up for its collective inadequacies so far. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice in a 2-1 comeback over Nantes on Saturday, and Edinson Cavani has netted eight goals in his last 10 matches. 'PSG is the last unbeaten team and it's a pleasure,' PSG coach Laurent Blanc said. 'You need to wait until the end to assess a season, but I'm sure there will be better days. I'm optimistic we will continue to take points, but with style.' PSG duo Lucas Moura and Zlatan Ibrahimovic hug after the Swede's goal against Nantes last weekend . Kick-off: Wednesday 7.45pm - Sky Sports 2 . Odds (subject to change): . Barcelona 4/9 . Draw 15/4 . PSG 13/2 . Managers: Laurent Blanc (PSG), Luis Enrique (Barcelona) Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Barcelona will win their eighth Champions League group in a row if they defeat PSG at the Camp Nou. PSG finished first in their Champions League group in each of the last two seasons – their best run in the competition. They would improve their run this season with a draw. Barcelona vs PSG and Porto vs Shakhtar are the only two games this Matchday between two sides already qualified for the round of last 16. Barcelona (90.1 per cent) and Paris Saint Germain (89.06 per cent) are the two teams with the highest passing accuracy in the Champions League this season. Lionel Messi is the top scorer in Champions League history with 74 goals. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has not scored against his former club Barcelona at the Camp Nou in his two CL games there since leaving, but he has netted two goals in three home appearances against them. Barcelona have lost just one of their last 10 European games against French opposition (W5 D4), but that defeat came in their last meeting against PSG earlier this season (2-3). However, the Catalan side have never defeated PSG in the Champions League/European Cup (D3 L2). They did them in the 1997 Cup Winners’ Cup Final (1-0) though. In 156 European games between Spanish and French sides, the Spaniards have won 70 and have kept 53 clean sheets (D41 L45). None of the last 11 goals scored in CL games between Barcelona and PSG have come from outside the box.","Barcelona host Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday, kick-off 7.45pm .

"Christian Benteke is 'cool and calm enough' to handle any rough stuff from West Brom in Saturday's derby, according to Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert. Albion captain Chris Brunt was quoted as saying the best way of handling Villa's Belgian frontman was to 'kick him' when they come up against their local rivals this week. However Lambert is sure Brunt's comments were 'tongue-in-cheek' and has no concerns about Benteke's temperament after his recent red card for retaliation against Tottenham. Christian Benteke, pictured in training on Thursday, is set to start for Aston Villa against West Brom . Villa boss Paul Lambert has backed Benteke to stay calm if provoked by the Baggies on Saturday . 'Listen, I don't think about that,' said the Villa boss. 'As long as Christian keeps playing the way he has been for me, we'll concentrate on our own team and our own lads. 'I'm pretty sure if he (Brunt) has said that, it was tongue-in-cheek. 'I know exactly where he's coming from, so there's no problem with that. Christian is playing really well at the moment.' Benteke has only recently returned from a three-game ban for raising his hand to Spurs' Ryan Mason after being given some rough treatment during the Londoners' 2-1 win at Villa Park. Lambert does not believe too much should be read into that flashpoint, however, and backed the Belgium international to keep his head in future. Belgian striker Benteke has an effort at goal during Villa's 2-1 win against Leicester last Sunday . Benteke celebrates scoring the winning goal against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park earlier this month . 'Listen, it happened once (recently) when he was sent off at Tottenham,' said the Scot. 'But there's never really been a problem with Christian's temperament at all. It's the only time I've really seen him retaliate, which he knows he shouldn't have done. 'I don't think he'll do it again. 'Christian is cool and calm enough to handle that.' Key men Ron Vlaar and Fabian Delph could be in contention to return to action against Albion. Ron Vlaar (front) and Fabian Delph (back) could both return from injury against West Brom on Saturday . Skipper Vlaar has been out since early November with a calf injury while England midfielder Delph dislocated his shoulder in October, but both have returned to training and may make surprise returns. Tom Cleverley (bruised foot) is a doubt and fellow midfielder Ashley Westwood will miss around a month with a knee injury. Forward Andi Weimann returns from suspension but defenders Philippe Senderos and Nathan Baker remain out, as does midfielder Joe Cole.","West Brom host local rivals Aston Villa at the Hawthorns on Saturday .

"After a wave of concept images that attempt to predict what Apple’s iPhone 6 will look like, it appears we've been given a glimpse of the real thing. Images posted to Chinese social network Weibo earlier this week are thought to have been leaked by an anonymous insider working at Apple supplier Foxconn. Although the images are blurry, they appear to show a rounded design and a protruding camera, similar to those seen on the iPod touch. Scroll down for videos . The images, pictured left and right, were posted on Chinese social network Weibo earlier this week and are thought to have been leaked by an anonymous insider working at Apple supplier Foxconn. Although the images are blurry, they appear to show a rounded design and protruding camera, similar to that seen on the iPod touch . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 6.18mm. This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm. By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm. Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 7.9mm thick, while the HTC One is 9.3mm. Alternatively, the models shown in the pictures could be the next generation of Apple's MP3 player. Reports are claiming Apple is gearing up to go into mass production of the screen on its next flagship phone as early as next month. The first image shows what appears to be a blueprint of the iPhone 6, while the other two images of prototype models are shown in silver with rounded edges - similar to those seen on last year’s iPad Air tablet. Speculation is rife that Apple could follow up this super-thin tablet with an equally slim phone, dubbed iPhone Air, and the new images appear to corroborate this. Earlier this month, Japanese magazine MacFan published drawings of what purported to be a 4.7-inch and 5.7-inch iPhone 6C. Earlier this month, Japanese magazine MacFan published drawings of what seemed to be a 4.7-inch and 5.7-inch iPhone 6C, pictured. The drawings feature a flat, bezel-free device with rectangle-shaped volume controls like those found on the current iPhone 5C, as well as a camera with a single LED-flash on the rear . Recent concept images by designer Martin Hajek, pictured, and Italian artists Enrico Penello and Ran Avni feature a curved screen with 'bumps' at the top and bottom, along with an illuminated Touch ID sensor used to recognise fingerprints, first introduced on the iPhone 5S . The drawings feature a flat, bezel-free device with rectangle-shaped volume controls like those found on the current iPhone 5C, as well as a camera with a single LED-flash on the rear. Recent concept images were then created using the schematics detailed in MacFan’s release, by designer Martin Hajek, and Italian artists Enrico Penello and Ran Avni. These concepts feature a curved screen with 'bumps' at the top and bottom, along with an illuminated Touch ID sensor used to recognise fingerprints, first introduced on the iPhone 5S. The protruding camera and rounded edges of the purported iPhone 6 prototypes are similar to those seen on the current iPod touch model, pictured . The latest mockups come after Taiwanese sources said the camera in the iPhone 6 will get a boost to 10MP megapixels, from its current 8MP version, along with a new lens offering better picture quality. It is also expected to boast a new filter, allowing for clearer pictures. If Apple follows its usual release schedule, the new models will be unveiled in September this year, although experts are expecting the tech giant to launch at least one model in June. Apple's new devices are expected to use the in-cell touch panel technology - which embeds sensors more tightly into the screen - seen on previous models to make the next device as thin as possible. But reports suggest difficulties with this technology in larger displays has caused Apple to delay production of the 5.5-inch versions. It has been widely accepted Apple's rumoured 4.7-inch iPhone 6 (concept pictured left) will debut in September, with the 5.5-inch model launching in 2015. This was blamed on manufacturing problems. The latest reports, instead, are blaming this staggered release date on Apple's marketing strategy .","Images believed to have been leaked by insider at Apple supplier Foxconn .

"It's a massive week in the Champions League as the final round of group stage fixtures are played and the last 16 line-up confirmed. While some groups are settled, there's plenty to play for in others and some big names staring at elimination. Ahead of Wednesday's fixtures, we take you through the permutations and possibilities for each of the final four groups. GROUP E . Bayern Munich are guaranteed top spot in this group, while the other three teams all have a chance of joining them in the knockout phase. Manchester City will go through if they beat Roma in Italy and CSKA Moscow fail to beat Bayern in Germany. If CSKA lose, City can also advance with a score draw because of their superior goal difference to Roma. However, if both matches end in a draw, Roma are the ones who go through. CSKA can advance if they beat Bayern and Roma fail to beat City. If both CSKA and City win, the Russians advance by virtue of their superior head-to-head record over the Premier League champions. Yaya Toure will be pivotal when Manchester City head to Roma in their decisive Champions League game . A tense final night is in store in Group E as Roma, CSKA Moscow and Man City aim to follow Bayern Munich . GROUP F . Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain are both comfortably through and they meet at the Nou Camp to decide who'll top the group. A win or draw will see the French champions finish first. If Barcelona win, they will finish top. Ajax will ensure Europa League football after Christmas if they win or draw against APOEL in Amsterdam. A defeat, however, will see the Cypriots through in their place. Zlatan Ibrahimovic returns to former club Barcelona as top spot in Group F is determined . Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona meet at the Nou Camp to determine who'll finish top in Group F . GROUP G . Chelsea's 5-0 win at Schalke on matchday five ensured they will top the group. In order to join them, the Germans must beat Maribor and hope Sporting Lisbon lose at Stamford Bridge. If Schalke win and Sporting draw, the Portuguese side advance because of their superior head-to-head record. Maribor could pounce and gain the Europa League spot if they beat Schalke. Roberto Di Matteo's Schalke need to beat Maribor and hope Sporting Lisbon lose against Chelsea to progress . Schalke and Sporting Lisbon could qualify alongside Chelsea from Group G . GROUP H .

"The taxman is already under fire over proposed powers to plunder unpaid income tax direct from people’s bank accounts . But it emerged last night that under controversial new powers Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs will also be allowed to snatch money from low-paid families in receipt of tax credits. Even struggling families who are only held to owe the Government money because of mistakes by HMRC will still face having the cash snatched straight from their banks. Tax Credits are payments made to people on such low incomes they are deemed to need financial help with family costs . And on HMRC’s own figures the proposed new powers will be used against 3,000 people a year who have received too much in tax credits, which are designed to help low-paid families with children. News of the HMRC’s plans to use new powers against the poor come on top of mounting outrage from bankers, accountants, small businesses and civil liberties charity Liberty, over the proposal that the taxman should be able to snatch unpaid income tax direct from citizen’s bank accounts. But it has now become clear that the same new power - known as ‘Direct Recovery of Debt’, and set to be granted to the Treasury if a proposal by Chancellor George Osborne goes ahead – will also be used against people paid tax credits. Tax Credits are payments made to people on such low incomes they are deemed to need financial help with family costs. But recipients have to estimate in advance how much they will be paid, before their tax credits are calculated accordingly. If people then receive pay rises, or other additional income, and do not tell HMRC straight away, they are then deemed to have been overpaid, and then have to give some of the money back. As they are by definition already on low pay, getting the money together to pay it back can be difficult. But under the new Direct Recovery of Debt proposals, the HMRC will have the power to seize the money straight from the accounts of the people involved, . A spokesman for the tax collectors last night admitted that it estimated 3,000 tax credit recipients a year would be hit, but insisted it would only take money if it could leave a minimum of £5,000 in the account involved. A spokesman for HMRC (head office above) admitted that it estimated 3,000 tax credit recipients a year would be hit, but insisted it would only take money if it could leave a minimum of £5,000 in the account involved . But campaigning group False Economy, which discovered the plans to hit the accounts of the low-paid only thanks to a Freedom of Information request, yesterday said it feared the new powers would end up costing dear ever-growing numbers of people. According to the HMRC’s own figures the total owed back to the Government in overpaid tax credits stands at more than £5.6bn. Around 10 per cent of the families involved have a household income of less than £20,000 a year, and 118,000 of those being chased over debts – which could have been caused by the taxman’s own errors – earn less than £5,000 a year. False Economy spokeswoman Chamina Jayanetti said: ‘These figures show that tax credit overpayments are just a state-created debt that many families can never pay off, caused by a combination of low pay, costly childcare, and government incompetence and sleight of hand. ‘A personal debt burden of £5.6bn – more than £1bn of it dating back more than five years – has turned a system that was supposed to support parents into what is effectively a “parent tax”.’ Even before receiving the power to snatch cash from the bank accounts of the low paid, HMRC had already recently for the first time started using private debt collectors to collect money overpaid in tax-credits. Those private debt collectors proceeded to handly more than 200,000 cases in the year to 2013 alone. Yesterday Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: ‘Tax credits are there to make sure people get a decent standard of income, but the sharp rise in debts from overpaid tax credits suggests this policy is having the opposite effect. ‘Seeking to improve the accuracy of tax credit payments is sensible, but HMRC needs to tread carefully. HMRC has a poor track record in managing people’s data and dealing with overpayments. ‘It does not take much to push families into financial trouble and mistakes by HMRC will be harmful.’ Last night an HMRC spokesman said it did not yet have the power to take money from debtors accounts, and went on: ‘HMRC’s initial analysis suggests that, in the first two full years of operation of Direct Recovery of Debt, there will be around 3,000 cases a year that include some form of tax credit debt. ‘This is out of a total population of around 17,000 debtors a year whose debts are expected to be subject to this policy. This number is expected to fall significantly in future years. ‘HMRC estimates that the debtors who will be affected by this policy have an average of £5,800 in tax and tax credit debts and around half have more than £20,000 in their bank and building society accounts. In all cases, £5,000 will be left across the debtor’s accounts after the debt has been recovered.’","The proposed new powers will be used against 3,000 people a year who have received too much in tax credits .

"After five months of undergoing treatment for cancer, Cincinnati Bengals player Devon Still's daughter will finally get to watch her father play in person for the first time on Thursday night. Since 4-year-old Leah was diagnosed with stage 4 Neuroblastoma in June, the defensive tackle has been immersed in helping her get through surgery and chemotherapy to fight the cancerous growth found in her abdomen. She's feeling good enough to leave a hospital back home in Philadelphia and fly to Cincinnati for a game on Thursday night against the Cleveland Browns at Paul Brown Stadium, where she'll get to watch her father play for the first time. Scroll down for video . Leah Still, 4, is feeling good enough to leave hospital in Philadelphia to fly to Cincinnati for Thursday night's game where she'll get to watch her father Devon play for the Cincinnati Bengals for the first time . Leah is hoping he'll do the robot dance just for her. ‘I got to do something for her,’ the third-year player from Penn State told WCPO. ‘You got to make a play. You can't just be out there dancing for no reason.’ After the first quarter of the game, Leah is expected to be part of a ceremony in which the team presents a check to Cincinnati Children's Hospital for more than $1 million to go toward pediatric cancer research. The team raised money from sales of Still's jersey, No. 75, which sold out, according to the team's website. ‘All the money that's been raised for the cancer research is because of her strength and because she's fighting this disease. So it's definitely going to be an emotional game for me.’ Leah is hoping that her father will do the robot dance just for her on Thursday night. ‘You got to make a play. You can't just be out there dancing for no reason,' he said . The Bengals (5-2-1) helped Still and his daughter by excusing him from offseason activities so he could spend time with her in Philadelphia. They kept him on the practice squad to start the season even though he was hurt so that he'd keep his medical coverage. ‘It's going to be added motivation just knowing my daughter is watching me,’ Still said. ‘I want her to be able to hear how the crowd cheers that loud whenever I make a tackle, so I'm going to go out there and do whatever I can to put a smile on her face.’ It will be a special night for the team, Bengals spokesman Jeff Berding said at a news conference. ""It's a little extra special because we have Leah Still in the house,"" Berding said. ""There's been a tremendous amount of support from the community and across the country to support her and Devon Still and their fight against pediatric cancer."" Fighting: Still posted a video of himself giving Leah a peptalk ahead of major surgery, which then went viral .","Leah Still, 4, is feeling good enough to leave hospital in Philadelphia to fly to Cincinnati for Thursday night's game .

"Italian coastguards returned to port to a hero's welcome on Saturday after they delivered the baby of a desperate African immigrant  following her dramatic rescue from a stricken boat off the coast of Sicily. The crew of the Italian navy frigate, named Euro, were forced into action minutes after dragging the heavily-pregnant mother on board as they rescued an overcrowded dinghy that had run into trouble in rough seas.

Happy news: Despite a lack of sterile hospital conditions, the on-board doctor, with the help of crew members, successfully delivered the baby girl before returning to harbour, where they were greeted with rapturous applause from well-wishers who had gathered to welcome the new arrival . Both mother and daughter - who was named Yambambi Yete - were reported to be doing fine after being taken to hospital in Reggio Calabria for check ups. She was among 600 would-be immigrants rescued from the Mediterranean sea this weekend - a consignment of human misery that included 24 minors and one paraplegic woman. It was a welcome piece of good news for Italy's border control, whose personnel too often face pulling the dead and dying from the Mediterranean sea as more and more refugees attempt to make the perilous crossing from north Africa each year. Technically the new arrival was born on Italian sovereign territory, which may increase the family's chances of being allowed to stay in Europe. 'At 15.23 on Saturday, we had the pride, happiness and joy to witness the birth of little Yambambi Yete, a Gambian national,' said the ship's captain, Cristian Nardone. 'It was a natural birth overseen by our on-board medical officer, Dr. Cesca, and Warrant Nurse Moscato. For them, it was their first experience of this kind, not only aboard a ship.'

"Victim: James Barker, 12, was among the 29 people killed in the 1998 who Omagh bombing . A father whose young son was murdered in the Omagh atrocity will today launch a one-man protest against former IRA commander Martin McGuinness’s presence at a state banquet with the Queen. Victor Barker’s 12-year-old son James was among 29 people who were killed in the 1998 bombing. The Surrey solicitor will stand outside the main gate at Windsor Castle waving a placard which reads, ‘A terrorist in white tie and tails is still a terrorist. Martin McGuinness – it’s time to tell the truth’. Mr Barker said: ‘I was born in Windsor and I thought I’ve got to do something. People need to be reminded of his credentials. ‘There is no place for a terrorist at the Queen’s table.’ Referring to the Real IRA attack on Omagh, Mr Barker added: ‘[McGuinness] knows of things and of people who could give evidence and he will not do so because it breaches their code of omerta. I have nothing against the Irish people. My beef is with the IRA.’ Mr McGuinness, the Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister and Sinn Fein politician, will be among the guests at the state banquet at Windsor Castle. He will also attend other events to mark this week’s official visit to the UK by Irish president Michael Higgins. Mr Barker played a leading role in launching the Omagh families’ campaign, backed by the Daily Mail, to help raise money to bring the terrorists behind the attack to justice. While no one has been convicted over the atrocity in criminal courts, in 2009 four republicans were found liable in the landmark civil case taken by some of the bereaved families and ordered to pay £1.6million compensation. Ambitions: James, a sports fan, had been excited about going to a Belfast prep school on the path to fulfilling his ambition to follow in his father's footsteps and become a lawyer . The Barker family had moved their four children to County Donegal from England a year before the bombing to ‘give them a better quality of life’. Demonstration: Surrey solicitor Victor Barker will stand outside the main gates of Windsor Castle with a placard while Martin McGuinness attends a banquet . James, a sports fan, had been excited about going to a Belfast prep school on the path to fulfilling his ambition to follow in his father’s footsteps and become a lawyer. Wearing a Three Lions football shirt, he was on a coach trip which had visited a theme park before stopping off in the town on a whim to do some shopping. Mr Barker has repeatedly challenged Mr McGuinness and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams to call for witnesses to come forward and help identify the people involved in placing the 500lb car bomb in the middle of Omagh on a busy Saturday shopping day. He said: ‘There is no realistic possibility of a criminal conviction unless someone comes forward. Either they, or people they know, can identify the people involved in Omagh.’ Former MP Mr McGuinness, who refused to take his Commons seat because of the oath of allegiance to the Monarch, snubbed a gala banquet in honour of the Queen during her visit to Ireland in 2011. The idea of an IRA leader dining with the Queen would have been unthinkable a few years ago. But in 2012 – more than 30 years after the Queen’s cousin, Lord Mountbatten, was murdered by the IRA – she agreed to meet Mr McGuinness for the first time and shake hands with him in public during a visit to Belfast.","Victor Barker’s son James was among 29 people killed in atrocity .

"More babies will be conceived tomorrow than any other day this year, according to new research. National birth records show that September 16 is the most popular birthday in the UK. And with the average gestation period for a baby being 40 weeks December 11, exactly 40 weeks prior to September 16, has been labelled as the most fertile day of the year. Planning a baby?

The statistics were compiled by Lovehoney, Britain’s biggest online seller of sex toys, based on established scientific studies. The Christmas party season has a big influence on conception rates . Lovehoney co-founder Neal Slateford said they were expecting a huge boom in sales prior to December 11. He said: 'December is always one of our busiest month as couples treat each other at Christmas. 'Everyone is increasingly doing their Christmas shopping online - who wants to go out to the shops when it is pouring down and there are queues at the check-outs? 'So we are expecting a big surge ahead of December 11, the most fertile and sexiest day of the year, when I guess a lot of broody couples will be staying in and having a good time!'

"Life expectancy in Britain has increased at a slower rate than most of our European neighbours – thanks to our poor record on cancer survival and high levels of obesity. An international report has found that despite the billions of pounds poured into the NHS by Labour, British patients have fared much worse than those across the Channel. Survival rates for breast, bowel and cervical cancer are among the worst in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which represents industrialised nations. Poor record: A women undergoes a breast cancer scan. Britain's low survival rates for some forms of the disease are partly to blame for a slower increase in life expectancy in the UK compared to Europe . Not got to grips with it: The UK's poor performance is also down to our high levels of obesity which lead to many deadly conditions like heart disease . This comes despite the fact that Britain spends more than the average OECD country on health. The organisation’s report found that the average Briton enjoys an extra 9.6 years of life than they did in 1960. But this is far less impressive than the rise of 12 years seen in Italy and Spain. Mark Pearson, head of the social policy unit at the OECD, said: ‘Perhaps the problem is that the UK has been complacent in the past – so convinced that the NHS is the right model, that we stopped looking at whether we are doing well or badly. ‘Now governments have started to focus on why it may be that the UK is doing a poor job on cancer. ‘The UK’s poor performance could also be down to the influence of alcohol and obesity kicking in. The UK simply has not got a handle on these. Cancer care has also been a problem in Britain: the UK performs poorly on cancer survival. ‘The NHS has done all the things we can think of to improve the  situation, and perhaps these things have not yet had an effect.’ Beleaguered in the league: A table showing the UK's performance in relation to life expectancy for women compared with other industrialised countries . The OECD’s report, Healthcare at a Glance, also found: . The study revealed the average Briton can expect to live to 80.4 – 14th in the OECD. This is below most other European countries, and almost two years less than Switzerland on 82.3. No effect: Government campaigns to curb excessive drinking like this one in 2006 have clearly failed as the report says alcohol consumption has soared over the past few decades . The country with the highest life expectancy is Japan (83). British women can expect to live to the age of 82.5 – up 8.8 years in the past 50 years, but lower than any country in Western Europe except Denmark. Men have a life expectancy of 78.3 years – up 10.4 years. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said last night: ‘Labour let down patients by focusing only on narrow targets and not on results. ‘This Government will focus on what really matters – delivering great care and great results for patients.’","Average Brit lives an extra 9.6 years than in 1960, says new report .

'We assume he had probably decided that during the second treatment he would try to sneak a cigarette where he couldn't be seen, as smoking in the hospital was not allowed.'
