"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- Somalia's parliament voted by an overwhelming majority to approve Abdi Farah Shirdon as the country's new prime minister Wednesday. Shirdon, who was the president's nominee, received 215 out of 275 votes. His appointment comes as the nation works to set up an effective central government following two decades of civil war. Shirdon, an economist who ran an import business in neighboring Kenya, was nominated by President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud this month. Shirdon will now form a Cabinet -- the first of its kind in Somalia in more than 20 years. Speaking to parliamentarians at the session, Shirdon said his government will do more to ensure the security of the country and to fight against terrorism and piracy. His appointment is the latest in a series of political transitions. In recent months, Somalia has also adopted a provisional constitution, selected members of parliament and appointed that body's speaker. Read more: Somali lawmakers pick president in landmark vote . The new leaders face the daunting task of propping up Somalia's first effective central government since 1991. Somalia plunged into chaos after dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown 21 years ago. Following his ouster, clan warlords and militants battled for control, sparking a civil war and mayhem nationwide. The nation since then has mostly been under a shaky transitional federal government.

African Union and Somali troops are battling militants from Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked group that controls part of the nation's south. The troops have driven the militants out of various areas, including the lucrative port city of Kismayo and the capital, Mogadishu. Life is slowly returning to normal as coalition forces exert control in more regions. In remarks at the United Nations Tuesday, the special representative of the U.N. secretary-general for Somalia, Augustine Mahiga, hailed the progress made. ""The fall of Kismayo, the last stronghold of the extremist Al-Shabaab insurgents in late September, marked a decisive turning point in the conflict,"" he said. Mahiga said the next challenge will be to maintain security and stability in Kismayo and other areas newly liberated from Al-Shabaab. He called for more international support for AMISOM, the African Union's peacekeeping mission in Somalia, in its efforts to keep Somalia's coastal waters secure. This is necessary for commercial reasons, to interrupt Al-Shabaab's supply lines and to deter piracy, he said. Journalist Omaar Nur and CNN's Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.","Abdi Farah Shirdon receives 215 out of 275 votes from parliament .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" immigration reform bill on Tuesday, sending the measure to the Senate floor for consideration and giving the bill's backers their first major legislative victory. Members of the Democratic-controlled panel voted 13-5 in favor of the measure. If enacted, the plan would constitute the first overhaul of the nation's immigration policy since 1986. ""The dysfunction in our current immigration system affects all of us and it is long past time for reform. I hope that our history, our values, and our decency can inspire us finally to take action,"" Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said. Spectators cramming the committee room applauded and cheered loudly following the vote. The panel's 10 Democrats were joined in supporting the bill by three Republicans: Arizona's Jeff Flake, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, and Utah's Orrin Hatch. Flake and Graham are two of its four Republican authors. Opinion: 'Rogue' DHS unions follow Obama's lead on deportation . Both party leaders in the Senate appeared supportive of the effort, a positive sign for backers hoping to win a solid majority in the full chamber. ""I think the 'Gang of Eight' has made a substantial contribution to moving the issue forward,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. ""I'm hopeful we'll be able to get a bill that we can pass here in the Senate."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, praised the ""masterful"" job of Leahy in navigating roughly 300 proposed amendments and advancing the 844-page bill to the floor. Immigration reform is a priority for both parties in Washington and so far is one example of bipartisanship this year on major legislation in a sharply divided Congress. A key political aim involves Republicans hoping to attract more Hispanics to their side, while Democrats wishing to keep that growing voter bloc squarely in their camp. Latinos voted overwhelmingly for President Barack Obama's re-election. He congratulated the committee on its work and urged the Senate to bring the bill to the floor at its earliest possible opportunity. ""The legislation that passed the Judiciary Committee with a strong bipartisan vote is largely consistent with the principles of commonsense reform I have proposed and meets the challenge of fixing our broken immigration system,"" he said in a statement. ""None of the Committee members got everything they wanted, and neither did I, but in the end, we all owe it to the American people to get the best possible result over the finish line."" The measure approved by the Judiciary panel would create a 13-year path to citizenship for most of the country's 11 million undocumented immigrants. Bipartisan House immigration talks foundering, Republican warns . It aims to strengthen border security while raising the cap on visas for high skilled workers and establishing a new visa program for low skilled workers on America's farms and elsewhere. Proponents say the change is necessary to permanently and fairly resolve the status of undocumented residents. Critics insist the proposed change amounts to amnesty, rewarding those who chose to break the country's immigration laws. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, is leading the charge against the ""Gang of Eight"" proposal and is a tough critic. He has tried to derail the bill at nearly every turn, arguing that adding millions of newly legalized workers to the mix over the next few years will only hurt the most vulnerable segments of the American work force. He also has raised security and other concerns. ""This will be a hammer blow to the wages and employment opportunities of American workersâ€”both immigrant and native born,"" Sessions said in a statement after the vote. ""This bill is bad for workers, bad for taxpayers andâ€”as immigration officers have pleaded for us to hearâ€”a threat to public safety and the rule of law,"" he said. In a defeat for backers of expanded gay rights, the committee did not approve a pair of Leahy-sponsored amendments bolstering federal support for bi-national same-sex relationships. Specifically, Leahy had proposed recognizing same-sex marriages in which one spouse is an American, and allowing U.S. citizens to sponsor foreign-born same-sex partners for green cards given proof of a committed relationship. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the most prominent Republican in the ""Gang of Eight,"" was among those who called Leahy's amendments a poison pill virtually certain to destroy GOP support for the measure. Immigration bill is Democratic plot, House conservative says . Leahy's amendments could be considered again when the bill is taken up by the full Senate. Doing so, however, would be little more than a symbolic gesture, as the proposals have virtually no chance of winning the 60 votes almost certainly needed to clear the 100-member chamber. Earlier this month, Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois, noted the possibility that an upcoming ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court on the federal Defense of Marriage Act could render the whole issue moot. ""The DOMA ruling could change this whole debate,"" Durbin said. ""They could eliminate DOMA and impose obligations on our federal government (relating to) same gender marriage, and that would dramatically change what we're trying to achieve."" The House is working on its own version of immigration reform.","Senate Judiciary Committee passes ""Gang of Eight"" immigration reform bill .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama's embattled pick to be ambassador to Iraq withdrew his nomination Monday, a day before facing an uncertain vote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Brett McGurk came under fire from Republicans and some Democrats for a variety of complaints; most notably for what senators said was poor judgment when he used an official government e-mail account to exchange flirtatious e-mails with a Wall Street Journal reporter while the two were stationed in Baghdad in 2008. The two were later married. In his resignation letter, McGurk said his withdrawal ""is in the best interests of the country"" because ""Iraq urgently needs an ambassador."" McGurk's wife: I've become 'collateral damage' ""The most difficult part of this process,"" McGurk said, ""was watching my wife become a part of it. She is the most precious thing in the world to me, and the depiction of our relationship has been both surreal and devastating. We have also witnessed real sacrifice and suffering in Iraq and know that nothing should be allowed to distract from the pressing work that must be done to build a better future there."" McGurk said he made the decision to withdraw Saturday and, in dramatic language, revealed it came as he was visiting the section in Arlington National Cemetery ""where so many heroes of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars now rest in peace."" National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor issued a statement thanking McGurk for his years of service to the United States. ""He served two administrations, and his commitment to the national interest and to the mission was always clear,"" Vietor said. ""He has proved himself to be a skilled diplomat willing to take on some of the toughest challenges at the toughest times in a difficult region. While we regret to see Brett withdraw his candidacy there is no doubt that he will be called on again to serve the country."" GOP senators oppose choice of nominee for Iraq envoy . It was not clear if the Foreign Relations Committee would have approved McGurk. The committee is made up of 10 Democrats and nine Republicans, and therefore, a single Democrat could have blocked McGurk's nomination if all Republicans voted against him. At least two Democrats -- Ben Cardin of Maryland and Ben Casey of Pennsylvania -- said they had concerns about the nomination. Six Republican members of the committee wrote the president last week urging him to withdraw McGurk's nomination because they said he lacked the management experience to run such a large embassy and because they say he ""botched"" negotiations over the Status of Forces agreement for post-war Iraq. Of the controversial e-mails, the Republicans said: ""The public release of information detailing unprofessional conduct demonstrates poor judgment and will affect the nominee's credibility in the country where he has been nominated to serve."" In the wake of the scandal, McGurk's wife, Gina Chon, resigned her position at the Wall Street Journal. In an e-mail to friends Friday, she said the e-mails she traded with McGurk ""which were exposed just before Brett's confirmation hearing reflected flirtatious banter and nothing more."" ""I feel like I have become collateral damage in this process,"" Chon wrote. ""And, after witnessing all I have, I'm amazed that anyone would want to become a public official. Nominee runs into opposition over racy e-mails .","Some senators said Brett McGurk had used poor judgment .

"(CNN) -- After more than seven hours of deliberations, jurors still haven't decided whether Jodi Arias will live or die. The Arizona jury sent out a note Wednesday morning saying its members couldn't agree. Judge Sherry Stephens told them to try again and ordered them back into the jury room. It was another unexpected turn in the dramatic, high-profile murder trial, which has lasted for months, sparked a media frenzy and drawn spectators who line up for courtroom seats. Earlier this month, the same jurors took less than two hours to decide that Arias was ""exceptionally cruel"" in 2008 when she stabbed ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander 29 times, slit his neck from ear to ear and shot him in the face. They pronounced her guilty of first-degree murder two weeks ago after 15 hours of deliberations. Now, the jury is weighing whether Arias, 32, should get the death penalty. After jurors told Stephens they were stuck on Wednesday, the judge encouraged them to listen to each other, pinpoint areas of agreement and disagreement and ask for further guidance if they need it. It's an approach often described as a ""dynamite charge,"" used by judges to blast open logjams in deliberations and help jurors reach a verdict. It's unclear whether her advice worked. After Stephens ordered them to continue their discussions, jurors deliberated for more than four more hours, then went home for the day. The jury's decision must be unanimous for Arias to be sentenced to death. In the case of a deadlock, a new jury would be chosen for this phase of the trial. A plea for mercy . A path of heartbreak, violence, lies and confessions has led Arias to the Phoenix courtroom where her life is now in a jury's hands. On Tuesday, she pleaded with jurors to spare her. It was a stark reversal from two weeks ago, when she told a journalist she preferred death to life in prison. ""I believe death is the ultimate freedom, so I'd rather just have my freedom as soon as I can get it,"" she told KSAZ shortly after her conviction. But her family implored her to change her mind, she told KSAZ late Tuesday. Now she wants to spare them further heartbreak, she said. ""One of my cousins really drove it home for me and told me how much it would affect them, if I did anything to myself,"" she said. Her mother pleaded with her, she claimed. ""Please don't give up; please don't give up,"" Arias said she told her. Haven't been following the trial? Read this . Well-planned presentation . Her life seemed to pass before her, as she delivered a slideshow presentation -- mostly of family photos -- to the jury on Tuesday. It started off with pictures of her as a toddler wearing pigtails and showed several images from holidays and vacations with family members. She read a prepared statement for nearly 20 minutes, at times crying. Arias told jurors that she had been a victim of abuse as an adult and as a child. She had claimed she killed Alexander in self-defense after he hurt her, something evidence failed to substantiate. She called his murder ""the worst mistake"" she'd ever made, ""the worst thing I've ever done."" She couldn't have imagined herself capable of such a grisly crime, Arias told the jury. ""But I know that I was,"" she said. ""And for that I'm going to be sorry for the rest of my life -- probably longer."" Arias pledged to make herself useful to other prisoners and humanity by performing acts of charity from behind bars, if spared. She told jurors Tuesday that she could teach people to read in prison and pledged to dedicate her life to good causes. She noted she could bring ""people together in a constructive and positive way"" by participating in various programs, including prisoner literacy initiatives; by her ""Survivor"" T-shirts, which would benefit victims of domestic violence; and by donating her hair, so it could be used to make wigs for sick children. She showed the jurors several pieces of her artwork. She told them she would suffer for what she did. ""I'm not going to become a mother because of my own terrible choices,"" she said. ""I won't be at my sister's wedding, when she ties the knot next year."" Attorneys argue life and death . Defense attorney Jennifer Willmott argued Tuesday that Arias' life should be spared. ""We're not talking about whether or not to convict. We're talking about whether or not to kill. And so when we talk about that, it matters that she was 27 years old and she had no criminal history,"" she said. ""It matters that she hadn't done anything wrong in her life before that."" Prosecutor Juan Martinez said pointing to Arias' artwork as evidence that her life should be spared wasn't a valid defense. ""It's an entitlement road that they want you to travel when they talk to you about the fact that she's a good artist,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean anything. All it means is: give her special or preferential treatment."" He argued that jurors should sentence Arias to death. ""You have a duty, and that duty really means that you actually do the honest, right thing, even though it may be difficult,"" he said. If Arias is given a sentence of death, she would be the fourth woman on death row in the state of Arizona. When Alexander died . Arias was living in Yreka, California, when she met Alexander at a business convention in Las Vegas in September 2006. That November, he baptized Arias into the Mormon faith, a ceremony Arias said was followed by anal sex. Arias became his girlfriend two months later, she testified. They broke up in the summer of 2007, and Alexander began dating other women. Alexander's naked body was found crammed in a stand-up shower in June 2008 after he missed two appointments, prompting friends to go to his house. He had been stabbed 29 times in the back and torso and shot in the head. His throat was slit. After her arrest, Arias told an elaborate lie about masked intruders breaking into Alexander's house and killing him before she narrowly escaped. Relatives who spoke with police described her as mentally unstable. HLNTV.com: Friend of Arias tweeting on her behalf .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- More than one-third of all weapons the United States has procured for Afghanistan's government are missing, according to a government report released Thursday. U.S.-issue M249 squad automatic weapons are shown at a camp in Kandahar in December. The U.S. military failed to ""maintain complete inventory records for an estimated 87,000 weapons -- or about 36 percent -- of the 242,000 weapons that the United States procured and shipped to Afghanistan from December 2004 through June 2008,"" a U.S. Government Accountability Office report states. ""Accountability lapses occurred throughout the supply chain,"" it says. The Defense Department spent roughly $120 million during that period to acquire a range of small arms and light weapons for the Afghan National Security Forces, including rifles, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. The military also failed to properly account for an additional 135,000 weapons it obtained for the Afghan forces from 21 other countries. ""What if we had to tell families [of U.S. soldiers] not only why we are in Afghanistan but why their son or daughter died at the hands of an insurgent using a weapon purchased by the United States taxpayers? But that's what we risk if we were to have tens of thousands of weapons we provided washing around Afghanistan, off the books,"" Rep. John Tierney, D-Massachusetts, chairman of the House Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs, said at the start of a congressional hearing on the report. The military is unable to provide serial numbers for 46,000 of the missing 87,000 weapons, the report concludes. No records have been maintained for the location or disposition for the other 41,000 weapons. The report urges Defense Secretary Robert Gates to ""establish clear accountability procedures for weapons while they are in the control and custody of the United States"" and direct those ""involved in providing these weapons to track (them) by serial number and conduct routine physical inventories."" The GAO review comes as numerous senior officials -- including President Obama -- are expressing serious concern over the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan. On Wednesday, eight Taliban suicide attackers struck Afghan government buildings and a prison in Kabul, killing at least 19 people in a coordinated attack that the Taliban said was in retaliation for the mistreatment of prisoners, according to Afghan officials. The attacks raised new questions over the effectiveness of the ongoing $16.5 billion U.S. effort to train and equip Afghan security forces. Officials from the State and Defense departments intend to request an additional $5.7 billion in assistance for the Afghan army and police in fiscal year 2009, according to the report. The Obama administration is conducting a top-to-bottom review of U.S. policy toward both Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan. The president will likely make a decision on sending additional troops to Afghanistan ""in the course of the next few days,"" Gates said Tuesday.","87,000 U.S. weapons bought for Afghan government unaccounted for, report says .

"(CNN) -- Things are looking horrible for President Barack Obama. There's the Obamacare website fiasco. Ongoing allegations of National Security Agency spying on European leaders. There was the government shutdown that damaged the economy on his watch. And a new poll released this week finds Obama with his lowest approval rating -- and his highest disapproval rating -- ever. If this were a movie, we would be at the part where the hero finds himself surrounded. He has no escape routes and he's outgunned. What will happen next: Will our hero prevail like John McClane in ""Die Hard,"" or will he fail like William Wallace in ""Braveheart""? Well, the good news for Obama is that the script for the final scenes of his presidency has not been written yet. The bad news is that he may not be the one writing it. Simply put: Obama is not the protagonist driving his own story. Rather, his storyline is being dictated by others. No question, he has long had trouble controlling the narrative, with a GOP bent on denying him, basically, everything he wants. But now he's heading toward the end of his final term -- and the clock is ticking on his agenda. Obama's main antagonist, of course, is the hyper-partisan Congress that refuses to agree on the most basic issues, such as raising the debt ceiling, which Congress has done more than 40 times since 1980. And unless something changes, it's looking bad for immigration reform, universal background checks for gun purchases, income tax reform or any of the other proposals he outlined in his State of the Union nine months ago. Perhaps the worst thing about the problems with the Obamacare website is that they occurred at a time when things were finally looking politically brighter for Obama. Though the government shutdown had been an unwelcome setback, polls showed after it ended that Americans blamed the Republicans in Congress for it much more than they blamed him. It looked as if Obama had righted his ship and would be able to refocus Americans on his priorities. It was as if Obama had become George Clooney as the captain of the fishing boat in ""The Perfect Storm."" The rain has stopped, the ocean is turning calm and there is even a glimmer of sunlight; he's beaten the storm. But then moments later, the sky darkens and there is a deluge of rain. The choppy waters (in this case, the Obamacare website debacle) soon consume the ship. Is this Obama's metaphoric fate? He can accept another plotline -- let's say of ""Gravity,"" with Obama as a character like Sandra Bullock's, hit with one harrowing challenge after another. This may be exciting to watch, but not great for the character, who has no idea what will happen next. I'd recommend a different story line. I'd use the ending of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" as inspiration and metaphorically go out with guns blazing. Why not set some lofty goals that will frame the agenda anew going forward? First, Obama should announce that retaking control of the House in 2014 is a top priority. Yes, many districts have been gerrymandered to all but ensure re-election for Republican House members. But he should take the fight to his adversaries anyway. Unseating some tea party House members has become newly possible after the shutdown mess. Their approval ratings are just below toe fungus. Can the President maneuver through this new landscape and turn it to his advantage? Even getting more moderate Republicans into the House could be a step toward sanity. (Sometimes you have to improvise to make a story line work.) Obama should also use executive orders to the extent legally possible to attain his policy objectives. He did this very thing in 2011 when he ordered that many children of parents illegally in the United States would no longer be deported. Sure, the Republicans will push back -- they will say Obama is behaving like a ""king"" or ""tyrant"" and complain about him nightly on Fox News. But the upside is that the debate will be about the issues the President has chosen. It's denouement time for Obama as we enter the final act of his presidency. Will the President's agenda continue to be dictated by others, making him nothing more than a lame duck, caretaker President? Or will he use every means at his discretion to write his own story? Obama is the star of this movie. The only question is: How is it going to end? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Obama in a tough stretch, facing policy debacles, low poll numbers .

"(CNN) -- Police are searching for a teen they say shot and killed someone in a Seattle-area bar where Seahawks players and other celebrities were partying. The shooting occurred early Monday morning just a few hours after the Seattle Seahawks won their way into the NFL playoffs with a victory over the San Francisco 49ers. Several players and other celebrities were among hundreds of people gathered at Munchbar, a popular nightspot in Bellevue, Washington. Another person was wounded in the shooting. No players were injured in the incident, which occurred just after 1 a.m. PT Monday. Bellevue Police said Tuesday they were still searching for 19-year-old Ja'mari Alexander Alan Jones and had secured an arrest warrant for the teen. Jones is ""a suspect in the murder of a 30-year-old man early this morning at the Munchbar in downtown Bellevue,"" Bellevue Police said in a statement. ""Jones is believed to be armed and dangerous."" Jones was one of three teens arrested in 2008 for the beating death of Ed Michael, who is better known by his nickname ""Tuba Man,"" CNN affiliate KOMO reported. The teen was sentenced to less than a year in juvenile detention for a first-degree manslaughter charge in the death of the popular musician who played his tuba outside Seattle venues, the affiliate reported. The shooting in the bar Monday sent the large crowd of about 600 people scrambling. Seahawks defensive end Greg Scruggs tweeted ""I'm OK"" and ""Everybody else is good too! .. Ignorance at its best right there"" after the shooting. CNN affiliate KING reported that the players were in a VIP lounge and were escorted to a safe place after the incident. The station also reported that Aubrey O'Day, who has appeared in several TV reality shows, tweeted that everyone in the players' group hit the floor when the gunfire erupted. In other tweets, she described how she saw a body and how people had to crawl out through the kitchen. ""I saw the guy laying on the floor and blood everywhere... Wasnt sure of his status,"" she said. CNN's Chandler Friedman contributed to this story.","Suspect is 19, police say .

"Washington (CNN) -- They are the numbers we've all been waiting for and House Republicans have unsuccessfully tried to get out of the Obama administration. This week, the Department of Health and Human Services will reveal how many people purchased policies on the federal Obamacare exchange website. Technical failures have plagued HealthCare.gov since its October 1 launch, although officials say it's slowly getting better. White House spokesman Jay Carney says enrollment numbers ""will be lower than we hoped and we anticipated."" Democrats losing patience with Obamacare . Just how low and what effect all of those online roadblocks had on enrollment remain to be seen. But what will the numbers mean about the health of Obamacare? Q: How many people need to enroll? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that 24 million people will purchase insurance through an exchange by 2023, but just seven million will enroll during the initial sign-up window ending March 31. CBO's estimate includes customers on both state-based and federally run insurance exchanges, but not individuals who enroll in Medicaid. If that number is spread evenly over the course of the open enrollment period, 1.16 million people would need to purchase insurance each month in order for the administration to be on pace to reach the seven million figure in six months. But officials both in and out of government are quick to point out that enrollment is unlikely to occur at an even pace. Pro-Obamacare group raises $27 million for outreach . To make that case, President Barack Obama recently traveled to Massachusetts where then-Gov. Mitt Romney enacted similar health care reforms in 2006. ""Enrollment was extremely slow, within a month only about a hundred people had signed up,"" the President told a crowd in Boston in late October, recounting data from the state's first open-enrollment period. ""But then, 2,000 had signed up, and then a few more thousand after that. And by the end of the year, 36,000 people had signed up."" On CNN the day after the President's trip, MIT economist Jon Gruber, a former health care adviser to both Romney and Obama, argued that the first month's numbers aren't that useful in estimating the pace of enrollment. ""The key deadline here is March 31, that's when people have to have insurance to avoid the individual mandate,"" Gruber said of the deadline for avoiding a financial penalty for not having any health coverage. ""That's still months away."" A consumer behavior expert said the slow pace of enrollment early could be attributed to buying habits. Michael McCall, consumer psychology professor at Ithaca College, compared it to paying rent or a mortgage when it's due, rather than before a bill is received. Until payment is submitted, the door remains open to back out or make changes. ""Once I pay, I've kind of made that commitment,"" McCall added. Arguably more important than the overall enrollment number is the diversity of the new customer pool. The administration is working to ensure that 40% of those on the new exchanges are relatively healthy between 18 and 35. ""Part of the challenge is to make sure that the exchanges are able to attract a broad cross section of people, sick people and healthier young people so that the coverage is affordable,"" said Drew Altman, president and CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation. An unbalanced insurance pool could cause insurers to increase monthly premiums or pull out of the exchanges altogether in future years. Clinton: Obama should honor commitments on keeping health plans . What about Medicaid enrollees? Customers whose income falls below a certain threshold are automatically referred to their state's Medicaid program. The Affordable Care Act offers subsidies to states to increase Medicaid qualification to 138% of the federal poverty level, and 25 states and the District of Columbia have taken up the federal offer so far. If your state has opted to expand Medicaid, you'll likely be referred to your state's welfare agency if you make less than $15,800 and are seeking coverage as an individual, or $32,500 if you're seeking it for a family of four. The CBO estimates that nine million people will enroll in Medicaid and its partner initiative for children, the Children's Health Insurance Program, by 2014. According to this estimate, that number will increase to 13 million by 2023. Media report: Fewer than 50,000 signed up for Obamacare . What if my state didn't expand Medicaid? The authors of the ACA intended Medicaid expansion to be mandatory, but a Supreme Court decision in 2010 ruled the federal government couldn't require expansion of a state-run program. This decision led 25 states to opt out. If you make less than the federal poverty level, you will be referred to your state Medicaid agency to see if you qualify for benefits under the current law, regardless of whether your state has expanded Medicaid or not. According to a study by the Kaiser Foundation, only four states that didn't expand Medicaid offer benefits to parents with incomes up to the federal poverty level, and only Wisconsin offers benefits to adults without children. If your state chose not to expand its Medicaid program, you can still purchase insurance on the exchange, but you might not qualify for a premium subsidy. Federal subsidies kick in for those with income above 100% of the federal poverty level. Due to the Supreme Court decision and the structure of the law, a large group of low-income Americans won't qualify for Medicaid in their state, but will earn less than the federal poverty level, meaning they won't qualify for any federal subsidies. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, roughly five million people will fall into this Medicaid coverage gap. What does ""enroll"" mean, anyway? Regardless of whether you're signing up on HealthCare.gov or one of the state-run exchanges, there are several steps in the enrollment process. You must first create an account and enter in some personal information, including your Social Security number and an estimate of your annual income. This information is then verified through the federal data hub with various government agencies, such as the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service. Then you'll either be presented with the plans available in your coverage area and an estimate for what those plans will cost after any federal subsidy is factored in, or you'll be told you qualify for Medicaid and referred to your state's Medicaid agency. If you're eligible to purchase a plan on the exchange, you can compare the plans available to find one that best fits your budget and coverage needs. Many insurance companies and state-based exchanges don't classify customers as officially enrolled until they've paid their first premium. Others will count people as enrolled once they've selected a plan. A spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services confirmed Tuesday that the numbers the government plans to announce will reveal how many consumers have completed an application and selected a plan, not necessarily how many have paid. Consumers have until December 15 to pay if they want coverage beginning on January 1, or until March 31 if they simply want to avoid paying the penalty for not having insurance.

"London (CNN) -- The jazz record was only three minutes long, but it was enough time to cast a spell on a wealthy European heiress who became determined to meet the artist behind the beautiful ballad with the haunting overtones. That record was ""Round Midnight,"" by a relatively unknown jazz pianist Thelonious Monk and hearing it would herald the start of a life-long friendship between him and heiress Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter. Born into the hugely wealthy Rothschild banking dynasty and married to a French diplomat, the baroness, known as Nica, gave up a world of privilege for the love of jazz and devoted herself to Monk, who was considered one of America's great musical geniuses. She later became known as ""the Jazz Baroness""—and could be spotted mingling with music legends of the bebop era, such as Charlie Parker, Art Blakey and Miles Davis. To explore Nica's elusive past, Hannah Rothschild tells her great aunt's mysterious life story in her book, ""The Baroness: The Search for Nica, the rebellious Rothschild"". Nica was first touched by jazz in 1948 while on a trip to New York. Just before catching a flight to join her family, she stopped to visit a friend, the jazz musician Teddy Wilson who put on ""Round Midnight."" WATCH: YouTube video of Thelonius Monk performing ""Round Midnight"" After hearing that record, the baroness' life changed forever, recalls Rothschild. ""It was like the vinyl version of a spell being cast."" ""It quite literally spirited her from one world to another and she never went home. That was it. She missed every single plane, stayed in New York, determined to meet this man Thelonious Monk."" In that very moment, she left her husband and five children behind and devoted herself to meeting the legendary musician. Armed with a mile long cigarette holder, a fur coat and a set of pearls, Nica could be found swaying to the blues in the big apple's jazz clubs or ferrying bands to performances in her convertible Bentley. But Nica didn't find herself in the presence of Monk until some years later at the 'Salon du Jazz 1954' concert in Paris. She was introduced to Monk backstage by a mutual friend - pianist Mary Lou Williams -- ""and once they met they were inseparable"", notes Rothschild. Though Monk was married, the relationship between the Baroness and him remained platonic, according to Rothschild's research. ""I believe what kept them together was their love of music, particularly his music might I add. A real sense of companionship and friendship."" Part of Nica's passion for jazz could be traced back to her experience during World War II. With Jewish relatives disappearing in the Holocaust, she played an active role in the war and even fought in the battlefields of Africa for Charles De Gaulle's Free French Army in Congo. After serving in numerous capacities, she ended the war as a decorated lieutenant. ""She had a very interesting war and when she came back it was impossible for her to settle down to a life of normalcy and domesticity,"" explains Rothschild. While Nica never took up composing or playing music herself, she remained a friend and philanthropist to the genre. As a result, she was a source of material for a dozen songs composed by jazz greats. Songs included Sonny Clark's ""Nica"", Kenny Dorham's ""Tonica"", Tommy Flanagan's ""Thelonica""—to name a few. The baroness remained close friends with Monk, funding his performances and even went to jail for him. The incident happened in 1958 when police stopped the pair en route to an out-of-town gig and found a small amount of Monk's marijuana in her car. Nica claimed it was hers and she was sentenced to three years in prison. After a two-year legal battle funded by the Rothschild's, the case was dismissed on a technicality in the appeal court. In Monk's last years, he suffered from mental health problems and withdrew from playing jazz altogether by secluding himself in Nica's New Jersey home. But at his funeral—Monk died in 1982, from a stroke, both his wife Nellie and Nica were greeted by mourners as widows. Six years after Monk's death, Nica passed away, aged 74, after undergoing a heart valve operation. Though Rothschild only met her great aunt a handful of times on her visits to New York, she was devastated by the loss. ""I went into a silent mourning of not having spent more time with her and not having asked those questions,"" recalls Rothschild. ""It occurred to me one day that just because somebody has died or passed on, it doesn't mean that your relationship with them is completely over."" And each time Rothschild listens to that infamous Monk record, she wonders, ""Maybe this time it'll change my life and I'll leave my children and my country and my friends—but it hasn't happened yet.""","British Baroness of Rothschild family abandoned her family for New York jazz scene .

"(CNN) -- Arizona's attorney general proposed arming one principal or employee at each school to defend against attacks such as the recent Connecticut school massacre. ""The ideal solution would be to have an armed police officer in each school,"" Attorney General Tom Horne said in a news release Wednesday. But budget cuts have limited the number of Arizona schools with ""school resource officers"" on campus, he said. The ""next best solution,"" Horne said, ""is to have one person in the school trained to handle firearms, to handle emergency situations, and possessing a firearm in a secure location."" A shooter, armed with a semiautomatic rifle and two other guns, on December 14 killed 26 people -- including six faculty members and 20 young students -- at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown. Horne compared the plan to the FAA's program adopted after the September 11, 2001, attacks to arm airline pilots. A school would be invited to send the principal ""or another designee"" to ""training in the use of firearms and how to handle emergencies such as that which occurred in Newtown,"" Horne's release said. Horne's office would oversee the free training with help from sheriffs, he said. ""The designated individual (no more than one per school) would then be authorized to keep a firearm locked in a secure place, and would have adequate communication to be alerted to an emergency in any part of the school,"" the release said. Newspaper publishes names, addresses of gun permit holders . Several Arizona sheriffs have joined in to support the proposal, Horne said. Legislation to allow it will be introduced by the Republican leader in the state House, he said. ""This proposal presents a golden mean between two extremes,"" Horne said. ""One extreme is to allow all teachers to bring guns to school, which could create more dangers than it prevents. The other extreme is to do nothing, which everyone will regret if a preventable incident like Newtown would occur in the future."" CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","Arming principals is ""next best solution"" to police in schools, Attorney General Tom Horne says .

"(CNN) -- A sniper who ambushed volunteer firefighters in upstate New York on Monday, killing two and seriously wounding two others, left a note saying he hoped to burn down his neighborhood and kill as many people as possible, police said Tuesday. A charred body, believed to be his sister's, was found in the burned house she shared with him Tuesday, police said. William Spengler, 62, used a Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle, the same kind of weapon used in the assault on Sandy Hook Elementary School, Webster Police Chief Gerald Pickering said. ""He was equipped to go to war,"" Chief Pickering said. The shooter, who was convicted of killing his grandmother decades ago, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound hours later. Read more: N.Y. man who shot dead 2 firefighters killed grandmother in 1980 . Pickering, at a news conference Tuesday, read a sentence from the three-page typewritten note that detectives believe Spengler left behind: ""I still have to get ready to see how much of the neighborhood I can burn down and do what I like doing best -- killing people."" The note indicated Spengler's intentions, but not his motive, Pickering said. The rest of the contents will not be made public because it is evidence in a criminal investigation, he said. There is ""all kinds of speculation"" about why he wanted to destroy his neighborhood and kill firefighters and residents, Pickering said. One theory is that he was upset about a donation his mother, who died in the past year, made to the fire department, he said. Another theory is there could be a connection to his arrest in the killing of his grandmother, he said. ""Motive is always the burning question, and I'm not sure we'll ever really know what was going through his mind,"" Pickering said. Spengler was convicted in 1981 of first-degree manslaughter in the death of his grandmother and had been released on supervised parole, Pickering said. It will be a challenge for the medical examiner to determine if William Spengler's sister -- 67-year-old Cheryl Spengler -- was killed before the fire was set, because it was a ""raging inferno,"" Pickering said. A former neighbor, Roger Vercruysse, said that Spengler was a nice guy who used to come over to Vercruysse's sister's house for holiday parties and would wave to the family from his front porch, where he often sat during the summer. ""He'd come to our house, we used to have picnics,"" he said. Spengler was especially attentive to his mother, who passed away in October, Vercruysse said, visiting her every day in the nursing home where she lived until she died. ""He loved his mama,"" Vercruysse said. ""He always talked about his mother."" Spengler did not share the same closeness with his sister, with whom he shared his home, Vercruysse said. ""He told me he hated his sister and never could tell me why,"" he said. ""I'd always wave to the sister, but she was not friendly."" Firefighters from the Rochester-area town of Webster responded before 6 a.m. Monday to a 911 call, reporting a fire that Spengler is believed to have set, when the gunfire began, Pickering said. ""This was a clear ambush on first responders,"" he said. Spengler was firing from ""a natural depression"" against a bank and a tree, he said. An off-duty police officer, who happened on the scene, returned gunfire and sheltered firefighters with his car, Pickering said. ""Had the police officer not been there, more people would have been killed because he immediately engaged the shooter with a rifle,"" he said. ""Essentially, it was a combat condition."" Investigators won't know until after an autopsy if any of his shots hit Spengler, he said. Officer John Ritter of the Greece, New York, Police Department, suffered minor shrapnel wounds but was released after treatment at a hospital. The two wounded firefighters were in stable condition after surgery Tuesday, Pickering said Tuesday morning. They were being treated for ""serious injuries"" in intensive care at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New York, he said. Seven houses were destroyed and several others damaged by the fire, which investigators believe spread from a car parked next to the home where they believe Spengler lived, Pickering said. Authorities do not know how Spengler obtained the Bushmaster rifle, .38-caliber revolver and 12-gauge shotgun he used, Pickering said. As a convicted felon, Spengler was not allowed to legally possess weapons. In chilling audio heard over a scanner Monday, a West Webster Fire Department firefighter reported ""multiple firemen shot"" -- including himself, with wounds to his lower back and lower leg -- and ""shots still being fired."" ""I'm pretty sure that we have two DOAs"" -- the term for dead on arrival -- ""on the street,"" the wounded firefighter said. ""... They're down and not good."" For several hours after that, the threat of gunfire stopped firefighters from battling the blaze and forced police SWAT teams to evacuate 33 people in the neighborhood of small waterfront homes. The fire destroyed seven houses. It was under control by 2:30 p.m. ET, but authorities weren't able to get into any of the homes. Pickering said it's possible that more victims could be inside. Lt. Michael Chiapperini, a firefighter who died at the scene, was a veteran of the West Webster Fire Department and a police lieutenant. He'd been named Firefighter of the Year just two weeks ago. And not long before that, he had volunteered to go to Long Island to help those suffering after Superstorm Sandy, New York Lt. Gov. Bob Duffy said. The other slain firefighter was Tomasz Kaczowka, who was also a 911 dispatcher. He'd been with the West Webster Fire Department for just more than a year, department spokesman Al Sienkiewicz said. The shooting occurred amid a renewed gun control debate after the December 14 elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 26 people, most of them children. The gunman in that case, Adam Lanza, also killed his mother and himself. The head of a lobbying group that represents first responders said the Monday shooting was ""senseless and cruel."" ""The firefighters who responded today were performing a selfless, meaningful service to their community, unaware that a cold-hearted maniac was planning to ambush them and take their lives,"" said Harold Schaitberger, general president of the Washington-based International Association of Fire Fighters. ""Coming on the heels of the horrific tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, and on Christmas Eve, this shooting is even harder to comprehend."" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo described the Webster shooting as ""horrific."" And the state's attorney general called it a ""senseless tragedy"" President Barack Obama has set a January deadline for ""concrete proposals"" to deal with gun violence after the Newtown shooting. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, has said she will introduce legislation to reinstate the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, while National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre has said his group will fight any new gun restrictions, saying most gun laws now on the books are rarely enforced. Pickering, the Webster police chief, said it was important -- after the shooting in his town and others -- to ""get a handle on gun control."" He also said more needs to be done to make sure that dangerous people aren't in society, where they can kill. ""For the last 20 years, we have been turning people loose and de-institutionalizing people, and I think we've swung too far,"" he said. ""I think there are still people that need to be in institutions that are a danger to themselves or others. And this is a classic example."" CNN's Brittany Brady, Chuck Johnston, Jake Carpenter and John Fricke contributed to this report.","NEW: A charred body believed to be the shooter's sister's was found in her burned house .

"(CNN) -- Virgin America topped the latest airline satisfaction rankings from Consumer Reports, the first time the 6-year-old airline has appeared on the list. The airline was lauded for its seating, in-flight entertainment and baggage handling, even though it charges $25 for the first and second checked bags.

"(CNN) -- Zoe Smith's petite frame should fool nobody -- she's a weightlifting warrior. If the 19-year-old isn't employing her immense physical strength to lift more than 120 kilograms -- easily double her own weight -- she's smiting Twitter trolls who are foolish enough to take her on. ""I suppose there is the stereotype that women who lift weights are butch,"" she told CNN's Human to Hero series about the online attacks she has faced. ""Or my favorite one is lesbians, which is a ridiculous kind of thing to say because I don't understand how lifting weights could make you a lesbian. But anyway, it's not me who thinks these things."" Smith may stand at just five foot three inches tall but tenacity courses through her veins, evident by a debut performance at the London Olympics that cemented her status as Great Britain's preeminent weightlifter. She equated the noise that greeted her British record lift of 121 kg in the 58 kg category to the tumult that was lavished upon one of her favorite bands, Muse, at one of their Wembley Stadium gigs. And though that cacophony saluted her strength, mental fortitude has been just as valuable in her battle to convince people that lifting weights was her destiny -- even her mum and dad. ""At first everybody was like 'What are you doing?' when I told them I had started weightlifting, even my parents actually,"" she said. ""It wasn't the fact that they thought it was like a 'boy's sport,' it was the fact they were paying for me to do gymnastics and I was spending all my time in the weights gym! So they weren't best pleased. But then I think my dad came in first and saw me lifting. ""I think I was only doing high pulls, so from the floor to about (shoulder height) on about 60 kilos and just being curious about it I think my dad picked it up when no-one was looking and his face went white as a sheet. ""He wasn't quite himself the whole way home and I overheard him say to my Mum, 'I've just seen what she's lifting!' "" If her dad was shocked then, he'll surely be flabbergasted by now. Smith has gone to conquer a multitude of British records since taking up the sport, in her two chosen disciplines: the snatch and the clean and jerk. In 2010, at 16, she became the first Englishwoman to win a medal at the Commonwealth Games, taking home the bronze, and added silver at the World Youth Games the following year before hitting the big stage at London 2012. Her experience in India for the Commonwealths gives an indication of the dedication her sport requires. ""I think I had, in the past couple of days prior to that, just an egg and a glass of water -- this is the extreme measures we have to go to in order to cut weight for our category,"" she said. ""It was boiling hot and I felt I was going to die. But had I been on form I probably could have won. Bronze wasn't bad, I'm hoping to go back next year (in Glasgow, Scotland) and get the gold."" Smith had always set her heart on appearing in the Olympics, but by the time she was 12, she'd grown to realize it wouldn't be in the field of gymnastics -- her first love. Her coach planted a seed that she might have a far better chance of making it to the Olympics if she swapped the high bars for the dumbbells. And despite the switch perplexing her family and friends at first, the idea stuck. ""I was powerful but not very graceful so I would never have made it as a gymnast,"" Smith said. ""I was always good at tumbling and stuff but I could never get to grips with beam bars -- I was terrified of stuff like that. ""They needed a girl for the weightlifting club to take part in a competition to make up a full team so I gave it a go and I took to it quite quickly."" Junior British records had been tumbling throughout her teens but it was the limelight of London 2012 that thrust her into the public consciousness. Though not yet 20, Smith radiates the twin characteristics that delight British sports fans --- a mixture of bulldog and underdog. Tenacious, driven, plucky and resilient, her makeup formed a potent cocktail that legions of followers in in the UK found irresistible. But as is often the case with high-profile sporting stars, her achievements at the Games drew sniping in some quarters on social media sites. If they hadn't realized while watching her delight the partisan home crowd, the trolls soon found out that Smith is not one to take a backwards step. ""Doing a sport like this I think you're going to get a bit of stick but I'm quite good at handling that kind of thing,"" she said. ""I'm really competitive and I like to win arguments. I never let things slide so I just have to take them up on it and say 'Well, why am I a lesbian? Why am I butch?' All this kind of stuff. ""They never have a real answer for it so until someone proves that it's going to change me or the way I am, I am going to keep doing it."" Respected and admired for her display at the Games, finishing 12th in the overall competition, she was also lauded for the head-on way she tackled her detractors. And her profile was such that many people have been in touch to ask how they can get into the sport. So how does she look back on the experience of competing in her hometown Olympics? ""It was crazy,"" she said. ""I still can't really put into words how I feel about it. Again I think I was really nervous, I didn't have the best competition. ""I got the British record in clean and jerk which was good. And I just really enjoyed competing in front of a home crowd. ""It was terrifying and nerve-racking; I think I experienced every emotion available to mankind. It was a once in a lifetime experience and I would do it all again if I could."" That is a distinct possibility if her progress continues to climb. And Smith says she'll be better prepared to deal with the size of the occasion when thrust into the cauldron of Olympic competition again. ""In the future I think I'm going to have to use that as a learning curve,"" she adds. ""Take what I did wrong from that experience, maybe be better prepared, and don't put myself through hell a couple of days before. ""I've got the experience of competing on a major stage under my belt now; I can't really use nerves as an excuse anymore. ""I've been there and done it, it's not going to be such a fear of the unknown. It'll be, 'I've been here before, I know what I'm doing, I know what to do.'

"(CNN) -- Rioting has broken out for the past three nights in Sweden's capital, Stockholm, with scores of cars set alight and violent clashes between police and youths. The shooting death of a man by police is blamed for the demonstrations. More than 100 vehicles were set on fire Sunday night just in the northern suburb of Husby, Stockholm police press officer Kjell Lindgren told CNN on Wednesday. Another 29 were set on fire Tuesday night in the wider district, he said. Eight people were arrested in Husby Tuesday night, which was quieter than the previous two nights, he said. Husby is an area that has a lot of problems and a high crime rate, according to Lindgren. The Swedish version of The Local, an English-language online newspaper, quoted a local youth leader as saying some police officers used racial slurs against residents Sunday as the trouble flared. Tensions have been brewing since May 14, when police shot dead a 69-year-old Husby man who had a machete, the newspaper said. The disorder led Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt to issue a statement Tuesday appealing for calm. ""We have had two nights of great worry, damage to property and a threatening mood in Husby. There is a risk that it will continue. Now everyone must help out to calm things down,"" he said. ""We have groups of young men who believe one should and can change our society through violence. We cannot let violence govern."" Police officers are there to maintain order according to laws that apply to everyone and to keep residents safe, Reinfeldt said. ""We should not make the use of violence a part of freedom of expression,"" he added. Reinfeldt said the trouble reflects a broader problem in Swedish society; more should be done to support education and help young people into work, he said. Sweden is generally regarded as having a history of successful integration of various immigrant groups.","Three nights of rioting involves youths and police in Sweden's capital, Stockholm .

"(CNN) -- Foster the People has done what many bands strive to do: make commercial indie-sounding pop, which is kind of an oxymoron, like ""jumbo shrimp"" or ""daily special."" ""We've grown up on the Beach Boys and the Beatles and Blur and Bowie and the Clash. Also E.L.O. and Hall and Oates,"" said the trio's frontman, Mark Foster. ""Those are all artists who write songs that are accessible but still left of center. It's intelligent pop. There's still something different and complex about it. That's our favorite type of music to make."" Foster's old day job as a jingle writer proved to be great training ground for creating punchy hooks. The Los Angeles-based group is now up for a pair of Grammys: Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group for their smash single ""Pumped Up Kicks"" and Best Alternative Album for their debut CD, ""Torches."" On the evening CNN interviewed Foster the People backstage at L.A.'s Wiltern Theater, the guest list was an inconceivable mix of Taylor Swift, a couple of kids from ""Glee"" and Jerry Cantrell from Alice in Chains. While the other guys looked forward to seeing Swift at their show, Foster seemed more impressed by Cantrell. ""When I was a kid and started playing the guitar, that's who I listened to, and I learned how to play the guitar because of that guy. So it's crazy that he's coming,"" he said, shaking his head. ""But you never know who's going to be here, especially when you play L.A. Gene Simmons (of KISS) was at our last show, which was pretty crazy."" But counting a couple of hard rock icons as fans isn't as random as one might think. Lurking beneath the shiny bubble-gum surface of Foster the People lies a dark theme or two -- particularly in ""Pumped Up Kicks,"" in which a teen shooter tells potential victims they'd ""better run, better run, faster than my bullet."" Other songs seem to be an internal running dialogue in Foster's head. The band's current single, ""Don't Stop (Color on the Walls),"" is a pep talk to push creative boundaries and seize the moment. Foster, bassist Cubbie Fink and drummer Mark Pontius recently spoke with CNN about what this moment in time is like for Foster the People. CNN: You guys got together as a band in 2009. It's been a fast ride. Mark Foster: I think it's funny, because we've all worked towards a career in music for a long time. For so many years, it was slow, playing in front of rooms full of 10 people and trying to get your friends to come -- begging your friends to come -- telling them you'll pay for their parking. Just whatever you could do to get them in there. And then all of a sudden, it kind of took off. It's been a fast incline, so we've had to just work really hard, keep our heads down and just stay grounded. At the same time, we've had a lot of fun during the process. CNN: I hear Bono is a fan. Foster: Yeah, the last time we played in Dublin, we ended up at Bono's house and had dinner with him and got to hang out with him for a few hours. We just talked about music and art and poetry and just all the things that you maybe expect Bono to talk about. We walked away and were really inspired. Cubbie Fink: I missed the Bono experience. It was on our day off in Ireland, and I just turned my phone off and kind of relaxed. I ended up turning it on in the afternoon and seeing 25 missed calls and a hundred texts saying, ""Hey, we're going to the BBQ. Come with us."" I missed it. Foster: But you did get to watch a rugby game, didn't you. Fink: Soccer. CNN: Are you critical when you hear your songs on the radio? Foster: I think now I just kind of turn the station off when the stuff comes on. I was hanging out with a girl in New York, and we were in a cab, and ""Pumped Up Kicks"" came on, and she told the cab driver, ""Hey, can you turn this rubbish off?!"" It's like, ""Thank you. She's reading my mind."" CNN: On the surface, your songs sound pretty happy-go-lucky. But some of them are pretty dark, like ""Pumped Up Kicks,"" which is about a teenager with a gun. Foster: I like to write about real-life topics, and I like to write about different walks of life. For me, that song was really an observation about something that's happening in the youth culture these days. I guess I wanted to reveal that internal dialogue of a kid who doesn't have anywhere to turn, and I think the song has kind of done its job. I think people are talking about it, and it's become a point of conversation, which I think is a really healthy thing. CNN: Did you feel like outsiders in high school? Foster: I experienced bullying a lot. I was an only child, and I was kind of a small kid with a big mouth, and so I always got myself in trouble. So I grew up kind of having to scrap. And I grew up in Cleveland. It's pretty blue collar, and kids know how to fight there, so that was a real thing, for sure. Fink: The whole youth violence thing hit pretty close to me. My cousin was part of the ordeal at Columbine. She was actually in the library when everything went down, so I actually flew out to be with her the day after it happened and experienced the trauma surrounding it and saw how affected she was by it. She is as close as a sister, so obviously, it affected me deeply. So to be able to have a song to create a platform to talk about this stuff has been good for us. CNN: What's inspiring you guys these days? Foster: I've been thinking a lot about the political state of where we're at right now. There's a lot I'm not happy about and would love to talk more about it. I think that musicians have a voice that is sometimes louder than anyone else's voice, in a sense. Also, doing charity work and humanitarian work is something that we've been really into on this last tour. We've teamed up with the Do Good Bus, which followed us around. We've done something with local charities in every city that we've stopped in, so I think going into the (next) record, we'll see where things are at. But we're also a new band, and we don't want to get too bleeding heart too early. I think you have to keep it about the music for a while before you start preaching too much. CNN: What do you have up your sleeve for Foster the People's second record? Foster: We're going to try to continue to push the envelope. A lot of what we've learned touring this year is that the percussion element of what we do live is something that we'd love to bring into the studio and do more of on our second record. And just pushing the envelope with the electronic music and also working on some classic songwriting, which we haven't really put our much of yet. I like classic soul, so we'll see. It's going to be interesting. CNN: Before Foster the People took off, you all had some odd jobs. Mark Pontius: We were delivery boys at one point, funny enough, delivering coffee and cheese to Larry King sometimes just down the street. We all had weird, odd jobs, and living in L.A., struggling to be a musician is tough sometimes, and you just want to give up. But you gotta stick to it. Foster: At the same time, those odd jobs, sometimes looking back, were the most fun times that I've had, as well. But when you're in it, it sucks.","""It's been a fast incline, so we've had to just work really hard,"" Mark Foster says .

"(CNN) -- The governor of Oklahoma, Mary Fallin, says it is ""hard to believe"" another monster tornado could devastate the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore. The odds of one striking the same place twice are extremely rare -- rarer still if it's near a populated area. But if that place is Moore, science may offer an explanation. ""Oklahoma has one of the highest climatological likelihoods for tornadoes of any place in the nation,"" according to Bob Henson of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. ""So if two EF4/EF5 tornadoes are going to strike the same city within 15 years, Moore is as likely as any other place. Even so, this is an extremely rare occurrence,"" Henson said. On average, 10 tornadoes a year reach the most dangerous classification and almost never strike populated areas. Monday's deadly storm was the exception. Oklahoma City area hammered by EF5 tornado in 1999 . Moreover, it partly followed the path of an EF5 tornado that walloped metro Oklahoma City in 1999, killing three dozen people. That twister tracked a path that included Moore, a southern suburb of more than 50,000 people. It was one of the costliest tornadoes in U.S. history. Dallas-Fort Worth, Kansas City and St. Louis are also considered high risk for severe tornadoes, according to Harold Brooks of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma. Deadliest tornadoes on record . Yet, none of those metro areas has been through what Moore has experienced. Monday's storm caused enormous property destruction and killed at least two dozen people. ""Yet it was a relatively ordinary violent tornado,"" according to Brooks, an acknowledged expert on the climatology and probability of twisters. Tornado prediction is improving . Such twisters are defined as those that have winds of at least 200 mph, are a half-a-mile or more wide, and produce the most fatalities. When they touch down, they normally stay on the ground for 30 to 60 minutes. The National Weather Service said Monday's tornado was 1.3 miles wide as it tore through Moore. The estimated peak winds ranged from 200 to 210 mph -- which would make it an EF5, the most powerful category. Judging by the vast destruction of homes and buildings, experts say it was on the ground for about 40 minutes. The number of tornadoes overall seems to be more variable. ""In the last three years we have set records for the most tornadoes in 12 consecutive months and the least number of tornadoes in 12 consecutive months,"" Brooks said. He has no explanation for the inconsistency. EF5 tornadoes are terrifying perfect storms .","Moore hit by devastating twisters twice since 1999 .
The biggest tornadoes usually don't strike populated areas .
Oklahoma has one of the highest climates .
Estimated peak winds in Monday's deadly storm were between 200-210 mph ."
"(CNN) -- The former Arizona congresswoman who survived a mass shooting in her district roughly two years ago paid a visit Friday to Newtown, Connecticut, where last month a gunman killed 27 people and himself in one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history. Gabrielle Giffords made the trip with her husband, Mark Kelly. The couple met with local and state leaders to discuss gun control legislation, mental health identification and treatment, and ""concerns for the erosion of our societal values such that we are increasingly desensitized to violence,"" according to Newtown First Selectman Pat Llodra. ""There is an agreed-upon sense of urgency that we need to take action while we have the world's attention,"" Llodra said of the meeting. Giffords retired from Congress last year to focus on her recovery after she was shot in the head in January 2011. Giffords was one of 19 people shot at a political event at a shopping plaza in Tucson, Arizona, and spent months relearning how to speak and walk. Six people died in the encounter, including a 9-year-old girl and a federal judge. After the Newtown shooting on December 14, her husband vented his frustrations on Twitter. ""When will we address this problem as a nation? The time is now!"" Kelly wrote. Giffords' visit came one day after Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy set a two-month deadline for a special commission to address the state's gun laws, mental health policies and public security issues. He called for recommendations to be brought to the state legislature by March 15. ""We don't know the underlying cause of this tragedy, and we probably never will,"" Malloy said, but that is ""no reason for inaction."" Friday's visit also coincided with the second day of school for students from Sandy Hook Elementary, where 20 of their classmates -- all ages 6 or 7 -- were killed last month. The gunman, Adam Lanza, also gunned down six adults after killing his mother, an avid gun collector, in her Newtown home. Authorities say security measures have been increased at Chalk Hill Middle School in the nearby Connecticut town of Monroe, where Sandy Hook students are currently attending class. Their former school remains part of an active police investigation. Giffords met earlier this week with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to discuss gun control, a topic that the three-term mayor has pressed on the national stage, urging tighter restrictions on high-capacity magazines and assault rifles. Despite emotions, little happens legislatively after mass shootings . CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: She discussed gun control and mental health treatment with local leaders .

"Seychelles (CNN) -- The pristine waters of the Seychelles, a glittering necklace of coralline and granitic islands scattered on the Indian Ocean, have long beguiled jet-setters and eco-conscious visitors from around the world, turning the idyllic archipelago into a popular travel destination. But as well as boosting the tiny nation's tourism revenues, the high seas off the east coast of Africa have also helped create another strategic industry: fishing. A major economic pillar, fishing is the second biggest contributor to the Seychelles' finances after tourism. Over the last two decades, the sector's products have accounted for more than 90% of the country's merchandise exports by value, supplying international markets with items such as canned tuna, also known as the Seychelles' ""blue gold."" But in recent years, the fishing industry has come under severe threat as a result of the ongoing risk posed by Somali pirates roaming the waters off the Horn of Africa. ""It's a big problem,"" explains major Jean Attala, deputy operations officer of the Seychelles coast guard. ""Anything that disrupts the tourism or fishing industry or the maritime equilibrium is a very big problem for us,"" he adds. Read this: The global cost of piracy . To deal with the threat of piracy, the country's authorities had to change the way they manage their waters in recent years. As part of this increased security drive, the Seychelles coast guard has intensified its patrolling efforts, with fast-attack armed vessels monitoring a newly defined zone for fishing. But there are just four such vessels in the Seychelles' entire fleet. It's a small nation in terms of landmass, but with its oceans, it is nearly twice the size of France. ""This is not adequate to cover such a large area,"" says Attala. ""We need more assets and build up more our capacity to deal with the issue."" Local fishermen are restricted from sailing beyond the designated area's perimeter, several dozen miles outside the main port. Analysts say that fishing boats are of particular importance to pirates because they can be used as floating bases from which to launch further attacks. But while the measure seems to be working -- there have been no successful attacks in nearly a year -- the restrictions on the movement of Seychellois fishermen has created another problem. ""There's no fish,"" explains local fisherman Patrick Pierre. ""Every boat is fishing in the same place,"" he adds. Pierre, who's been casting his nets for 12 years now, says his job was hardest during the worst period of the piracy -- in 2007 and 2008. Since then, the Seychelles has been at the forefront of the global fight against piracy but the new rules mean fewer fish and less money. Latest African gold rush: Hotels . Joram Madnack is the general manager of the French-owned Indian Ocean Tuna, one of the world's largest tuna canneries and the biggest employer in the Seychelles. He says fish intake has fallen nearly 25% in the last five years. ""The impact has been on the price, which for some places has gone up by 70%-80% compared to 2007 prices,"" explains Madnack. According to a recent report by the World Bank, piracy costs the global economy an estimated $18 billion a year. The increased costs come as shippers are forced to change trading routes, sending fuel bills soaring, as well as pay higher insurance premiums and security bills for guards on board. But the threat of Somali piracy is also damaging the economies of neighboring countries, particularly in the key sectors of tourism and fishing. Since 2006, the year the World Bank report takes as the starting point of piracy, exports of fish products from piracy-hit countries have declined by 23.8%. In Seychelles, the impact has been even greater, with exports collapsing by nearly 30%. ""We now fish where we are allowed to fish,"" says Peter Sinon, the country's minister of natural resources and industry. ""It has made the industry more costly in terms of going out there [and] be secure to bring in what usually was our daily supply of protein,"" he adds. Watch video: protecting ""blue gold"" from pirates . And although many of the pirates have now gone, the fishermen say their industry still hasn't recovered. For people like Pierre, the fight against piracy and the introduction of fishing zones has proven to be a double-edged sword. The protection is still necessary, he says, acknowledging that today he is safer. Yet, he and other local fishermen miss the freedom to sail about and return with a big catch. ""Five years ago, there was a lot of fish,"" says Pierre. ""We could go anywhere we wanted without the fear of piracy and everything.""

"(CNN) -- The unprecedented success of two German teams reaching the final of the Champions League is down to the Bundesliga's investment in young players, the chief executive of the league told CNN Tuesday. Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund battle it out Saturday at Wembley to claim European club football's most prestigious title. They have broken the stranglehold of the English Premier League and Spain's La Liga in providing the the Champions League winners and Christian Seifert claims the major factor has been a crop of home grown talent in both teams. ""On Saturday we will have 16 or 17 German players on the pitch,"" he said. Seifert said that decisions taken by the German federation and the Bundesliga after a poor showing at the European Championships in 2000 paved the way for the current triumphs at both club and international level. ""Each club that wanted to play in the top two tiers of the Bundesliga -- 36 clubs -- had to have youth academy,"" he said. ""Today more than 100 million euros per year is invested and 5,000 players are educated in the program."" By the end of the first decade of the 21st century, it was clear German football had a promising crop of talent and at the 2009 European under-21 championships the evidence was overwhelming. A team containing goalkeeeper Manuel Neuer and defenders Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels, who are all likely to feature in Saturday's showpiece final, thrashed England 4-0 in the final. Sami Khedira and Mesut Ozil, ironically now in a Real Madrid side shocked by Dortmund in this season's Champions League semifinals, were also in that German team. ""Virtually every member of today's German national team played in that squad,"" said Seifert. His views have been echoed by CNN FC contributor Owen Hargreaves, who played for Bayern Munich as the youth revolution got underway. Former England international Hargreaves said the English Premier League should learn the lessons of the Bundesliga experiment and give more opportunities to young players. One area where the EPL does still reign is in overall revenues, but Seifert, who comes from a marketing business background, believes the Bundesliga is catching up. ""We have the second biggest turnover of the major leagues although far behind the EPL. ""We have sold our TV rights in 208 countries but we are seeing increased interest because of the Champions League success."" Even he though was surprised by seeing two Bundesliga sides in the final. ""Bayern Munich is probably not such a big surprise -- it's their third final in four years -- but Borussia Dortmund getting there with a relatively young team is,"" he said. Dortmund won the trophy back in 1997 in their only final appearance, Bayern, with Hargreaves in the line up, last took the honors in 2001 and will be looking to put their shock defeat to Chelsea in last year's final on their home Allianz Arena behind them. But for 44-year-old Seifert whichever team wins it will not matter as the Bundesliga goes from strength to strength.","Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund battle for Champions League title .

"(CNN) -- It's one of the most familiar pieces of advice from authorities to people in the path of a tornado: Get into your basement. Yet few homes in the Oklahoma City area have them -- even though that state is hit by far more powerful tornadoes than most others. ""Probably less than one tenth of one percent"" of the houses in Moore are built with basements, said Mike Hancock, president of Basement Contractors in Edmond, Oklahoma. ""There's just such a misconception that you cannot do it."" Why? Hancock cited the area's high groundwater levels and heavy clay as among the reasons some people believe -- wrongly, he said -- that basements are tough to construct. But improved waterproofing methods can obviate the first; and the second, too, is surmountable, according to Hancock, who said he has built more than 600 basements in the Oklahoma City area over the past 15 years. ""We do 'em all day long,"" he said. ""I've got 32 basements to put in the ground right now."" The city of Moore was the epicenter of an EF5 tornado Monday that decimated neighborhoods in the Oklahoma City area, leaving at least 24 dead. Inside a tornado-ravaged school . In Moore, other issues can dissuade new home buyers from investing in basements, Hancock said. One is that there are so few other such houses that comparable values are tough to estimate, ""so appraisers don't give you any credit."" In fact, basements are so rare in the area that real estate listings do not include ""basement"" as an option under foundation types, he said. ""You can list it in the comments section, but that's not a foundation type."" That means it's hard for house hunters to narrow their searches to houses with basements, which makes it harder still for sellers who have built houses with basements to recoup their investments, he said. Moore in bull's-eye twice, science may know why . Mike Barnett, a custom homebuilder in the area for 37 years, estimated that some 2% of residents have basements, and 10% to 15% ""have some kind of cellar."" None of the homes in his partially completed, 51-house development, called Autumn Oaks, has a basement, he said. Though it was spared Monday's storms, ""a block north of us it looks like Bosnia,"" he said. He plans to build a community shelter that would accommodate all of its residents. Alternatives exist: An above-ground shelter runs $8,000 to $10,000; a small basement would cost $15,000 to $20,000; and a concrete cellar built during new-house construction would cost as little as $2,200, said Barnett. Tornado prediction is improving, scientists say . Accessibility an important element . Basements provide good protection if equipped with a suitable door and a concrete roof, but basements of pier-beam houses would leave their occupants exposed and vulnerable if the structure above them were blown away, said Ernst Kiesling, a former professor of civil engineering at Texas Tech. Kiesling created the concept of the above-ground storm shelter after a tornado swept through Lubbock, Texas, in 1970, killing 26 people and demolishing scores of homes. EF5 tornadoes are terrifying perfect storms . In addition, it is difficult to make basements compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, said Kiesling, who is on the research faculty at the school's National Wind Institute. Above-ground storm shelters are easy to make accessible to those who are physically challenged, ""and I would say that accessibility is a very important element,"" Kiesling said. Specially reinforced safe rooms provide ""near absolute occupant protection from even the worst-case tornado,"" he said. Opinion: How can we be safe from tornadoes? Other products include steel, concrete and plastic shelters; above-ground and below-ground shelters; indoor and outdoor shelters; and shelters that fit underneath the garage slab. The extra cost of incorporating a basement into plans for a house depends on where it is being built. ""If you're in the colder climates, then one has to put the foundation walls several feet deep to get below the frost line,"" Kiesling said. A region's frost line marks where the ground no longer freezes and is an important variable when installing pipes. The added cost of digging down the extra couple of feet needed to make a basement for a house in the Northeast is relatively small, he said. ""If you're that deep, you're pretty well along forming the shell for the basement."" But in the Southwest, where the frost line is only about 18 inches below ground, the added incremental cost of digging out a basement would be far steeper, said the Texan. ""Here, houses are typically built by placing a slab on the surface and building above it."" Opinion: The making of a nightmare tornado . Lessons to be learned . Kiesling is also executive director of the National Storm Shelter Association, a nonprofit group that focuses on improving the quality of storm shelters. He was planning Tuesday to organize teams to travel to Moore to study which structures failed and which performed well. ""There's a lot of lessons we can learn from this,"" he said. Kiesling said he had heard news reports citing underground shelters as the only safe places Monday in Moore. ""That causes my blood to curdle, because I've spent my career developing safe places above ground,"" he said. Monday's disaster is expected to lead to renewed calls to ensure that new houses are equipped with some sort of protection, said Leslie Chapman-Henderson, president and CEO of the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes. But don't count on them to effect change. ""What happens is that time and fading memories are the worst enemies,"" she said. ""People think it can't happen twice, but in the case of Moore, Oklahoma, the tragedy here is this is the third strike -- 1999 to 2003."" After each of those strikes, homebuilders pledged never again to build homes without including safe rooms, she said. Though many followed through on their vows, more work remains, she noted. Opinion: We love and fear the Oklahoma skies .","Misconceptions abound over basements, builders say .
""We do 'em all day long,"" says one who has built many in the Oklahoma City area .
Deeper frost line means they're common in the Northeast .
Alternatives, including safe rooms, exist ."
"(CNN) -- The massive tornado that devastated communities in Oklahoma Monday touched down near the town of Newcastle just five minutes after the first warnings went out, according to the National Weather Service. But residents of Moore, which would be hardest hit by the killer storm, had about 30 minutes before the twister entered the western part of the city, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said Tuesday. It sounds like enough time to act, but in the wake of tragedy, the question always persists: Could more have been done to warn residents of the monster tornado? The science and technology behind severe weather prediction continues to improve, and many of the tools in place were deployed during Monday's tornado. Once the tornado had touched down and meteorologists had determined that it was heading toward a populated area, the National Weather Service issued a ""tornado emergency,"" said Harold Brooks, a research meteorologist at the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration's Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma, which is near Moore. The rarely used distinction is designed to make it clear that there is a dangerous situation. Moore in bull's-eye twice, science may know why . ""When you hear that, the response is that you better get your act together, now,"" Brooks said. For the citizens of Moore, the tornado emergency was declared at 3:01 p.m., about 14 minutes before the tornado reached the city. ""I think it was a very well-warned and well-forecasted event,"" Brooks said. EF5 tornadoes are terrifying perfect storms . The initial warning, which included the counties where Newcastle and Moore are located, would have been followed by alerts on television, radio, phone apps and sirens. Once forecasters recognized that the tornado was violent and that a ""potentially extraordinary event was occurring,"" the emergency declaration set off another round of warnings, Brooks said. Still, at least 24 people lost their lives as a result of the tornado. Considering the size of the tornado and the number of homes it affected, the death toll could have been worse, Brooks said. ""A lot of people survived the path of the tornado,"" he said. Basements scarce in tornado-prone area: Here's why . The science behind predictions . Currently, the Severe Storms Laboratory can forecast weather conducive to tornadoes about seven or eight days out, Brooks said. This is a vast improvement over 15 years ago, when forecasts were available for just one day ahead. In the case of the tornado that hit Moore, forecasters predicted severe weather in the Oklahoma area as early as Wednesday. But these forecasts are for weather systems that are capable of producing tornadoes, not predictions of where a specific tornado may hit. Advances in technology and science are continuously improving forecasts. ""As computers have gotten more powerful, the models have gotten better,"" said Adam Sobel, a professor of atmospheric science at Columbia University in New York. Computers use the laws of physics and mathematics to make predictions based on simulations of the atmosphere that are represented on a grid. Opinion: How can we be safe from tornadoes? Just like pixels on the digital cameras have become smaller and smaller, the grid that these computers use has gotten smaller, allowing for more precise forecasts, Sobel said. But tornadoes are so small, relatively, that they are still too small for the models to see. The increased power of these computers have made it easier to spot storms systems that could spawn tornadoes. New research may increase the window of prediction from the current seven or eight days to 10 to 12 days before the event, Sobel said. NOAA is also working with several institutions to increase warning lead times for tornadoes and other severe weather. Known as ""warn-on-forecasts,"" the new methodology would issue warnings based on forecasts rather than observations, said Jeff Trapp, a professor of atmospheric science at Purdue University in Indiana. The new method is promising, he said, but it is still at an experimental stage. It might allow forecasters to provide cones of uncertainty for a tornado, similar to those used to predict where hurricanes are headed. These warnings for tornadoes could come one to six hours before the tornado, as opposed to the current 15- to 30-minute warnings, Trapp said. Another innovation with the new research could result in forecasters providing the strength of a tornado at the time it is formed, instead of after the fact, as is currently the case. Residents may react differently if they know the intensity of the tornado heading toward them. The challenge, Trapp said, is the same one that all forecasters face: A forecast depends on the data available. Deadliest U.S. tornadoes on record .","Residents of Moore had time to prepare for tornado, but can more be done?
Forecasters can predict tornado-worthy storms up to eight days in advance .
New technology could yield more warning, ""cones of uncertainty"" like with hurricanes ."
"New York (CNN) -- Three university researchers working on medical technology are facing federal charges -- and up to 20 years in prison if convicted -- for allegedly taking Chinese money for their U.S.-funded research, according to federal authorities. Their research was partially funded by a multimillion dollar National Institutes of Health grant, according to a criminal complaint. The three -- Yudong Zhu, 44 of Scarsdale, and Xing Yang and Ye Li, both 31 of Hartsdale -- are each charged with one count of commercial bribery, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan. Zhu is also charged with one count lying about conflicts of interests in a federal research grant. The three are Chinese nationals, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney's office. It was not clear from the statement what their status was while working in the United States. ""Instead of working exclusively for a New York research institution, the defendants took bribes to acquire research for the benefit of both a Chinese competitor and a Chinese government institution,"" said FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge George Venizelos said. The U.S. attorney's statement described the three as ""researchers who worked on improving MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) technology at a university in New York, New York."" Although the statement did not name the university, the website of the New York University School of Medicine identifies Zhu as an associate professor conducting research focused on improving MRI technology. The criminal complaint said Zhu recruited the other two scientists to aid him in the MRI research. The defendants had undisclosed ties with a Chinese medical imaging company and a Chinese government-sponsored research institute conducting the same MRI research, according to federal authorities. The scientists allegedly shared private information stemming from their research in the United States with those Chinese institutions. ""As alleged, this is a case of inviting and paying for foxes in the henhouse,"" U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Monday. The researchers allegedly accepted thousands of dollars for travel, tuition and rent. Zhu and Yang were arrested at their residences in New York Sunday, according to the U.S. attorney's office. Li is believed to have traveled to China before charges were brought. Zhu and Yang appeared in court Monday and were both released on bond, according to Zhu's lawyer, Robert Baum. ""Many of the government's statements in the bail hearing misinterpreted facts which are actually consistent with his innocence,"" Baum told CNN Tuesday.","The three researchers were working on MRI technology at a U.S. university .

"(CNN) -- Golfer Tiger Woods has described a jibe aimed at him by Sergio Garcia as ""wrong, hurtful and inappropriate,"" though the world No. 1 insists he wants to move on from their very public war of words. Garcia apologized to Woods after making a remark about the American at a players' dinner ahead of the European Tour's flagship tournament -- the PGA Championship at Wentworth that starts Thursday. Asked on stage whether he would be inviting Woods round for dinner during next month's U.S. Open Garcia replied: ""We'll be having him round every night... and serving him fried chicken."" Fried chicken is a common food in the American South, but when used in references to African-Americans, it often implies a negative stereotype. Garcia and Woods have been at loggerheads since an acrimonious round during the penultimate day of The Players' Championship earlier this month. ""The comment that was made wasn't silly. It was wrong, hurtful and clearly inappropriate,"" Woods said on his official Twitter account. ""I'm confident that there is real regret that the remark was made. The Players ended nearly two weeks ago and it's long past time to move on and talk about golf."" Earlier on Wednesday Garcia released an apology via the European Tour and used his pre-tournament press conference at Wentworth to reiterate his remorse. ""I want to send out an unreserved apology, I did not mean to offend anyone,"" Garcia told reporters. ""I was caught off guard by the question but don't get me wrong, I understand my answer was totally stupid and out of place. ""I can't say sorry enough. I would also like to say sorry to the European Tour and my Ryder Cup teammates for taking the shine away from a wonderful dinner that we all enjoyed to that point. ""Finally and most importantly I want to apologize to Tiger and anyone that I could have offended. I feel sick about it and truly, truly sorry. Hopefully we can settle things down and move on. ""As soon as I left the dinner I started to get a sick feeling. I didn't really sleep at all. I felt like my heart was going to come out of my body. ""It was tough to hit a shot (in the pro-am) without thinking about it."" Garcia said he had spoken to the head of the European Tour George O'Grady and the PGA Tour to apologize and subsequently will not face any punishment. His comments came at a dinner to honor the 12 members of Europe's victorious Ryder Cup team, whose dramatic comeback in Chicago to defeat the American team that included Woods has been dubbed 'The miracle of Medinah.' The 33-year-old's Ryder Cup teammate Graeme McDowell, the 2010 U.S. Open champion, later tweeted when asked about the fried chicken comments: ""Private/humor filled environment but he (Garcia) shouldn't have said it #slip."" Fuzzy Zoeller comments . Woods and Garcia have long enjoyed a fractious relationship that was again highlighted when they were paired together during the penultimate round of The Players' Championship earlier this month. Garcia claimed he was disrupted during one of his shots after the gallery following Woods cheered as the 14-time major winner pulled a club out of his bag that signaled his intention to go for the green despite being in the rough. Garcia sliced his shot and made a bogey that saw him relinquish the one-shot lead he held at the time. After the incident Garcia told reporters: ""I think that I try to respect everyone as much as possible out there. I try to be careful what I do to make sure it doesn't bother the other players."" Woods responded by saying: ""It's not real surprising that he's complaining about something,"" prompting another provocative comment from the Spaniard: ""That's fine. At least I'm true to myself. I know what I'm doing. He can do whatever he wants."" Woods went on to cement his status as the world No. 1, winning the tournament by two shots with Garcia eventually six back after he faltered on the notorious 17th island hole, which is surrounded by water. The row rumbled on into this week as Woods was asked at a press conference whether he would consider contacting Garcia to end their spat. ""No,"" came his brief response. Upon hearing that, Garcia hit back by reportedly telling a function in London: ""He called me a whiner. That's probably right. It's also probably the first thing he's told you guys that's true in 15 years. I know what he is like. You guys are finding out."" Garcia's remarks are similar to those made by two-time major champion Fuzzy Zoeller in 1997 after Woods won The Masters. Zoeller suggested at the champions dinner the following year Woods would choose to serve fried chicken to his guests. He later apologized and claimed the remarks had been taken out of context. At his own press call ahead of the PGA Championship, Lee Westwood, Garcia's Ryder Cup teammate, refused to be drawn into the row saying he was friends with both players. ""It's an awkward situation where they obviously just don't get on. It's in the public (domain) and you guys (the media) will stoke it up and you don't need to,"" he told reporters. ""I don't think Tiger will be particularly bothered. I get on with both of them but I have no interest of getting in the middle of that relationship. It's nothing to do with me.""","Tiger Woods calls jibe aimed at him by fellow golfer Sergio Garcia 'wrong' and 'hurtful'

"Meiktila, Myanmar (CNN) -- Nineteen-year-old Hnin Ei Phyu is on her knees at home, whispering her prayers. It's a small sign of normality in a community where things have been anything but normal in recent months. This young Muslim woman can't go inside her family's mosque because it was shut down after being vandalized. And for more than a month, she had to say her prayers from inside a shelter at a nearby sports stadium in Meiktila, a city in central Myanmar. Fearing for their lives, Hnin Ei Phyu's family fled their home on March 20 during the first of three days of rioting that tore apart this city of 100,000 people. A wave of sectarian violence between Buddhists and Muslims resulted in the deaths of at least 43 people and displaced thousands more, according to the Myanmar government. During the clashes, reportedly set off by a dispute between a Muslim gold shop owner and two Buddhist sellers, rioters set fire to houses, schools and mosques, while people were also beaten, doused with gasoline and set on fire. Many Muslims complain that the police stood by and did nothing during the violence. The rioting was only stopped after President Thein Sein declared a state of emergency and called in the military. By then thousands had fled their homes in terror. Meiktila's Muslims were heavily outnumbered and suffered the bulk of the casualties. Few remained in their homes because they were either destroyed by rampaging mobs or it simply wasn't safe for them to stay there. It wasn't until earlier this month that Muslims whose houses were not destroyed were able to leave the shelters and return home. ""Tears came out of my eyes when I got back home,"" said Hnin Ei Phyu's mother, Thidar Hla. ""I'm extremely happy to be back home."" But the 43-year old said that when she walks down the streets of this predominantly Buddhist city, it's clear things are not the way they were before the riots. ""We (Muslims and Buddhists) don't interact with each other the way we used too,"" she said. ""People are keeping a mental distance between each other."" Thidar Hla and her extended family share a collection of rickety houses along a side street in a modest neighborhood of Meiktila. A security post manned by police and soldiers has been set up just a short walk away. Similar arrangements are in place in other parts of the city where Muslims live -- a sign of the times since March. ""There are soldiers and security guards on each end of the street,"" Thidar Hla said, before adding that she hopes they can keep her family safe. But in areas that bore the brunt of the rioting, little has been rebuilt more than two months on. The blackened frames of burned down homes are all that stand in some places. Metal sheets that once served as roofs now lie in pieces on the ashen ground. The government says it will replace all of the approximately 1,600 homes that were destroyed -- an easier task than repairing the trust between Muslims and Buddhists. ""Right now we don't trust them and they don't trust us,"" said U Aung Khin, a 50-year-old Buddhist man. Aung Khin is married with five kids between the ages of five and 24. He says he has numerous Muslim friends, but things have been strained since the riots. ""After this we don't really have to talk. It isn't necessary for us to talk with each other at all,"" he said. ""I'm afraid to trust them right now."" He said he used to buy meat from a Muslim butcher but won't now because he's afraid his food might be poisoned. Meanwhile, Thidar Hla's family says they're playing it safe by buying their food from other Muslims. She has also instructed her daughter to stay close to home. She's a student at a local university that has not reopened since the riots. Hnin Ei Phyu says she has several Buddhist friends at school and is hoping her relationships with them go back to normal. But she hasn't contacted them since the violence and they haven't been in touch with her. Though Myanmar is about 90% Buddhist, Muslims have generally coexisted peacefully with the Buddhist majority -- their children go to school together and their parents often work together. But as with Meiktila, ethnic fault lines have been exposed in some areas as the country emerges from decades of military repression. Last year, at least 110 people were killed in attacks on Muslims in western Myanmar's Rakhine State. The Muslim Rohingya people are a stateless Muslim minority living in Rakhine -- thought to number between 800,000 and one million -- who claim they were persecuted by Myanmar's military during its decades of authoritarian rule. Myanmar does not recognize them as citizens or as one of the 135 recognized ethnic groups living in the country. Much of this is rooted in their heritage in East Bengal, now called Bangladesh. Though many Rohingya have only known life in Myanmar, they are viewed by the Buddhist majority as intruders from across the border. Across the country, a budding movement known as ""969"" has been spreading anti-Muslim sentiment by encouraging Buddhists to avoid Muslim-run businesses. ""969"" stickers are increasingly found in businesses and taxis in Yangon, the country's largest and most ethnically diverse city. Police recently stepped up patrols in Yangon following the Meiktila clashes, though serious fighting has yet to spread there. However, in several communities within 100 kilometers (62 miles) of Yangon, Buddhist mobs reportedly vandalized mosques as well as Muslim businesses and houses. The wave of religious unrest has prompted the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) urge Burmese authorities to allow a delegation to visit Myanmar to discuss the issue -- a request the authorities in Naypyidaw have so far rebuffed.","Hnin Ei Phyu's family fled their home during outbreak of violence in Meiktila .

"(CNN) -- A junior professor drives his Doppler On Wheels mobile radar trucks through Moore, Oklahoma, less than 90 seconds after a tornado has torn a path of destruction through the city. Debris -- pieces of homes -- falls from the sky onto his truck. The scene is shocking; wrecks of houses covered with dirt are all that is left in the twister's path, and people are still huddled underground in shelters. The professor doesn't know it yet, but he has just recorded 302 mph winds in the core of the vortex, the strongest wind speed ever measured anywhere in the world. He doesn't learn until later that his wife and baby are in a shelter just 3 miles south of the tornado. The year was 1999. The professor was me. Forty-six people died in tornadoes that day. I was chasing twisters with the DOW radars -- mobile weather radars driven up to tornadoes to make ultra-fine detail, 3-D maps of the winds and debris. I was trying to learn more about how tornadoes form, about how the winds cause destruction, with the optimistic hope that this would soon lead to better forecasts, longer warning lead times, fewer false alarms, fewer deaths. Tornado prediction is improving, scientists say . In 1999, tornado warnings were issued by the National Weather Service an average of 13 short minutes before touchdown, and the false alarm rate was a whopping 75%. The same remains essentially true now. And on Monday, my team and several other teams of really smart scientists with mobile radars and other equipment independently concluded -- incorrectly -- that southern Oklahoma, about 50 miles south of Moore, was at the highest risk of strong tornadoes. We all missed the opportunity to collect data in the Moore tornado. Opinion: We love and fear the Oklahoma skies . Why? Why haven't scientists and all the smart forecasters been able to improve tornado forecasts? And why, even when communities like Moore, Oklahoma, and Joplin, Missouri, (devasted by a tornado in 2011) and others are warned sometimes 30 minutes ahead of time do so many people die? We can't expect that there will be zero deaths from tornadoes, but can we do better? For people to be safe from tornadoes, several things must happen. Scientists need to better understand the details of how tornadoes form, what events precede tornado formation, and how to better distinguish between thunderstorms that will make tornadoes and the overwhelming majority that will not. Then, forecasters need to be able to integrate that knowledge with observations, mainly from the national network of government weather surveillance radars and computer simulations to detect tornado precursors. Warnings need to be effectively communicated to those most at risk, using traditional methods such as sirens and weather radio and new media like Twitter. Finally, those who are warned need to heed these warnings and take immediate and effective precautions. Opinion: The making of a nightmare tornado . In recent years, scientists have learned much about tornadoes. The National Science Foundation's DOWs have mapped the winds in nearly 200 different tornadoes, large and small, during birth and death, and while passing through towns. Scientists, supported by the foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, are analyzing nearly 30 terabytes of data, -- the equivalent of about 8,000 DVDs -- collected during VORTEX2 (or Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes). VORTEX2 is the largest and most ambitious tornado study in history -- begun in 2009 -- in which 100 scientists in 50 scientific vehicles surrounded and probed tornadic super-cell thunderstorms. The formation of tornadoes is hard to predict, but we are making headway in identifying potential precursors. But, as our missed forecasts for Moore show, we have a long way to go. Even with the most sophisticated instruments, we can't tell even 20 minutes ahead of time whether a super-cell will become a tornado. Opinion: The extraordinary courage of teachers . The public and local governments have a critical role to play. No matter what warnings are issued by forecasters, every adult's safety is ultimately in his or her own hands. One has to choose first to heed a warning. Then, critically, one has to have a safe place to go. In particular, buildings hosting the most vulnerable -- schools and hospitals -- need to have hardened shelters. Communities need to enforce the most basic and inexpensive good building practices so that roofs are attached securely to walls, which are anchored to foundations, so that buildings are more resistant to tornadoes. Moore in bull's-eye twice, science may know why . I believe that we are doing a pretty good job at all of this. While the tolls in Moore and Joplin are tragic, most people who lived and worked in even the worst swaths of destruction survived. During the 1999 tornado, for example, more than 400 homes were completely destroyed -- not just some walls down, but all walls down -- but only about 40 people died. Many thousands lived in the paths of the 2011 Joplin and 2013 Moore tornadoes, and only a small fraction died. But we can and should do much better. Tornado deaths can be reduced, if not to zero then still substantially. It will take the continued efforts of scientists, forecasters, builders, community planners and ultimately the people who live in the path of the most intensely destructive phenomenon. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joshua Wurman.","Joshua Wurman: Research has improved tornado tracking, but it remains imprecise, flawed .
He says warning speed, false alarms change little. People still die. We must do better .
He says synthesis of research, radar observation will help. Communications must improve .
Wurman: Public must heed warnings, build tornado-proof structures, to bring deaths to zero ."
"(CNN) -- As Sandy Hook Elementary School students returned to class Thursday for the first time since last month's massacre, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy set a two-month deadline for a commission to address the state's gun laws, mental health policies and public security issues. ""We don't know the underlying cause of this tragedy, and we probably never will,"" said Malloy, who added that that is ""no reason for inaction."" Malloy appointed Hamden, Connecticut, Mayor Scott Jackson to lead a special advisory commission and set a March 15 deadline for an initial report that is expected to be addressed during the next legislative session. ""We can work together to make our state a model for the rest of the nation,"" said Malloy, who also called on Congress to enact stricter national gun control laws. The move comes just weeks after a gunman killed 26 people at the Newtown elementary school, including 20 children, ages 6 and 7. The shooter, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, also killed his mother before breaking into the school with an AR-15 assault rifle. On Thursday, Sandy Hook parents accompanied their children to an emotional first day back in school. ""There was a little bit of anxiety, but everybody was happy to be back in the swing of things,"" said Sarah Swansiger, the mother of a kindergarten student. Students from Sandy Hook attended Chalk Hill Middle School in the nearby town of Monroe because the Sandy Hook building remains part of an active investigation. Newtown Public Schools Superintendent Janet Robinson has said that part of the Chalk Hill building had been transformed to resemble an elementary school and that security had also been increased, incorporating an upgraded system of new cameras and locks. ""(We want) to have as much (of) a normal routine as possible,"" said Robinson. ""(Thursday) is a regular schedule, and we will do the kinds of things that we know are good for kids."" Counselors were also on hand to help parents, students, teachers and administrators in coping with the emotional toll of returning to class. Swansiger said that while there were ""some emotional moments in the beginning of the day ... you couldn't walk around the corner without someone asking if you were OK.""

"(CNN) -- A man has been charged with the murders of four members of the Royal Household Cavalry in a 1982 IRA attack in London, the UK Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement Wednesday. The suspect is named as John Anthony Downey, 61, of County Donegal, Ireland. The four cavalry members were killed in London's Hyde Park on July 20, 1982, as they rode from their barracks to Buckingham Palace. Seven horses were also killed. Downey is accused of the murders of Roy John Bright, Dennis Richard Anthony Daly, Simon Andrew Tipper and Geoffrey Vernon Young, a Crown Prosecution Service statement said. He's also charged with intending to cause an explosion likely to endanger life. ""We have determined that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that these charges are in the public interest,"" said Sue Hemming, head of Special Crime and Counter-Terrorism at the Crown Prosecution Service. Downey made an initial court appearance, at Westminster Magistrates' Court, on Wednesday afternoon. In 1987, IRA member Gilbert ""Danny"" McNamee was ordered jailed for 25 years for making the bomb. The conviction was later overturned, and McNamee was freed. The Good Friday peace deal in 1998 largely brought to an end three decades of violence over the question of whether Northern Ireland should stay under British control or join the Republic of Ireland, as republicans want.

"(CNN) -- Malaga coach Manuel Pellegrini has added his name to May's managerial merry-go-round by announcing he is leaving the Spanish club at the end of this season. The Chilean has been linked to the top job at Manchester City after the English Premier League club dismissed Italian Roberto Mancini earlier this month. Pellegrini had a one-season spell in charge of Real Madrid before joining Malaga in 2010, shortly after Qatar's Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Al-Thani bought the club. This season the 59-year-old guided ""Los Boquerones"" to the heady heights of the Champions League quarterfinals, losing to one of this weekend's finalists, Borussia Dortmund. But Pellegrini said he was now standing down for ""sporting reasons"" -- not because of the club's financial problems. Malaga confirmed to CNN that the head coach would be leaving at the end of the season. The Spanish club agreed Pellegrini could leave despite having two years left on his contract. ""My coaching staff and I are separating from Malaga but our union with this city will be eternal,"" Pellegrini said in a social address to the Malaga Provisional Council. ""We leave the club qualified for Europe with the mission accomplished. We had a time with the club that was very rewarding."" Pellegrini plans to stay at the helm for Malaga's final two matches. The club, sixth in the La Liga standings, plays Deportivo La Coruna at home before closing the season against Barcelona at the Nou Camp on June 1. ""Sunday will be my last match at La Rosaleda and will be very exciting for me,"" Pellegrini said. ""I'm not leaving due to the matter of money but looking for a project that allows me to develop my profession conveniently."" Pellegrini continued in a statement on the club's website: ""Everyone has the right and obligation to follow their chosen path, and Malaga must do the same. The club requires a realistic project next season. ""Malaga had a past without Manuel Pellegrini, and will also have a future without Manuel Pellegrini . ""I will be eternally grateful to the owners of the club, who always had blind faith in me. The most important foundation of this club is the strength and support from the fans."" It's not only on the Costa del Sol that waves are being felt in the managerial market. Along with Mancini's departure, Everton manager David Moyes will replace Alex Ferguson at EPL rival Manchester United. Carlo Ancelotti has indicated he wants to leave French champion Paris Saint-Germain, possibly to replace outgoing Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho, who in turn has been linked with a return to Chelsea in place of Rafa Benitez. Tony Pulis has also left EPL side Stoke City while Roberto Martinez is said to be considering his position at Wigan following relegation from England's top flight. As Pellegrini pondered his future, UEFA ruled on Malaga's eligibility to compete in European competitions on Wednesday. Malaga fell foul of the European governing body's Financial Fair Play rules in 2012 and was subsequently handed a season-long ban from its tournaments. Malaga owed player wages and has debts with other football sides as well as the Spanish tax authorities, claimed UEFA. But UEFA's Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) confirmed that Malaga has now fulfilled conditions imposed upon it and a second year of ""suspended sanctions that had been imposed will not apply."" Malaga was allowed to continue in this season's Champions League but is not eligible to compete in next season's Europa League even if the team qualifies for one of the three places on offer to Spanish sides. The club is awaiting a decision, due next month, on its appeal against this ban to the global Court of Arbitration for Sport. Malaga was reported to have splashed out $80 million in 2012 assembling a squad containing big names like Spain's double European champion Santiago Cazorla and Dutch defender Joris Mathijsen, but the many top players left as the club cut its costs.","Manuel Pellegrini says he will stand down as Malaga manager at the end of season .

"(CNN) -- The wait is over for Mario Matt. Matt ended a nearly three-year drought on the World Cup circuit when he won the slalom on the icy Face de Bellevarde in Val d'Isere, France on Sunday. He now has 14 slalom victories, putting him into a tie for fifth in the record books with fellow Austrian Benny Raich. At 34, he is the oldest man to win a World Cup slalom race -- having placed second earlier this season in Finland -- and he moved to the top of the overall standings after last season's champion Marcel Hirscher failed to qualify for the second run. ""I am very happy about this result,"" the two-time slalom world champion was quoted as saying by the website of alpine skiing's governing body. ""I was a few times on the podium in the past two years but since (Slovenia) in 2011 I couldn't win."" Matt posted the fastest time in the first run and held his nerve in the second to beat Sweden's Mattias Hargin by 0.13 seconds and Italy's Patrick Thaler by nearly 0.40 seconds. Hargin made up ground in the second run but not quite enough. He still, though, collected his first World Cup podium in two years. Thaler, too, finished in the top three for the first time in a while -- since 2009. ""It's a special day for me,"" said the 35-year-old. ""I was fighting for many years to come back on the podium and I have to thank a lot of people."" Ted Ligety had a weekend to forget in Val d'Isere. A day after he failed to take part in the second run of a World Cup giant slalom for the first time in four years, the American didn't qualify for Sunday's second run, too. Former overall champion Bode Miller didn't complete the first run, either. ""It was tough conditions where it was very hard snow but very grippy,"" U.S. men's alpine head coach Sasha Rearick told his team's website.

"(CNN) -- Severe weather turned deadly Wednesday night in north Texas. Officials say at least 10 tornadoes touched down, leaving at least six people dead and more than 100 injured in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. If you are looking for missing loved ones, you can call 817-579-2888 to get info from Lake Granbury Hospital. One of the hardest hit areas was a community of homes built by Habitat for Humanity in Granbury, Texas. Most of the 110 homes in that neighborhood are completely destroyed. This is a community that will need help to recover from this devastation. The Hood County Sheriff's Office urges people wishing to volunteer to report to the First United Methodist Church, 301 Loop 567 in Granbury. Several groups are in Hood County getting the effort started. The Red Cross . The Red Cross is on the scene and providing shelter for those who need it. It has opened two shelters in Hood County and you can find their locations here. The Red Cross is not collecting items but encourages monetary donations at this time. You can use the Red Cross' Safe and Well site to alert your loved ones that you are safe or if you are concerned about someone you can't reach. The Salvation Army . The Salvation Army went into action Wednesday night, deploying three Disaster Canteen mobile kitchens to the area, with two more on standby. These canteens provide food as well as emotional and spiritual support for the residents and first responders affected by the storm. The Humane Society of North Texas . When homes are lost, families are displaced, including pets. And when there are only moments to get to safety, pets can become separated from their owners in the chaos. The Humane Society of North Texas is bringing a trailer to the area to help with animal control and displaced animals. Habitat for Humanity . Many of these homes were built by Habitat for Humanity and the Dallas chapter has vowed to stand by the families of Grandbury.

"(CNN) -- A European satellite that ran out of fuel will start falling in the next few days, and fragments of the disintegrating 2,000-pound spacecraft are expected to strike the Earth's surface. Nobody knows where or when the fragments will hit, but the European Space Agency has said the parts are likely to fall into the ocean or unpopulated areas. Potential spots will be narrowed down closer to re-entry, ESA said on its website. Re-entry probably will occur Sunday or Monday, Rune Floberghagen, mission manager for the Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Explorer, better known as GOCE, told the New York Times. GOCE was launched in 2009 to map variations in the Earth's gravity in 3D, provide ocean circulation patterns and make other measurements. ESA's website said the satellite ""became the first seismometer in orbit"" in March 2011 when it detected sound waves from the earthquake that struck Japan. GOCE was expected to fall much earlier but fuel consumption was less than expected. In August, the satellite's altitude was lowered to about 139 miles, lowest of any research satellites, to improve the accuracy of the information being gathered, ESA's website said. GOCE ran out of fuel October 21. On November 4, ESA's website said the satellite was orbiting the Earth at 119 miles and the rate of descent would increase significantly in coming days.","Nobody knows where or when fragments will strike Earth .

"(CNN) -- Jodi Arias could face the death penalty, nearly five years after she stabbed, shot and almost decapitated her ex-boyfriend. An Arizona jury Wednesday found that Arias was ""exceptionally cruel"" when she murdered Travis Alexander in 2008. That verdict makes Arias, 32, eligible for the death penalty in the next phase of her trial. Arias sobbed as a prosecutor presented evidence Wednesday. Around her, the courtroom was silent for two minutes. That's how long Travis Alexander suffered in pain as Arias attacked him, Prosecutor Juan Martinez said. ""Does that seem like a short period of time?"" Martinez said. ""It was an incredibly long period of time to be continually stabbed, to be continually followed."" And Arias, he argued, was well-aware of how much Alexander was suffering. ""He was stabbed in the heart, chased down and then he had his throat slit,"" Martinez said. ""Those approximately two minutes that we talked about must have seemed like two lifetimes."" Arias stabbed Alexander 29 times, slit his neck from ear to ear and shot him in the face. During the trial, she claimed she killed him in self-defense after he attacked her. Jurors found her guilty of first-degree murder a week ago. But that was just the first of a series of decisions they must make in the case, which has been marked by drama so intense that spectators have lined up to get seats in the Phoenix courtroom. Under Arizona law, before they could consider imposing the death penalty, jurors had to answer a key question: Was Arias exceptionally cruel when she killed Alexander? They answered the question on Wednesday. Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi had urged them not to be swayed by passion or emotion. He said that adrenaline surging through Alexander's body at the time of the attack could have prevented him from feeling pain. Haven't been following the trial? Read this . He also argued that psychological problems prevented Arias from knowing the pain Alexander was going through or understanding what was going on. In a rebuttal, Martinez countered that actions Arias took after the killing, such as cleaning up the scene, made it clear that she understood what was going on. As Martinez showed images of Alexander's wounds to the jury Wednesday, members of Alexander's family wept. Arias cried and looked away. After hearing testimony from medical examiner Dr. Kevin Horn and arguments from both sides, the jury deliberated for about an hour and a half before reaching a verdict. But the case isn't over. Arias, who testified for 18 days during the trial, could speak to jurors again in court. The jury's verdict Wednesday means the case moves to the sentencing phase. ""Now is a more complicated and a more difficult challenge for the prosecution, and a chance for the defense to really put on a case,"" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. The defense will have an opportunity to ask the jury for mercy and present evidence to support why Arias should not be executed. Witnesses may include Arias' friends and family, and Arias could make a statement to the jury pleading for her life to be spared. Members of Alexander's family may also testify. The jury then will deliberate for a third time to determine whether Arias should be sentenced to life or death. Its decision must be unanimous. In the case of a deadlock, a new jury would be chosen for this phase only. The trial's final phase starts at 10:30 a.m. (1:30 p.m. ET) Thursday. It's unclear how long it will take. One thing is clear, Toobin said. ""This is the last decision the jury has to make,"" he said, ""and things have not been going well for (Arias) so far."" There are 127 people on death row in Arizona. If Arias is given a sentence of death, she would be the fourth woman on death row in the state. Minutes after the first-degree murder guilty verdict was announced last week, Arias said receiving a sentence of life in prison without parole would be the worst possible outcome. ""I said years ago that I'd rather get death than life, and that still is true today,"" she told Phoenix television station KSAZ. ""I believe death is the ultimate freedom, so I'd rather just have my freedom as soon as I can get it."" HLNTV.com: Friend of Arias tweeting on her behalf .

"(CNN) -- Stories about weight loss usually have a beginning, middle and end. How did these people gain so much weight? What made them decide to change? And how much do they weigh now? But in real life, weight loss isn't that linear. Matthew Shack has struggled with his weight since college when a knee injury ended his promising football career. The 35-year-old from Oxnard, California, has lost more than 100 pounds several times, only to gain it back. ""My being overweight is just -- I don't know why it's happened to me,"" Shack says. ""I don't know why I (continue to) overeat."" After dropping out of college to join the work force, Shack ate out three meals a day, seven days a week. By his 20th birthday, the 6-foot-3 computer consultant weighed 400 pounds. He decided he wanted a girlfriend and knew it would be difficult to find one at his current size. So he started working out several hours a day. In six months, he lost 100 pounds. A short time later he met Amy. While the two were dating, Shack caught mononucleosis, or mono. For months, he slept 12 to 18 hours a day and slowly regained the weight he had lost. Amy didn't care. She had started gaining weight in middle school and never stopped. When she met Shack in 2000, she carried 180 pounds on her 5-foot-1 frame. The couple married after three years together. When she got pregnant with their first son, Sidney, Amy weighed 220 pounds. When she delivered their second son, James, two years later, she weighed more than 300. ""We were eating out, and having fun, and we just kept on getting bigger and bigger,"" Amy remembers. Medical emergency motivates couple to lose 538 pounds . The Shacks really wanted a girl to complete their family, but Amy had trouble getting pregnant again. After undergoing infertility treatment without success, they decided to become foster parents. The interview process was brutal. ""You guys are so large, what are you going to do when you die?"" Amy recalls the agency asking. ""Who's going to take care of the children when you pass on?"" It was something neither had considered. On June 22, 2009, the Shacks celebrated their sixth anniversary at Outback Steakhouse. While they chowed down on Aussie cheese fries, several rounds of bread and butter, salad, French onion soup, an 18-ounce prime rib, baked potatoes with the works and dessert, the couple realized they had to make a change. ""We knew we were heading down a path we weren't going to be able to come back from,"" Shack says. Amy decided that she would undergo gastric bypass surgery. Never a foodie like Shack, she figured the surgery would be the simplest way to cut back on her portion sizes. Shack made an appointment at his doctor's office to weigh in because his home scale wouldn't go past 350 pounds. He figured he would top out at 400 pounds -- 450 max. When the doctor's scale hit 500, he was floored. Shack decided to use the app LoseIt! to track his calories. He created a spreadsheet and figured out how much he needed to eat every day to reach his goal weight of 235 pounds in 14 months. ""At the end of the day, losing weight is really just a big math equation -- calories in, calories out,"" he says. Amy had her surgery the following month. ""The next day, it felt like a truck hit me,"" she says. But she pushed through the pain, altered her diet to eat small amounts every couple of hours, and lost 100 pounds in five months. Two months later, Amy found out she was pregnant. It was a girl. She lost another 40 pounds during pregnancy, which worried her obstetrician. But a healthy Samantha Shack was born on November 1, 2010. TV reporter: Lose weight or lose my job . Shack saw quick results as well. He restricted his calories to 1,400 a day and lost his first 100 pounds in a few months. By September 2010 he had lost 265 pounds and had reached his goal weight. LoseIt! called him its biggest loser ever. That should have been the end of Shack's story. But while losing weight is hard, keeping it off often can be even harder. Shack stopped counting his calories and tried to stick to a healthy diet without constantly monitoring it. He barely noticed when the pounds started to creep back on. ""Since my frame is so large, I don't gain weight in my stomach, I gain it head to toe,"" he explains. Over the next two years he reached 300 pounds, then 340. He and Amy became foster parents, and a new influx of kids reminded Shack why he had lost weight in the first place. In April 2012, he decided he wanted to do a ""century"" bike ride of 100 miles. Between April and November 2012, he lost 100 pounds in training. After the bike race he regained some, then dropped some. He recently started gaining again when he lost his job. But he's aware of his pattern -- and has a plan to tackle the extra pounds. ""I haven't been able to find my magic bullet,"" he said. ""There's usually some motivation point that makes me want to lose weight. Once I hit that goal, I kind of lose my motivation."" Amy has maintained her goal weight of 160 pounds for more than three years. She finished a half marathon in January. She stays active -- ""when you have six kids, they are your activity"" -- and continues to monitor what she eats closely. She knows people have gained back their weight even after gastric bypass surgery. ""I'm going to battle my weight for the rest of my life,"" she says. No one's weight loss story really has an end. The goal of a healthy lifestyle is to avoid ending the tale too soon.","Matthew and Amy Shack have lost a combined 425 pounds .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When American pop artist Andy Warhol visited Beijing in 1982 and was told there wasn't a McDonald's, he replied: ""Oh, but they will."" Twenty-six years after his death, Warhol, whose much-lauded prescience extended across visual and consumer culture, has popped up in China once again -- and he was right about the fast-food chain. ""Andy Warhol: 15 Minutes Eternal,"" the first major retrospective of his work in China, recently arrived in Shanghai with the aim of acquainting the Chinese public with the artist who created some of the most famous paintings of the most iconic figure in the country's history. Warhol goes to China . While Warhol's trip to Beijing was his first and only visit to mainland China, his engagement with the country started a decade earlier, inspired by former U.S. president Richard Nixon's rapprochement with the communist power in 1972. Ripping from the headlines, Warhol adopted Chairman Mao as his subject, applying his signature pop aesthetic to China's paramount leader. His series of portraits went on to become some of his most well-known works. ""Mao was front-page news in America and that was often where Warhol got his biggest inspiration,"" said Eric Shiner, director of Pittsburgh's Andy Warhol Museum, which organized the exhibition. He described Mao as ""classic Warhol subject matter."" Warhol relied on a copy of Mao's portrait photograph in the leader's Little Red Book of ideological quotations to create his paintings. Little did he know that he would eventually pose for a photo in front of the original portrait hanging in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. His trip to Beijing was an unexpected byproduct of a visit to Hong Kong. The industrialist Alfred Siu had invited him to the city to attend the opening of a night club, decorated with portraits of Britain's Prince Charles and Princess Diana that he had commissioned from the artist. Upon Warhol's arrival, Siu announced he had arranged a VIP tour to Beijing for him and his friends. Artistic inspiration aside, China also provided Warhol with a respite from the pressures of fame. ""It was one of the special places,"" said Christopher Makos, the artist's close friend and personal photographer, who accompanied him to China. He recalled that Warhol went virtually unrecognized in China, although the artist stood out for his unusual looks. ""As Andy would say, he didn't have to wear his Andy suit. Notoriety and fame is a double-edged sword....you have no privacy."" China's communist uniformity, with its blue sea of unisex Mao suits, appealed to Warhol's aesthetic obsession with repetition. ""He was all about multiples...and at the time, China was the ultimate multiple,"" Makos said. The country also provided a source of inspiration for Warhol's nascent modeling career. Warhol posed for Makos' camera with gestures he adopted from the tai chi practitioners he observed outdoors -- and even adopted the bared-teeth expression of the guardian lion in the Forbidden City in one photo. Can Warhol make a name in China? While Warhol is well-known within art and fashion circles in China (Shiner said 600 of these cultural elite attended the exhibition's pre-opening), he remains unknown to the average Chinese citizen. Many Chinese are familiar with certain Warhol works, such as the Marilyn Monroe or the Chairman Mao portraits, reproductions of which dot cafes and tourist markets across Beijing. But they are much less likely to connect the work with the artist -- or to even have heard of the artist himself. ""If you don't know who Andy Warhol is, I won't blame you. But if you say you've never seen his Marilyn Monroe portrait, I would have to jump into the Huangpu river and kill myself!"" wrote user @Jianisi_yangyang on Sina Weibo. A search on China's popular Twitter-like platform revealed many posts by users expressing ignorance of whom Warhol was or why he is famous. Having recently launched a ""massive"" advertising campaign and sat for dozens of interviews with mainland media outlets, Shiner is hoping to reach the masses. ""One of the reasons why I wanted to do this show is so the general public can learn about the artist behind these iconic works and realize (Mao and Marilyn Monroe) are just a few of thousands of images he made,"" he said. So far, it appears that this education is welcome -- and necessary. ""For the first time, I learned the charm of pop art,"" Weibo user @Yanmingdu wrote about the exhibition, while user @GracieMankedun posted, ""Just saw Andy Warhol's exhibition and I got a little confused. For example, I didn't understand the Campbell's soup cans."" ""The curiosity is greater than the awareness,"" said John Good, international director for post-war and contemporary art at Christie's, which is holding its second private sale of Warhol's work in Hong Kong this week. ""We've seen a great deal of interest and curiosity (among Chinese) about Western art and international culture. I think Warhol is a perfect artist...to show what Western culture is all about."" Christie's first private Warhol sale in Hong Kong last November attracted a mostly Asian demographic and managed to sell nearly half of its lots, Good said. Censoring Mao in China . However, visitors to the ""15 Minutes External"" exhibitions in mainland China will not see any Chairman Mao portraits. While Shiner was planning the exhibition with the host venue -- the Shanghai Power Station of Art -- its staff advised that exhibiting the Mao works wasn't a ""good idea right now."" A staff member told CNN that government authorities would have considered the works ""too political."" ""Of course, the primary concern is to get the show there and up and not put anything in a category that would ever question anything,"" Shiner said. ""Knowing that we would have the censors from the Ministry of Culture, we wanted to make sure... that nothing would put the show in jeopardy."" An editorial in the state-backed Global Times newspaper suggested that while Warhol may not have had ill intent, the ""provocative"" blotches of color splattered on Mao's face suggested that he was wearing make-up -- a disrespectful portrayal of the iconic leader. While Shiner acknowledged the Mao portraits ""could be read as a sarcastic or ironic portrayal"", he said Warhol ""definitely wasn't being critical. He always liked to blur the lines on gender, and making colorful men somewhat beautiful was something that he liked to do as an inside joke,"" he added. Once the Chinese public gains a deeper understanding of Warhol's work, he expects that the Mao works ""won't be as big a deal."" Influence on Chinese contemporary art . Warhol's influence on Chinese contemporary art can actually be traced back to 1981, when many contemporary artists, labeled as dissidents, fled the country, Shiner said. While most of them went to Paris and Berlin, two artists ""very specifically went to New York because they wanted quite literally to be part of Andy's universe"" -- Ai Weiwei and Xu Bing. Both artists have gone on to become some of the most recognized and celebrated names in Chinese contemporary art, and some would go as far as calling Ai Weiwei ""China's Andy Warhol."" ""Ai Weiwei loves the idea of multiples,"" Makos pointed out, noting Ai's most famous installations, including the 9,000 backpacks representing the schoolchildren killed in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, and the millions of porcelain sunflower seeds he poured into the Turbine Hall of London's Tate Modern museum. Shiner readily concurred: ""He's really gone on to model his entire art-making process and career on proven Warhol tactics, looking at repetition, multiplication, and critique of consumer culture. When you look at his Coca-Cola works, that's directly related to Warhol and it's really amazing how many things he picked up from Andy."" Ai's similarity to Warhol also lies in his social activism, which aims to change Chinese society through art, he added. As for Xu Bing, viewers may not immediately see Warhol in his work, Shiner said, but he described the artist as a ""huge fan of Warhol"" who ""loves the idea of repetition -- the formal arrangement of Chinese character after Chinese character, an endless array of similar looking imagery."" Unfortunately, neither artist became acquainted in person with their muse, despite moving to New York for him. Ai once spotted Warhol at a party, but did not approach him, Shiner revealed. ""As a young man, he was too shy to actually go and say hello,"" he said, recalling that Ai told him his English wasn't good enough at the time. Ai and Xu aside, the Warhol aesthetic and vocabulary has deeply influenced Chinese contemporary artists over the past 10-15 years, with its characteristic combinations of social realist imagery with pop culture and iconic brands. The Shanghai exhibition will run to July 28 and make its way to Beijing later this year. Meanwhile, Makos will also hold an exhibition of his photographs of Warhol next month in Shanghai, including images from their 1982 trip to China. ""His work lives on. Maybe (the Chinese) don't know him, but they know his work,"" Makos said, predicting that Warhol ""will get bigger and bigger in China."" ""Andy was the ultimate pop artist. To this day you can still find Campbell soup on the shelf in the grocery store and you can see multiples of them,"" Makos said. ""As long as that imagery is live and well, Warhol will have this built-in publicity.""

"(CNN) -- Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro became the second player in the world's top 10 to withdraw from the French Open when a viral infection ruled him out of Sunday's championships in Paris. The world No. 7 revealed that the virus had affected him when losing to Frenchman Benoit Paire in last week's Rome Masters. The 24-year-old's withdrawal follows that of world No. 2 Andy Murray, who pulled out of the year's second grand slam with a back injury. ""This is a tough blow, because these are the events you dream of winning,"" said del Potro, who won the U.S. Open in 2009, on the ATP website. ""Now I must get over this disappointment and recover completely in order to prepare at 100% for the tests to come."" The virus affecting Del Potro had prompted the tall right-hander to miss recent tournaments in Portugal and Madrid, and he returned in Italy with the hope of being able to compete at the French Open. Despite his exit in the third round, he will always remember his time in the Italian capital after meeting with the Pope, a fellow Argentine, last week -- an experience del Potro said he would ""never forget"". Del Potro reached the semifinals of Roland Garros in 2009 and the quarterfinals last year -- only to be beaten by Roger Federer on both occasions. He was joined in withdrawing from next week's event by former world number seven Mardy Fish, who is now ranked 41st in the world, and fellow American Brian Baker -- whose absences had been expected. Also on Wednesday, Caroline Wozniacki's terrible 2013 continued when the number one seed was beaten in straight sets by China's Zheng Jie at the Brussels Open. The former world number one from Denmark is on a terrible recent run of form, having now added a first round exit in Brussels to those suffered in Italy, Spain and Germany in the last month alone. The latest loss was all the more humbling given that Zheng had been on court four hours earlier to see off American qualifier Mallory Burdette in the first round. Wozniacki, who had received a bye into the second round, was beaten by Zheng's aggressive tactics with the Chinese hitting twice as many winners as the Dane (34 to 17). ""She's a very tough player and fought until the last point,"" Zheng was quoted as saying by the Women's Tennis Association website. ""I'm so happy I could win this match. We've played many times before and she's always so tough to beat. ""But she's also a very nice person, ever since she was a junior. I'm very proud and this gives me a lot of confidence."" Zheng will play Romina Oprandi of Switzerland in the quarterfinals, while Wozniacki must work out how to rediscover the form that took her to April's Indian Wells final ahead of Sunday's French Open.","Virus forces Juan Martin del Potro out of French Open .

"Geneva, Switzerland (CNN) -- Western diplomats and Iran appear to be inching toward a breakthrough agreement that could slow the nation's suspected progress toward a nuclear bomb while easing some sanctions that have hobbled its economy. Top diplomats from the United States, France, Great Britain and Germany rushed to Geneva on Friday to see whether they could close the deal, which has emerged suddenly after years of frustrating stalemates and Western suspicions of Iranian cat-and-mouse games with international weapons inspectors. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov may join them on Saturday, Russia's state-run Ria Novosti news service reported. China's foreign minister is also headed to Geneva, according to Press TV. The planned arrivals Saturday of those officials suggested negotiations did not reach a deal Friday night, as the chief Iranian negotiator -- Foreign Minister Javad Zarif -- had earlier predicted. Negotiations on Saturday will include a meeting of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and Zarif. ""The negotiations have reached (a) critical, very sensitive situation, and it needs decisions at higher levels,"" Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told reporters in Geneva. The emerging deal would ease some sanctions on Iran if it stops enriching uranium to 20% purity -- a key step on the path to a nuclear weapon -- destroys its existing stockpile and takes other steps, according two senior U.S. administration officials. For years, international leaders have suspected Iran of working toward nuclear weapons, fearful of the instability such a scenario could bring to the already tense Middle East. Those fears include the possibility of a pre-emptive Israeli strike that could spark a broader conflict. In the past, Iran has threatened Israel with military attack. Iran has denied working toward a nuclear weapon, and has said it will not submit to any plan that would totally eliminate its nuclear program. Despite those issues, Zarif said a deal is within reach. ""We are at a very sensitive stage of negotiations, and it is best if these negotiations are done at the negotiating table rather than on live television,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""But I can tell you that we are prepared to address some of the most immediate concerns that have been raised, and we expect reciprocally our concerns to be met by the P5+1."" He had earlier predicted the talks could produce a deal by Friday night. U.S. official: We think Iran wants a nuclear deal -- and fast . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is not involved in the talks, warned that the proposed agreement is ""the deal of a century for Iran"" but a ""very dangerous and bad deal for peace."" ""It's a very bad deal,"" he said. ""Iran is not required to take apart even one centrifuge. But the international community is relieving sanctions on Iran for the first time after many years. Iran gets everything that it wanted at this stage and pays nothing."" British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted Friday that he had discussed the talks with French President Francois Hollande and they agreed the talks ""offer an opportunity to make real progress."" Separately, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' atomic watchdog agency, announced its director will travel to Iran on Monday to meet senior Iranian leaders. The agency's nuclear experts will meet the same day with their Iranian counterparts in Tehran, the agency said. Despite the progress, officials said much work remains to be done. Kerry said ""some important gaps"" remain in the negotiations, echoing earlier comments from his French counterpart, Laurent Fabius. U.S. officials outline possible deal . Two senior U.S. administration officials said that, under the potential deal, Iran would agree: . -- to stop enriching nuclear fuel to 20% purity; . -- to render unusable most of its existing stockpile of such fuel; . -- to agree not to use advanced IR-2 centrifuges, which can enrich nuclear fuel five times faster than older centrifuges; . -- not to activate a plutonium reactor at Arak. In turn, the P5+1 would agree: . -- to unfreeze some Iranian assets held in banks overseas; . -- to consider easing sanctions banning trade in gold, precious metals and petrochemicals. Other sweeteners were also under consideration, they said. One of the officials said the deal is designed to ""stop Iran's progress by stopping the shortening of time by which they could build a nuclear weapon"" while also providing temporary, reversible sanctions relief to Iran. That official cautioned the deal is not done, but said it could happen if the Iranians agree to the P5+1's demands. Most sanctions to stay in place . Speaking to NBC on Thursday, Obama said the United States would retain its ""core sanctions"" in place against Iran while granting ""very modest relief"" from economic sanctions. ""So that if it turned out during the course of the six months when we're trying to resolve some of these bigger issues that they're backing out of the deal, they're not following through on it, or they're not willing to go forward and finish the job of giving us assurances that they're not developing a nuclear weapon,"" Obama told NBC, ""we can crank that dial back up."" Broader implications . The strategy of pursuing a phased deal ""is a sensible way for the administration to proceed,"" said Nicholas Burns, former U.S. ambassador to NATO. And if it works, reaching a deal with Iran would be ""stunning,"" said Jane Harman, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center and a former member of the House Intelligence Committee. ""This is way beyond the initial deal that people speculated about,"" she said on CNN's ""New Day"" on Friday. ""If this can work, if they can get to this agreement today, I see all kinds of advantages for other issues pending in the Middle East, like Syria,"" she said. Iran's cooperation could be key to ending the civil war there, she said. 'Getting to the root of the problem' The details were hashed out during a bilateral U.S.-Iran meeting -- part of an apparent effort on each side to mend fences -- which lasted about an hour on the sidelines of broader talks under way in Geneva. The U.S. delegation was led by Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. The Iranian delegation was led by Deputy Foreign Minister Araqchi. Iran talks: Do we want a deal or a war? ""The main issue is getting to the root of the problem, which is the enrichment issue and all things that lead from that,"" Michael Mann, spokesman for Ashton, said on the sidelines of negotiations. Moments later, the Iranian state-run Fars News Agency tweeted a quote from Araqchi: ""Enrichment is our red line, and its suspension is unacceptable."" Iran's supreme leader 'not optimistic' about nuclear talks . When CNN asked Araqchi about the issue of uranium enrichment, he declined to answer. ""The talks are extremely complex and are now going into a serious phase,"" Mann said. ""We want to focus on substance and hope there will be concrete progress over the next couple of days."" Zarif said Iran's nuclear program would continue in some form. ""There won't be a suspension of our enrichment program in its entirety,"" he said. ""But we can deal with various issues. Various issues are on the table."" History of the issue . The sudden progress in meetings between Iran and the group of nations known as the P5+1 or EU3+3 -- United States, France, Britain, Russia, China and Germany -- comes after years of stalemate between Western nations and Iran over its nuclear program. It also follows a slight thaw in relations between Iran and the West under newly elected president Hassan Rouhani. Iran has always maintained its nuclear program is for purely peaceful purposes, despite repeated findings by U.N. weapons inspectors that the country appeared to be conducting nuclear weapons research. In August, the International Atomic Energy Agency --the U.N. nuclear watchdog -- estimated that since declaring its nuclear program, Iran has processed 10 metric tons of uranium to 5% purity, the level used for nuclear power plants. The International Atomic Energy Agency estimates that Iran has a stockpile of 410 pounds (185 kilograms) of uranium at 20% purity. Weapons experts warn that this uranium could be further refined for use in a nuclear warhead. Although experts suggest that amount would not be enough for a single warhead, the IAEA has warned that it believes Iran's nuclear program could have ""possible military dimensions."" Iran has been under crippling U.N. sanctions related to its nuclear program since 2006. The United States first sanctioned Iran over its nuclear program in 2000. Resolutions and sanctions passed by the United Nations in 2006 called on Iran to halt all enrichment activities and clarify that its nuclear facilities were being used for peaceful purposes only.

"(CNN) -- An Ohio man who has been legally dead since 1994 will remain so in the eyes of the law after losing his complaint to overturn his death filing, according to authorities. Donald Miller, 61, testified Monday that he disappeared in 1986 after losing his job, leaving behind a wife, two children and thousands of dollars of unpaid child support, according to James Hammer, the attorney for Miller's ex-wife, Robin Miller. He was declared legally dead eight years later. Donald Miller said he returned to Ohio ""around 2005"" with no knowledge of his legal death, and that he had hoped to reestablish his Social Security number. A legal statute in Ohio prevents changes to death rulings once three years have passed, Hammer told CNN, and Judge Allan Davis ruled accordingly in Hancock County Probate Court. ""In over 40 years, I've never come across a case like this,"" the judge told CNN. ""In the end though, because of the statute, it was a pretty open-and-shut case."" Hammer recounts that at the time of Donald Miller's legal death in 1994, he owed Robin Miller around $25,000 in child support, a matter which could have been complicated had the judge ruled in Donald Miller's favor on Monday. Following the 1994 ruling, Hammer said, Robin Miller began receiving Social Security death benefits to support her two children. ""There could have been the possibility that my client would have to pay back what she received from Social Security,"" Hammer said. ""We certainly did not want to open that door, so we're satisfied with the outcome."" Despite her relief at the court's ruling, Hammer says his client has no ill will toward her ex-husband. Donald Miller's attorney was not immediately available for comment Wednesday. He still has 30 days to appeal the court's ruling, according Judge Davis.","Donald Miller testified Monday that he disappeared in 1986 after losing his job .

"(CNN) -- A 1997 Cadillac plowed into a parade crowd in Virginia on Saturday, injuring dozens of spectators and leaving others pinned underneath the car. The accident injured up to 60 people, with 10 hospitalized, but none of the injuries appeared life-threatening, CNN affiliate WJHL reported. Rescuers lifted the car to free people trapped beneath it after the accident in Damascus, said Bill Nunly, the town's police chief. A medical condition caused the driver participating in the parade with hikers to lose control and plow into spectators, WJHL reported, citing Pokey Harris, an emergency management coordinator with Washington County. It was unclear what condition it was, and the driver was not identified. Revelers and trail blazers were filing down a street in the town near the Tennessee state line to celebrate the Appalachian Trail when the sedan veered off the road. It ""then moved into the hiker parade, where it started striking hikers,"" Nunly said. It also crashed into other vehicles. Hikers and rescuers dashed after the car to stop it. ""The doors were open; people were able to make entry inside,"" Nunly said. Timothy Tabat was in the right place at the right time. ""I reached back and grabbed the handle for the driver's side rear door, jumped into the car, and put the car into park,"" he said. Then the crowd that had pursued the large car lifted it up to free those pinned underneath it. Of those injured, at least five or six were ""trauma victims,"" an emergency dispatcher said. The accident occurred during the Hiker Parade at the annual Trail Days festival, which honors the famed hiking trail. Dalton Thomson told CNN affiliate WCYB that he was pushed out of the way of the oncoming car by a hiker. ""We all looked back. There were hikers on top, hikers under the car,"" he said. ""It was unreal."" CNN's Chelsea Carter, Janet DiGiacomo and Jennifer Moore contributed to this report.","Bystanders run after the car, enter it and stop it .

"(CNN) -- Justin Timberlake and Kanye West may not always see eye-to-eye, but they have at least one trait in common: the inability to be cool. As Timberlake explains in the December issue of GQ, ""being cool is about keeping your blood pressure steady,"" rather than being passionate. Similar to Yeezus, Timberlake isn't the type of guy who can restrain himself from displaying passion, whether he's passionately in love with something or passionately in disagreement -- particularly when he's in disagreement with his critics. After surviving a stretch of negative reactions to his entertainment offerings this fall -- there was September's ""The 20/20 Experience -- 2 of 2,"" and his October release with Ben Affleck, ""Runner Runner"" -- Timberlake admits to GQ that it was ""literally like a bunch of people just took a s*** on my face."" To make matters worse, the crime drama ""Runner Runner"" was not only poorly reviewed, but it also didn't do well at the box office. (To date, it's made $19.2 million domestically.) So when reviewers told the 32-year-old that he should reconsider this whole acting thing, and probably should have also re-thought releasing the second half of March's ""The 20/20 Experience,"" Timberlake was feeling a little sensitive. ""This face ... This recognizable face that you work so hard to get -- not because you want the recognition but because you know you're made to do it"" also comes with a price, he said. ""The movie didn't do well at the box office, so I should quit? Hold on a second. If I was somebody else, you wouldn't have said that. I have the number one album this week, and I shouldn't have released it? Come on, man. You sound like a d***head.... It just shocked me because, like, you're trade magazines. None of your opinions count. And by the way, none of you can do it."" Although Timberlake has been in the business since he was a child, getting his start in entertainment around age 10 and building his fanbase on ""The Mickey Mouse Club,"" he nonetheless ""grew up with a little bit of a chip on my shoulder,"" he says. ""Sometimes I find it funny that I've been able to acquire the patience it takes to be kind to people in our business. Because sometimes I just want to f****g kill everybody."" So, no. Justin Timberlake isn't always as cool and smooth as his ""Suit & Tie"" portray him to be. But the actor/singer/entrepreneur -- who later apologized for going off on that ""tangent"" during the interview -- doesn't have any regrets. ""I've been doing this professionally since I was 10. If entertainment years were dog years, man, I'd be like Gandhi. I'd be like 250 years old,"" the recently married star says. ""Don't be cool. Be passionate. Be dedicated. Be tenacious. Be uncompromising. Be pissed. Be happy. Be sad. ... I've made a career out of doing things that I should not be doing. I wasn't cool about it. Because being cool would have meant I passed up on those opportunities. If you do that, it's because you're afraid. And what are you afraid of? You know?"" The full interview is in the December issue of GQ magazine, which has named Timberlake one of its Men of the Year, along with rapper Kendrick Lamar, ""Anchorman"" star Will Ferrell, Matthew McConaughey and the late James Gandolfini.","Justin Timberlake is one of GQ magazine's Men of the Year .

"Bhubaneswar, India (CNN) -- [Breaking news update 12:09 a.m.] . There have been at least four confirmed deaths from Tropical Cyclone Phailin, Amitabh Thakor, deputy inspector general of Brahmapur, Odisha, told CNN. Three were killed Saturday; a fourth was confirmed dead Sunday. Local police told CNN's sister network in India, CNN-IBN, that seven people had been killed by falling trees. [Last update at 10:24 p.m.] . In morning light, India assesses damage from Cyclone Phailin . (CNN) -- Morning light on Sunday revealed some of the damage from Tropical Cyclone Phailin, which made landfall on India's eastern coast as the strongest storm to hit India in 14 years. Power lines and trees were down and cars were overturned near the spot where the center of the storm struck the coast around 9 p.m. (11:30 a.m. ET) Saturday in eastern Odisha state, along the Bay of Bengal. Debris littered wet streets, roofs were torn off houses and windows on buildings were smashed in Brahmapur. Odisha's director-general of police, Prakash Mishra, told CNN that two men and a woman were killed by trees brought down by heavy winds in the state. Local police in Odisha told CNN's sister network in India, CNN-IBN, that seven people had been killed by falling trees. Hurricanes are known as cyclones in the Indian Ocean, and the wind speed at landfall -- 140 mph -- made it equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane. India evacuated more than a half-million people in advance of the storm, hoping to avoid a repetition of what happened 1999, when a cyclone claimed 10,000 lives. ""We have taken a zero-casualty approach,"" said Odisha state disaster manager Kamal Lochan Mishra. ""If people do not move, force will be used to evacuate them."" Since Friday, Phailin has brought nearly 8 inches of rain to Odisha's capital of Bhubaneswar, about 30 miles from the coast. The city's average rainfall for October is 6.5 inches. The storm will continue to fall apart as it moves over land, but tropical-storm-force winds are still possible through early Monday, said CNN Meteorologist Judson Jones. Rainfall will also be a problem as Phailin moves up toward the Himalayas in Nepal. Multiple states in the region were under weather warnings for excessive rainfall and thunderstorms for most of Sunday and into Monday, Jones said. 500,000 people evacuated . Residents were evacuated to safer places in Odisha and the neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh, national disaster-management authority chief Marri Shashidhar Reddy said. More than 400,000 were moved to safety in Odisha alone, he told CNN. Many of those evacuated from low-lying coastal areas of Odisha left on foot or by bicycle, Kamal Lochan Mishra said. They are being housed in nearly 250 emergency shelters set up in sturdy buildings like schools and government offices. The Ganjam district of Odisha is expected to be the worst hit, with disaster preparedness efforts concentrated there, CNN-IBN reported. The India Meteorological Department warned of extensive damage to kutcha houses, those made of flimsy materials like mud and bamboo, as well as damage to old buildings. Power and communication lines are likely to suffer large-scale disruption. Extensive flooding will also disrupt rail and road traffic, and crops are likely to suffer major damage, it said. In Gopalpur, a coastal resort town in Ganjam, restaurants were shuttered and streets deserted Saturday afternoon, as rain lashed down. Tourists and local residents were asked to leave the town. Power was out in coastal areas including Kalingapatnam, from where about 80,000 people were evacuated to relief camps, CNN-IBN reported. Some fishermen earlier told the broadcaster they had defied the order to leave, anxious to see what happened on the shore. Military deployed . Some fear a repeat of what happened on October 29, 1999, when Cyclone 05B, also known as the Odisha Cyclone, made landfall in the same area, killing 10,000 people. It was the strongest tropical cyclone recorded in the Bay of Bengal, with winds of 155 mph at landfall, and it caused more than $2 billion in damage. In advance of the storm, military units and National Disaster Response Force personnel were deployed to coastal areas with relief supplies and medical aid, CNN-IBN said. More than 20 medical teams flew to the region. Federal and state government ministers are being briefed on the situation, the cabinet secretary said. All flights to Odisha have been canceled and train services in the state are also disrupted, CNN's sister network reported. Disaster preparedness . International humanitarian organization World Vision said it was helping local community groups prepare for the cyclone's arrival. ""In a storm of this magnitude there is the potential for widespread damage to crops and livestock in the low-lying coastal areas and houses completely wiped away,"" said Kunal Shah, the head of World Vision's emergency response in India. ""So while we are praying this storm loses intensity, we're also preparing."" The organization has worked for the past several years to train local people in disaster preparedness -- including search and rescue, basic first aid and how to protect livestock -- and has thousands of emergency response kits ready to hand out where needed. ""We believe communities are better prepared than they were when the devastating cyclone hit in 1999,"" said Shah. CNN's Lonzo Cook reported from Bhubaneswar and Harmeet Shah Singh from New Delhi and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London. CNN's Khushbu Shah, Tom Sater and Ivan Cabrera contributed to this report.","Power lines and trees are down, cars are overturned .

"(CNN) -- Seven Egyptian soldiers who were kidnapped six days ago in the Sinai Peninsula have been freed, the spokesman for Egypt's armed forces said Wednesday. The men are now en route to the capital, Cairo, Ahmed Mohammed Ali said on his official Facebook page. Their release is a result of ""the efforts made by the Egyptian military intelligence services with the cooperation of the tribal sheikhs and the noble people of Sinai,"" he said. After the news, Egyptian authorities reopened the Rafah border crossing into Gaza in both directions, Egypt's state-run news agency Egy News reported. The crossing was closed for five days by Egyptian security forces to protest the kidnapping of their fellow soldiers, the official Jordanian news agency Petra said. Hamas leader Ismail Haniya congratulated Egypt on the release of the soldiers, calling it a ""major achievement by the Egyptian military and a reassurance of the Egyptian sovereignty in Sinai,"" Egy News reported. Gaza has been controlled by Hamas, a militant Islamic group that does not recognize Israel, since 2006. Some in the Egyptian armed forces reportedly suspect it of supporting radical Islamists in the Sinai Peninsula. Hamas on Sunday rejected allegations that it played a role in the kidnapping of the soldiers. ""The only beneficiary of the problematic developments at the Rafah crossing in the southern Gaza Strip is the Zionist occupation,"" said Hamas spokesman Salah Bardawil, according to the Hamas website. It's not yet clear who kidnapped the seven soldiers or how their release was secured. Radical Islamist militant activity has been on the rise in the Sinai. The official Egypt State Information Service reported Tuesday that a military operation was planned to secure the soldiers' release but it cited presidential spokesman Omar Amer as saying only that all options were open. Amer said Monday that Egypt would deal ""decisively"" with the kidnapping situation, the news agency reported. The government wanted to ensure the safe release of the soldiers and was determined that the same scenario should not occur again, Amer was quoted as saying. The Egyptian army sent dozens of armored vehicles and personnel carriers across the Suez Canal into North Sinai early Monday, the news agency said.","NEW: The Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza has reopened, state media say .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Every issue in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial is so disputed that even giving candy to jurors caused an argument. AEG lawyers gave a bag of peppermint candy to the bailiff to hand out to the jury this week. Even Katherine Jackson -- the pop icon's mother -- enjoyed the treat. But Jackson's lawyer raised an objection Tuesday afternoon, suggesting jurors might be influenced if they realized the source of the sweets. A compromise was reached. Each side can provide snacks for jurors, but they'll be placed at the bailiff's desk before jurors enter court so they have no clue who brought it. While the candy controversy might seem trivial, the stakes are high for AEG Live. The promoter and producer of Michael Jackson's comeback concerts could be found liable for billions of dollars in damages if the jury decides the company is responsible for the star's death. AEG execs face questions about Jackson's death . Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live for the negligent hiring, retention or supervision of Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death. The candy argument may be the most interesting thing about Tuesday's proceedings, unless you are a student of employment law and budgeting. AEG Live Senior Vice President/General Counsel Shawn Trell was on the stand for a second day hoping to give testimony that would convince the jury that Murray was chosen, hired and supervised by Jackson -- not his company. Murray never had an executed contract with AEG Live, although one had been negotiated. The doctor signed it and returned it to the company on June 24, 2009, but the AEG Live executive decided not to sign it after Jackson died the next day. Jackson lawyers contend Murray was already on the job, working under an oral agreement confirmed by a series of e-mails that promised him $150,000 a month to be Jackson's full-time physician. With Trell on the stand, Jackson lawyer Brian Panish played part of an interview that AEG Live President Randy Phillips gave to Sky News television soon after Jackson's death. ""This guy was willing to leave his practice for a very large sum of money, so we hired him,"" Phillips said. Panish also showed jurors an e-mail between AEG lawyers suggesting that Phillips told other interviewers AEG Live ""hired"" Murray. Jackson's manager's e-mails found, could be key in AEG trial . Trouble at the Front . The Jackson lawyers argue that AEG Live executives ignored a series of ""red flags"" that should have alerted them that Jackson needed help as he prepared for his comeback concerts. Earlier testimony from Jackson's makeup artist, choreographer and an associate director described his failing health and mental condition in the last two weeks of his life. Panish asked Trell about e-mails titled ""trouble at the Front"" between AEG executives and people working on the production starting on June 19, 2009 -- a night that show director Kenny Ortega sent Jackson home because of his strange behavior. ""He was a basket case and Kenny was concerned he would embarrass himself on stage, or worse yet -- get hurt,"" production director John ""Bugsy"" Houghdahl wrote to AEG Live top execs Randy Phillips and Paul Gongaware. ""The company is rehearsing right now, but the DOUBT is pervasive."" Phillips forwarded the e-mail to his boss -- Tim Leiweke -- at AEG Live's parent company, with the comment: ""We have a real problem here."" Jackson had missed a number of rehearsals and the ""This Is It"" tour debut was just three weeks away in London. Wade Robson calls Jackson 'a pedophile' Ortega, in an e-mail previously reported, told Phillips that same morning -- five days before Jackson died -- that he did not think he would be ready for the shows. ""I honestly don't think he is ready for this based on his continued physical weakening and deepening emotional state,"" he wrote. Ortega described seeing ""strong signs of paranoia, anxiety and obsessive-like behavior"" with Jackson. ""I think the very best thing we can do is get a top psychiatrist to evaluate him ASAP."" Even John Branca, a former Jackson advisor and lawyer who had just been rehired, weighed in with advice in an e-mail: ""I have the right therapist/spiritual advisor/substance abuse counselor who could help (recently helped mike tyson get sober and paroled) ... do we know whether there this is a substance issued involved (perhaps better discussed on the phone.)"" Does Trell consider that exchange a ""red flag"" that AEG Live should have noticed, Panish asked. ""I would take it seriously, as I believe Mr. Phillips did,"" Trell answered. ""I don't know I would use the word 'red flag.'"" Phillip called a meeting the next afternoon with Murray at Jackson's home. Afterward, he sent this e-mail to Ortega: . ""Kenny, it is critical that neither you, me, or anyone around this show become amateur psychologists or physicians. I had a lengthy conversation with Dr. Murray, who I am gaining immense respect for as I get to deal with him more. He said that Michael is not only physically equipped to perform and that discouraging him to, will hasten his decline instead of stopping it. Dr. Murray also reiterated that he is mentally able to and was speaking to me from the house where he had spent the morning with MJ. This doctor is extremely successful (we check everyone out) and does not need this gig so he totally unbiased and ethical."" The Jacksons' lawyer called this e-mail ""a flat out lie,"" since AEG Live had not done a background check on Murray before hiring him -- and if they had it would have disclosed that he was in deep debt and not a successful doctor. ""We did not do a background or credit check on Dr. Murray,"" Trell conceded. Witness: 'Everybody was lying' after Jackson died . No due diligence . The Jackson lawyers contend that AEG Live is liable for his death because they did not do their ""due diligence"" by checking Murray's background and credentials. If they had done so, they would have realized that Murray had a major conflict of interest that made him vulnerable to break rules in his treatment if Michael Jackson, they argue. Murray needed the high-paying job because he was more than $1 million in debt, his home was being foreclosed on, he was being sued for unpaid child support and delinquent taxes, and his cardiology clinic in Las Vegas faced eviction. His $150,000 a month job would end if Jackson's shows were canceled or delayed, according to the terms of his contract. AEG Live failed to conduct the background check, which the company's own expert witness said would between cost between $40 and $125. ""I am not familiar with the process of doing background checks,"" Trell said. ""No training."" Trell is back on the witness stand Wednesday for questioning by AEG Live lawyer Jessica Stebbins Bina. The trial, which is in its fourth week in a Los Angeles courtroom, is expected to last through July.

"(CNN Student News) -- ""Writing is hard work. If you want to succeed, don't ever give up!"" says 17-year-old author Michelle Izmaylov. Izmaylov, a senior at Alpharetta High School in Alpharetta, Georgia, speaks from experience. Michelle Izmaylov is an accomplished writer of fantasy-fiction books for young adults. An accomplished writer of fantasy-fiction books for young adults, Izmaylov published her first title when she was just 11. Izmaylov's second book, ""Dream Saver"" rose to No. 5 on Barnes & Noble's daily Top 10 fantasy fiction best-seller list. Her third novel, ""Galaxy Watch,"" is scheduled to hit book stores in December. CNN's Lisa Porterfield sat down with Izmaylov to find out how she started writing and the secret to her success. Porterfield: Michelle, what was your first book, and how did it come about? Izmaylov: My first book was ""The Pocket Watch."" The reason I wrote it is kind of an interesting story. My sister Nicole was 6 at the time, and I was reading ""Harry Potter."" Nicole tried to read it, but she couldn't because of the vocabulary. She got pretty upset. I didn't like seeing her upset all the time, so I decided: ""OK, I can't do anything with 'Harry Potter;' but what if I wrote another story for her, something that she will understand?"" And that's where ""The Pocket Watch"" came from. Porterfield: What inspired you to publish ""The Pocket Watch""? Izmaylov: The inspiration to publish it came from a schoolteacher. We were supposed to write a short story, and I was like, ""OK, I'll just bring in my book."" The teacher took it home, read it and loved it. She said, ""Why don't you try to publish it?"" I mean, it was just bizarre; I had never even dreamed of that, and suddenly it was an opportunity. And I said, ""OK, I can try."" Porterfield: What steps have you gone through to get your books published? Izmaylov: This first book was actually self-published, because it was OK, but it wasn't super-great. But I was absolutely amazed when ""Pocket Watch"" came out. When I held that book in my hands for the first time, I didn't care if it was self-published; I was proud of it, and it inspired me further. ... I  said, ""Let's do this again on a 14-year-old scale,"" which was the age I was when I wrote ""Dream Saver."" ""Dream Saver"" came out because of my passion for fantasy. That book I published through a traditional process. As a first-time author, it's almost impossible to get to a traditional publisher, but I won a short-story contest with the publishing company. Then, I contacted the publishers and said, ""Hey, I actually have a book written. Do you want to check it out?"" And they said, ""OK."" And that's how ""Dream Saver"" got out. So ""Dream Saver"" came out, and I was absolutely psyched! I was holding this book, this real book, that was traditionally published, and I start thinking, ""OK, it's good, but I can do better."" And so, when I was 15, I sat down and started writing ""Galaxy Watch."" I've been working on it for two years. It's book one of a trilogy, and it's a science fiction/fantasy story. Porterfield: What's ""Galaxy Watch"" about? Izmaylov: It's basically about my life, the way I would love it to be in a fantasy world. It's about this girl. She lives an ordinary life ... and everything is going great. And then she goes walking and finds a pocket watch and she thinks, ""Wow. This is pretty cool."" So, she picks it up and she's looking at it and suddenly she presses a button, completely accidentally, and it teleports her to another planet, another world. It's basically her adventures as she starts to discover that there are things other than just her happy little life on Earth. Porterfield: What's the writing process like for you? Izmaylov: It's a lot about not giving up. I had writer's block every two days. ... It's so difficult because of the way I write. I think of the beginning and I think of the end, and then I have to fill in everything in between. It's a lot of planning and a lot of rewriting. The version of ""Galaxy Watch"" I just finished, I rewrote five times from scratch. Porterfield: When you're writing a book, do you think about it all the time? Izmaylov: Absolutely! When I'm really into the book, it becomes this world for me. In the trilogy, I've been working with these characters for two years. These characters are as real to me as any of my friends or my family. Porterfield: Does writing come naturally for you, or do you have to work at it? Izmaylov: Writing is just like everything else: It's the classic 90 percent hard work and 10 percent talent. It's just a lot of hard work. My rule is write a little bit every single day. It doesn't matter what it is -- a homework assignment, a poem or an e-mail -- but you've got to write something every single day.","Best-selling author Michelle Izmaylov shares the secret to her success .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor underwent successful hip replacement surgery Monday morning to repair damage suffered when she fell out of her bed Saturday night, her spokesman said. ""We're all very relieved,"" publicist John Blanchette said. Francesca Hilton, Gabor's daughter, was with her mother as she recovered from the surgery at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. ""She is conscious and groggy and knows that the surgery is over,"" Hilton said. ""She is strong and hopefully will recover and heal."" Gabor, 93, is likely to remain hospitalized at least four more days, Blanchette said. The surgery lasted more than three hours, he said. ""Her doctors are happy with the results."" Gabor was sitting in bed and fell reaching to answer the phone, her husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt, said. She was watching the television game show ""Jeopardy,"" which is ""a must-see show"" for the actress, he said. Gabor has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, according to Blanchette. The crash occurred when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Her husband, who has been caring for her at the couple's Bel Air, California, home, is also a dark-horse candidate for governor of California. ""I will put it in a closet because my wife comes first,"" Von Anhalt said. Von Anhalt, 65, is Gabor's eighth husband, but after 24 years of marriage he is her longest-lasting relationship. ""She has an active mind. She's very bright. She's funny. She always makes me laugh whenever I talk to her,"" Blanchette said. ""Her body's failing her."" The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her eight marriages. Among her husbands were hotel millionaire Conrad Hilton and Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge;"" ""The Story of Three Loves,"" 1953; ""The Girl in the Kremlin,"" 1957; and Orson Welles' classic ""Touch of Evil,"" 1958. In 1989, Gabor was sentenced to 72 hours in jail for slapping a Beverly Hills police officer after a traffic stop. She also had to perform community service at a battered women's shelter. The other Gabor sisters were Magda, the oldest, who died in 1997 five days shy of 83, and Eva, the youngest, who died in 1995 at 76. Magda, an occasional stage actress, also was married to George Sanders at one time. Eva is probably best remembered for her role as a socialite turned farmer's wife on the 1960s TV sitcom ""Green Acres.""","NEW: Her husband says he will put his gubernatorial bid ""in a closet""

"(CNN) -- After the 2008 financial crisis had taken hold, the Queen of England asked, in essence: Why did no one tell us that the disaster was coming? The answer from a group of eminent economists, some of the smartest people on the planet, was to blame it on ""the failure of the collective imagination of a number of bright minds."" Do you wonder why a search on Amazon for the word ""creativity"" returns a list of about 90,000 books? Why a search on Google for ""innovation + creativity"" delivers 45 million results, and adding the word ""consultants"" boosts the number to 60 million? And yet, in spite of all that professional advice, it's the rare idea that is making money or delivering benefits two years after its implementation. Wonder why businesses insist that their expensive executives spend a significant proportion of their time (over three months every year) carefully preparing budgets, only to find that they are often out of date and need changing before they can be published? Have you been troubled by so much energy dedicated to summits and visions on how we intend to rebalance the environment or on how we intend to grow wealth for all, and yet with little in the way of accomplishments? Isn't it clear that the key is not the vision but the implementation? TED.com: Why you will fail to have a great career . Despite businesses spending decades professionalizing implementation in project management and change management, the results are underwhelming. To use an analogy to illustrate how woeful the results are, imagine a family of five planning to go on holiday from London to Hong Kong, with a budget of Â£3,000. If the vacation turned out like the typical result of a business plan, the family would end up in Makassar, Indonesia, at a cost of Â£4,000, while leaving two of the children behind. What's happened in business is that the rules of the real 21st century aren't clear to us, so instead we spend our time responding rationally to a world which we understand and recognize, but which no longer exists. In the past, the world in which we created our institutions, enterprises and organizations was built on a number of truths. In that world, the immediate past and near future were usually similar enough to allow us to predict the future with some confidence. TED.com: Keep your goals to yourself . As individuals or organizations, our experiences were mostly influenced by local events, and so by understanding our local business or national environment we could learn about the world around us much faster than it was changing. This meant that our knowledge and experience had a long ""sell by"" date. To be successful, we would ensure that the person who knew best had the power to decide and lead effectively from the top. Enterprises sought growth often by choosing to do ""more of the same"" of what had produced their success. But over the past few decades we have moved our world to a point where institutions, enterprises, organizations and individuals most often need to seek change. At the same time we have connected the world through cyberspace, allowing distant events, ideas and social phenomena to influence us instantly. And we've enabled people to connect to each other, fueling the density of human interaction. TED.com: What we learned from teetering on the fiscal cliff . The only things holding us back are the ever weakening inertia of habit, and tradition. And it is this shift in balance which has resulted in a silent transition, flipping from an environment which was far more predictable, Newtonian and laminar, to a turbulent and more complex new world. I call the transition point ""Midnight"" (the punch line of a weak joke about the fact no one noticed the flip because it happened at night while they were asleep) and I have been exploring how to think and what to do in this World After Midnight. I proposed an experiment to many clients: ""Keep a diary on a spreadsheet, for a week. Wait for four months and then score the time spent which either improved the bottom line or made your life better."" A typical result is about 15%. But these are not idle people. They are smart, well-meaning people, in top, well-resourced enterprises, who are working full weeks, often from dawn to beyond dusk. The result horrified me -- almost all of the time spent acting rationally in response to a world which doesn't exist turned out to be wasted. All the CEOs around me, my clients, want innovation, so they seek innovation. They say to people, ""Take risks and be creative!"" But unfortunately the words get transformed as they travel through the air. By the time the words enter their ears, what people hear is, ""Do crazy things and then I'll fire you."" Why? Because in the old world, getting stuff wrong was unacceptable. If you got something wrong, you'd failed. How should you be treated? Well, harshly, because you could have asked somebody who had experience. The answer is, don't do things which are different. And then suddenly we tell people to do things differently, and it doesn't work. TED.com: How ideas trump crises . In reality, there are two ways you can fail in our new world. One, you're doing something for which you should follow a set procedure, and it's a very difficult thing, you're sloppy, and you get it wrong. How should you be treated? You should probably be fired. On the other hand, you're doing something new, no one's ever done it before, and you get it completely wrong. How should you be treated? Well, free pizzas! You should be treated better than the people who succeed. It's called smart failure. My goal is to get executives around the world to realize that we're in a new world and that they have to rethink everything they do as a result.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- For the second time in a week, suspected Hong Kong organized crime syndicates -- known better as triads -- have targeted the production of ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" being filmed in the Chinese territory. Four men attempted to extort an undisclosed sum of money from a crew member inspecting a rooftop shot location in the district of Kowloon Tuesday, the Hong Kong Police told CNN. Police arrested and charged one 35-year old man with blackmail but his three partners remain at-large. The attempted shakedown follows a suspected triad incident October 17 in which two men assaulted Transformers director Michael Bay. Bay, 48, explained that every vendor that experienced disruptions from filming in the area ""got paid a fair price for our inconvenience"" but one man ""wanted four times that amount"" -- around $13,000 (100,000 Hong Kong dollars). ""I personally told this man and his friends to forget it,"" said Bay. ""We were not going to let him extort us. He didn't like that answer."" The man returned an hour later, ""carrying a long air-conditioner unit,"" added Bay. ""He walked right up to me and tried to smack my face, but I ducked threw the air unit on the floor and pushed him away."" Hong Kong police arrested two brothers in connection with the incident. In both episodes, triads -- known for their dealings in smuggling, prostitution and illegal gambling -- are believed to be involved. ""The two incidents associated with Transformers are indicative of low-level attempts to extort money from a big production by persons who may be triad members,"" said Steve Vickers, former head of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force's Criminal Intelligence Bureau and now CEO of Steve Vickers and Associates, a specialist political and corporate risk consultancy. ""The separate side of this is that the triad control of the movie industry in Hong Kong is a very complicated issue and has been in place for many years,"" added Vickers. ""The triads strangle the oxygen out of the local movie scene. They're not just extorting people for money. It's control of movies, starlets and distribution."" In recent years, triad-related crimes in general have been on the rise, according to crime statistics from the Hong Kong Police Force. For three years in a row, from 2010 to 2012, the number of triad-linked incidents rose nearly 15%. Most recent data for the first half of 2013, however, shows 988 triad-related crimes -- the second lowest reported number for the same time period over the past decade. But ""reported crime is not an accurate measure of triad influence,"" said Vickers. ""Triad related crimes are under reported.""","Suspected Hong Kong triads target Transformers filming second time in a week .

The incident took place Wednesday in Busan, a port city in the southern part of the country. The girl had left her apartment building with her parents when a 38-year-old tenant made his suicide plunge, said Busan Police officer Kim Gil-san. The man died on the spot. He apparently was being treated for depression, police said. The girl was taken to a hospital and died of skull fracture, Kim said. Her parents were unharmed.

"(CNN) -- As the first airline outside Japan to own Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Ethiopian Airlines has an impressive business record despite the global economic crisis. Growing 20 to 30% a year for the past seven years, the airlines' strategic plan is to carry 18 million passengers a year by 2025. Read related: EasyJet founder to launch low-cost airline in Africa . Tewolde GebreMariam, the airline's CEO, says his company is cashing in on Ethiopia's double-digits economic growth and its strategic location. ""If you draw a line through China, Africa, India and Brazil we are located right in the middle,"" he says. Read related: Worth the wait: Boeing 787 a hit with first passengers . But the company's future success depends on its ability to deal with Africa-specific pressures. Aviation infrastructure on the continent is lagging behind the rest of the world, and the lack of qualified pilots and technicians means airlines need to invest millions in education and training. Read related: Flier comfort: Boeing 787 myths and facts . As the global airlines continue to suffer from high fuel prices and dropping numbers of passengers, GebreMariam remains confident about the future of the industry in Africa. He sat down with CNN's Jill Dougherty to talk about the company's route to success. CNN: You just flew in on Dreamliner. What do you think is significance of this? Tewolde GebreMariam: Today we got the opportunity to experience what it looks like and what it can offer to customers and to airlines. So I would say to customers, there are a lot of new features. We experienced the amount of humidity at 40,000 above sea level. You feel like you are at 6,000 above sea level so it's more humid. So it reduces drowsiness and dryness, fatigue and jet lag. The windows are much wider than what we have in other airplanes today. From one of side of the airplane you can see the other side. It's 50% composite matter. Much lighter. And as a result of that, it is more fuel efficient -- it consumes 20% less fuel than airplanes in the same category. Read related: Farnborough airshow special coverage . CNN: I understand you have a 15 year plan with Ethiopian Airlines and the target is to meet ten billion dollars a year in revenue. What does that goal tell us about Africa's aviation industry? TG: Ethiopia is growing very fast. 11% GDP for the last decade continuously. It's among the fastest growing economies in the world. Africa is growing, so we are growing together. In our vision, 2025, strategy plan is to operate 120 airplanes. To more than 90 destinations, generating about 10 billion dollars, carrying more than 18 million passengers, 720,000 tons of cargo. We've been growing for 20 to 30% per annum compounded for the last seven years. So in seven years, we have multiplied the airline by five times. So this growth is predicted to continue mainly because we are leveraging and harnessing on our strategic location. If you draw a line through China, Africa, India and Brazil we are located right in the middle and we take advantage of this growth because these emerging economies are growing very fast. Video: 787 Dreamliner takes off . CNN: What other challenges you face in Africa that companies outside of Africa might not face? TG: We have many challenges. You are right. The first one is infrastructure. Airport infrastructure or aviation infrastructure in the continent. It is not as well developed as the rest of the world so much work is needed there. We're working with African governments to improve on that. The second one is brain drain from Africa to the developed world. And particular to the Gulf, and so this has been a problem for most African carriers. I think for all of us. But going forward we are building a huge aviation academy, the capacity has grown from 150 graduates to 1000 graduates a year. So going forward this program will give opportunity for the country. CNN: Where will this Dreamliner fly? What's the route? TG: This Dreamliner is the first in Africa and also the continent of Africa is first for us. We are a truly African airline. So it will be in Africa for the time being. When we get the second one we will utilize it on the Washington route. CNN: So we can take it! So you have plans to buy two? TG: No. Ten. Already ordered. We'll take delivery of four of them before the end of the year. Ivana KottasovÃ¡ contributed to this report.","Ethiopian Airlines became the first airline outside Japan to own Boeing 787 Dreamliner .

"London (CNN) -- Security experts are starting to analyze events leading up to the horrific cleaver attack of a man believed to be a British soldier on the suburban streets of London. One key line of inquiry they'll be following among the many leads: How does this attack relate to other incidents around the world? CNN Terrorism Analyst Paul Cruickshank says the precedents are not hard to detect. ""It's early in the investigation in terms of looking at the culprit and motivation but there's a track record of Islamist extremists inspired by al Qaeda ideology targeting soldiers in the West,"" he said. Other areas the security services would look at, he added, would include which groups -- if any -- were behind the attack and whether it was home-grown. Cruickshank said that there had been plots in the past when attackers had tried to target military personnel: the fact that Wednesday's murder happened near a military barracks in southeast London was significant. ""It's not clear if this particular officer was specifically targeted or he just happened to be walking through this area and was a target of opportunity,"" said Cruickshank, ""but it seems that more than one individual was part of this attack, so this could well have been planned. We just don't know."" CNN affiliate ITN has broadcast a video showing a man at the scene of the attack with bloody hands and holding a meat cleaver, saying: ""We swear by almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you."" He then continues: ""The only reasons we killed this man this is because Muslims are dying daily. This British soldier is an eye for an eye, a tooth for tooth."" Cruickshank cited the plot, uncovered in 2007, to kidnap and murder a Muslim British soldier. Four men plotted to kidnap a solider on leave and then decapitate him in a garage. Parviz Khan, the leader of the plotters, planned to behead the soldier ""like a pig"" and then post film of the killing online. It is not known if there are any links between this plot and the attack. Leading al Qaeda clerics have called those who target soldiers in the West ""heroes,"" Cruickshank said. ""These are people inspired by al Qaeda ideology in the West,"" Cruickshank said. ""Hero"" was the term militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki -- who was born and raised in the United States -- had used to describe Nidal Hasan, an American Muslim soldier based at Fort Hood, Texas. In November 2009 Hasan shot and killed 13 U.S. soldiers at the military base in November 2009. Hasan and Al-Awlaki had communicated on the internet before the shootings at the military base, used at the time by soldiers about to be deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, Cruickshank said. Al-Awlaki himself was killed by a U.S. drone strike in in Yemen in September 2011. ""The motivation in these past attacks has been the war in Afghanistan and Iraq,"" Cruickshank said. ""For a generation of Islamist extremists in the UK, Iraq and Afghanistan were their formative experiences."" In 2012, Mohammed Merah, a 23-year-old French-Algerian, went on a killing spree that terrorized France and left seven people dead, including three soldiers. Three children were killed when he attacked a Jewish school. He was eventually tracked down to his apartment in Toulouse, southern France, where he was besieged for 32 hours before being killed as security forces stormed the building on March 22. During that siege Merah told negotiators that he was acting on behalf of al Qaeda. A senior U.S. counterterrorism official later told CNN that Merah was believed to have linked up with Jund al Khilafah, an obscure Kazakh Jihadist group with ties to al Qaeda, just months before the attacks. ] . Cruickshank said the fact that such killings had occurred since foreign troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan had been scaled back was irrelevant to the attackers. ""The Iraq War is still very much an issue for these people. A significant number of these have been energised by watching beheading videos put out by groups like al Qaeda in Iraq.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Dr. Conrad Murray's ""severely distressed"" financial situation may have led him to ""break the rules"" in his fatal treatment of Michael Jackson, a police investigator testified Tuesday. Los Angeles Police Detective Orlando Martinez testified in the Jackson wrongful death trial that Murray was trying to deal with the large drop in value of his Las Vegas home, unpaid taxes and child support payments for eight children with seven women. Michael Jackson's mother and children claim AEG Live is liable for the pop icon's death because it hired, retained and supervised Murray, who worked as his personal physician as he prepared for his comeback concerts in 2009. AEG says Murray was hired and supervised by Jackson, whom they blame for making bad choices because of his drug addiction. One contention in the lawsuit is that the concert promoter should have known that Murray's financial stress could lead to unsafe treatments for Jackson. AEG lawyer: 'Ugly stuff' to come . Martinez, the second witness in the trial's first day of testimony, said that after interviewing Murray and after the search of Murray's car four days after Jackson's death, his ""thinking at the moment was the crime was negligence."" Inside the BMW -- which belonged to Murray's sister in Texas -- he found a contract between AEG Live and Murray saying he would be paid $150,000 a month to work as Jackson's doctor, along with AEG Live President Randy Phillips' business card and cell phone number, he said. ""That's a lot of money for anyone,"" Martinez said. ""Seeing the scene and talking to him about what he had done and how he did it raised questions."" ""Focusing on the financial aspect may have been important for Dr. Murray's willingness to disregard his Hippocratic Oath for financial gain,"" he testified. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to four years in prison. Prosecutors said Jackson death was caused by a fatal combination of the surgical anesthetic propofol and sedatives Murray gave him in a desperate effort to treat his insomnia. Martinez said what he learned about Murray's financial troubles in the weeks after Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, led him ""to opine that he may have, for this easy money -- the $150,000 a month -- may break the rules, bend the rules, to do whatever he needed to do to get paid."" His investigation revealed that Murray hadn't paid his mortgage in more than six months, his home was being foreclosed on and he had several liens for unpaid child support and tax debts, Martinez said. Murray's Las Vegas home, which he bought for $1.6 million, was appraised at barely $1 million in 2009, he said. The Las Vegas real estate market had suffered a major decline in home values up to that date. Elvis' ghost haunts Michael Jackson death trial . Judge rules: Jacksons can't watch trial without mom . The judge ordered that only one of Michael Jackson's brothers and sisters can come to court to watch the testimony at at a time -- and then only if Jackson family matriarch Katherine Jackson is present. AEG Live lawyers argued at the start of the second day of the trial that there was ""a risk in allowing any of them in the courtroom."" AEG expects to call Janet, Jermaine, Jackie, Tito, La Toya, Rebbie and Randy Jackson as witnesses in its defense. Only brother Marlon Jackson is not on the defense witness list. AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam said in his opening statement Monday that Jackson family members will testify about their failed attempts to intervene with Michael Jackson's drug addiction and their lack of knowledge about what was happening. The defense lawyers asked that Randy Jackson, the only one attending the trial Tuesday with his 82-year-old mother, be booted from court. After that, Jackson lawyer Brian Panish told the judge that Katherine Jackson, who can stay in court because she is a plaintiff, needed one of her children to sit with her each day. ""He can remain, but you cannot have five in the courtroom,"" Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos said. Because Katherine Jackson left the courtroom early to avoid gruesome testimony by a paramedic who described Jackson's death, Randy Jackson was unable to watch Tuesday's testimony. Randy and Rebbie Jackson attended court Monday, the trial's opening day. All of the siblings attended the 2011 criminal trial of Murray at various times. Having members of the famous entertainment family in court could influence the jury because their seats are just a few feet away from the jury box in the small Los Angeles courtroom. Paramedic: Jackson looked like ""a hospice patient"" The first witness called Tuesday was Richard Senneff, one of the Los Angeles County paramedics who responded to the 911 call from Michael Jackson's home on June 25, 2009. Senneff mostly repeated the testimony he gave as one of the first witnesses in the Murray trial, describing how he initially ""thought perhaps this was a hospice patient."" ""He looked like someone who was at the end stage of a long disease process,"" he said. ""No, no, this just happened,"" Murray told him, Senneff said. Jackson was not breathing and appeared to be dead, he said. An AEG lawyer asked him during cross-examination if he thought Murray was not telling him the truth. ""I don't even go there,"" Senneff said. ""I'm not worried about that."" Senneff's testimony is important to informing the jury about the circumstances of Jackson's death, but the drama that filled the Murray courtroom was not duplicated. In fact, humor sometimes emerged. Panish even asked Senneff whether he had ever rescued a cat. ""I have not rescued a cat,"" Senneff, who is also a firefighter, joked. ""I rescued a dog that was lying in the street."" He also shared the ironic story of the next emergency he responded to after leaving Michael Jackson at the UCLA Medical Center's emergency room. His ambulance was called to a west Los Angeles apartment to help an elderly Russian woman, Senneff said. ""When she heard the news on TV that Michael Jackson had died, she fainted,"" he said. She suffered a minor head injury in her fall. ""She was just deeply emotional when we took her to the hospital,"" Senneff said. Martinez will return to court Wednesday to resume his testimony, but the trial will break early so a juror can attend a funeral in the afternoon. A medical examiner from the Los Angeles County Coroner's office is expected to take the stand Thursday. No court is scheduled for Friday.","NEW: LAPD detective suspected Murray would ""do whatever he needed to do to get paid""

"Norman, Oklahoma (CNN) -- On Tuesday morning, the residents of Moore, Oklahoma, woke again to another nightmare. In the past 14 years, Moore and its nearby neighbors have been subjected to devastation from three major tornado events. The latest chapter in this nearly unimaginable history was the EF5 tornado that claimed the lives of 24 people and injured hundreds. But how unusual is this tornado in context? While the frequency is unusual, especially over such a short period, the actual tornado is less of an anomaly. Over the same 14 years, there were a number of similar events. The Joplin, Missouri, tornado of May 22, 2011, destroyed 25% of the town and killed 158 people. The path length for the Joplin tornado was similar in length and width, about 20 miles long and 1.5 miles wide. The ""original"" Moore tornado on May 3,1999, was rated F5 (NOAA now uses the enhanced Fujita scale, called the ""EF"" scale). It killed 36 people in Moore and had a similar path length. On April 27, 2011, fifteen EF4 and EF5 tornadoes tracked across Mississippi and Alabama -- many having damage tracks that extended for dozens of miles. So while horrible and sad, this extreme class of tornado occurs regularly in the United States. And when these tornadoes travel across populated areas, we see their awesome power at its worst. So what do we know about the conditions that cause these violent storms? First, the atmosphere must be what is called potentially unstable. Potentially means the atmosphere must first build up heat and moisture near the ground, like fueling the gas tank of your car for a long trip. Unstable means that if an imaginary balloon filled with air from near the ground were to be lifted upward, colliding with some weather feature such as a cold front, the ""balloon"" would become warmer than the surrounding air at that level. The initial ""push"" upward by the cold front on that balloon filled with surface air is like a child letting a helium-filled balloon go -- it just keeps rising. The difference is that on these violent tornado days, the balloon does not just rise in a leisurely way. It slingshots upward, especially when the air inside cools enough to condense all the water vapor it carries. It's the extra heat released when the water vapor condenses that is like a driver flooring a car's accelerator. The balloon of surface air quickly reaches speeds of 100 to 150 mph going straight up! Our ""balloons"" -- meteorologists call them ""updrafts"" -- are the engines of the storm. The energy released in the updrafts then interacts with our second ingredient needed for violent tornadoes, the change of the wind direction and speed at you go upward from the ground. Anyone who has flown knows that the wind speed increases with height. These violent storms almost always require that the wind speeds increase from 20 mph on the ground to more than 100 mph (horizontally) aloft. Spin in the storm's updraft is enhanced when the air entering the base of the updraft is from the south, while the winds further aloft are flowing from west to east. This is the so-called jet stream, the fast river of air that helps drive our weather, which interacts with the storm's updrafts to create a spinning column of air. It is this updraft spin, or mesocyclone, that creates the tornado. When the updrafts are strong and the wind shear large, the spin inside the mesocyclone becomes very fast. And in the most extreme cases, a violent tornado is born beneath that spinning white cloud of updraft that meteorologists call the supercell thunderstorm. So how well can we predict these storms? Tornado deaths during the past 50 years have declined considerably, indicating our forecasting and warning skill has improved considerably. The deployment of the Doppler radar system in the early 1990s by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration extended tornado warning lead times from five minutes to their now-annual average of 12 to 14 minutes. But other factors have improved warnings as well since then. During the past 20 years, supercell thunderstorms have been the focus of intense academic and government research to understand how they work and how they produce tornadoes. Two major field programs have studied these storms using dozens of mobile weather stations, aircraft and Doppler radars. The result from all these years of research and training was displayed Monday. Forecasters from the National Weather Service Office in Norman, Oklahoma, were very aware that the atmosphere in and around central Oklahoma had all the ingredients for significant tornadoes. Knowing that the atmosphere could produce a strong tornado, they immediately issued the tornado warning as soon as the Doppler radar started to show low-level rotation within the storm. This warning was 16 minutes before the touchdown of the Moore tornado outside of Newcastle, Oklahoma, and nearly an hour before the end of the tornado some 20 miles away. Undoubtedly, the long lead time saved countless lives. I'm one of a number of researchers at NOAA who are working on ways to combine all of the environmental, radar and other weather data into a computer model that will attempt to predict when the tornado will develop and how strong it will be as much as an hour in advance. This ""Warn on Forecast"" concept, while showing promise, is still years away from being a reality. So until then, when you hear the tornado sirens or tornado warning, take cover immediately. Like the people in Moore, your life may depend on it.

Apparently, that's what legions of us had in mind when -- humbug! -- the Netflix Instant streaming service went down. The outage, caused when some Amazon servers used by Netflix crashed, lasted more than 20 hours. Like many companies, Netflix pays to rent space on Amazon's massive banks of servers. The outage, which affected devices such as tablets and smartphones, began at about 3:30 p.m. ET Monday. Many Netflix users had to scratch those plans to gather around the laptop for ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""A Christmas Story"" or ""Santa's Slay"" (the 2005 classic starring former wrestler Bill Goldberg as a deranged Santa demon). Although for the desperate, ""Shrek the Halls"" was available on ABC. Netflix said service was restored Christmas morning. ""Special thanks to our awesome members for being patient.

"(CNN) -- The lone, tattered page from a decimated children's book sat quietly amid the rest of the rubble. But the words spoke volumes about the pain and nostalgia in the city of Moore: . ""I remember my old house, . Its rooms so bright and wide. Its halls will echo for all time, . With the laughter heard inside."" Mark Toney found the battered page while volunteering with LifeChurch.TV. ""It more than likely came from a house that had been demolished,"" said fellow volunteer Jared Bowie, who was with Toney at the time. ""Then I thought about how many houses were full of laughter and memories."" At least 12,000 homes were damaged or demolished from Monday's abysmal tornado, Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett said. The twister killed 24 people, including 10 children, and injured 353 in central Oklahoma. With everyone missing now accounted for, the daunting road to recovery is underway. Throngs of volunteers have come to Moore to help. Each has a poignant tale about the breadth of the human condition. Juan Olivo started searching for survivors as soon as the storm passed. He documented the search on video. ""Is there anybody here?!"" he bellowed as he walked past heaps of debris. In the distance, deep under a mound of shredded lumber, a man's voice replied: ""Here!"" Olivo and other volunteers raced to the wreckage. ""We're gonna get you out!"" Olivo told the man. He later told CNN's iReport he was stunned at the discovery. Basements scarce in tornado-prone area -- here's why . ""The odds of me filming and capturing this man cry out for help is one (in a) million, and I'm happy he is alive,"" Olivo said. Demands for storm shelters . Of the 10 children killed by the tornado, seven were inside Plaza Towers Elementary School. The twister crushed the school and reduced it to pieces. Kyle Davis, 8, was one of the victims. ""I am angry to an extent. I know the schools did what they thought they could do but with us living in Oklahoma, tornado shelters should be in every school,"" Kyle's mother, Mikki Dixon Davis, told CNN's Kyung Lah. Her daughter, who was also at Plaza Towers when the storm struck, survived. Photos: The path of destruction from above . ""There should be a place that if this ever happened again during school that kids can get to a safe place,"" Davis said.

Moore Mayor Glenn Lewis said he would push for a law requiring storm shelters or safe rooms in new homes.

""Anybody that lives in any tornado area should have (a storm shelter), but it's just the matter of cost."" Custom homebuilder Mike Barnett said an above-ground shelter runs $8,000 to $10,000; a small basement would cost $15,000 to $20,000; and a concrete cellar built during new-house construction would cost as little as $2,200. Looking ahead . On top of the human toll and grief, the cost of the tornado's destruction is astronomical. Insurance claims from the area are likely to exceed $2 billion, said Kelly Collins, a representative of the Oklahoma Insurance Department. But the Federal Emergency Management Agency is in ""good shape"" to support the recovery in Oklahoma and other disaster zones, such as New Jersey and New York after Hurricane Sandy, FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate said.

"(CNN) -- At noon on May 16, 1990, a runaway truck struck a minibus at the foot of Jerusalem and bound together the lives of 22 people: 18 Israeli Chasidim, two American Jews, an Israeli Arab and an Israeli Jew who had just found religion. The last died at the wheel of his bus. The rest of us returned to our homes to heal -- a medical jet flying me, my broken neck and a respirator back to New York. I was 19. In time, half of my paralyzed body returned to life, my spastic left side not quite keeping up with my right. I was a hemiplegic and would be always. And when last year I returned to Jerusalem at age 40, stepping from the plane with my cane and ankle brace, I hoped to write of the crash and its place in my life. It had taken me years to tease out where I ended and my disability began. Yes, I knew that had my neck not broken, I would have gotten a haircut that May day, would have played baseball in college, would have become a doctor. But what of the rest? Was it owing to the crash that I was not married, that I was ever-mindful of time, that people seemed to tell me what they told no one else? I wondered if my crash-mates wondered similar things. I wondered how they had made sense of the crash. And so, 22 years after it, I set off to look for them. *** . I found the Chasidim first. They were a large extended family that, together with me and my American friend, had been riding the bus to Jerusalem where they planned to worship at the Western Wall, the Kotel. I found them in the ultra-Orthodox town of Bnei Brak. They welcomed me into their home. Surrounded by seven shelves of holy books, Yaakov, the family patriarch, told me that God had caused the crash and spared our lives. He said we had to follow the example of Job and serve God though we did not understand him. TED.com: There are no scraps of men . Next, I found the widow of the bus driver. She was a secular Jew of Yemeni descent and lived in the industrial town of Petach Tikvah. (She wished to keep her name private.) She told me that her husband had feared nothing but God. And, she said, it was God who had ordained the crash. ""It is written,"" she told me. ""If you don't believe that, you will go crazy."" Finally, in the Arab town of Kfar Qara, I found the driver whose truck had crashed into the left rear of the bus where I sat. Abed told me that he had become religious after the crash and that the crash was an act of God. He then paused from his coffee and his Hebrew to speak an Arabic word: Maktoob. ""It is written."" I left Abed, mindful as I drove south toward Jerusalem that, in this land of competing narratives, Arab and Jew were for once in perfect agreement. *** . Maktoob made a certain sense to me, for I had long wished to see the story of what befell me written down, formed into a coherent narrative. But not by God. By me. And so, years ago, I had settled on my own variant of maktoob: It will be written. Now -- 23 years later -- it finally is. I have written my book. And it occurs to me that whenever any of us wish to assimilate why we suffer (or prosper), we must choose between these same two narratives. We can attribute our lots to God and his writings, his unknowable ways. Or we can root them in the natural world and chronicle them ourselves -- on paper or simply in our minds. We can take comfort in ultimate if inscrutable justice. Or we can take comfort in observable reason and responsibility. *** . At first, I threw my lot in with God. Never mind that I had long struggled with the theological implications of life's evident unfairness. I was being prayed for and I was recovering, and at age 19, that sufficed. Religion and maktoob were comforts -- the notion of divine authorship (and its obvious extension, ultimate justice) elastic enough to accommodate even inflexible facts like the Holocaust and that my mom was both good and burdened with a vascular disease. But in the end, whether one believes (or not) is not a choice. It is an empirical question. And in time, I came to see that I did not believe in a deity that choreographs crashes. I soon saw just as clearly the uncomfortable fact that I was agnostic regarding God (though my love of Judaism, its traditions and teachings, did not wane). Maktoob -- reassuring, prescriptive -- was gone for good. TED.com: My story -- from gangland daughter to star teacher . But the need in me to make sense of things was not. Like all of us, I still needed a narrative! And as the years passed, and I failed to translate my thoughts into words on a page, I feared, as had John Keats, . ""that I may cease to be . Before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain."" *** . I write narratives for a living. And so, seated at my Jerusalem window last year, ready to at last look back and write, I was familiar with the task at hand, the need to gather information and to then look for patterns in it. But as a writer, I also knew to be wary of pareidolia, the perception of a pattern or meaning where it does not exist. I knew that each of us is apt to overlook those patterns that do exist if they are inconvenient or painful. And I knew that particularly those narratives we write about ourselves can be as detached from the truth as those we inherit. And so, when written records -- hospital files, diaries, photos -- contradicted my memories, I deferred to them and tried to learn from the difference. That I misremembered that a girl in college had canceled our date after seeing my wheelchair a first time (when in fact she had long known that I used it) reminded me that I had long seen the shadow of disability where it was not present. And it was then I saw how similarly intent my crash-mates were to see God in a wrecked bus. Yaakov, the Chasid, told me that God had saved his family because grandmother Etel had said Psalms before boarding the bus. He did not note that the family had headed to Jerusalem only because Etel had suggested they go to the Western Wall (or that God might have done better by them by not causing the crash at all). The widow of the slain bus driver said that God had taken her husband. She did not note that he had died at a bend in the highway known by some in Israel as ""sivuv hamavet,"" the turn of death, where between 1980 and 2010, according to the State of Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, there were 144 accidents with casualties. Abed, the truck driver, said that God, not he, had caused the crash (adding that he had lived an unholy life before the crash, partying in Tel Aviv and Haifa). He did not note that he had ignored large yellow signs instructing him to shift his truck into a low gear (evidenced by police photographs of his brake pads). And he did not note that he had already been guilty, at age 25, of 26 driving violations. But I noted these things. And what for so many years had seemed to point to the arbitrariness of life was soon evidence of the opposite -- my broken neck the almost inevitable consequence not of a divine plan, but of a reckless driver, a truck loaded with four tons of tiles, a backseat with no headrest, and a dangerous road. And it was out of this recognition that the narrative of a slim book grew, careful always to make sense, to reflect, to contextualize -- the obvious efforts of a once passive victim to exert agency over an ungovernable act. TED.com: The why and how of effective altruism . That agency is important for the writer. It is what enables him or her to wring meaning from facts and observations, and then be free of them. And because agency informs the narrative, it is important for the reader too. Millennia after Job suffered, my Chasidic crash-mates put him forth to me as an example of faith in the face of sorrow. But he had ached to write his own narrative too. ""Oh that my words were now written!"" Job said. ""Oh that they were printed in a book!"" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joshua Prager.","23 years ago, a bus crash forever changed the life of Joshua Prager .

"(CNN) -- The view from the roof of Mohammed Younis's hotel in Giza, Cairo, is of a thousand lights twinkling on the dark surface of the river Nile. It's a pretty scene, but few visitors are here to enjoy it. As a waiter brings over beer and tea, Younis puts out a Marlboro cigarette and lights another. A tour guide and hotel partner whose livelihood depends on tourism, Younis is agitated, and understandably so. The World Economic Forum has just declared Egypt one of the most dangerous places on earth for tourists. The report puts Egypt above Yemen and Pakistan in terms of risks for visitors. ""Just like any other country, Egypt has dangerous places,"" allows a weary Younis. ""Yes, the crime rate has increased since the revolution, due to the economic situation, but this affects Egyptians, not tourists."" Why some travelers seek out the world's most dangerous locales . Younis is one of many. The country's tourism workers have been hit hard by political and civil unrest. According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), tourism employs directly nearly 18 million people. Tourist arrivals are far lower than in previous years. In addition to politically motivated violence that continues in the wake of the 2011 Egyptian revolution, there are concerns about the country's beachside resorts at Hurghada and Sharm Al Sheikh. Many worry that the new government, the Muslim Brotherhood, will impose strict morality provisions on these party towns, which are famed for their beaches and nightlife. Earlier this month, tourism minister Hisham Zaazou sought to quell these fears at the Arabian Travel Market in Dubai, when he alluded to Islamist groups calling for bans on alcohol and women wearing bikinis. ""Bikinis are welcome in Egypt and booze is still being served,"" Zaazou told reporters in Dubai. Egypt hotel goes alcohol-free, creates women-only floor . Tourists trickling back . Despite media coverage of calls by conservatives for an alcohol ban, tour guide Younis says he never expected the comments of hardliners to be taken seriously. Egypt isn't an exclusively Muslim country, and tourism has long been a lifeline for the Egyptian government, which is currently facing its worst economic crisis in decades. The country desperately needs the money that tourism brings. In 2012, UNWTO figures show international tourism generated $10.1 billion. Tourist numbers have fallen, from 14 million in 2010 to 10.2 million in 2011, and 10.5 million for 2012. The good news is that, after a sluggish start, total numbers for 2012 picked up with a strong surge toward the end of the year. ""Despite the ongoing political instability in 2012, main tourist attractions such as the Red Sea beach resorts, Luxor and Aswan remained very much secluded from the political turmoil, which allowed the tourism sector to slowly recover,"" says Maii Abdel Rahman, a research analyst at Euromonitor International. The first quarter of 2013 has continued the trend, with arrivals and hotel bookings showing a ""healthy increase,"" according to Rahman. Cairo slower to recover . Despite the positive outlook, the Egyptian capital of Cairo isn't a placid city two years after the revolution (arguably it never was). Gone are the days when tourists might visit Egypt's museums and pyramids and ignore the country's political turmoil. Tourism gains for 2013 come almost exclusively from outside of Cairo. Euromonitor's Rahman says that in the early days of the revolution, the capital's Tahrir Square -- the epicenter of protests that ultimately toppled President Hosni Mubarak in February 2011 -- became a tourist attraction in itself. The attraction proved short lived, as political instability in the country persists. ""With the ongoing unrest and growing security concerns, the number of tourists visiting Tahrir Square and Cairo in general remains very small, hence the low (hotel) occupancy rates,"" she says. The revolution is on the lips of every barman, taxi driver, shop owner and tout. Its graffiti adorns walls across the city. Despite the challenges, Cairo remains a fascinating, vibrant city, and local optimists argue that dangerous areas are few and far between. Luxor balloon flights resume . Fruit sellers, kebab shops and cafes bring peaceful crowds into the streets. Men sit in plastic chairs puffing on shisha pipes. Outside the Metro station close to the Al Tonsi, an unlicensed vendor openly sells Egypt's Stella and Sakara beers for a fraction of the price found in the city's trendy bars. In Zamalek, a 20-minute walk north, outdoor cafes are packed with young Egyptians sitting in the shade of the trees. Tentative hope . Mohammed Younis has landed another job, this one guiding a group around Egypt's ancient tombs and monuments at Luxor. He's grateful for the work, and, with his schedule filling up in the warm summer months -- generally a slow season in Egypt ahead of the busy autumn -- he can relax, at least temporarily. ""The unrest is still putting people off, of course, but I think people are starting to come back,"" he says. Younis remains hopeful, if not for a revolution, at least for a little more activity.","WEF: Egypt 'one of the most dangerous places on earth'

"(CNN) -- Ten months after being released from a mental institution, the suspect in the slaying of a West Virginia sheriff was able to purchase a gun that authorities say was used in the crime because his mental health information was not entered into a federal database, two sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. How the violent mentally ill can buy guns . Tennis Maynard, 37, has been charged with first-degree murder in the killing of Sheriff Walter E. ""Eugene"" Crum and with attempted murder after he allegedly pointed a gun at a sheriff's deputy who chased him. His family admitted him to a mental hospital in February 2010, according to both sources. That would have disqualified him from buying a firearm or even being in the presence of guns, authorities say. But in December 2010, Maynard was able to purchase a .40-caliber handgun at a licensed gun dealer in neighboring Logan County, according to the same source, despite a required, computerized background check. Slain sheriff's widow takes on his job . In West Virginia, once a mental hygiene commissioner adjudicates someone with mental health problems at a hearing, the state's mental health registry is notified and the information is transferred to the National Instant Check System. In Maynard's case, it didn't happen as soon as it should have, the sources say. Mingo County Prosecuting Attorney Michael Sparks won't confirm or deny that Maynard's mental health record was the specific information that was missing from the federal database. However, Maynard's mother previously told CNN he was involuntarily committed by his family a few years ago. Sparks said there was an 'inexcusable delay' in relaying information from the state to the federal background check database. Sparks stressed that the firearm dealer who sold the handgun to Maynard did ""what was legally required"" under the law and performed a background check. Maynard tried to buy another firearm in early 2011, but that attempt failed when the same computerized system flagged him as ineligible, Sparks said. It's unclear where Maynard tried to purchase the second firearm. It's also unknown how many guns were seized from Maynard's home where he lived with his parents and how many belonged to Maynard. Mingo County, West Virginia meet your new sheriff . Maynard's mother, Olgie Maynard, told CNN last week that her daughter signed paperwork to admit Tennis Maynard to a hospital and that he was there for about a week in 2010. She says her son ""went crazy"" in their yard. The family called police, and he was taken to a hospital. He also has been a patient at a local mental health clinic, she says. Booth Goodwin, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia, said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is continuing its investigation of Maynard's gun history. Goodwin has not yet decided whether to prosecute Maynard on felony federal weapons charges and declined to comment further. Lying on a gun purchase application is a misdemeanor in West Virginia, however, it is a felony under federal law, according to authorities. Maynard is accused of killing Crum on April 3 as he sat in his truck just blocks from the county courthouse. The suspect parked his car close to the sheriff's SUV and shot through the window twice, hitting the sheriff twice in the head, according to a state official who was briefed on the investigation. After a brief chase, Maynard was shot and wounded by a sheriff's deputy in Delbarton, West Virginia, after he wrecked the vehicle he was driving and raised his weapon. Sparks said the shooter used a Glock .40-caliber handgun to kill the sheriff. Investigators don't know what the motive is. Maynard is alleged to have made a statement shortly after he was shot, but authorities won't reveal what he said, saying only that it ""could have been interpreted in different ways."" Williamson Police Chief Dave Rockel says authorities later spoke to Maynard at his bedside last week, but the suspect was too medicated to make a lucid statement. On Wednesday, a judge appointed Huntington attorney Rick Weston to represent Maynard, who remains hospitalized as a precautionary measure to help protect his rights, according to Sparks. The prosecutor said he expects to bring evidence before a grand jury within the next couple of weeks. Investigators have been collecting several pieces of surveillance video evidence and receipts that put Maynard in the area of the courthouse, some within an hour of the fatal shooting, Sparks said. Police are still seeking surveillance cameras that might have captured the murder itself, Sparks added. A witness told police the alleged shooter was wearing a hood when he fired into the sheriff's vehicle, then fled the scene, according to Sparks. Crum's daughter said ""it's a strong possibility"" that her father was killed for vigorously pursuing the illicit drug trade. Crum had taken office only three months before his killing but already had built a reputation for taking out dealers and shutting down ""pill mills."" ""My dad fought tirelessly against drug abuse. He just wanted to clean up the county and make it a better place to live,"" Julie Hall told CNN. ""Things are still under investigation at this time. We really are unsure,"" Hall said. Crum's funeral was Sunday. His wife, Rosie, was appointed last week to complete his term, which runs through the end of next year. Mandated by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 and launched by the FBI in 1998, the NICS is used by federal firearms licensees to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. The reliability of the NICS system has been a point of contention in the debate on gun violence. A deal reached by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, and Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, aims to tackle issues some have with the current background check reporting methods. The Manchin-Toomey compromise would require states and the federal government to provide records on criminals and the ""violently mentally ill"" to the national background check system, addressing a criticism by the NRA and other opponents of gun laws that the existing system lacks substantive information. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report .","W. Virginia officials didn't update a background check database in time, prosecutor says .

"(CNN) -- As the number of children with autism has risen dramatically over the past couple of decades, experts have learned that the earlier a child gets diagnosed, the earlier specialized therapy can be initiated, which can significantly improve outcomes. Now researchers have been able to show that a particular type of behavioral therapy called the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) not only improves autism symptoms, but actually normalizes brain activity and improves social behavior. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that starts to become very apparent around age 3. The main signs and symptoms of autism involve communication, social interactions and repetitive behaviors. According to the latest statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in 88 children currently is diagnosed with autism, including one in 54 boys. ""Early intervention alters the trajectory of the brain and social development in children with autism,"" says Geraldine Dawson, the lead study author who developed the ESDM therapy along with study co-author Sally Rogers. Dawson was a researcher at the University of Washington when she helped devise ESDM; she's now the chief science officer for the advocacy and research group Autism Speaks and a professor at the University of North Carolina. Rogers is a professor and researcher at the University of California Davis MIND Institute. ESDM therapy uses teaching methods from ABA ,or applied behavioral analysis, the traditional one-on-one interaction between a child and the therapist. But rather than sitting at a desk next to the child -- where a teacher or therapist breaks down complex tasks into small components and gives tangible reinforcements -- children receiving ESDM are sitting on the floor, playing with their therapist or parents. It can be done just about anywhere, and Dawson says the play-based method of engaging a child helps him or her develop a social relationship. Autism event pegged to U.N. draws story of perseverance . The study began with 48 children in Seattle and Sacramento, California, who were between who were between 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 years old. Half of the children received a total of 20 hours of ESDM therapy over five days a week. But since parents can be taught the methods in just a few hours, they could engage their children using the ESDM method as well. The other half of the toddlers received community-based interventions, which included in some individual therapist sessions and some day care-based sessions. The number of hours spent with therapists was the same in both groups. Three years ago, Rogers and Dawson published their first findings from this study and found that children receiving ESDM therapy increased their IQ and language skills three times more than children in the community-intervention group. That in itself was ""very significant,"" says Dr. Thomas Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health, because it proved that early detection and intervention leads to improved outcomes. In their latest study, published Friday in the Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Rogers and Dawson show what parts of a child's brain are active after two years of therapy, compared to typically developing children, using an EEG (electroencephalogram). In an EEG, electrical activity in different parts of the brain is measured using electrodes that attached to the child's head. ""If the child wiggles too much, the data is not interpretable,"" says Dawson. In the end, researchers could only get 60% of the children to sit still enough to get usable EEG results, she says, but that was true in both the group of children with autism and those without. Fifteen children in the EDSM group, 14 in the community intervention group and 17 typically developing children underwent EEGs while looking at pictures of faces (social stimuli) vs. pictures of toys (nonsocial stimuli). Technicians measuring the brain activity had no idea which children had autism and which did not. ""Children who received ESDM now showed a normal (brain) response, identical to typical 4-year-olds,"" Dawson tells CNN. That wasn't the case with most children who didn't have ESDM therapy. With autism, no longer invisible . Babies are naturally drawn to people and faces, and their brains show greater responses when they look at a face, compared to an object or a toy, Dawson says. But in young and even older children with autism, the opposite happens. The part of the brain that should be responding to a face or social activity doesn't light up, but the part of the brain that responds to objects is more active. Insel says this study shows that the ESDM form of therapy ""not only changes behavior, it changes the brain."" The exact cause, or more precisely causes, of autism are unknown and there is no cure. Parents and pediatricians are urged to look for early signs of autism including: little or no eye contact, lack of or delay of spoken language, repetitive use of language and behaviors and persistent fixation on parts of objects. Since 2007, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians screen 18- and 24-month-old toddlers for signs of autism. When something is wrong in the brain -- not just in autism, but also in diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's -- what's causing the disease is occurring much earlier than when symptoms appear, Insel explains. Based on the new findings, perhaps using EEGs to measure this type of brain activity could be a biomarker for autism, he says. A biomarker is a distinct characteristic that indicates a particular condition. Measuring a baby's brain activity as early as 3 and 6 months could identify changes in the brain before changes in behavior are noticed, he says, and therapy could begin even earlier. The ESDM model could be applied as early as 12 months, say Dawson and Rogers. More research will probably have to be done to confirm the biomarker. So until there is a definitive test for diagnosing autism, Dawson says this it's even more important that pediatricians screen children for autism as early as possible. ""The average age of diagnosis is still 4 and 5 and even older in minority groups,"" she says. ""We really need to close the gap."" Autism Speaks has many tools on its website to help parents see what a child with autism looks like compared to a typically developing child. There are also many tool kits to help families of children with autism.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A pile of red, white and blue blankets on the cold, linoleum floor. This is how Kecia Cruz's 20-year old son had been sleeping since returning to live with his mother nearly two weeks ago. A family with a past -- Cruz has served time in prison and her son is a recovering methadone addict. Cruz sees her child's return as a second chance. She didn't want him sleeping on the floor, but she didn't know where to turn. Sitting on Cruz's back porch recently, her neighbor had an answer: Beremedy. Beremedy is an organization that utilizes social media such as Twitter, Facebook and blogs to streamline the donation of food, clothing and furniture to people in need. The name is a short way to say ""you be the remedy for someone in need."" The neighbor, who previously received clothing for her six children, reached out to Beremedy on behalf of her friend. ""We were just sitting out back and I was explaining about my son coming home, and I don't remember how the conversation come about no bed but she said, 'I know somebody that might be able to help you,' "" Cruz recalls. Beremedy tweets the need . Blake Canterbury is a charming 26-year-old with a background in new media marketing. He founded Beremedy in 2009, after flooding washed over parts of Atlanta, in order to get items such as baby formula and diapers to people in need. ""Everyone I've ever met in my entire life wanted to help other people; they just didn't know where to start,"" Canterbury says. ""We thought, 'What would this city look like with 10,000 people getting a text message at the same time of needs in their community? Surely people would want to help with that."" The process is simple: Canterbury receives needs from nonprofits, school social workers and individuals looking for help directly on Beremedy.org. Canterbury and a team of four volunteers use Google Wave to communicate about what needs they will accept or deny. Once a need is determined, a member of the team is assigned as case manager and writes a blurb about the story. Canterbury blasts out the write-up on Twitter and Facebook with a link back to the full story on Beremedy's site. ""We're putting a story behind it. We say maybe this is a single mom who needs a bed, maybe it's a middle school kid who needs a pair of shoes, but you know the story. You may not know the exact individual, but you know the story and you feel like you're connected and you know exactly where it's going,"" Canterbury says. The person's last name is omitted to protect confidentiality; the donor and the recipient will never meet. Social Media Week Founder Toby Daniels, speaking at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas last week, says while doubters often dismiss the scope of social media, smart organizations are using this software in transformational ways. ""For me, it's putting it on a spectrum,"" Daniels says. ""On one end of the spectrum you have dogs on skateboards, people talking about their lunch and the other end of the spectrum you have the uprising in Egypt, right? So two ends of a spectrum but created by the same single medium which is real-time communication, this network that Twitter provides."" Hairstylist Ragan Holt responded with a mattress and box set for Cruz within 15 minutes of Canterbury's post. ""It's the things that we might think we don't need and the things that we might consider trash is someone's treasure, and I love that they can put your things in the hands of those people,"" Holt said. So when Canterbury and fellow Beremedy volunteer Brian Sudduth, arrived with Cruz's new mattress on Saturday, March 12, mom had tears in her eyes. ""I don't know anything about a computer, I don't know how to text or anything like that, so, you know, I'm amazed at technology and just you know ... somebody helped me that didn't even know me.

"(CNN) -- Kyle Davis was 100% boy. He loved going with his grandpa to see Monster Trucks, and would hoot and clap whenever one of those giant things would roll over and crush a smaller car. Because he was a good kid and got A's and B's, his family would sometimes reward him with a trip to the lake and let him ride his four-wheeler around. The 8-year-old was a force on the soccer field. His stocky build earned him a nickname: ""The Wall."" ""Kids just bounced off of him,"" Davis' grandfather Marvin Dixon said Wednesday.

He told the kids, ""OK, I'll see you at 3. I love you."" ""I love you, too, Pawpaw,"" Kyle answered. Kaylee survived the twister that ripped the school apart around 3 p.m. She was in the main building, but Kyle and his classmates were hunkered down in another building, the Dixons said. ""It was just hailing, really coming down as that thing got closer and we got in the car,"" Marvin said. ""The school was in lockdown. I would have gone to pick them up. I would have. I would have risked it, but I couldn't. They wouldn't let me get to him."" Inside a tornado-ravaged school . The Dixons managed to outrun the tornado in their car. When they were able to turn around, traffic was backed up on the interstate. By this time, the Dixons had Kyle's mother with them. They drove as close as they could to the school, about two miles away, then got out and began running toward it. As they got closer, they could barely comprehend what they were seeing . ""Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"" Marvin said. ""My daughter was hysterical."" Photographer captures snapshot of courage . Kaylee had somehow walked away from the devastation with a few bruises. ""We're not angry at the school,"" Marvin Dixon said. ""But I want them to get something better for the next time because we can't say this horrible thing won't happen again. I want the kids to have a safer place to go in the future."" Mother leaves behind two young boys . Shannon Quick was at home with her mother and two boys. The debris cut open her midsection, and she lay on the floor, telling her mom she was having a hard time breathing. Joy Waldroop said her daughter, who was 40, also kept calling for her boys. ""She kept saying,'Tanner! Jackson! Tanner! Jackson!'"" Waldroop consoled her daughter and told her to lay still. Quick, who was clutching the pants leg of an emergency worker, died. ""All of a sudden her arm went limp,"" Waldroop said. She said her daughter had a profound effect on others. ""She was so good,"" she said. ""There's not a soul that doesn't love her."" Mother's instinct saves lives of 3 sons . Young girl was a 'ball of love' Angela Hornsby threw up her arms in frustration Monday as she sat at home watching a news anchor tell people to seek shelter underground. She doesn't have a basement.

She died along with Kyle and their five other classmates. Watch Hornsby talk to Anderson Cooper . Just last weekend, Hornsby's 14-year-old daughter and Jenae and all of Jenae's many cousins were at a park in Moore. They had just come from church. The girls were dressing up and joking around, wearing their aunt's wig. ""They loved to dress up and dance to Beyonce, pretend they were Beyonce,"" Angela Hornsby said. ""They would tape each other with their phones and play it back."" The 14-year-old is so upset about Jenae that she's been throwing up and is at home in bed. ""My daughter said to me, 'I don't want to sound crazy but maybe she's gonna call me. Maybe Jenae's not dead, Mom.'"" Angela doesn't know how her brother -- Jenae's father, Joshua -- is going to move forward. Tuesday night, Joshua Hornsby, talking to CNN's ""AC360,"" called his daughter ""a ball of energy, a ball of love."" ""She was the best kid anybody could have,"" he said.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. government will temporarily delay a controversial rule that would again permit passengers to carry small knives on commercial flights three days before it was due to take effect. The Transportation Security Administration said in a statement on Monday it would consider additional input from a federal advisory committee that includes aviation-related interests, passenger advocates, and law enforcement experts before activating the new regulation. Airline passengers had been cleared to carry knives with small blades, including some pocket knives, beginning on Thursday. The TSA did not give a new date for the policy to take effect. Small knives were banned along with a host of other undersized sharp objects, like nail clippers, screwdrivers and cosmetic scissors, after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. Opinion: Letting knives on planes would be insane . Al Qaeda hijackers were believed to have used box cutters to gain control of four jetliners. There has been a gradual easing of those prohibitions in recent years as planes hardened onboard security and the potential threats shifted from hijackings to attempts by terrorists to bring down planes with bombs. Knives are probably the most common items surrendered by passengers at screening points, aside from liquids. About 35 knives are seen at Baltimore-Washington International Airport on an average day and about 47 per day at Los Angeles International Airport, officials said recently. Under the plan, knives with blades that are 2.36 inches or shorter and less than a half-inch wide will be allowed in airline cabins so long as the blade is not fixed or does not lock into place. TSA Administrator John Pistole had previously told a House Homeland Security subcommittee that his decision on permitting small knives would stand. He said it would improve screening efficiency and allow security to focus on items that pose more serious threats to aviation. Knives on a plane? Really? But Pistole has been under pressure from congressional lawmakers, flight crews and others concerned the change dangerously relaxed aviation security and sent the wrong message to a flying public eager for more simplicity and efficiency in passenger and bag screening. Some of the nation's biggest carriers have also opposed the policy. The TSA statement on Monday said the delay would enable security planners to weigh new feedback and continue workforce training. U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer said the temporary move is a ""solid, commonsense step"" toward maintaining safe skies. ""This delay acknowledges that permitting knives on planes is a bad idea; now the TSA should go the rest of the way and end this flawed policy all together,"" the New York Democrat said in a statement. Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, also approved of the delay. ""Now TSA can go through the established process, seek input from stakeholders and consult with the (Transportation Security Officer) workforce -- so we can have a sensible security policy with stakeholder buy-in,"" the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee said in a statement. CNN's Mike M. Ahlers contributed to this report .","NEW: Sen Schumer of New York says decision to delay rule is a ""commonsense"" move .

"(CNN) -- Pinterest is the breakout social network of 2012, but even technology addicts could be excused for missing its rise to success. The web-based ""pinboard,"" which launched almost two years ago, barely got a mention on Silicon Valley news sites until six months ago, when early adopters suddenly realized that a site with millions of monthly users had sprung up almost unnoticed by the tech press. That's because Pinterest didn't take the usual route of Web-based startups: romancing early adopters and technology journalists before attempting to ""cross the chasm"" to mainstream adoption. Instead, Pinterest grew a devoted base of users -- most of them female -- who enjoy ""pinning"" items they find around the Web. While clothing, home decor and recipes dominate the site, inspirational quotes and humor are also popular topics for users to add to their pinboards. Interest, meet Pinterest: Site helps users catalog their passions . How successful is Pinterest? Unique visitors to the site grew 400% from September to December 2011, and just last week one study showed that Pinterest drives more visitors to third-party websites than Google+, YouTube and LinkedIn combined. Demographics are surely a large part of Pinterest's success: While technology's early adopters have sprung upon other interest-driven networks like Quora, these sites now suffer from a form of ""cumulative disadvantage"" in which mainstream users are put off by how tech-centric they've become. Delicious, a bookmarking service that hit it big during the ""Web 2.0"" era, relaunched recently with a Pinterest-like interface, but has failed to attract the same audience. Canv.as, meanwhile, is a similar pinboard concept, but caters mainly to those who keep up with the latest Web memes and inside jokes. Pinterest, by contrast, provides no barrier to entry for anyone looking to bookmark, share and comment on images and ideas from around the Web. CNN iReport: What's your Pinterest passion? There's more to Pinterest than its unique audience, however. If you'd mapped out the evolution of social sharing online a few years ago, you might have predicted that something like Pinterest would emerge. As tech entrepreneur Elad Gil insightfully explained in an article on his blog last month, sharing on the Web has been following three parallel trends. The first is that sharing involves less effort over time. The second is that social sites are becoming more visual over time. And the third is that ""people-centric"" recommendations are being augmented by ""topic-centric"" networks -- which is to say that while Facebook lets you explore the Web through information shared by friends, newer social networks organize content by topics of interest. Some in the technology industry call this the ""interest graph."" Social networks began with blogging tools like Blogger and WordPress, where you had to write an entire blog post to express yourself. Then along came Twitter and Facebook, and a simple status update was all that was required to share a thought on the Web. These sites then discovered even simpler ways to share: ""retweeting"" the updates of others and ""Liking"" Web pages on Facebook. Tumblr, now one of the biggest blogging platforms, also fits the trend: Not only is it largely used to share images, but ""reblogging"" the posts of others is a primary activity on the site. As for the trend toward organizing content by both topics and the stuff your friends enjoy, you only need to look as far last year's hit news app: Flipboard, which turns the news into a more visual experience on your iPad, personalizing your experience by highlighting links shared by your online connections and topics you find interesting. Pinterest checks all the boxes: It's a visual social network that organizes images by topic and lets you reshare with just one click. So will we see a thousand Pinterest clones bloom, or will the site's stellar growth continue despite others jumping on the trend? I'd say success is assured for Pinterest. Thanks to the ""network effects"" of these sites -- you join because your friends are already there -- it'll becoming increasingly hard to compete with the new king, or perhaps queen, of social bookmarking.","Unique visitors to Pinterest grew 400% from September to December 2011 .

"(CNN) -- South Sudan's Council of Ministers has declared Jonglei state a ""humanitarian disaster area"" and called on international aid agencies to provide urgently needed humanitarian assistance. The declaration came Wednesday during a council meeting led by President Salva Kiir Mayardit, according to a posting Thursday on the government's website. Government spokesman Barnaba Marial Benjamin said the council asked that international relief agencies, including the United Nations, provide aid to the Lou Nuer and the Murle ethnic groups and to people in other affected areas in the state. Marial said the council had resolved to deploy more forces to guarantee security. He further reported that the council had resolved to establish a high-level committee to effect reconciliation between the Lou Nuer and Murle. South Sudan gains control of town . The council of ministers directed the two ethnic groups to return women and children from both sides who have been abducted and to reunite them with their communities, Marial said. The council said the national forces were in full control of Pibor, in Jonglei. The United Nations sent a battalion of peacekeepers to Pibor last week amid reports that members of the Lou Nuer tribe were marching toward the town, which is home to the Murle tribe, after attacking the village of Lukangol. In a statement posted Thursday by the independent News Agency of South Sudan, Marial was quoted as saying the Lou Nuer should vacate Murle territory so that the government can deliver relief services there. He appealed to the commissioners of Uror and Pibor counties to cooperate with the government to ensure the return of the abducted children and property of Lou Nuer and Murle communities. The London-based Minority Rights Group International, a nongovernmental organization, condemned the attacks between the Lou Nuer and the Murle and called on the government to protect citizens from all ethnic groups. ""Competition between ethnic groups over scarce resources has escalated in South Sudan,"" said Chris Chapman, MRG's head of conflict prevention, in a statement posted on the group's website. ""At the same time there is a security vacuum, leading to the formation of militia groups and a breakdown of traditional structures of authority. This will continue to threaten the stability of the new nation, unless the government acts quickly to ensure security, inclusive representation for all communities, and equitable access to land and natural resources."" Ethnic tensions in the South Sudan state of Jonglei have flared as tribes fight over grazing lands and water rights, disagreements that have dissolved into cattle raids and abduction of women and children. Fighters first struck Pibor on Saturday, attacking a portion that was out of the reach of U.N. peacekeepers, said Col. Philip Auger of the South Sudan army. Benjamin said most of the Murle had fled when they heard the Lou Nuer were approaching. The nonprofit group Medecins sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders, suspended its activities in Pibor County. The group's clinic in Lukangol was ""burned and looted,"" spokeswoman Emily Linendoll said, adding that its Pibor clinic ""has been targeted."" The attack on Pibor followed reports last week that Lou Nuer fighters raided Lukangol, burning it to the ground and forcing thousands to flee toward Pibor. At least 50,000 people have fled the violence in the state, said Quade Hermann, chief of radio at Radio Miraya, a U.N.-backed radio station in South Sudan. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last week urged the groups to work with the government of South Sudan to find solutions. The violence in Jonglei state is the latest to rock South Sudan, which officially gained its statehood in July after separating from the north. South Sudanese celebrate birth of their nation . ""The attacks, which on the face of it appear to be cattle raids, have deeper underlying causes related to poverty, competition for scarce resources, the ubiquity of small arms left over from a decades-long war and marginalization of ethnic minorities,"" said MRG's Chapman. ""In addition, the conflict between the Lou Nuer and Murle is taking on a dynamic of repeated revenge attacks, highlighting the need for the government to take urgent action to protect innocent civilians."" According to MRG's 2011 research, some groups feel that they are not represented by the political system, and that resources have been diverted to more populous ethnic groups, leaving them poorer with unreliable access to land and resources.","South Sudan's Council of Ministers calls for humanitarian aid .

"(CNN) -- South Sudan appealed for international aid for a remote region that has been under attack by roaming fighters, as thousands of residents fled into the bush to avoid the violence. The government declared Jonglei state a ""humanitarian disaster area"" and called on international aid agencies to help provide urgently needed assistance. It is not yet clear how many people have been killed or injured in the violence. The United Nations said Thursday it was mounting a ""massive emergency support programme"" to help those displaced by fighting. The organization sent a battalion of peacekeepers to the area last week amid reports that members of the Lou Nuer tribe were marching toward two towns which are home to the rival Murle tribe. The Lou Nuer fighters, who numbered 6,000 to 8,000, have now agreed to leave the area following ""intensive negotiations,"" a United Nations statement released Thursday said. But as many as 50,000 people who fled their advance on the towns of Likuangole and Pibor now need food, water and shelter. ""The situation in humanitarian terms is grim,"" U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator Lise Grande is quoted as saying. ""They haven't had food; they haven't had access to clean water. In a number of cases, some of the people are wounded. They haven't had shelter. As the day progresses, you can see hundreds of people coming back into town and there is no question they are in trouble."" The U.N. World Food Programme has already delivered food supplies for some of the most vulnerable, including children, the statement said. Grande said the United Nations had helped evacuate citizens from the area and avert a greater crisis. Ethnic tensions in Jonglei state have flared as tribes fight over grazing lands and water rights, leading to cattle raids and abduction of women and children. Government officials have urged the two ethnic groups to return women and children abducted in the spate of violence. More forces will be deployed and a committee established to push for reconciliation between the two groups, according to government spokesman Barnaba Marial Benjamin. Kouider Zerrouk, a spokesman for the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), said Thursday that the United Nations was ""beefing up"" its presence across Jonglei state in support of government efforts. Zerrouk said the situation was now calm but UNMISS was operating daily land and air patrols to deter further violence and ensure the Lou Nuer fighters did leave the area. The mission would also help the South Sudan authorities transport about 800 additional police to the area, he said in a statement. Jennifer Christian, Sudan policy analyst with the Enough Project, said that while it's important to get emergency food and medical aid to those affected, a longer-term strategy is needed to avoid future violence. ""The underlying, largely economic, causes of this cycle of inter-communal violence must be addressed to ensure permanent peace and stability in Jonglei state,"" Christian said. ""In Jonglei, cattle is currency. For instance, young men need cattle to pay dowry prices and marry. A lack of access to basic services and economic opportunities compounds the reliance of Jonglei's communities on this cattle economy, which, in turn, fuels conflict associated with cattle raiding,"" she said. The international community should work to support the South Sudan government in developing its security forces and judicial system, she added. As residents fled the fighting last weekend, the United Nations said peacekeepers were having trouble accessing the rugged and isolated region, which is surrounded by thick forests. ""The problem we faced in this particular region of Jonglei state was one of access, because there are no roads, because of insufficient helicopters,"" said Herve Ladsous, the U.N. peacekeeping chief. ""So we did reinforce our available staff there. The government of South Sudan itself is trying to do the same, but facing the same constraints."" The violence in Jonglei state is the latest to rock South Sudan, which officially gained its statehood in July after separating from neighboring Sudan to the north. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005. But before South Sudan gained independence in July, human rights monitors expressed concerns that long-standing grievances could end in violence consuming the region again. The United Nations estimates that more than 1,100 people died and 63,000 were displaced last year by inter-communal violence in Jonglei state, not taking into account the latest clashes. CNN's Moni Basu, Nima Elbagir and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","NEW: The United Nations says it is providing emergency help to those most in need .

"(CNN) -- In 1974, a series of powerful tornadoes whipped through Alabama and devastated a small town called Harvest. It happened again in 1994, and then again last April. Kathleen Graves was there for all three. ""We're sort of a tornado magnet,"" she said, her voice quaking as she surveyed the damage to her neighborhood caused by the latest major storm system to hit her community. ""I'm basically starting to rebuild, just like I did last year."" Graves, 56, and her husband, Buddy, were still reconstructing their home smashed by April's tornadoes when an apparent twister barreled through town on Friday. ""My son called me and said there's one coming up Capshaw Road,"" she said. ""I could hear the ground rumbling. So I stepped outside with my coffee and I saw it."" Turning to her neighbor, she asked, ""Jim, is that a tornado?"" ""Hell yeah,"" he responded. ""Run!"" What happened next for Graves seemed a blur. ""I ran through my front door and out the back toward my neighbor's storm shelter. It was almost like I had blinders on,"" she told CNN Saturday. ""I wasn't looking where that funnel was, I was just running."" Moments later, the pair flung open the shelter's metal door and descended underground as powerful gusts swirled overheard. About 15 minutes later, it was over. Surveying the damage, Graves said her front porch and a section of her roof were gone. Much of the house's siding had also been cleaved off, rooms were damaged and carpets were soaked. ""I was lucky,"" said Graves. ""We didn't lose any of our neighbors this time. They didn't die this time."" The state's emergency management agency said Saturday that at least one person had died and 11 others were injured in Alabama after Friday's storm. The apparent tornado outbreak also killed dozens of others across the nation, leveling communities from Texas to Indiana and up through North Carolina. Seventeen counties in Alabama reported moderate to heavy damage, including Madison County, where the town of Harvest is located. ""Last year two people died right there on that corner,"" said restaurant owner Kim Shelton, referring to a nearby intersection in town. Shelton, 47, who runs the Harvest House Restaurant on a storm-damaged block, said the region has grown somewhat accustomed to treacherous weather. During last year's storms, she said, her store was damaged and lost power, but continued to serve food on open grills in its parking lot until National Guardsmen arrived three days later with much-needed aid. ""This is a close-knit community,"" she said. Harvest House has also become a neighborhood meeting spot of sorts, and is located roughly a quarter of a mile from Graves' home in an area where several other houses were damaged Friday. ""It destroyed my trailer,"" said resident Nancy Lawson, who had fled to seek shelter with her daughter in the neighboring town of Madison when she heard news of the approaching weather. Less than a year ago, her home -- a house that she and her family had built -- was destroyed in a similar storm. ""It was a nice house. I didn't have much money and no insurance, and so FEMA gave me the trailer."" In 2011, the Federal Emergency Management Agency dispatched disaster assistance, including trailers, after April storms tore through houses, downed trees and scattered debris across Alabama. But after Friday's storms, Lawson said her year-old trailer had been rendered unlivable. ""I'm 75 years old and I'm tired,"" she said. ""It just makes me feel real tired."" Mostly weary of the weather, Lawson says she now has plans to look for a place in Tennessee. ""I just trust in God."" Back at the Harvest House, conversations were abuzz Saturday with talk of the storm. ""It basically followed the same path it followed on April 27th,"" said Fred Allen Wilson, a 67-year-old retiree and long-time restaurant patron. ""It just got them again,"" he said of his neighbors. ""People are walking around dumbfounded."" Wilson, whose house survived Friday's storms, said last year's tornado cost him more than $40,000 in home damages. ""How much more of this are we going to take?"" he said. ""Some are saying, 'That's enough,' and don't planning on coming back."" Harvest is in the so-called ""Dixie Alley,"" a collection of Southern states, which includes Alabama, where warm-air moisture from the Gulf of Mexico mixes with cold air sweeping down from Canada. The mixture is thought to foster conditions suited for tornadic activity. ""When the seasons change, warm and cold air are fighting more,"" said CNN Meteorologist Monica O'Connor. ""That increases the chances."" But the specific path tornadoes take is ""largely happenstance."" State authorities say Alabama historically has been prone to the storms, and encourage residents to develop emergency plans for the start of what's commonly referred to as ""tornado season."" ""We always know that starting in March we'll likely have tornadoes,"" said state emergency management spokeswoman Yasamie August. ""Fifty-five percent of Alabama was hit by the storms last April, so it's pretty likely that we'll have had some repeat hits this year.""","Harvest, Alabama, has a history of coping with tornado damage .

"New York (CNN) -- Police in New York are stepping up their presence in neighborhoods with large gay and lesbian communities after a string of recent attacks on residents based on their sexual orientation. ""Hate crimes are down this year, almost 30%, but anti-gay hate crimes are up over 70%,"" Commissioner Ray Kelly said Tuesday, hours after the latest incident in which a gay couple walking in the city's SoHo district were assaulted by two men shouting homophobic slurs. One of the victims suffered an eye injury. Two men, Fabian Ortiz and Pedro Jimenez, were arrested and charged with assault in the third degree as a hate crime, Kelly said. And late Monday, another man was left unconscious after being struck in the face and head several times when he revealed he was gay to another man. The suspect, identified as 39-year-old Roman Gornell -- ""became enraged, and yelled anti-gay expletives,"" Kelly said. Gornell has been charged with assault and harassment as hate crimes in the incident. The rash of violence has caught the attention of city leaders, including Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who addressed the issue at a news conference Tuesday. ""No person -- regardless of what they look like or who they love -- should ever walk down the street in fear,"" Bloomberg said. In the past two weeks, five crimes against those in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community have occurred throughout Manhattan's West Side, according to the New York City Council. In the most violent incident, 32-year-old Marc Carson was shot and killed in Greenwich Village early Saturday by a gunman who allegedly made multiple anti-gay comments before the shooting. Elliot Morales faces a charge of second-degree murder as a hate crime in the shooting, authorities said. In response, police are setting up temporary headquarter command vehicles in LGBT neighborhoods at least through the end of June -- the city's Gay Pride month. ""Investigators say there's no pattern in these types of crimes,"" Kelly said Tuesday. ""These types of crimes are outrageous. And we are going to do everything in our power to see to it that they certainly don't occur but if they do occur we're going to very aggressively investigate them and bring people to justice."" Carson's killing inspired a march Monday by city leaders and members of the LGBT community to the spot where Carson was slain. After the march, New York City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn announced a five-point plan for keeping the city's LGBT residents safe. In addition to an increased police presence in LGBT neighborhoods, the plan calls for lessons in schools that address hate crimes and bullying. ""It was a cold-blooded hate crime that cut short a life full of promise -- and brought back awful memories for people who were once afraid to walk down the street with the person that they loved. New York City has zero tolerance for intolerance,"" Bloomberg said of Carson's killing. Erinn Cawthon reported from New York. Sarah Aarthun wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Kristina Sgueglia and Chris Boyette contributed to this report.","Anti-gay hate crimes up over 70%, police commissioner says .

"(CNN) -- When Germany's two biggest soccer clubs go head-to-head in Saturday's Champions League final, there can only be one winner: German industry. The Bavarians of Bayern Munich will look to rectify last year's heartbreak on home soil against Chelsea when they take on a formidable Borussia Dortmund side that is seeking to emulate the club's only success in Europe's top competition, back in 1997. Some of the biggest talents in world football will be on show at Wembley come kickoff at 1845 GMT in London, with the likes of Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Robert Lewandowski set to dazzle the crowd. But the all-Bundesliga final could just be the sideshow to a bigger German act, as billion-dollar corporates gear up for one of the major advertising opportunities in world sport. From sportswear multinationals such as Adidas and Puma to insurance giants Allianz and Signal Iduna, Wembley stadium will be awash with the household names of German commerce -- all helpfully beamed to a global television audience of potentially 150 million. Thousands of toxic yellow and crimson red jerseys will sport the names of Dortmund's sponsor -- chemical manufacturer Evonik -- and that of Bayern -- Deutsche Telekom -- as Europe's largest economy struts its industrial might on club football's most prestigious stage. Germany, Europe's manufacturing powerhouse, is considered one of the economic bright spots of a continent dogged by recession despite the country posting growth of only 0.1% in the first quarter of this year, driven mostly by consumer spending. Despite low growth, Germans -- recognized as the best savers in Europe -- proved they were ready to flaunt their cash as Dortmund received a staggering half a million ticket requests for the final while Bayern received 250,000. Wembley can hold just 90,000 fans. Football finance expert Simon Chadwick said the final will provide a ""brilliant showcase"" for ""Brand Germany,"" adding that the flair and style of the Bundesliga as well as the wide array of homegrown talent on display will enhance the brands connected with the teams. ""Existing brand associations that many people around the world have with German products -- notably efficiency and quality -- will no doubt be reinforced,"" Chadwick told CNN. Financial model of sustainability . The ties between German industry and football run deep. Unlike in England, France and Spain, where clubs are backed by Arab sheikhs, Russian oligarchs and American tycoons, the German league prefers a more homely approach to club financing. Christian Seifert, chief executive officer of the Bundesliga and a self-proclaimed Borussia Monchengladbach fan, is skeptical as to whether the final will boost the national economy, but he does believe the game will be a good advert for German football. ""Bayern and Dortmund are proof that it is possible to have good sporting performance and to have solid financial behavior,"" Seifert told CNN. Unlike other top leagues which attract more global endorsers, the Bundesliga clubs are largely sponsored by domestic brands -- 15 of the 18 clubs in Gemany's top tier for the 2012-13 season were backed by local companies ranging from multi-billion-dollar insurance firms to family chicken and dairy farmers. ""The big difference that you notice between other clubs in Europe is the degree of indigenous corporate engagement,"" sports finance expert Tom Cannon told CNN. Even the stadia are part of the Bundesliga's ""Brand Germany"" philosophy. While fans of Manchester United or Liverpool would scorn at the renaming of Old Trafford as the Aon Arena or Anfield as the Standard Chartered Stadium, regular rechristening is the norm for the 18 Bundesliga teams. So the Commerzbank Arena -- home to Eintracht Frankfurt and located in the country's financial heartland -- is named after one of Germany's biggest banks. Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park, once the Westfalenstadion, and Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena -- both tagged by insurers -- serve as further examples of the close links with big business in Germany. Chadwick believes branding stadiums reveals a consensus in football that is characteristic of German society and culture, where sponsor and fan cooperation is seen as for the club's greater good. ""This shows both a level of commercialism and a certain betrayal of history and heritage that some fans both in Germany and in other countries find unacceptable,"" said Chadwick. However, there is one fundamental rule for all Bundesliga teams that ensures fans are not kept in the dark when it comes to the control of their club. The ""50 plus one"" rule -- a revered model of football governance whereby fans are the majority stakeholder -- applies to all clubs participating in the Bundesliga, with the exception of Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg. Those teams were founded by pharmaceutical company Bayer and car manufacturer Volkswagen respectively and are 100% owned by these companies, with the stadiums -- BayArena and Volkswagen Arena -- named in their honor. This is due to a rule that states if a club in Germany receives major financial backing from one party for over 20 years, that party can then take a controlling stake in the club. The boardroom structure in the Bundesliga is unique and completely different to the big clubs in England, where a relatively small ownership group dominates the board. ""The boards of these (German) clubs are packed with corporate heavyweights,"" said Cannon. ""It's a confident assertion of German industry."" Although Bayern is owned by the fans, both Adidas and carmaker Audi have 9% stakes in the club, with the chairmen of both companies sitting on its supervisory board. In the case of Dortmund, 82% of the club is free-float stock and owned by the fans but the corporate board is dominated by businessmen with backgrounds in banking and shipping. Bundesliga boss Seifert insists he is not concerned by the intimacy between big business and football clubs in Germany because the revenue generated by the teams pales in comparison to big multinational brands' profits. ""I don't think they're too close,"" said Seifert. ""The good thing is that the 100,000 jobs are created through the Bundesliga in Germany. ""We're talking about global brands and they're using football as a marketing instrument all over the globe."" The strategy pursued by the German Football Federation and the Bundesliga after a poor showing at the European Championships in 2000 has paved the way for the nation's current success at both club and international level. ""Each club that wanted to play in the top two tiers of the Bundesliga -- 36 clubs -- had to have a youth academy,"" Seifert said. ""Today more than â‚¬100 million ($128 million) per year is invested and 5,000 players are educated in the program."" Dave Webb, a scout for English Premier League club Southampton who spent time observing the Bayer Leverkusen setup, explained that there has been major investment by Bundesliga clubs at grassroots level -- and players coming up from youth level are given more time to flourish than players in the English system. ""Bayern and Dortmund are very strong at youth level and that is behind their success,"" said Webb. ""Players are judged a bit later in the Bundesliga -- instead of 17 or 18, players can go right through to under-21 level before they reach the first team."" Given that co-ordinated strategy allied to long-term planning, no wonder ""Fussball"" is coming home -- to Germany.","Champions League final provides a ""brilliant showcase"" for ""Brand Germany""

"(CNN) -- Jason Russell, director of a documentary about a notorious Ugandan warlord that went viral, does not have a drinking or drug problem, according to his family, after the filmmaker was seen running through the streets of San Diego in his underwear. Russell was picked up by police Thursday after several people reported a man running through the streets in his underwear, screaming, sources said. While San Diego police declined to provide the identity of the 33-year-old man, an official familiar with the case confirmed him to be Russell. Police said the man, who 911 callers said was interfering with traffic and acting irrationally, was not arrested and was transported to a local medical facility. Russell is one of the founders of the San Diego-based nonprofit group Invisible Children, which produced the half-hour film about warlord Joseph Kony. ""Kony 2012"" skyrocketed to popularity on YouTube, propelled by thousands of posts on Twitter and Facebook, garnering nearly 80 million views since its March 5 release. ""Let us say upfront that Jason has never had a substance abuse or drinking problem, and this episode wasn't caused by either of those things,"" the Russell family statement said. ""But yes, he did some irrational things brought on by extreme exhaustion and dehydration. On our end, the focus remains only on his health and protecting our family."" The popularity of the film led to a flurry of media appearances for Russell and his fellow Invisible Children co-founders and prompted scrutiny from some who argued that the social media frenzy was too little, too late. Russell's family said some of the criticism has affected the filmmaker. The group has said it hopes the film and other efforts will make Kony a household name and drum up international support to halt killings, rapes, abuses and abductions committed by his group, the Lord's Resistance Army, in central Africa. Kony, who has operated in central Africa for two decades, is wanted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. In October, the United States sent 100 combat-equipped troops on a mission to kill or capture Kony. ""We thought a few thousand people would see the film, but in less than a week, millions of people around the world saw it. While that attention was great for raising awareness about Joseph Kony, it also brought a lot of attention to Jasonâ€”and, because of how personal the film is, many of the attacks against it were also very personal, and Jason took them very hard,"" the statement said. Ben Keesey, the group's chief executive, issued a statement Friday confirming that Russell was hospitalized for ""exhaustion, dehydration and malnutrition."" ""The past two weeks have taken a severe emotional toll on all of us, Jason especially, and that toll manifested itself in an unfortunate incident yesterday,"" Keesey said. CNN's Rachel Wells contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Jason has never had a substance abuse or drinking problem,"" family says .

"(CNN) -- On Thursday, President Barack Obama is scheduled to deliver a major speech in Washington about his administration's counterterrorism policies, focusing on the rationale and legal framework for the controversial CIA drone program and his plans to wind down the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay. So we thought it might be useful to examine some common myths about the drone program and the prison population at Guantanamo. 1. Drone strikes largely target the leaders of terrorist groups that threaten the United States. In fact, of the thousands who have been killed in CIA drone strikes in Pakistan, only 37 were leaders of al Qaeda or affiliated organizations, according to a tally by the New America Foundation. And even if we add to that list the leaders of the Taliban who have been killed in drone strikes, only 2% of the victims of the CIA strikes in Pakistan have been militant leaders. The drone program, which began more than a decade ago as a tool to kill leaders of terrorist groups, has evolved today into a counterinsurgency air force whose principal victims in Pakistan are lower-level members of the Taliban. Drones, by the numbers . 2. Drone strikes target specific terrorists who pose some kind of imminent threat to the U.S. Obama's top counterterrorism adviser and now CIA Director John Brennan said in a speech last year that ""in order to prevent terrorist attacks on the United States and to save American lives -- the United States government conducts targeted strikes against specific al Qaeda terrorists."" That's only partly true, because the CIA has also has occasionally conducted ""signature strikes"" against groups of men who display a particular behavioral ""signature"" that indicates they may be militants. In these cases, the targeter does not know the identity of the persons in the drone cross hairs. 3. Drone strikes kill a lot of civilians. That was certainly once the case. Under President George W. Bush, the proportion of those killed by drones in Pakistan who were identified in reliable news reports as civilians or ""unknowns"" -- people who were not identified definitively as either civilians or militants -- was around 40%, according to data assembled by the New America Foundation. But the civilian and ""unknown"" casualty rate from drone strikes has fallen steadily over the life of the program. Under Obama that number has fallen to 16%. And in 2012 it was around 11%. In 2012, 2% of the drones' victims were characterized as civilians in news reports and 9% were described in a manner that made it ambiguous whether they were militants or civilians. And in 2013, civilian casualties are at their lowest ever. That is partly the result of a sharply reduced number of drone strikes in Pakistan -- 12 so far in 2013, compared with a record 122 in 2010 -- and also more precise targeting. According to data collected by the New America Foundation, three to five ""unknown"" individuals have been killed so far in drone strikes in 2013. Two other organizations that track the CIA drone program in Pakistan, the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Long War Journal, report zero to four civilian deaths and 11 civilian deaths respectively. 4. The United States has no reason to worry about the legal framework governing drone strikes because it is so dominant in drone technology. Only three countries currently are confirmed to possess armed drones -- Israel, the United Kingdom and the U.S. But some 80 countries have drones, according to a count by the New America Foundation, and a number of them may already be able to arm them. In February, a Chinese state-run newspaper reported that the Chinese government had contemplated deploying an armed drone in a remote, mountainous area to kill a drug lord, but decided instead to capture him. Iran unveiled what it claimed was its first armed drone in 2010. During a speech last week at the New America Foundation, the U.N. special rapporteur for counterterrorism and human rights, Ben Emmerson, estimated that ""within a matter of certainly a year or two, other states will be deploying the technology, and within five years or so we will see a number of states and possibly nonstate actors deploying similar types of combat technology."" Emmerson also pointed out that the rapid proliferation of drone technology means whatever legal framework the United States puts together to justify its targeted killing campaign ""has to be a framework that we can live with if it is being used by Iran when it is deploying drones against Iranian dissidents hiding inside the territory of Syria or Turkey or Iraq."" A sobering and instructive thought. 5. The Pakistani government gives a wink and a nod to the drone program, providing tacit approval for its continuation. It is true that Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf quietly agreed to allow the CIA's targeted killing campaign to begin in 2004. But the program has become deeply controversial and unpopular in Pakistan because of the perception that it kills many civilians and that it erodes Pakistan's national sovereignty. In April 2012, the Pakistani parliament voted unanimously to rescind any previous permission that had been granted by the government for the CIA to conduct the targeted killing program. During Ben Emmerson's visit to Pakistan in March to discuss the CIA drone program with top officials, the point made to him ""consistently, right across government, at the highest level and throughout, was that there is no continuing consent to the use of drones on Pakistani territory."" The next Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who was elected on May 11 with a clear mandate, has urged an end to the drone strikes, telling reporters, ""Drones indeed are challenging our sovereignty. Of course we have taken this matter up very seriously. I think this is a very serious issue, and our concern must be understood properly."" 6. Obama is soft on terrorists. The CIA has conducted 355 drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal regions since the targeted killing program began there in 2004. The vast majority of these -- 307 to be precise -- were carried out under Obama. Even if you take the most conservative estimate of the numbers of people the Obama administration has killed in drone strikes in Pakistan, 1,600, that is around twice the total number of prisoners that Bush sent to Guantanamo. 7. Many of the Guantanamo detainees who have been released return to the battlefield. The U.S. government claims that 27% of those released from Guantanamo are suspected or confirmed to have taken up arms. For security reasons the government hasn't released the names of these men since 2009, but a review of the public record suggests that number is quite inflated. According to a review by the New America Foundation of news articles, Pentagon reports, and other relevant documents, of the 603 detainees who have been released from the prison, only 17 individuals (2.8%) are confirmed to have engaged in terrorist or insurgent activities against the United States or its citizens, while 21 individuals (3.5%) are suspected of engaging in such activities. 8. The detainees still held at Guantanamo are too dangerous to release. Some undoubtedly are, such as the operational commander of 9/11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. But contrary to the fulminations of officials such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina -- who said last year that Guantanamo detainees are ""crazy bastards that want to kill us all"" -- half of the men still held at the prison camp were cleared for release three years ago by a task force of Department of Justice and Pentagon officials. To be exact, 86 of the 166 men still imprisoned at Guantanamo were either found to be guilty of nothing, or were low-level fighters who could be repatriated subject to some continued monitoring by their home country's government. 9. There are no benefits for the U.S. to release additional prisoners from Guantanamo. Obama correctly said of Guantanamo in April, ""It is expensive. It is inefficient. It hurts us in terms of our international standing. It lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts. It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed."" The cost per year to keep one prisoner at Guantanamo is estimated to be $800,000, more than 30 times the cost of keeping a prisoner in a jail in the United States. And the Pentagon is asking Congress to approve a $200 million renovation plan for the prison. The prisoners at Guantanamo have also featured frequently in jihadist propaganda, making it a recruitment tool for would-be al Qaeda members. There is also a way forward through Guantanamo to obtaining some kind of peace deal with the Taliban. As a ""confidence-building measure"" for peace negotiations, theTaliban have agreed to release the only U.S. prisoner of war, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, in exchange for a handful of senior Taliban figures being held at Guantanamo, who would then be held under some form of house arrest in the Persian Gulf state of Qatar. This deal is a precondition for continuing serious peace talks with the Taliban. The 27-year-old soldier has been in captivity since the Taliban seized him on June 30, 2009.","President Obama to speak Thursday on drone program, Guantanamo .

"New York (CNN) -- Details started to trickle out Tuesday about the engineer at the center of Sunday's New York train derailment. William Rockefeller Jr., or Billy, has worked as a locomotive engineer for almost 11 years, according to Anthony Bottalico, a union representative who has been meeting with the man. He said Rockefeller started out as a janitor at Grand Central and ""worked his way up."" ""He's a man of a lot of character. He's honest. He's sincere. He's never been disciplined, that I know of, on the railroad,"" said Bottalico. ""He's got a great attitude and he comes to work every day, and everybody's very proud and honored to work with him."" The representative described Rockefeller, who is cooperating with authorities, as a good human being, a strong person and someone who goes out of his way for others. ""I think it takes a strong man to come down and ... be honest -- and that's what Billy's doing. That's what strong men are. You know, strong men are people who can come out and tell it like it is, and, you know, be accountable. And that's what Billy is,"" said Bottalico. He also said Rockefeller apparently ""was nodding off and caught himself too late"" before the accident that killed four people and injured 67 others. The engineer has not been charged. ""I don't believe that, in my opinion, that anybody could ever ... make Billy feel worse than he's making himself feel today. So Billy feels terrible. Whether it was his fault or not his fault, it's his train,"" said Bottalico. Also speaking on the engineer's behalf Tuesday was Rockefeller's lawyer, Jeffrey Chartier. The attorney has met with his client, police and National Transportation Safety Board representatives. He said that Rockefeller worked as a volunteer firefighter and is married, with a stepson and a granddaughter. ""Billy's a good man and, you know, I hope he can move forward from here,"" said Bottalico.

"(CNN) -- Murder-suicides, by their very nature, leave a mountain of unanswered questions. When the killer pulls the trigger first on his victim and then himself, he takes with him to the grave the reasons that compelled the angry, desperate act. Not so in the case of Radcliffe Haughton. What prompted the 45-year-old former Marine to open fire at a suburban Milwaukee salon Sunday -- killing his wife and two other women, and wounding four others -- was foreshadowed in no uncertain terms by his estranged wife just three days earlier. At a restraining order hearing Thursday, the wife, Zina, begged the court for protection, saying her husband would surely kill her. With her voice shaking, she outlined how he'd threatened to throw acid in her face. How he accused her of cheating on him. How his red hot jealousy terrorized her ""every waking moment."" ""Things have gotten so bad. We need to separate,"" she said at the hearing, according to a recording obtained by CNN affiliate WISN. ""We need a divorce before you hurt me. I don't want to die."" The judge sided with her. Haughton was ordered to stay away from his wife for the next four years. He was forbidden from possessing a gun. But on Saturday, he bought a .40-caliber handgun from a private seller. Wisconsin law only requires background checks for purchases from a dealer. And he waited. The next day he took her life. Paul Ryan says he's 'shocked and saddened' by Wisconsin shooting . 'I don't want to die' At the bizarre Thursday hearing, Haughton acted as his own attorney -- cross-examining his wife, asking questions that the judge refused to allow. Haughton said his wife's infidelity was to blame for their failing marriage. ""I have been involved with Zina Haughton for most of my adult life. This is the woman that I love,"" he said. ""Things have not always been the best that they could have been but I can stand before the court, stand before God and say that I love her. I love her unconditionally. This situation was brought about by infidelity."" The wife said the abuse began long before the infidelity accusations. She detailed a night when she said Haughton pulled a gun on her. It accidentally discharged. The bullet narrowly missed her and her daughter. ""For 20 years, we've fought. He's hit me. We've fought. But since May 29, the evening that he thinks I cheated on him, just the threats have gotten so bad, and like I said, I don't want to die,"" she said. A long history with police . Police in the area say they had a long history of run-ins with Haughton, a general manager of a local Land Rover dealership. ""Since 2001, the Brown Deer Police Department has responded to calls for service regarding the Haughtons, ranging from animal complaints to domestic violence related cases,"" the Brown Deer Police said in a statement. The police reports seemed to speak of a man who was destined to harm his wife. In January 2011, Haughton was accused of throwing his wife's clothes out of their home during an argument and then pouring tomato juice on her car. When police arrived, Haughton locked himself in the home and officers thought they saw Haughton holding a ""long barreled"" gun in the direction of his wife, according to a police report. Charges were eventually dropped in that case. On October 4 this year, police say, Haughton slashed his wife's tires outside the salon. After that incident, the wife applied for the restraining order. ""He threatened to throw acid in my face, burn me and my family with gas. His threats terrorize my every waking moment,"" she said in the request obtained by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Hospital lockdown hinders young patient's visit with Bieber . Calm in the face of death . On Saturday, Haughton walked into the two-story Azana Spa in Brookfield, outside Milwaukee, where his wife was a stylist. He was screaming. ""He yelled 'Everybody!' Get down. Get down,'"" Betty Brunner, a customer in the salon, told WISN. ""And as I went to get down, Zina walked to the reception desk, and said, 'Calm down, sir. There are good people here."" Haughton grabbed his wife and pushed her behind a wall, Brunner said. Then the bullets flew. All three of those killed were Azana employees, salon owner Tami Gemmell said Tuesday. ""They were heroic in their actions and protected each other to the end,"" she said. She called Zina Haughton one of the hardest workers she's ever known, someone who gave her heart and soul to every client and was an ""extraordinary"" mother and friend. Brunner considers Haughton's wife a hero for confronting her husband and making sure to move him away from most of the customers. She says she wonders how Zina Haughton stayed so calm in the face of death. If the court hearing is any indication, perhaps she knew it was just a matter of time. CNN's Carma Hassan and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","The shooter and his estranged wife were in court three days before the killing spree .

"Washington (CNN) -- JetBlue Airways is apologizing for a ""computer glitch"" it blames for a family being told their 18-month-old daughter was on a government no-fly list. The parents, who reportedly would not disclose their last names for fear of repercussions, and their infant, identified only as Riyanna, had boarded JetBlue Flight 510 from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Newark, New Jersey, on Tuesday evening when they say an airline employee ask them to get off the plane.

The family is of Middle Eastern descent and the mother wears a headscarf, but they say they are U.S. citizens and have lived in New Jersey all of their lives. The government disputed the airline's initial characterization. ""TSA did not flag this child as being on the no-fly list,"" Transportation Security Administration spokeswoman Sterling Payne told CNN in a statement. ""TSA was called to the gate by the airline and after talking to the parents and confirming through our vetting system, TSA determined the airline had mistakenly indicated the child was on a government watch list."" The family declined to continue on the flight, saying they felt humiliated. ""We were put on display like a circus act because my wife wears a hijab,"" Riyanna's father said. The airline says it was a technical mistake. ""We are investigating this particular incident. We believe this was a computer glitch,"" JetBlue Spokeswoman Allison Steinberg said in a statement without elaborating. ""Our crewmembers followed the appropriate protocols, and we apologize to the family involved in this unfortunate circumstance."" ""The whole situation was bizarre, it was completely bizarre and absolutely made no sense,"" the mother added. Steinberg said JetBlue crew members ""are trained to address each situation discreetly, treating every customer with dignity and respect."" The government maintains several databases of individuals who warrant extra screening when they fly. No one on the official no-fly list would be given a boarding pass, according to a TSA official who did not want to be named discussing the matter.

"Washington (CNN) -- An internal government review released Friday found no ""widespread"" misconduct or inappropriate behavior among U.S. Secret Service employees, after concerns were raised in Congress about the agency's disciplinary controls following a prostitution scandal. The 145-page report from the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general noted isolated cases of unethical conduct among Secret Service workers, on or off duty, that raised broader security concerns. It recommended 14 guidelines to deal with future problems. The agency whose mission includes protecting the President and visiting world leaders came under embarrassing scrutiny after revelations last year that some of its employees allegedly consorted with prostitutes before President Barack Obama's trip to the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia. ""Disciplinary and security clearance cases show that, while not widespread, USSS should continue to monitor and address excessive alcohol consumption and personal conduct within its workforce,"" said the report. ""USSS is planning to identify and address trends in misconduct through the new position of Chief Integrity Officer."" More than 24 people were eventually linked to the scandal, from both the Secret Service and the military. Nine of the Secret Service members resigned or were being forced out, and three others were cleared of serious misconduct. They were part of a contingent of hundreds of American security personnel who arrived early to prepare for the April 2012 summit. Secret Service officials later testified the behavior was isolated and did not reflect an inherent culture of recklessness or lack of supervision. The inspector general's report concluded the same. ""We did not find any evidence that USSS leadership has fostered an environment that tolerates inappropriate behavior."" Parts of the report were blacked out, including complete details of an apparently newly revealed incident from 2010, similar to the one in Colombia. Investigators said allegations against an agent were not thoroughly investigated. ""We identified one case that highlights how the combination of managerial discretion and weak internal controls affected multiple areas of the misconduct adjudication process. In this case, USSS did not adequately investigate an allegation of employee misconduct, despite the incident raising security concerns."" That agent was working in an unidentified foreign country in preparation for a presidential visit, and while off-duty was alleged to have consorted with prostitutes and showed up late to work, smelling of alcohol. Secret Service employees who had gone to town with the agent, the report says, ""consumed alcohol; interacted with FFNs (female foreign nationals); and were untruthful when initially questioned by managers. Both incidents required managers to divert their attention to address potential misconduct."" One leading member of Congress said he would press the agency to follow through on all the recommendations in the report. ""This report exposes long-standing problems with Secret Service management,"" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-Mississippi), the ranking member of the House Committee on Homeland Security. ""The Inspector General has revealed what we already knew -- that the Secret Service does not have standardized practices in place for handling employee misconduct and discipline. The lack of consistent policy has led to an agency culture dominated by personalities instead of rules."" Another alleged incident revealed last month has prompted further internal scrutiny. Two Secret Service supervisors on President Obama's protective detail are being investigated for alleged misconduct, a federal law enforcement source with knowledge of the internal agency investigation told CNN's John King. The details were first reported in the Washington Post. The investigation began after an incident at the posh Hay-Adams hotel near the White House in May. As first reported by the Post, one Secret Service agent allegedly removed ammunition from his service weapon and left a bullet in the room of a female guest, whom he had met in the hotel bar. The agent tried to regain entry to the room when he realized the bullet was left behind, the Post said. Hotel staff notified the White House after he identified himself as a Secret Service agent and demanded to be let in to the room. No police report was filed and no complaint was filed with the Secret Service by any of the parties involved, a government source told CNN's Joe Johns. ""The Secret Service takes allegations of improper behavior seriously and works diligently to investigate and resolve issues. Any misconduct is regrettable, but when it is identified, appropriate action is always taken based on established rules and regulations,"" Edwin Donovan, deputy assistant director of the Secret Service, said in a statement at the time. 2 Secret Service supervisors under investigation in misconduct probe .","The report noted isolated cases of unethical conduct among Secret Service workers .

"West Liberty, Kentucky (CNN) -- With dozens dead and scores of buildings reduced to rubble, residents of the Midwest and South on Sunday were assessing the damage that a series of vicious twisters left behind last week. By the time the powerful storm system faded, 39 were dead: 21 in Kentucky, 13 in Indiana, three in Ohio and one each in Alabama and Georgia. Alabama town struck twice in one year . ""The damage I saw yesterday was the worst I've seen. ... It was a war zone, debris everywhere, buildings destroyed, other buildings just the walls standing, roofs gone. It was a terrible sight,"" Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear told reporters, describing his visit to the tornado-ravaged town of West Liberty. On Sunday, nearly all that remained of Rose May's West Liberty house was a pile of broken wooden beams in a parking lot across the street. Nearby, scattered cinder blocks surrounded the basement area where Doris Shuck took shelter from the tornado. ""I feel blessed. I think the Lord protected me and let me get out of it alive, and I'm thankful for that,"" she said. Shuck said she emerged to devastation after the deafening storm ripped through the Kentucky town. ""I could hear people crying and asking for help,"" she said as she picked through what was left of her house Sunday. Many miles and many states away, others described similar scenes. Tall, once-sturdy trees littered the ground. Bright yellow school buses lay smashed into buildings. Garbage bins and wooden beams, which had flown through the air like jet airliners, resurfaced hundreds of yards away. ""It's like a bomb went off and everything is splintered, bricks are down and trees, and (there's) just a lot of debris,"" Ohio Gov. John Kasich said after visits to Moscow and Bethel. On Sunday, the focus turned to caring for survivors whose lives were turned upside down by the storm. Beshear told reporters he was requesting an expedited disaster declaration from President Barack Obama. Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency were scheduled to begin damage assessments in Kentucky on Monday, he said. Meanwhile, state officials were preparing as forecasters predicted rain and snow would hit parts of Kentucky on Sunday night, Beshear said. ""We have made sure that the shelters are open. ... There's obviously food and clothing and warmth in those shelters (for tornado victims),"" he said. The tornado outbreak began Friday and extended into the next day, affecting millions of people from Indiana to Georgia. The National Weather Service has confirmed that at least 42 tornadoes swept across 10 states on Friday. Indiana State Police Sgt. Jerry Goodin said the destruction left authorities there with ""no idea how many people are left homeless."" More than 400 National Guard troops were deployed in Kentucky, while 250 more were dispatched in Indiana, according to state officials. In Henryville, Indiana, about 20 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky, an EF-4 tornado -- with sustained winds of between 166 mph and 200 mph, putting it in the top 2% of tornadoes in terms of its strength -- struck a school complex. National Weather Service meteorologists said it was one of two tornadoes that hit the town, crediting the early dismissal of students with preventing more fatalities. The 40 students who had remained and huddled in an office area survived the storm, elementary school principal Glenn Riggs said. But the storm destroyed schools, homes and businesses, leaving many parts of the town unrecognizable, Kevin Welz told CNN's iReport. ""It is something you would expect to see in an end-of-the-world movie,"" he said. Pamela Rawlings described how her parents rushed to the middle of their one-story Henryville home for safety. After a tornado ripped through, a neighbor found the long-time couple about 30 feet apart -- with Pamela's 64-year-old father, Wayne Hunter, discovered dead and her mother, Lenora, bloodied but alive. A toddler who had survived the storm in Salem, about 20 miles west of Henryville, died Sunday afternoon after family members took her off life support, Jefferson County Coroner Bob Jones said. Tiny symbol of tornado survival dies . The 14-month-old girl had been in critical condition, surrounded by extended family members at Kosair Children's Hospital in Louisville, said hospital spokesman Brian Rublein.

"La Paz, Bolivia (CNN) -- Bolivian President Evo Morales handily won re-election Sunday, unofficial preliminary results showed. With 91 percent of votes tallied, Morales' Movement for Socialism party won 62 percent of the vote, according to exit polls. The conservative Progress Plan for Bolivia party came in second with 23 percent, according to preliminary numbers. The resounding victory was not unexpected, as Morales, the country's first president of indigenous descent, was leading in pre-election polls and was widely expected to win. The victory ""shows that it is possible to change Bolivia based on the vote of the Bolivian people,"" Morales said in a victory speech Sunday night. The large margin and possible majorities in congress and the senate are an embrace of his government's policies, Morales said. The resounding win ""compels me to accelerate these changes,"" he said. The leftist leader, an ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, said earlier Sunday that he hoped for a record-breaking turnout. ""I urge all the patriots to go vote at the electoral tables so that Bolivia beats not just the national, but the international participation record, near 90 percent,"" Morales told reporters Sunday. Morales nationalized important sectors in Bolivia, including mining. The move for the state to protect the country's natural resources and increased social programs have made Morales popular among the nation's large population of poor. A referendum earlier this year changed the constitution to allow a president to run for re-election. Seven other candidates challenged Morales. His closest rival was former governor of Cochabamba state Manfred Reyes Villa. In a speech Sunday night, Reyes Villa talked about the future, though he did not explicitly concede the election. ""The polarization of the country continues,"" he said, referring not only to the political right and left but to the fractured opposition. The various parties who ran against the current government should put national interest ahead of personal interest, Reyes Villa said. ""We must keep fighting to strengthen our democracy,"" he said. Thousands of police and hundreds of international observers were deployed across Bolivia. No major incidents were immediately reported. ""Morales is going to win, and he's going to win handily. He doesn't need to commit fraud,"" said Eduardo Gamarra, a Bolivian political science professor at Florida International University. ""The guy is popular and it's all constructed on this anti-American populist rhetoric, which is very politically popular."" In addition to president, Bolivians also voted for a vice president, 130 congressmen and 36 senators. CNN's Arthur Brice and journalist Gloria Carrasco contributed to this report for CNN.","President Morales was widely expected to win re-election .

"(CNN) -- The thunderous sound of more than a million wildebeest trekking across wide open plains in the Serengeti is not one you're likely to forget. Tanzanian safaris serve up all kinds of memorable moments. The country's bountiful wildlife, vast array of landscapes, relatively safe environment for tourists and temperate climate near the equator make Tanzania a desirable year-round destination for a safari. You just need a knowledgeable guide to help you make the most of the seasonal patterns of the animals while you're there. For the best experience, most travel experts suggest planning and booking your trip with a safari operator, and it's worth your time to obtain quotes, research and compare differences between a few of them before deciding. Accommodations in Tanzania can range from high-end luxury lodges and tented camps to mid-range and budget lodges or basic camp sites. Mid-range lodges in Tanzania may cost on average $350 to $700 per night for a double room and upscale operations may run visitors between $750 and $3,000 per night. The most popular Tanzanian safari destinations are in the north, in what's commonly referred to as the northern game circuit. Here are five stunning parks to explore: . Arusha National Park . Size: 52.9 square miles . The northern town of Arusha is considered the gateway to the northern game circuit. Nearby Arusha National Park might be small by Tanzanian standards, but it's filled with animal life covering three distinct areas: the Momela Lakes, Ngurdoto Crater and the rugged Mount Meru. The park is famous for its 400 species of birds, said Nandi O'Dell, a Tanzanian safari specialist with Proud African Safaris. The lakes particularly attract pink-hued lesser flamingos. The Ngurdoto Crater is surrounded by steep, rocky cliffs and often filled with herds of buffalo and warthogs roaming the swampy ground. Mount Meru is covered with lush forests and bare rocks. Arusha is the only place on the northern safari circuit where you can easily find a black and white colobus monkey. You are fairly certain to spot giraffes, zebras, hippos, leopards, elephants, baboons, buffalos and hyenas, too. ""Lions are absent from this park since they need a larger territory for hunting and can't thrive like they do in bigger parks,"" noted O'Dell. Accommodations: Try the midlevel Arumeru River Lodge or the upscale Lake Duluti Lodge. Lake Manyara National Park . Size: 127 square miles . Ernest Hemingway once called Lake Manyara National Park ""the loveliest"" in Africa. Some 77 square miles of the park's 127 square mile area are covered by the alkaline Lake Manyara when water levels are high. A lush forest in the park is home to baboons and blue monkeys, among other wildlife. The acacia woodland is a favorite spot for tree-climbing lions, a behavior that is not common in most places in Africa, said O'Dell. The Rift Valley escarpment, which towers 1,968 feet, provides a striking backdrop to the lake. The trail inside the park is a huge loop that O'Dell says can be navigated by a safari truck within a couple of hours. You're likely to spot baboons, giraffes, hippos, elephants, wildebeests, impalas, buffalo, warthogs, dik-diks and flamingos along the way. Accomodations: Explore the mid-level Plantation Lodge or try the high-end Manor at Ngorongoro. Ngorongoro Conservation Area . Size: 3,205 square miles . This region has often been described at the ""eighth wonder of the world"" and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The main feature of Ngorongoro Conservation Area is the Ngorongoro Crater, the world's largest unbroken volcanic caldera. The 2,000-foot-deep crater formed when a volcano exploded and collapsed on itself some 2 to 3 million years ago. A rich grassy pasture covers the crater floor and provides favorable conditions for grazing animals such as lions, zebras, gazelles, buffalo and warthogs, to name a few. ""This natural enclosure provides a safe haven for some of Tanzania's endangered black rhinos,"" O'Dell said. Accomodations: Try the mid-level Ngorongoro Serena Safari Lodge or the luxury the luxury Ngorongoro Crater Lodge. Serengeti National Park . Size: 5,700 square miles . The Serengeti is Tanzania's largest, and perhaps most famous, national park. The seemingly endless grassy plains are host to the famous Great Migration -- the largest mass movement of hooved animals on the planet, said O'Dell. More than 1.4 million wildebeest, 250,000 zebras and 400,000 Thomson's gazelles annually migrate in a clockwise direction over 1,800 miles in an endless search for food and water. This park also boasts some 9,000 hyenas, 2,800 lions, 1,000 leopards and 500 cheetahs. O'Dell said these statistics can fluctuate on a yearly basis, but these numbers are fairly consistent estimates. The name Serengeti comes from the Maasai language and means ""endless plains."" Accomodations: Stay at the mid-level Mbuzi Mawe Luxury Tented Camp in the central region of the Serengeti or or the high-end Serengeti Bushtops in the northern extension of the Serengeti. Tarangire National Park . Size: 1,100 square miles . This natural wonder is named after the Tarangire River that flows through the park and provides the only permanent water for wildlife in the area. This national park is famous for its large population of elephants and more than 550 species of birds. These creatures are among the fauna that roam the park's grounds, which are dotted with baobab trees, acacia woodlands, high grasses and seasonal swamps. Accommodations: Try the mid-level Kikoti Luxury Tented Camp or the high-end Tarangire Treetops Lodge.","Tanzania offers a massive concentration of wildlife and varied landscapes .

"(CNN) -- Some people go to desperate measures when they see a snake, any snake. But for a Texas homeowner, an impromptu anti-snake solution -- set that repulsive reptile on fire -- came back to bite. Big time. Six fire crews in eastern Texas had to respond this week as a house burned, with the unidentified owner blaming the blaze on a blazing snake. The homeowner in the Liberty-Eylau area south of Texarkana had spotted what was described as a large black snake, and decided to do something about it. ""She just didn't like snakes, I guess,"" Liberty-Eylau Fire Chief David Wesslehoft told CNN on Friday, in something of an understatment. The woman said she poured gasoline on the snake, which apparently was then set afire by her son, according to Wesslehoft. Then things really got hot. The snake fled to a brush pile between two homes. The brush ignited, sending flames through tall, dry grass toward the residences, officials said. ""The house is on fire,"" a 911 caller said. ""Could you hurry up, please?"" A brick home the woman had recently purchased to move into was a complete loss, said Bowie County Sheriff's Deputy Randall Baggett. The other home, which she also owned, suffered 20% damage. The fire was being investigated. The snake's fate was not known. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Fire crews respond to 911 call Wednesday evening .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- The longstanding bad blood between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq boiled Monday amid another round of attacks: the killing of 25 people and wounding of dozens more in five car bombings. Four of the blasts occurred in the Shiite heartland in the southern region of Iraq. Two car bombs exploded near a busy outdoor market in Amara, killing 13 people and wounding 24 others. A bomb went off near an outdoor market in Diwaniya, killing six people and wounding 20 others. And two people died and 11 others were wounded in a bombing at a commercial area in Karbala. Another blast occurred in Mahmoudiya, a predominantly Sunni area just south of Baghdad. Four people were killed and 14 others were wounded in that attack. Iraq pulls plug on 'misleading' TV networks . No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, nor was it clear whether they were related. But the fighting has prompted fears among Iraqi leaders and international powers that the tensions between Sunnis and Shiites could escalate and bring a return of the full-blown sectarian war that raged last decade. Since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's government last decade, Sunni Arabs have been politically marginalized and Shiites, who represent a majority of Iraqis, have emerged with more power. There have been protests for months by Sunni Arabs against the Shiite-led government and its prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki. The anger has escalated since a confrontation last week between police and protesters in Hawija. The International Crisis Group last week said that the ""failure to integrate Sunni Arabs into a genuinely representative political system in Baghdad risks turning Iraq's domestic crisis into a broader regional struggle."" ""The most urgent task today is to tamp down the flames, and the burden for this lies above all with the government,"" the Belgium-based think tank said in a report. ""The country is at a crossroads,"" said Martin Kobler, U.N. special representative in Iraq.","Four of the five blasts occurred in the Shiite heartland in the southern region of Iraq .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- A top Turkish official said Saturday that authorities believe those responsible for a pair of deadly car bombings earlier in the day had been in contact with the Syrian government's secret police force. In a news conference, Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay said the Syrian government was linked to the attack. ""The investigation into the perpetrators is for the most part complete. It has been determined that the organization and its members who carried out the attack were in contact with pro-Syrian regime Al Muhabarat (Syrian Intelligence Services) organization in Syria,"" he said. ""The organization is identified and for the most part the persons involved are identified. "" Atalay added that license plate checks have been ""completed"" and ""the organization and its members (behind the attacks) have been largely identified."" But Syria's information minister denied that his country had any involvement in the bomb attacks. Omran al Zoubi made the comments Sunday while speaking to journalists in Damascus on Syrian TV. ""We were saddened yesterday for the fall of martyrs in Turkey,"" al Zoubi said. ""In one way or another; Turkish people are the Syrian brothers."" The two car bombs exploded Saturday afternoon in the southern Turkey town of Reyhanli, according to Turkish Interior Minister Muammer Guler. In addition to the 43 people dead, 29 people were injured critically, said Guler. Atalay added that 50 people were still hospitalized as of Saturday night. The first blast occurred at about 1:55 p.m. at the municipality building, which houses city government offices. A second, more powerful blast occurred in front of the post office. In both cases, cars were loaded with large amounts of explosive material, according to Guler. There was a third explosion of a diesel fuel tank elsewhere in Reyhanli, but Guler said this was ruled an accident. Abu Marwan was just outside of the town when he heard the blasts and hurried to the scene of one of them, where he saw ""body parts everywhere."" ""Buildings and the walls of buildings are collapsed,"" Marwan said. ""The windows, the cars, everything is burned around it, people are burned. So many injured. The scene is outrageous, may God grant us peace."" A video posted on YouTube showed a column of thick, black smoke rising from the center of town; another video showed what appeared to be where one of the bombs erupted. Rescuers were pulling bloodied people from the street, the side of a building had been torn off and the windows of the building across the rubble-crusted street had been blown out. CNN is not able to confirm the videos' authenticity. The blast drew swift condemnation internationally, including from U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who vowed that Washington will ""stand with our ally, Turkey."" The report came shortly after the Local Coordination Committees for Syria, an opposition group, reported that Syrian government forces had fired several shells toward Reyhanli, which is in Turkey's southern province of Hatay. Several Syrians were among the casualties, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, another opposition group. But that did not spare Syrians residents of the town from being blamed by residents. ""People with sticks in their hands are going after Syrians,"" Marwan said. ""We almost have more Syrians here than Turks, and people are getting angry."" The town's location in Hatay province along the southern border with Syria ""carries sensitivity,"" Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters here, according to AA. ""Around (20,000) to 25,000 Syrians live here in camps as our guests. Certain steps as in Reyhanli today may be taken to affect the sensitivity in Hatay by those not willing to accept the status quo."" Turkey hosts more than 190,000 Syrian refugees in state-run camps, and more Syrians who have fled their country to Turkish cities and towns. In addition, Turkey has played a major role in providing assistance and a relatively safe springboard for operations to Syrian opposition groups. The timing of the blasts comes as momentum toward a resolution of the Syrian issue has grown, said Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, AA reported. ""Such blasts taking place on Saturday were no coincidence,"" he told reporters in Berlin, where he was on an official trip. ""The tranquility and stability of the Turkish Republic and our citizens have priority more than anything else,"" he said. ""It is possible that certain sides may want to sabotage Turkey's tranquility. No power would be successful in hurting Turkey's tranquility."" In a statement, the opposition Syrian National Coalition condemned the attacks. ""The Coalition sees these heinous terrorist acts as an attempt to take revenge on the Turkish people and punish them for their honorable support for the Syrian people, including their welcoming of Syrian refugees who have fled the regime's crimes in their villages and cities,"" it said. ""The Coalition views this attack as a desperate and failed attempt to sow discord between the two peoples."" The conflict in Syria has repeatedly spilled across borders to Turkey, prompting Turkish security forces to reinforce the frontier. At Turkey's request, the NATO military alliance deployed several Patriot missile batteries to protect Turkish border cities from the threat of Syrian missile attacks. This story was reported by Gul Tuysuz in Istanbul and reported and written by Tom Watkins in Atlanta.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- At least 2,800 dead pigs have been fished from a Shanghai river since Friday, but authorities insist that tap water in the city is still safe to drink. State news agency Xinhua said labels tagged to the pigs' ears indicated they came from the upper waters of the Huangpu River, which flows through the center of Shanghai and is a source of the city's drinking water. It's not clear why the pigs had been dumped in the river, though local media reported earlier this month that a disease had killed thousands of pigs in a village south of Shanghai. ""We will continue to trace the source, investigate the cause, co-operate with neighboring areas and take measures to stop the dumping of pigs into rivers,"" the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Commission said in a statement posted on their website on Monday. As of Sunday, water quality on the Songjiang section of the river, where most of the pigs were found, remained normal and the incident has had ""no significant effect on tap water supply,"" the commission added. However, local residents and users of of the popular Twitter-like microblog service Sina Weibo have expressed concern that the dead pigs would make the city's tap water unsafe to drink. ""Huangpu river is the source of drinking water for more than 20 million Shanghai residents. And this horrific incident was only made public when residents started posting pictures on Weibo,"" business investor Xue Manzi said in a post on his account. The agricultural commission said it had tested organ samples from the pig carcasses and the results suggested the animals had contracted a type of porcine circovirus. According to Professor Fred Leung, who specialises in animal diseases at Hong Kong University, this is a fairly common disease in pigs and not usually fatal on its own. Pictures showed sanitation workers with sticks retrieving the bloated bodies of small pigs caught up in reeds and debris at the side of the river. A local newspaper in Jiaxing, a city in Zhejiang province south of Shanghai, reported on March 6 that tens of thousands of pigs had died of an animal disease in a major pig farming village in the past two months. ""According to our records, 10,078 pigs died in January, another 8,325 died in February. More than 300 pigs die everyday in our village, and we barely have any space left to dispose of the dead pigs,"" a local villager was quoted by the paper as saying. Chen Yi, a veterinarian at the Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, told the Global Times newspapers that farmers are required by law to dispose of dead animals at community disposal sites or bury them with disinfectant. CNN's Zhang Dayu reported from Beijing .","NEW: Pig carcasses test positive for porcine circovirus .

"RIVERHEAD, New York (CNN) -- The tragic story that began with a sick joke on the Internet is coming to a close as a Riverhead, New York, jury deliberates the fate of 53-year-old John White, on trial for killing a friend of his son. A bogus threat of rape on the Internet may have led to the shooting death of 17-year-old Daniel Cicciaro. White is accused of shooting 17-year old Daniel Cicciaro in the face on August  9, 2006, outside his Long Island home after a heated exchange with Cicciaro and his friends. Cicciaro died that night, and White was arrested. He is charged with second-degree manslaughter. The trial has brought out allegations of racism and revenge. White, who is African-American, maintains he was protecting his family from a white lynch mob and says the gun discharged accidentally. Prosecutors disagree, saying White should have called police but instead deliberately chose to confront the boys outside his home with a .32-caliber Beretta.  Watch Cicciaro's parents recall son's death » . Riverhead police say this all started with an Internet prank sent from the MySpace page of White's son, 20-year-old Aaron. Under his screen name, a threatening message was sent to a teenage girl who was a close friend of Daniel Cicciaro. The night Cicciaro was killed, he was at a party with the girl when they spotted Aaron White. According to court testimony, Cicciaro became angry and White was asked to leave. Aaron  White testified that after he left the party, Cicciaro and a male friend called him on his cell phone, saying to him, ""Get back to this party you n****r."" Aaron White says he then went home and received more calls from Cicciaro and his friends, telling him they were coming to his house to kill him. He then woke his father, who grabbed his handgun and waited for the boys to arrive. Police say that around 11 p.m., Cicciaro and four friends arrived at White's house. John and Aaron White walked out of their house, both holding guns, and had a heated exchange with Cicciaro and his friends. John White asked the boys to leave. Then, police say, John White shot Cicciaro at point-blank range. Cicciaro died in the emergency room that night. But the rape threat that sparked the confrontation between Daniel Cicciaro and Aaron White was not real. Under testimony, Aaron White's friend Michael Longo admitted he logged on to Aaron's MySpace page and sent the threat to the girl as a joke. Daniel Cicciaro's mother, Joanne Cicciaro, says her son was trying to protect the girl. ""The thing is, that night, Daniel believed Aaron threatened to rape a girl that was like his little sister,"" Cicciaro said. During the trial, which lasted three weeks and ended Tuesday,  John White broke down in tears. He testified, ""I didn't mean to shoot this young man. This young man was another child of God."" White's attorneys say that racism lies at the heart of the confrontation and that John White feared Cicciaro and his friends were going to kill his son. ""You had this group of white men who felt that they were going to defend this young white woman from a black man who said these things about her, and they felt justified to do so because of his race,"" said defense attorney Fred Brewington. But Daniel Cicciaro's father, also named Daniel, says he doesn't believe White's story. ""He had 20 minutes to gather his thoughts, to call the police to defuse the situation, to find out why they were coming over, and he didn't take any of the precautionary steps"" he said. ""The Whites, none of them, ever called 9-1-1, even after he shot Daniel, but he did call their attorney,"" Joanne Cicciaro added. With tears in their eyes, Daniel and Joanne Cicciaro say their last image of their son was in the hospital, drenched in blood and being given CPR. ""I saw the hole in his cheek. I got to tell him that I loved him,"" Joanne Cicciaro said. ""I saw his blank eyes open, staring at the ceiling."" Friends and supporters of both the Whites and the Cicciaros have attended the trial daily, which presented its case to the jury Tuesday. The jury finished its second day of deliberations Thursday with no verdict. E-mail to a friend .","A bogus Internet threat may have led to 17-year-old's death .

"Washington (CNN) -- The State Department is using cutting-edge data gathering technology to help keep the peace in some areas and keep violence from flaring in others, saving both physical and fiscal costs of conflict. ""We are about breaking and interrupting, stopping and preventing atrocities and destabilizing violence, for the good of the people in the countries where we work, as well as the good of the American people,"" said Jerry White, deputy assistant secretary for partnerships and learning in state's newly formed Conflict and Stabilization Operation (CSO) office. White, a Nobel laureate, encountered first-hand consequences of miscalculated foreign policy decisions, violence, and instability, when he lost a leg to a land mine during a hike in Israel in 1984. That led him to co-found Survivor Corps, which is the first international network of survivors helping survivors to recover from war, rebuild their communities, and break cycles of violence. CSO analyzes ""large data sets"" as well as ""civil society"" generated data -- essentially the sum of patterns, human behaviors, electronic signals, social media elements and everything tangible that creates masses of technological and non-technological data. ""As observers of patterns, data, and focal points, we look at violence as an epidemic that can ultimately spread,"" White said. ""As interrupters of violence, by using the nuances such as data analytics we now have the technology to prevent, interrupt and break these cycles of violence."" Iraq and Afghanistan . State Department officials said they didn't want to speculate the ""should have, could have, would haves,"" but Mark Abdollahian, a political-scientist and co-creator of ""Senturion"", a ""large data"" predictive analysis tool, says otherwise. In conjunction with the National Defense University, Abdollahian ran a forecast using big data analytics during the run-up to the war in Iraq, which was a fairly accurate preview of where the conflict would go. Abdollahian's model anticipated what the Iraqi and international political support would look like if the United States went into Iraq with and without the United Nations support. It found very early on that if the United States entered Iraq on its own, ""it would be the ultimate source of Iraqi sectarian and domestic violence."" It also predicted ""the situation in Iraq would worsen throughout 2003 and 2004 in terms of Iraqi attitudes toward the U.S. presence as well as insurgent activity,"" said Abdollahian, whose Senturion model is now used by White and his team at CSO. The model produced very specific predictions about the behavior of factions and accurately predicted the timing of defections as well as the potential support from unexpected allies -- such as the specific behavior of Shia leaders after Saddam Hussein's regime collapsed â€” to the point of even accurate sequencing of defections among different factions. ""When we published our findings with NDU, everyone was asking how we did this -- questioning whether or not we had inside deals. And we simply responded by saying we only looked at patterns, behaviors, and ran data -- yet everyone was shocked,"" Abdollahian recalled. An alternative to 'top-down' approach . Both White and Abdollahian believe that this ""large data analytic technology"" provides a ""focal point"" and identifies the players in what Abdollahian calls a political ""tug of war."" Software allows analysts to map ""different people, players, stakeholders, and people with interests, in various targeted political landscapes."" Then the computer chip tracks interactions among these elements -- Abdollahian's ""tug of war"" -- and therefore ""anticipates if people are going to agree, and if so, what are the compromises, and if not, what are the potential outcomes."" The technology allows U.S. policymakers to frame responses in a timely manner and avoid conflicts that might require the introduction of military forces, reducing the cost in both money and casualties by identifying innovative courses of action that may have not been spotted without the use of this new technology. White suggests the data-driven approach is somewhat contrary to the conventional ""top-down"" wisdom, since ""many believe that it take decades to get into conflicts and consequently it would take the same amount to come out."" Amir Bagherpour, a senior analyst at CSO and former student of Abdollahian, suggests ""mixing new technologies with conventional methods of developing policy strategies, creates ""pockets of hope that allow advanced planning around the patterns of violence for the future."" AB Paul, cyber strategist and former policy adviser at the Pentagon and the U.S. Central Command, believes that people's emotions are a pivotal element in data analysis and capturing these human elements are a huge challenge. ""If you could apply human judgments, it's wonderful, otherwise substituting human judgment and talent with computing analytics does not work,"" Paul said. Paul's argument is central to what White and Bagherpour regard as pivotal element in their work at the CSO. ""The key to success is to combine this nuance and technology with the invaluable talent, knowledge and human power of our diplomats and civilian responders through a comprehensive team effort,"" Bagherpour said. Decoding Syria . One of the main areas of focus for the year-old agency is Syria, which is similar to many less-developed countries that lack cyber data availability. Gary Shiffman, a former chief of staff of customs and border protection at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said ""you want data to allow you to see"" life's normal patterns. ""So this model can work as effective both in developed countries as well as undeveloped countries,"" said Shiffman, who is now president of Giant Oaks, a consulting firm that provides big data analytics for national and homeland security interests. Shiffman suggests useful data in less developed countries can be found in ""economic data -- what people are buying in stores, what cars are they driving, what kind of phones are they using, refugee flows, the direction of their move, mobile use."" Both Shiffman and White believe traditional data and civil society patterns can be as valuable for data analytic forecasts as cyber data that's more prevalent in developed countries. ""In the case of Syria, we look at trends, where the business leaders gather, what they talk about, where are the religious leaders; we follow sermons, political and religious statements, public meetings, statements in commerce and business areas,"" White said, suggesting that through this accumulation of information, they see connections in Damascus, Turkey and elsewhere and can project connections within the region. CSO's analysis of large data and civil society enabled the Syrian opposition to build mass-communications and improve internal and external communications networks and develop civilian leadership capacity for if there's a change in government. Introducing new narratives . In a post-Gadhafi Libya, White said the United States and its allies were under the impression that ""militias"" were one of the big problems in that country. As a result, White and his team ""dug down and looked at who are these militias? Where are they located? And how is the pattern of violence manifested?"" through the study of human patterns and civil-society data-gathering. ""Libyan streets became our study ground, as did civil society and social media,"" White said. By using large data analysis in a strategic effort to advance stability in Libya, ""it was not your typical police, but rather the Libyan civil society that was the antidote to the militia violence,"" White said. By looking at social networking, open sources and the civil society, analysts got a better picture of Libyans' attitude toward Americans, which helped ""understand trend lines against Americans â€” that potentially led us to learn that Libyans were simply horrified -- Libyans were actually horrified -- by the killing of Ambassador Chris Stevens,"" White said of the U.S. diplomat who was killed in a terror attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi last September. Moving forward, White suggests that by looking at these reactions, instead of a military and counter terrorism approach, we can build-up ""myth-busters"" and thus introduce new narratives that can help prevent violence, not just in only Libya, but the region at large. Thousands of miles away from where the Arab Spring bloomed, CSO is applying similar methods in Kenya, where more than 1,000 people were killed and 350,000 displaced after the 2007 elections. Last year White and his team integrated similar patterns of large data analysis to help Kenyans prevent violence during last month's elections. North Korea is another conflicted area that remains a pivotal threat not only for the United States but also for the rest of the world. Both Abdollahian and Raphael Carland, director of partnerships and communication at CSO, say the area lacks readily available ""information clouds"" that make up the first layer of large data analysis. But by using its analytical tools, it's possible to fill in data gaps by correlating conditions in comparable environments. Preventing another Boston . There is also strong potential in using large data analytics in the United States to help forecast terror attacks like the bombing at the Boston Marathon two weeks ago. ""Absolutely we can make this work domestically in the U.S., however the challenge is that people guard their privacy from the government very closely, so then we might face privacy-issue challenges when running human patterns and large data in the States,"" Shiffman said.","Analyzing human behavior, social media, other data points a State Department tool .

Data-driven approach is contrary to conventional ""top-down"" wisdom .

"(CNN) -- For the second time this month, a U.S. service member who worked in a military sexual assault prevention program has been accused of a sexual crime. In the latest incident, an Army sergeant first class assigned to such a program at Fort Hood, Texas, is being investigated for alleged sexual assault, pandering, abusive sexual contact and maltreatment of subordinates. Charges had not been filed as of Wednesday morning. A Defense Department official says ""initial indications"" show that are at least one person may have been forced into prostitution activity, but the matter remains under investigation no conclusions have been drawn yet. The sergeant has not been named. In a statement that does not use pronouns that would identify the gender of the service member, the Defense Department said that the person has been suspended from all duties. The allegations come as the military is under intense scrutiny for sexual assaults within its ranks. The number of service members anonymously reporting a sexual assault grew by more than 30% in the past two years, according to a Pentagon report released last week. More than 26,000 troops experienced ""unwanted sexual contact,"" a significant jump from 19,300 troops, a figure reported in a 2010 report on the topic. The news of the Fort Hood case comes as the military prepares for a historic move: opening combat roles to women for the first time. It's unclear how that might affect the apparently increasing problem of sexual assault. The department's own research indicates that both genders are victimized. Consider that 10,700 of the 19,300 troops were men, according to the 2010 report. On Wednesday, the investigation into the Fort Hood case continued as special agents from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command were in charge. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was told about the case Tuesday and met with Army Secretary John McHugh. ""I cannot convey strongly enough his frustration, anger and disappointment over these troubling allegations and the breakdown in discipline and standards they imply,"" Defense Department spokesman George Little said of Hagel. Hagel has ordered that all service members working in sexual assault prevention units be retrained and screened again. If they pass, they will get new credentials. That should also apply to personnel and military recruiters. An Air Force officer who was arrested the first weekend in May on allegations that he attacked a woman and groped her buttocks and breasts in an Arlington, Virginia, parking lot was a personnel officer by training, said Gen. Mark Welsh, the Air Force chief of staff. After top Air Force officer charged in sex assault, military faces questions . In February, Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski was placed in charge of a branch of the Air Force's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program, and he oversaw a five-person office, an Air Force official told CNN after the incident. The official declined to be named, citing the ongoing law enforcement case. Shortly after Krusinski's arrest, military officials appeared before a congressional panel for an already scheduled hearing on sexual assault in the military. Welsh described Krusinski when he was asked what made him qualified to work in the sex assault prevention program. Krusinski, 41, is a 1994 graduate of the Air Force Academy who served tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He made an initial court appearance last week. He did not enter a plea. During the hearing, lawmakers brought up yet another case that has made headlines involving sexual assault. Lt. Col. James Wilkerson III was found guilty last year by a jury of Air Force officers of sexually assaulting a woman at his home outside Aviano Air Base in Italy. General defends decision in Aviano case . He spent four months in a Navy brig before Lt. Gen. Craig Franklin, the convening authority in the case, threw out the verdict. Franklin was the officer who ordered Wilkerson's court-martial at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. But military law allowed him to have the final say. ""After considering all matters in the entire record of trial, I hold a genuine and reasonable doubt that Lt. Col. Wilkerson committed the crime of sexual assault,"" Franklin said in a letter to the Air Force secretary released publicly this week. Pentagon officials told CNN that it is rare for charges to be dismissed in this manner. The decision angered victims' rights groups and some members of Congress. ""I am extremely disturbed,"" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, who chaired a hearing last month on the issue. ""I don't know how you can say that having 19,000 sexual assaults and rapes a year is discipline and order."" Military rape victims: Stop blaming us . Reports of sexual assault appear to be weighing heavily on higher-ranking officers. ""This is so contrary to everything upon which the Army was built,"" McHugh, the Army secretary, has said during testimony before the House Appropriations Committee defense subcommittee. ""To see this kind of activity happening in our ranks is really heart-wrenching and sickening."" He spoke generally about sex abuse crimes in the military. Survey indicates troubling trend in military sexual assaults . ""As I said to our new Brigadier General Corps when I spoke to them about two weeks ago, 'You can do everything from this point forward in your military career perfectly, but if you fail on this, you have failed the Army,' "" McHugh reportedly said. After assault case, Hagel seeks changes to military legal process . There were 3,374 sexual crimes reported in the military in fiscal year 2012, a 6% increase over the previous year, according to the Defense Department report issued last week. Military officials worry that many victims don't come forward because they fear retaliation. But the numbers might indicate that more victims are willing to report crimes than in the past. On Monday, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard P. ""Buck"" McKeon said he was outraged and disgusted by the Fort Hood allegations. He called the case the ""latest chapter in a long, sordid history of sexual abuse"" in the military. The military was rocked in the early 1990s by the Tailhook scandal. A female Navy lieutenant said she had been sexually assaulted at a military convention by other service members. Revisiting the military's Tailhook scandal . McKeon, a California Republican, has a granddaughter in the Army. ""I see no meaningful distinction between complacency or complicity in the military's latest failure to uphold their own standards of conduct,"" he said. ""Nor do I see a distinction between the service member who orchestrated this offense and the chain of command that was either oblivious to or tolerant of criminal behavior."" CNN's Barbara Starr, Dana Ford, Larry Shaughnessy and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Prostitution-related activity may have been involved, an official says .

"(CNN) -- A gas explosion ripped through a building containing offices and an art gallery in a historic district of central Prague on Monday morning, injuring 35 people and prompting evacuations of nearby buildings in the Czech capital, officials said. More than 230 people were evacuated from the area, including from buildings used by schools including Charles University and the Academy of Performing Arts' film and TV school, known as FAMU, officials said. ""We can now confirm this was a gas explosion. It was not a terrorist attack,"" Prague Mayor Bohuslav Svoboda told reporters Monday. The blast at 5 Divadelni Street, not far from the National Theatre and a block from the Vltava River, which cuts through the city, collapsed the first floor's ceiling, officials said. Windows in neighboring buildings were damaged. Officials do not believe anyone is trapped in the rubble, though fire officials will remain at the site for a while longer ""to be 100% sure nobody is in there,"" Svoboda said. People who initially were unaccounted for were later found with minor injuries, he said . Of the 35 people injured, 30 were taken to hospitals, including two people who suffered serious injuries, officials with the city's emergency services said. The city's fire department, which is examining the area for possible gas leaks, said it would take two days to stabilize the site. Charles University canceled classes at an adjacent building for the rest of Monday. A surveyor employed by the city told reporters Monday that the building might not need to be demolished and that the damage appears to be reparable. Earlier, Czech news media gave conflicting reports of the building's location, with an outlet reporting at one point that the blast happened at a FAMU building. FAMU dean Pavel Jech said that the blast happened near FAMU's main building, known as Lazansky Palace, which was evacuated. ""Nobody in FAMU has suffered any injuries,"" Jech said. ""There will be no classes for the rest of the week at Lazansky Palace. Classes scheduled at other locations ... will continue as planned. Marianna Zapotilova was in an office in a nearby building when the blast happened. The office's window was open, and the force of the blast ""pushed me away from my computer,"" she said. ""There was a lot of dust"" immediately after the explosion, Zapotilova said. ""People in the area were injured, mainly by broken glass from the windows; they had their heads bandaged.""

"(CNN) -- Syria denies that it has used, or even possesses, chemical weapons, accusing the United States and Britain of lying in order to pressure the embattled Damascus government. Syrian Information Minister Omran Al-Zoubi talked to Russia TV on Friday, dismissing a claim by U.S. officials a day earlier that they had evidence the chemical weapon sarin had been used in Syria on a small scale. ""Everything that the American minister and British government have said lack credibility,"" Al-Zoubi said. ""It's baseless, and it's a new tactic to put political and economic pressure on Syria."" Al-Zoubi said the Syrian government is the one that called for an investigation of an incident in which it claimed chemical weapons were used by ""terrorist groups."" The government routinely labels rebel fighters as terrorists. Syria does not have chemical weapons and would not use them if it did, he said. The Americans ""want to manipulate the issue, to let whoever used the chemical weapons ... get away (with it), and to repeat the Iraq example,"" Al-Zoubi said. After a meeting on Friday with Jordan's King Abdullah, President Barack Obama reiterated U.S. ""preliminary assessments"" that ""chemical weapons have been used on ... populations in Syria."" He didn't backtrack from his earlier statements that it would be a ""game changer"" -- as far as how the world deals with Syria -- if it's proven definitively that President Bashar al-Assad's forces used chemical weapons on his own people. Still, Obama didn't specify what actions the United States might take if that determination is made. For now, he said, the United States is planning to continue its own ""very vigorous investigation"" and to work with its Middle Eastern allies and the United States. ""We to have act prudently,"" the president said. ""... But I think all of us, not just in the United States but around the world -- recognize how we cannot stand by and permit the systematic use of weapons like chemical weapons on civilian populations."" Israel, for one, is asking the United States to take the lead in crafting a response to the evidence of chemical weapons. ""I think the U.S., as the leader of the Western world, should lead the efforts with our partners in Europe and Israel and to take action with what we're seeing happening today in Syria,"" Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Danny Danon said on Friday. Opinion: Obama must act on Syria chemical weapons . While he didn't offer specifics, Danon said that Israeli military intelligence also has information indicating ""Syria has used chemical weapons."" Also Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon asked the man heading the world body's investigation into chemical weapons use in Syria to report to U.N. headquarters on Monday for ""consultations,"" a U.N. spokesman said. Ban had ""taken note"" of comments Thursday from the U.S. government that it has evidence sarin has been used in Syria. The U.N. leader has repeatedly asked the Syrian government to give U.N. inspectors unrestricted access to the country as it looked into chemical weapons use allegations. The team, led by Swedish scientist Ake Sellstrom, is ready to head to Syria within 48 hours if an agreement is reached. ""We remain in close contact with the Syrian authorities, most recently through another letter (Thursday) urging the Syrian government to grant unconditional and unfettered access to the mission,"" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said. ""The secretary-general strongly urges the Syrian government to respond swiftly and favorably so that this mission can carry out its work in Syria."" Russian foreign ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich responded Friday by criticizing Ban's position as ""nothing but a demonstration of a politicized approach."" ""The inspection system proposed is analagous to that used at the end of the previous century in Iraq, which -- unlike Syria -- was under U.N. sanctions,"" Lukashevich said in a statement posted on the foreign ministry's website. ""It is difficult to understand why the U.N. secretariat prefers to take its cue from those who care not about concrete steps to prevent attempts to use chemical weapons in the Syrian crisis but to change the regime of a sovereign state."" Earlier this week, the Russian foreign minister also warned against a repeat of the ""Iraqi scenario"" in which claims that Saddam Hussein's government possessed so-called weapons of mass destruction were the basis of the U.S.-led invasion. He also said that international investigators were asking ""too much"" by demanding access to all facilities in Syria and to have the right to interview any Syrians. Read more: What is the Syrian Electronic Army? In a letter sent to lawmakers before U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced there was evidence sarin has been used in Syria, the White House said that intelligence analysts have concluded ""with varying degrees of confidence that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale in Syria, specifically the chemical agent sarin."" The White House cautioned that the ""chain of custody"" of the chemicals was not clear and that intelligence analysts could not confirm the circumstances under which the sarin was used, including the role of al-Assad's regime. British Prime Minister David Cameron said that he supported Obama and that the use of chemical weapons should constitute a ""red line,"" the UK Press Association reported. But if a red line has been crossed, Cameron was less clear on what the next steps should be. Asked if the development could result in sending troops into Syria, Cameron said he didn't want to see that. ""But I think we can step up the pressure on the regime, work with our partners, work with the opposition in order to bring about the right outcome,"" he said, according to the Press Association. ""The question is how do we step up the pressure. And, in my view, what we need to do -- and we're doing some of this already -- is shape that opposition, work with them, train them, mentor them, help them, so that we put the pressure on the regime and so what we can bring this to an end."" The Syrian government has been battling a rebellion for more than two years, bringing international condemnation of the regime and pleas for greater international assistance. The United Nations estimated in February that more than 70,000 people had died since the conflict began. The opposition Local Coordination Committees in Syria reported that 139 people, including 16 women and 14 children, had been killed across the country on Friday. Twenty-nine of those deaths were in and around Damascus, while 27 were in Homs province. Members of the rebel Free Syrian Army clashed with government forces in at least 115 places around Syria on Friday, during which the opposition group reported 235 bombing attacks -- including from warplanes and surface-to-surface missiles.

"Newbury Park, California (CNN) -- A Southern California wildfire grew to 8,000 acres and is threatening 2,000 homes, authorities said late Thursday. The blaze damaged 15 homes and caused the evacuation of other homes and the campus of California State University Channel Islands, fire officials said. Winds reaching 25 mph aided the Springs Fire in Ventura County, and weather conditions grounded fixed-wing air tankers, allowing only helicopters to drop water, fire officials said. The blaze was 10% contained Thursday evening, officials said. The fire was one of two wildfires that firefighters were battling in the Los Angeles area. The other one was east of the city in Riverside County. The Ventura County blaze prompted the evacuation of homes in Newbury Park, fire authorities said. More than 900 fire and law personnel were assigned to the growing conflagration that began near Camarillo, where Cal State Channel Islands is located. The university campus will remain closed through Friday, the school said. Equipment included 96 fire engines, six helicopters and three fixed-wing aircraft, authorities said. Thick smoke blanketed neighborhoods as fires burned along ridge lines. In the evacuated Dos Vientos neighborhood, firefighters took a preventive posture beside million-dollar, Spanish mission style houses with red tile roofs. Flare-ups rose 15 feet behind backyards, but no houses had caught fire by about noon local time. Rounding up pets, important papers . Meanwhile, homeowners scrambled, gathered pets and loaded boxes with important papers and medicine. Some owners of evacuated houses kept watch of their properties a few blocks away, wondering whether the fire would reach their homes. ""We can pray and watch and listen,"" one woman homeowner told CNN. ""Anyone living in that area ahead of the fire really needs to prepare,"" said Mike Lindberry of the Ventura County Fire Department. Winds reaching 25 mph, however, were fanning the wildfire, he said. Aerial footage by CNN affiliate KTLA showed flames moving toward Point Mugu State Park along the Pacific Coast Highway. Newbury Park resident Paul Whyte told CNN's Piers Morgan his home was spared, while nine acres of shrubbery were burned. ""I am very fortunate."" Whyte was grateful for three firefighters who calmly protected his residence from tall flames. ""It's very reassuring to meet people like that: People who are professional who know what they are doing. Put me at ease."" In a second wildfire on the other side of the Los Angeles area, firefighters were making progress against flames that consumed more than 2,950 acres in Riverside County, a fire official said. The spread of the blaze seemed to slow early Thursday morning, and crews gained greater containment, now pegged at 40% with no growth in acreage, according to the state agency Cal Fire. Cal Fire Battalion Chief Julie Hutchinson said winds are the wild card in vanquishing the blaze, since they were picking up as the sun rose. But firefighters were feeling pretty good about their progress and were cautiously optimistic after a good night on the fire line, she said. The Riverside County Fire Department said 425 firefighters were involved in what's being called the Summit Fire. Six air tankers dropped chemical retardants on the flames. There were no exact numbers on how many people had been evacuated in the region late Wednesday, but authorities said a 200-unit mobile home park in Cherry Valley had been cleared. They also said some residents in Banning were told to leave their homes. Banning is about 25 miles west of Palm Springs. An evacuation center was opened at the Banning Community Services Center, officials said. There was also an evacuation center for small animals at San Jacinto Valley Animal Services, Cal Fire said. Family home up in flames . The fire claimed at least one Banning house. Joe Kiener said his mother bought the home in 1973 and lived there until her death last month. ""I didn't think I was going to lose the house at all,"" he said Wednesday. ""I just knew that the fire was coming across at a rapid speed from east to west, and I was safe at the time."" But then the wind shifted. ""I grabbed the dog ... and put him into the car,"" making a quick getaway with a police escort, he said. Perfect conditions for wildfires . The early start to the Western wildfire season has authorities concerned. Only a couple of inches of rain have fallen in Southern California since the start of the year, making the region as dry as it normally would be in the fall, when fire season is typically at its peak. ""It could be a very long, hot summer with a lot of potential for fires if they get started and if we continue to have the hot, dry weather,"" said Hutchinson, the Cal Fire battalion chief. ""It's only going to get hotter and drier as we go through the summer."" The National Weather Service said a red flag warning was in effect until Friday evening. Forecasters called for wind speeds between 15 and 25 mph, with gusts up to 45 mph. Forecasters say the combination of strong winds, low humidity and warm weather will create ""extreme fire behavior."" Better get used to it, says Hutchinson. ""Fire season is here. Everyone needs to be alert for that. They need to be prepared for that."" Paul Vercammen reported from Newbury Park and Mike Martinez reported and wrote in Los Angeles.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- As Hurricane Sandy lashes the East Coast of the United States with wind and rain, Southeast Asia is dealing with the trail of death and damage from a powerful storm that has killed at least 30 people in the region over the past few days. Superstorm Sandy threatens 'catastrophe' of a lifetime . Tropical Storm Son-Tinh was moving northeast along the northern Vietnamese coast on Monday after tearing the roofs off hundreds of houses and breaching flood defenses overnight, the state-run Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported. Son-Tinh was at typhoon level when it thumped into northern Vietnam late Sunday with winds as strong as 133 kilometers per hour (83 mph). It left three people dead and two injured, according to an initial estimate from the Office of the National Search and Rescue Committee reported by (VNA). More than a 1,300 rescue workers and soldiers have been deployed to work with local authorities on search and rescue efforts in the aftermath of the storm, VNA said. Helicopters were on standby for a search and rescue mission for an oil rig with 35 people on board that became disconnected from its towboats miles out at sea amid strong waves generated by the storm, according to VNA. And five people were missing Sunday after winds from Son-Tinh sank an engineering vessel near a cargo terminal in Sanya, a city on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported. Son-Tinh is expected to gradually weaken over the course of Monday, regional weather agencies said. At least 260,000 people in Vietnam had been relocated to safer areas as it approached Sunday. The storm had already killed 27 people when it swept across the central Philippines during the second half of last week, causing flash floods and landslides, according to the Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Nine people remain missing, the council said Monday. East Asia is buffeted for several months a year by heavy storms that roll in from the western Pacific Ocean. In August, a big typhoon, named Bolaven, killed more than 60 people on the Korean peninsula.","More than a thousand rescue workers have been deployed in Vietnam .

"(CNN) -- Hours after talking at length with U.S. and Russian authorities, the father of the two suspects in last week's deadly Boston Marathon attack is set to fly to the United States -- and cooperate with authorities -- an activist working with the family told CNN. Anzor Tsarnaev told Russia's state-run RIA Novosti that he and his wife, Zubeidat, will leave the semi-autonomous southern Russian republic of Dagestan on Thursday. Authorities from various U.S. government agencies did not immediately confirm the Tsarnaevs' travel plans. According to the official Russian news report, a police source said Wednesday that the suspects' parents consented to their U.S. trip and ""will be involved in the U.S. investigation."" After that report came out, human rights activist Kheda Saratova told CNN that only the father, Anzor, would travel to the United States as early as Friday. The news of the impending travel comes nine days after three people died and scores were wounded when two bombs exploded at the marathon's finish line. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died days later following an early morning shootout with police. His body remained unclaimed Wednesday, according to Terrel Harris, a spokesman for Massachusetts' chief medical examiner's office. The exact cause of his death has not been determined. His brother Dzhokhar was captured the next night after being found hidden inside a boat in the backyard of a Watertown, Massachusetts, home. Characterized in fair condition at a Boston hospital, the 19-year-old suspect has been communicating with authorities. So, too, have his parents. On Wednesday, FBI agents were in Makhachkala, Dagestan -- a city that Tamerlan called home for several months in 2012 -- to talk with the suspects' parents. The ""conversation"" -- which included members of Russia's Federal Security Service -- ended Wednesday evening, the men's mother told Saratova. Both Anzor Tsarnaev and his wife have publicly insisted they believe their children are innocent. Zubeidat Tsarnaev has said she's convinced her boys were framed ""just because they were Muslim."" When asked whether she thinks her younger son will get a fair trial, she replied, ""Only Allah will know."" Suspects' mother describes her last conversation with her sons . Russia asked U.S. twice to probe one suspect . It's not clear if Zubeidat Tsarnaev might not return to the United States because she's in legal trouble there. She faces three felony charges for alleged shoplifting and property damage in Massachusetts in 2012, according to Natick District Court. She jumped bail, and there has been an arrest warrant for her since October, the court's clerk magistrate Brian Kearney said. Zubeidat Tsarnaev and her husband moved to Dagestan from the United States. The family is originally from the embattled Russian republic of Chechnya but fled from the brutal wars there in the 1990s. The two brothers were born in Kyrgyzstan and moved at different times to the United States. The family's adopted republic has become a focus for investigators, especially given that Tamerlan Tsarnaev went there during a six-month trip to Russia last year. Officials have been looking into what he may have done there during that time, though Tamerlan's father has said his son was with him throughout the trip. The young man is believed to have posted videos online tied to militant jihadists in the region. On two occasions before that -- in March and late September 2011 -- Russian authorities asked U.S authorities to investigate Tamerlan Tsarnaev. They provided ""basically the same information"" both times, a U.S. government official said. A senior U.S. official with direct knowledge of the information said that the case from Russia ""was extremely thin,"" adding that the European country wanted Tamerlan Tsarnaev questioned to see if he and others had become ""radicalized."" Suspects' mother describes her last conversation with her sons . Police: Suspects may have planned NYC 'party' What did the Tsarnaev brothers want to do days after inflicting pain and carnage in the Massachusetts capital? According to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, the brothers' destination may have been New York City and their plan may have been to ""party."" Kelly said information collected from the surviving suspect included ""something about a party or having a party."" ""It may have been words to the effect of coming 'to party' in New York,"" Kelly said. The man who was carjacked and held hostage -- allegedly by the Tsarnaev brothers -- just outside Boston last week said he thought he heard the two men say ""Manhattan"" in their conversation, the commissioner said. The one-time hostage has told investigators the suspects spoke in another language, which may have been Chechen or Russian, while he drove with them. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was in New York in late 2012, likely in November, Kelly said. The brothers used a remote control device similar those used to control toy cars to detonate the two bombs in Boston, Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, a Maryland Democrat and member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, said Wednesday. The surviving suspect, Dzhokhar, has indicated that his older brother Tamerlan masterminded the attack and described he and his brother as self-radicalized jihadists, according to a U.S. government source. The teenager cited the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as motivating factors behind the attack, a U.S. government official said. Dzhokhar told authorities that neither he nor his brother had had any contact with terrorist groups overseas, the U.S. government official said. But the official cautioned that the interviews were preliminary and that Tsarnaev's account needs to be checked out. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death. The suspects' uncle said a friend of Tamerlan's ""brainwashed"" him. And the suspects' former brother-in-law said Tamerlan seemed to be influenced in Islam by a friend named Misha, but that he did not see Misha try to radicalize him. Investigators had no immediate comment on reports of someone named ""Misha."" Investigators are looking into the possibility Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- who was married with a young daughter, whom he frequently cared for while his wife worked as a home health aide -- may have helped finance the bomb plot through drug sales, according to a source familiar with the investigation. Dead Boston bomb suspect posted video of jihadist, analysis show . Boylston Street reopens as slain officer is mourned .

"(CNN) -- As Africa celebrates the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Organization of African Unity, the focus of the celebrations is renewing Africa's vision for continental unification as envisaged by its founding fathers such Kwame Nkrumah. It is not the lack of political will that hampers Africa regional integration, it is poor infrastructure. Africa's challenges have less to do with fragmentation of state but more to do with the lack of infrastructure connectivity, especially energy, transportation, irrigation and telecommunications. The World Bank estimates that Africa will need to invest nearly $93 billion annually over the next decade to meet its infrastructure needs. A third of this cost will go to maintenance. Part of this investment can be met through public and private sector investment, including novel facilities such as the infrastructure bonds proposed by the African Development Bank. But the urgency to address Africa's infrastructure requires additional non-conventional interventions such as the mobilization of the continent's armed forces. Historically, there is a long legacy of military involvement in infrastructure projects going back to the Roman days. Read this: Gunboats keep pirates from 'blue gold' African armed forces possess extensive human resources and equipment needed to build infrastructure projects. They regularly use such facilities during emergencies and are at the forefront of developing robust systems such as smart microgrid systems that can provide decentralized power supply for rural Africa. What is needed is an explicit policy to extend their role in the construction and maintenance of infrastructure projects in cooperation with civilian agencies. Many African countries have been converting military facilities to support civilian infrastructure activities. Rwanda, for example, turned a military barracks into the Kigali Institute of Science and Technology, which played a vital role in the reconstruction of the country after the genocide. The role of the military in Rwanda's civilian affairs involves a wide range of operations which include the awareness-raising annual Army Week. One of the most explicit commitments to the role of the military in infrastructure projects comes from Uganda. The country's armed forces recently established Africa's first University of Military Science and Technology which is training engineers to build and maintain infrastructure projects. Uganda has been collaborating with the US Army on how to rehabilitate its railway networks. Read this: South Africa's private security forces bigger than army . These efforts are targeted interventions and differ remarkably with cases such as Egypt, where the military controls a large proportion of the economy. It is much harder for countries where the military is an economic class to be creative. The role of the military in civilian projects needs to be under democratic control for it to rise above popular suspicions and distrust. Senegal, for example, has established clear policies and operational guidelines that have since independence steered its ""Army-Nation"" program. The program includes activities in infrastructure (especially water supply and road construction), healthcare and environmental management. In 1999 Senegal set up the civil-military committee in support of development to bring together representatives from parliament, the military, government ministries, civil society and the private sector to collaborate on implementing public programs. Its broad membership helps to foster trust and coordination. It can be argued that deploying the military in civilian infrastructure activities could divert attention from essential defense functions. To the contrary, the military would strengthen its national security activities by building infrastructure projects. Read this: 'Africa's tallest building' set for $10 billion tech city . Many of Africa's armed conflicts occur in isolated regions with limited opportunity for economic growth. Poor infrastructure and lack of economic opportunity traps populations in spirals of poverty and conflict over limited resources. Countries such as Indonesia and Papua New Guinea are responding to the challenges of poverty to deploy their armed forces to fill the gap in civilian capacity to build infrastructure projects. Similarly, building robust infrastructure networks makes it easier to police national borders. Investments in Earth observation satellite infrastructure, as well as the ability to deploy troops along national boundaries, is an important element in maintaining peace. Infrastructure built to address economic needs has the additional purpose of helping to maintain internal law and order as well as maintenance of national security. New countries such as South Sudan face the challenge of keeping large armies that were built up to fight for independence. They can choose to dismantle their armed forces or convert them to a force of development. They are better advised to do the latter; their potential role in infrastructure rehabilitation pays for peace building. As Africa celebrates the 50th anniversary of its declaration of unification, it should also reflect on the fact that it has recorded about 80 successful military coups. Led by an increasing number of technocratic presidents, Africa's armies can give future generations hope by helping to build infrastructure -- the motherboard for all economic activities. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Calestous Juma.","Military should be mobilized for infrastructure projects, argues Harvard professor .

"(CNN) -- No sooner had Ruganzu Bruno and his troupe of fellow eco-artists arrived at Kampala's Kawempe area than their presence stirred up questions within the local community. ""What are you doing?"" the startled residents asked. ""Why are you using all this plastic?"" they continued, baffled by the piles of waste bottles that were gradually filling a dusty compound yard in the northwestern suburb of the Ugandan capital. What the group of artists was doing was creating ""The Hand That Speaks,"" an enormous structure made of recycled materials to raise awareness about environmental degradation. ""We were trying to bring out the message that the hand is the one which is throwing this trash into the environment and at the same time it could be used to collect [them] and save the environment,"" says Bruno. And once the nine artists started assembling their futuristic creation, using more than 20,000 bottles collected in the slums of Kampala, the local crowds also decided to lend a helping hand. ""At first, the community were confused but then they really loved it,"" says Bruno. ""They were always getting us bottles."" Eco Art . That was about four years ago, when Bruno was still a student at the Kyambogo University fine art school. During that time, the talented painter and sculptor discovered that he wasn't interested in just crafting artworks that would only satisfy his creative needs. Instead, he wanted his art to have a positive impact on his community. ""When we are trying to achieve things in life we are self-centered, and as artists we tend to make work for ourselves,"" explains Bruno, 30. ""I kind of felt a change within myself to think about others,"" he adds. ""From then on I could not only paint -- I decided to work on work that was beneficial to my community."" Driven by a desire to influence his surroundings, Bruno then became involved in eco-art projects, devising innovative ways to deal with Kampala's acute waste management problem. In 2010 he founded Eco Art Uganda, a collective of artists promoting environmental awareness by transforming anything from discarded bottles and cast-aside metal to broken TVs and computers into contemporary and functional pieces of art. Read this: Specs 'give trash a second chance' ""I was looking for materials that were not expensive and easily available,"" says the soft-spoken artist, who hails from southwest Uganda. ""I really found that this trash and rubbish could actually become a really positive way of communicating to people,"" adds Bruno, who's won several accolades for his work, including the Ugandan Young Achievers award 2011. Amusement park . In April last year, Bruno also won the $10,000 City 2.0 Award at the TEDx summit in Doha, Qatar, for his idea to create an amusement playground for children living in Kampala's congested slums. Using an array of recycled materials, Bruno went on to transform a school yard in Kampala's Kireka community into a fun and safe place where children can play and learn. The eco-park, which was completed last September, is dotted with whimsical structures attracting dozens of children each day -- from a colorful helicopter and life-size board games made of bottles to recycled swings and climbing frames crafted from old tires. Bruno says the entire community, which lacked a recreation facility, embraced the project wholeheartedly. Read this: Boy's flashy invention scares off lions . ""I talked to the head of the school, and together with the parents and the students, they are the ones who collected the bottles,"" says Bruno, who is also a lecturer in the department of Art & Design at Kyambogo University. ""So we built the playground together as a team and they know how to repair it -- this is very important in terms of sustainability."" But more importantly, Bruno, who was orphaned at a young age, says the project has had a positive impact on the children. ""The attention of children in class has improved; the number of children who are dropping out [is falling] because now they have something to keep them busy there, "" he adds. ""There is a really good progress and it has also helped them to express themselves in class."" Legacy . Bruno says his goal is to recreate ""as many as 100"" similar amusement parks in other parts of Uganda. He is also using the prize money to grow an eco-artist loan scheme he's developed, aimed at supporting the business endeavors of creative women in Kireka. It's all part of his continuous efforts to be an artist whose work will serve his community's needs. ""I think a man will always be remembered by his work, ""says Bruno. ""I'm an advocate now of the environment; I'm an advocate for play for children; I'm an artist ...who wants his work to have an effect on the people."".","Ugandan Ruganzu Bruno raises environmental awareness through his art .

"(CNN) -- CNN's Drew Griffin interviewed Dan Holman of Missionaries to the Preborn Iowa about the recent murder of Dr. George Tiller, whose women's clinic frequently took center stage in the debate over abortion. Tiller was shot and killed while serving as an usher at his Wichita, Kansas, church Sunday morning, according to police. Below is a transcript of Holman's interview. Drew Griffin: Dan, first off -- tell me about your group, and what you guys do and the name of it. Dan Holman: OK. We are Missionaries for the Preborn Iowa. There [are] a number of Missionaries of Preborn. The group in Milwaukee is our judiciary of preborn. And we speak up for preborn child in different venues including the abortion rallies and on the street, political venues. And media types and venues like we are doing right now. Drew Griffin: When you heard the news over the weekend about the abortion doctor -- that I'm sure you are well aware of -- was shot and killed, what was your reaction? Dan Holman: I was cheered by it because I knew that he wouldn't be killing any more babies. And I expect that would happen when all legal and moral -- legal ways of trying to stop it has been exhausted, as they have tried to prosecute him for giving abortions to people in violation of Kansas law. Drew Griffin: When you say you were cheered by it, is there any inconsistency in your thought in that you are trying to protect life and at the same time here's this doctor who was shot and killed and in your own words you are cheered by that? Dan Holman: No, because I'm protecting innocent life. I'm not -- and the doctor or the abortionist is guilty of murder as far as I'm concerned. It's no different for him to be killing a preborn child or a post-born child. The preborn child is entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as a post-born child. Drew Griffin: So, you support this killing? Dan Holman:  I don't advocate it, I don't support it. But I don't condemn it, and I believe that what he did was justifiable. Drew Griffin: You told me earlier that he -- meaning the shooter -- he did what the law should have done? Dan Holman:  Right, exactly. The law should have protected the preborn child; and the law is supposed to execute vengeance, you know, in protecting the child. But what the man did was not execute vengeance, as far as I'm concerned. He was protecting preborn children, ones that are slated for abortion today and the future. I don't feel that what he did is vengeance. Drew Griffin: Do you seek this fate on all doctors performing abortions out there? Dan Holman: I believe that all abortionists are deserving of death, and they are not the only ones. There are politicians and judges and others who support this murder that are also deserving of death. Drew Griffin: Would you care to name names, Dan? Dan Holman: George Bush, Barack Obama. Any politician that gives our tax money to Planned Parenthood and organizations that kill babies are participating in the killing of innocent children deserve the same penalty. Drew Griffin: Huh. And you, again, stage a weekly protest at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Iowa City. Your wife has been banned from doing that? Dan Holman: Right. She has a -- they -- she's received an injunction from being there. Drew Griffin: But you will be there this Wednesday? Dan Holman: I will be there this Wednesday. Drew Griffin: And you were at Notre Dame? Dan Holman: Yes, and we were at [unintelligible] before that. Drew Griffin: Right. All right. Well, Dan, thank you so much for the interview.","Dan Holman says his group speaks for preborn children in different venues .

"London (CNN) -- Two men have been charged with endangering an aircraft, police in Britain said Sunday. An altercation they were allegedly involved in caused a flight from Pakistan to the UK to be diverted Friday. A UK fighter jet was scrambled to escort Pakistan International Airlines Flight PK709 as it was diverted from northwestern England's Manchester Airport to Stansted airport near London. Essex police, who cover the area near Stansted, said officers arrested Tayyab Subhani, 30, and Mohammed Safdar, 41, and removed them from the plane, which had 297 passengers aboard. The flight originated in Lahore. The men are to appear in court Monday. Wajid Hasan, Pakistan's high commissioner to the United Kingdom, told CNN that the two passengers ""got into an altercation with air stewardesses and threatened to blow up the plane."" The flight attendants contacted the pilot, who contacted UK air traffic control authorities, who then scrambled the fighter jet, he said. The plane later continued on to Manchester from Stansted after all the passengers and cargo were screened, a process that took about four hours, according to the high commissioner's office. Passengers arriving at Stansted told CNN they were delayed by what several called a ""terrorist scare."" Police have not mentioned terrorism in connection with the incident.

"(CNN) -- The AGA Rangemaster may be a quintessentially British cooker, but demand has slumped amid the UK's recession. Now, the cooker that has been at the heart of British kitchens since the 1930s, is looking overseas for its profits. Britain's troubled housing market hit sales of the sturdy oven hard, the company's chief executive William McGrath told CNN. Sales fell and the company cut jobs. Read more: Patek Philippe boss: Quality is more important than growth . ""The level of housing transaction is well under half the level it was back in 2007 and 2008, so, really we have seen a flat-lining period,"" McGrath said.

""From the peak we have lost around 600 people,"" McGrath told CNN. The move has saved the company around $27 million, but to sustain profits they're looking to new markets. The company sells 37% of all its products to North America, but it expects this number to increase to half of all its sales. It also plans to launch in the Chinese market.

""The cooker doesn't really exist as a product category, so we're talking about the potential for a whole new product category which will hopefully take China by storm.""

The Chinese buyer, used to steaming, boiling and frying food on a gas burner, may need some persuading to consider a giant cooker complete with roasting and baking ovens.

Chinese kitchens are often small and in high-rise buildings -- creating a squeeze for a cooker which is between 90 and 110cm wide and weighs around the same as a baby elephant. But McGrath is optimistic, demonstrating to CNN how a wok can be used to stir-fry on the rangemaster's hot plate. ""As we found in Britain in the 1930s, there's the evolution in the nature of the Chinese kitchen, maybe moving from a galley kitchen to something's that is more the heart of the home,"" McGrath said.

"(CNN) -- Researchers managed to create embryonic stem cells through cloning, a breakthrough in the field that was announced May 15 in the journal Cell. That study is now being called into question -- but not necessarily on scientific grounds. It appears that the study authors, led by Shoukhrat Mitalipov at Oregon Health & Science University, made some errors in the graphical presentations when they submitted the manuscript. A commenter on the PubPeer website noticed some duplication of figures (the data plots, graphics and images in a scientific paper) and apparent errors in labeling. Mitalipov acknowledged that the commenter made some valid points but told Nature.com, ""The results are real, the cell lines are real, everything is real."" Emilie Marcus, editor-in-chief of Cell, posted a statement on the study in the comments on the Cell website: . ""Based on our own initial in-house assessment of issues raised and in initial discussions with the authors, it seems that there were some minor errors made by the authors when preparing the figures for initial submission. While we are continuing discussions with the authors, we do not believe these errors impact the scientific findings of the paper in any way."" The study has received several comments relating to how fast it was reviewed for publication at the journal. The review process is not being questioned, Marcus said, and the paper was not considered any less thoroughly than usual despite its being published relatively quickly. According to Nature.com, the study was accepted three days after it was submitted, and it was published 12 days later. Oregon Health & Science University released this statement: . ""In response to the issues raised in PubPeer, OHSU has had several discussions with the journal which published the paper, Cell. Based on OHSU's own initial reviews and the original assessments by Cell, OHSU agrees that there were some minor errors made when preparing the figures for initial submission. Neither OHSU nor Cell editors believe these errors impact the scientific findings of the paper in any way. We also do not believe there was any wrongdoing."" The researchers are also sending more information to Cell, including photos and original data. ""Our shared goal is to publish a correction noting the errors and correcting the photos as soon as both OHSU and Cell feel the issues are fully investigated,"" the statement said. A South Korean scientist in 2004 claimed to have cloned human embryonic stem cells. Reports of Hwang Woo-suk's studies attracted worldwide attention and enthusiasm from researchers and patients, but in 2006 he acknowledged faking his findings after questions of impropriety emerged. Hwang was convicted in 2009 of embezzling money and illegally buying human eggs, according to state media. He was sentenced to a two-year prison term suspended for three years. Here's how the OHSU experiment in question actually worked: . Normally, an embryo is created when sperm enters the egg and it starts to divide. But, in the Cell study, Mitalipov and colleagues began with skin cells from an 8-month-old baby that had a genetic disease. They did not use sperm. To create each embryo, they took the DNA out of an egg so that it was hollow and replaced it with the skin cell's DNA instead. The baby's DNA was the only genetic material being used. With the help of chemicals, the egg started to divide just like a normal fertilized egg would. Then, within several days, embryos genetically identical to the baby were created, from which stem cells were derived. Researchers made more than 120 embryos using this method. Embryonic stems research is inherently controversial because in order to use the stem cells for science, the embryo, which is a collection of cells that could develop into a fully formed human, is destroyed, even though embryos in these procedures are left over from in vitro fertilization. However, Mitalipov said the embryos created in his study, from skin cells and eggs, would not grow babies. That would have required additional technology, and it wasn't part of the study. Cloning stem cells: What does it mean?","A study about cloning stem cells contained errors in its presentation of graphics .
The journal Cell says these errors don't impact the scientific findings .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A top AEG executive referred to Michael Jackson as ""the freak"" and another called him ""creepy"" just hours before their company signed the pop icon to a huge concert deal. The revelation brought an audible gasp in the Los Angeles courtroom at the wrongful death trial Wednesday and left fans crying. Jackson's mother and children are suing AEG Live for what they say was the negligent hiring, retention or supervision of Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the singer's death. Katherine Jackson watched from the front row as her lawyer questioned AEG Live Senior Vice President and General Counsel Shawn Trell about an e-mail exchange with his boss at parent company AEG. The Jackson family matriarch began weeping when Trell returned to the witness stand Thursday morning. She left the courtroom and did not return. Sweet controversy at death trial . ""Is it the policy of AEG to talk in derogatory terms about the artist you're going to do business with?"" Jackson lawyer Brian Panish asked. ""No,"" Trell answered. Panish then showed jurors an e-mail Trell sent on January 28, 2009, to Ted Fikre, AEG's chief legal officer, letting him know he was about to go to Jackson's home for the signing of the contract for his ""This Is It"" concert tour. ""Does that mean you get to meet the freak?"" Fikre replied. Trell responded: ""Apparently. Not sure how I feel about that. Interesting for sure, but kind of creepy."" The e-mail exchange happened less than four hours before Trell and other AEG executives visited Jackson's Los Angeles home. AEG execs face questions about Jackson's death . ""This is a man you hoped to make millions and millions of dollars from?"" Panish asked Trell. ""Didn't your mom ever say if you don't have anything good to to say about someone, don't say anything?"" Trell earlier testified that he was excited to meet Jackson for the first time and was impressed with his ""good, firm handshake."" ""I may not have necessarily agreed with some of the life choices Michael Jackson made, but I certainly had enormous respect for him as an entertainer."" Manager's e-mails found, could be key . A dry review . Most of Wednesday's session was a dry review of Jackson and Murray's contracts as AEG Live's defense team worked to convince jurors that Murray was not hired by the concert promoter. Jackson chose, hired and supervised the doctor, they contend. Murray signed his contract the day before Jackson's June 25, 2009, death, but AEG executives and Jackson never put their signatures on it. Jackson lawyers, however, argue he had been already working for two months based on an oral contract. The Jackson lawsuit contends that AEG Live executives ignored red flags that should have warned them that Jackson was in danger from Murray's treatment. The coroner ruled that Jackson died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, which Murray told police he was using to treat the singer's insomnia. Panish -- the Jackson family's lead lawyer -- questioned Trell Thursday about his previous testimony that there were no ""red flags"" to alert AEG executives about Jackson's declining health. He showed jurors an e-mail sent to AEG Live President Randy Phillips and Co-CEO Paul Gongaware by ""This Is It"" stage manager John ""Bugzee"" Houghdahl on June 19, 2009 -- six days before Jackson died. ""I have watched him deteriorate in front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks,"" Houghdahl wrote. ""He was able to do multiple 360 spins back in April. He'd fall on his ass if he tried now."" Another Prince . The name of Prince Rogers Nelson -- the artist commonly known as Prince -- came up when Trell acknowledged that while AEG Live had promoted about 100 tours, it had produced only one other concert tour the size of Jackson's shows. When Panish suggested Prince had not had ""a very favorable experience"" with AEG, Trell said he'd not spoken to him about it. Panish: ""Did you ever try to get a doctor for $150,000 a month for Prince?"" Trell: ""No."" Panish: ""And is Mr. Nelson is still alive today?"" Trell: ""Yes.""

"London (CNN) -- The family of the British soldier brutally slain in a cleaver attack in southeast London spoke movingly Friday of a man who was a devoted husband, father and brother, as well as a dedicated serviceman. Stepfather Ian Rigby said Drummer Lee Rigby was a ""precious gift"" who had always wanted to serve in the army and was a devoted family man. It was difficult accepting that his stepson died on his native soil, he said. When a soldier is serving in Afghanistan, ""you come to terms with it,"" Ian Rigby said. ""You don't expect something like that on your doorstep. It's very difficult."" ""I just want to say that I love Lee, I always will, and I'm proud to be his wife,"" said Rebecca Rigby, sobbing. ""He was a devoted father to our son, Jack, and we will both miss him terribly."" Her husband had been due to travel home to see her and their 2-year-old son this weekend, she said. In the capital's Woolwich neighborhood, where Rigby was slain Wednesday by two men who drove a car into him, then hacked him with knives and a cleaver, a bank of flowers left in tribute swelled by the hour Friday. Soldier was a machine gunner, Royal Palaces drummer, father . Many of those who came to the road near an army barracks were emotional as they paid tribute not just to him, but to the contribution of all British servicemen and women. A note signed by two army cadets, reads: ""I understand the great lengths you would have gone to to protect our British people. It's a huge disappointment to hear the way people have treated you in your own country."" One bouquet , propped in a pair of black army boots, had a message that read: ""RIP Brave Soldier. Dream sweet dreams. Remembered always and never forgotten. Our thoughts with you and your family."" One elderly man, using a cane, had tears in his eyes as he walked, shaking his head, up and down the flowers for half an hour. He removed his hat, looked to the heavens and made the sign of the cross. Another woman, loudly sobbing, asked police officers standing by the growing array of tributes: ""Why did this happen, why did this happen here? My children go to the school just there."" A man sharply dressed in a suit and tie brought his toddler son to drop off flowers, each placing their blooms next to the army boots. The father reached down to hug his son, tears filling his eyes. One note referred to both a quote by the late Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi and comments made by one of the attackers, saying: ""An eye for an eye makes the world go blind."" Another had a more sinister message. Attached to a wooden cross adorned with a red poppy, the symbol of remembrance for the British armed forces, it read: ""Your passing shall be avenged."" Outpouring of support for charity for vets . Since the brutal slaying, the outpouring of support for a charity that supports Britain's wounded military veterans, Help for Heroes, has been so great that its website has crashed. Rigby, a 25-year-old machine gunner and military drummer, was wearing a Help for Heroes T-shirt when he was attacked in Woolwich, according to witnesses. Help for Heroes said Friday it had been ""overwhelmed with people spontaneously showing their support for the Armed Forces"" since the news broke. ""This sudden surge of interest in the work we're doing to help the wounded and their families has taken us completely by surprise,"" the charity said, noting that some were buying hoodies and T-shirts like the one Rigby had on. ""We just want to help, and all funds we receive will be used to provide direct, practical support to those affected by their service to our country."" 3 men arrested in connection to slaying . There's been no indication that Rigby knew the men who attacked him with meat cleavers Wednesday afternoon. One of the two, who approached a man filming the gory scene in the Woolwich neighborhood, suggested that Rigby had been targeted only ""because Muslims are dying daily"" at the hands of British troops like him. Britain's armed forces have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. All its combat troops are due to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014. ""We must fight them as they fight us. An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,"" he said in the video aired by CNN affiliate ITN. Friends, acquaintances and British media have identified that man as 28-year-old Michael Adebolajo, a British national of Nigerian descent. Police have not released his name, nor those of the others they've arrested. Adebolajo and the 22-year-old suspect also tied directly to the attack are now hospitalized under guard after a confrontation with police in which they were shot. A 29-year-old man arrested Thursday is being on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. Two women arrested Thursday, ages 29 and 31, have been released without being charged, police said Friday. Police continue to search five addresses in London and one in Lincolnshire, which is in eastern England. Suspect knew British Muslim radical leader . It is understood the two people suspected of carrying out the knife attack were known to Britain's domestic security service. They had been featured in previous investigations into other people, but were not themselves under surveillance. Abu Baraa blamed Wednesday's attack not on his friend Michael Adebolajo -- who he says is the bloody, cleaver-wielding man shown talking in the ITN video -- but on the British government and said there may be more attacks. ""As long as (British) foreign policy is engaging in violence, they're only inviting violence in retaliation,"" Baraa told CNN. By sharp contrast, Prime Minister David Cameron said ""the fault lies solely with sickening individuals who carried out this attack,"" adding that ""nothing in Islam ... justifies this truly dreadful act."" British Muslim radical leader Anjem Choudary told CNN on Thursday that he knew Adebolajo, noting the suspect attended demonstrations and a few lectures organized by Choudary's group Al-Muhajiroun. In fact, an ITN video from April 2007 shows Adebolajo standing behind Choudary at a rally protesting the arrest of men who allegedly made inflammatory speeches inside a mosque. Syrian cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed, who founded Al-Muhajiroun in the late 1990s, told CNN Terrorism Analyst Paul Cruickshank by phone from Tripoli, Lebanon, he also had been acquainted with Adebolajo. Bakri Mohammed used to live in the United Kingdom but was barred from returning after the 2005 terror attacks. Bakri Mohammed said Adebolajo, who he knew by his Muslim name ""Mujahid,"" attended several talks he gave in London from 2003 to 2004 and was at his side at a number of Al-Muhajiroun protests against the war in Iraq around that time. One talk Adebolajo attended was at a Woolwich community center, he said, noting the group met in such locations because they were not welcomed in mosques. The very large majority of British Muslims reject Bakri Mohammed's views. The radical cleric said that although they did not have many interactions, Adebolajo stood out because he was a new convert to the religion. Bakri Mohammed said he had no contact with him after he left the UK. Volley of shots . Dramatic video footage obtained by Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper, filmed from an apartment block overlooking the street, shows the moment when armed police arrived at the scene. One of the attackers rushes at the police vehicle brandishing knives while the other aims a gun. Both are brought down by a volley of shots. The firearms unit was called in after the initial alert because British police do not usually carry weapons. Witnesses remarked that the two attackers appeared to wait for the armed police to arrive, nearly 15 minutes after their assault on Rigby. The two injured suspects remained in stable condition at separate South London hospitals Friday, the Metropolitan Police said. The attack, which Cameron and others called an act of terror, stirred anxiety and alerts in Britain not seen since the summer of 2005, when coordinated bomb attacks struck London's public transport network. An additional 1,200 police are now on London's streets to reassure the public, police said Thursday. Extra security is in place for military personnel and sites. London attack: Terrorists targeting soldiers at home again? Violent reactions? The Woolwich bloodshed spurred concerns not only about violence by Islamic extremists, but also about attacks targeting Muslims by people angered by Rigby's killing. London attack mirrors plot to behead Muslim soldier . In Kent, police arrested a man on suspicion of ""racially aggravated criminal damage"" at a religious building. And on Wednesday night in Essex, a man with two knives was arrested after throwing a smoke grenade at the Al Falah Braintree Islamic Center and demanding someone come outside to answer to the Woolwich slaying, said the mosque's secretary, Sikander Sleemy. Members of the far-right English Defence League clashed with police late Wednesday, with a tweet from its official account touting that ""it's fair to say that finally the country is waking up!:-) NO SURRENDER!"" ""Don't listen to the Government cover ups, The lies about Islam being peaceful,"" read another EDL tweet Thursday. Political and social commentator Mohammed Ansar appealed for ""a sense of calm (and) perspective"" after what he called ""a really, really heinous act of, I would say, criminality, ... not terrorism."" ""What we don't need are knee-jerk reactions ... to really ratchet up tensions and really stoke and inflame anxieties within communities,"" he told CNN. Nearly 100 senior British imams together issued a statement sharply condemning the ""sick and barbaric"" killing, which they said had spurred ""hate-fueled individuals"" to attack mosques and Muslims. The group called for action and dialogue to prevent attacks by extremists of all ilks. ""We (urge) our fellow citizens not to be taken in the mindless rantings of the (few) extra extremists in our midst,"" they said.

"(CNN) -- After a year where football's name has been dragged through the mud by a series of racism controversies, UEFA has announced that players and officials will face a 10-match ban if found guilty of racist abuse. Following a meeting of UEFA's executive committee in London Thursday, the European governing body confirmed the bans would apply to its own competitions, while other national associations remain free to decide on their own punishments. The new tougher sanction comes just over a week after the English Football Association drew criticism for its plans to introduce a minimum five-match suspension for racism. ""An association should adopt the same or similar measures. UEFA has always acted in a way to try to convince people rather than impose,"" said UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino at a press conference. ""I don't think you measure the way of fighting against racism in one simple measure and sanction. ""The way I read the FA's decision is that it could be five matches and it could also be 15. The FA is sure their way of regulating is more correct for England. ""It's their decision but it doesn't mean they do more or less than us. Everyone has to do what they can do in this field. ""The FA is autonomous and knows best what is best for England to do in the fight against racism. It is probably one of the countries where the most has been done."" According to details released by UEFA, clubs and national side's whose fans are found guilty of racist abuse will be punished with a partial stadium closure as a first offense, while a second offense will lead to a complete closure. Only last week, AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli told CNN that he was prepared to walk off the pitch if racially abused once again. The Italy striker was subjected to ""monkey chants"" by visiting fans during Milan's goalless draw with Roma at the San Siro. ""I always said that if it (racism) happened in the stadium I will just do like 'nobody says nothing and I don't care,'"" Balotelli told CNN. ""But this time I think I've changed my mind a little bit. If it's going to happen one more time, then I'm going to leave the pitch because it's so stupid."" Balotelli is not the first player to have suffered racial abuse while playing for AC Milan -- one of the most revered clubs in Europe having won 18 league titles and seven European Cups. In January, midfielder Kevin Prince-Boateng walked off the pitch in disgust after being racially abused by a section of supporters during a friendly game at Pro Patria. Since then, UEFA has stated its intention to introduce stricter punishments for those found guilty of racism after being heavily criticized in the past for being too lenient. The new rules are intended to curb racism at clubs such as Italian club Lazio, which has been charged four times by UEFA so far this season, with the Italian side paying $300,000 in fines. Europe's governing body also plans to introduce the implementation of biological passports for players in the future. Biological profiles are built up by collating an athlete's drug test results over time, therefore making it easier to detect differences which could indicate the use of a banned substance. A new UEFA anti-doping program will also examine 900 samples given in the past five years to decipher whether steroids have been used. On Friday, UEFA is expected to announce changes to the Europa League with the winner set to be granted a place in the Champions League from 2015. Meanwhile, Berlin's Olympic Stadium will host the 2015 Champions League final, while Warsaw will welcome the finalists of the Europa League.","UEFA sets out punishments for clubs and nations whose fans are found guilty of racist abuse .

"(CNN) -- After a series of high-profile and embarrassing hacks, Twitter has rolled out a new, two-step login to help users prevent unwanted intrusions. The ""two-factor"" verification system, which will be optional, asks users to register a phone number, e-mail account and six-digit code that would have to be entered, via text message, each time they log in to the site. ""Every day, a growing number of people log in to Twitter,"" Jim O'Leary, of the site's security team, said in a blog post. ""Usually these login attempts come from the genuine account owners, but we occasionally hear from people whose accounts have been compromised by email phishing schemes or a breach of password data elsewhere on the web."" The move comes in the wake of repeated hacks to prominent Twitter accounts in recent months. Last month, The Associated Press's Twitter account was compromised by someone who falsely tweeted that there had been a bombing at the White House. It was the latest in a laundry list of media organizations hacked in recent months. Among them: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, Bloomberg News, CBS, ""60 Minutes"" and ""48 Hours."" In 2011, Fox News saw its Twitter account compromised and used to send a fake message that President Obama had been assassinated. In February, Burger King and Jeep were similarly hacked. And earlier this year, Twitter itself was hacked. User names and e-mail addresses for about 250,000 users were exposed. In many cases, account hacking happens when the target has an easy-to-guess password, accesses the account via public Wi-Fi, or forgets to log out after using an account on a publicly shared computer. Accounts can obviously also be accessed when a user who hasn't logged out loses his or her phone or has it stolen. But high-profile victims are often targeted by phishing, where hackers send deceptive e-mails that encourage victims to enter personal information. Privacy advocates have long called on Twitter to beef up its security. Many security experts applauded the move Thursday, at least partially. ""Right now Twitter's 2FA (two-factor authentication) is more likely to be welcomed by individuals who own personal accounts, and small companies with a Twitter presence, than embraced by the high profile victims attacked by the (hacker group) Syrian Electronic Army in the past,"" Graham Cluley, of Sophos Security, wrote on his blog. But he said it's unlikely that many of the media outlets and other high-profile organizations that have been hardest hit will take advantage of the new tools. ""Sadly, I don't think it's going to help them at all,"" he wrote. ""Media organizations who share breaking news via social media typically have many staff, around the globe, who share the same Twitter accounts. 2FA isn't going to help these companies, because they can't all access the same phone at the same time."" For those users, he recommends a system like Facebook, on which multiple users can access the same account, to varying degrees of authority, with their own unique accounts and passwords. Twitter's O'Leary noted that the security upgrade isn't a cure-all. ""Of course, even with this new security option turned on, it's still important for you to use a strong password and follow the rest of our advice for keeping your account secure,"" he wrote.","Twitter has added a two-step login option to make users' accounts more secure .
The move comes after multiple high-profile hacks .

"(CNN) -- An Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River in Washington has collapsed, a spokesman for the Washington State Patrol said Thursday. People and cars were in the water. The bridge is located in a rural area, said Trooper Mark Francis, the spokesman. Because of that, he said he did not expect mass causalities or injuries. There were no immediate reports of either. CNN affiliate King 5 News in Seattle broadcast still images of the evening collapse, showing a span of the bridge in the water and crowds nearby. Images included two people sitting atop vehicles in the water. It was not immediately clear what caused the collapse, which happened some 60 miles north of Seattle. The Washington State Department of Transportation will take over the investigation, Francis said. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.","The collapse happened north of Seattle .

"(CNN) -- I was born 70 years ago this spring in the Bronx in New York City. In the years I've lived, more than 500,000 Americans have died and almost 1 million have been wounded in at least 15 U.S. military conflicts. Some wars were long and cost a great deal in lives and treasure, such as World War II and the Vietnam War; others were short and cheap, such as the invasion of Grenada in 1983. Americans are being killed and wounded today in Afghanistan in a war that has lasted 12 years, the longest in U.S. history. And now some in Congress and elsewhere are calling for U.S. military action in Syria and Iran. One thing you can count on: Every U.S. military intervention takes surprising turns and is beset by unexpected problems. Victory looks a lot easier in the planning stages than it does once the bullets and bombs are flying. When I was born in 1943, the United States had 12 million men and women under arms and -- with its allies -- was beginning to swing the fortunes of war in Europe and the Pacific against the Axis powers. World War II was a ""good war,"" a necessary horror that prevented the even worse horror of fascism taking over the world. The U.S. has more than 60,000 service personnel fighting the last vestiges of the war in Afghanistan. This is a war that began with a necessary mission -- to remove the Taliban regime that gave refuge and support to the terrorist organization responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans. Over time, however, the mission was transformed into a much broader and far more difficult imperative -- to bring effective governance and security to Afghanistan. That is a mission of choice, not necessity. The United States has been at war in the greater Middle East more or less continuously since the early 1980s. In 1982, the U.S. put a small force in Lebanon to facilitate the withdrawal of Palestine Liberation Organization forces from Beirut during the Israeli occupation. Over time the mission grew, and the U.S. became involved in the Lebanese civil war. The U.S. Embassy was bombed, along with the Marine Barracks, with the loss of 241 American lives. The situation continued to escalate until President Ronald Reagan had the wisdom to withdraw American forces from a conflict getting rapidly out of hand. All too soon, the U.S. was back at war in the Middle East. It skirmished with Iranian forces through much of the 1980s. In the 1990s, the U.S. and its allies liberated Kuwait and established no-fly zones over, and conducted strikes against, Iraq. In the current century, the United States fought in Afghanistan and invaded Iraq and put down an insurgency there. Reasonable people can disagree about the wisdom of U.S. actions in each of these situations, but they were all wars of choice, not of necessity. Too often, decisions to intervene militarily were founded on incomplete or erroneous information, the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq being a case in point. Each of the U.S. military interventions in the Middle East has evolved in unexpected ways. Only rarely have U.S. political leaders had the discipline to stick to the original mission. Today Syria looks very similar to Lebanon in the early 1980s in its complexity of ethnic, religious, political and clan conflicts. Yet some in Congress want the U.S. to arm the rebels or enforce no-fly zones. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, has even argued for American ""boots on the ground"" to protect Syria's chemical weapons from terrorists. The U.S. may go into Syria with limited aims, but the risk of unforeseen consequences would be grave. Others argue America should go to war with Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons, but no one can predict with certainty how effective that would be or how it might evolve. Most experts believe decisive action would require a concerted air campaign lasting weeks. Leaders of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps have said they would adopt guerrilla tactics if Iran was attacked. If Iran's commandoes attacked U.S. forces or installations in the region, or those of U.S. allies, how many incidents would it take before the United States decided to replace the regime in Tehran -- the only sure way to end the conflict? As I look back at U.S. military involvements in my lifetime, I see many wars in which America accomplished great things -- defending vital U.S. interests or sacrificing in defense of international law. There may be such necessary cases in the future, such as honoring the U.S. commitment to defend South Korea. But I also see wars in which the United States blundered into complicated situations with disastrous results for the country and for others. America's leaders should learn from the country's previous military involvements. They should not casually initiate conflict with only limited understanding of complex situations. It's past time for greater caution in commitments of U.S. military forces, particularly in the Middle East. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Barry Blechman.","Since Barry Blechman was born 70 years ago, America has engaged in at least 15 wars .
To name a few: Lebanon, Gulf War, Bosnia, Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan and Iraq, he says .

"(CNN) -- The head of European football has told players not to walk off the pitch if they are racially abused, saying any decision to stop a match should be left to the referee. UEFA president Michel Platini's comments come just one week after AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli, who was subjected to ""monkey chants"" in a recent match against Roma, told CNN he would leave the pitch if he was abused in future. Balotelli's teammate Kevin-Prince Boateng walked off the field during an exhibition match against a fourth division team in January and while Platini support's Boateng's decision, it is a situation he is keen not to see repeated. ""It's not a matter for the player to regulate the game and to stop the game; it's a matter for the referee,"" Platini, who has been president of European football's governing body since 2007, told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""It's not normal that people in 2013 are being insulted about their color, about the difference of color. It's not normal. It's very tough for the player on the field."" But Platini fears that if a team is ""not happy"" and is losing a match its players could decide to leave the field for reasons that might having nothing to do with racist abuse. On Thursday, UEFA announced a raft of new racism regulations -- part closures of stadiums, match abandonments and full stadium closures in the event of discriminatory chanting. Clubs would be handed a fine of $65,000, a figure which has drawn criticism as being too meager for football teams which are multi-million dollar businesses. But Platini defended the severity of that financial sanction. ""It's not a question of money,"" explained the Frenchman, who said clubs are often left in a difficult position when trying to deal with fans who attend games armed with political agendas. In the past Platini has also faced criticism for his stance on goal-line technology (GLT), with the Frenchman often portrayed as a ""luddite"" for opposing the use of a system which FIFA has embraced. GLT debuted at last year's Club World Cup and is set for another run out in June's FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil. But the 57-year-old Platini defended his position, insisting money should be spent on developing the game at grassroots level rather than GLT. ""It will cost me $67 million to have GLT,"" continued Platini, who was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1984. ""I have to put it in all the games in the Champions League and all the games in the Europa League. I have to put it in Kazakhstan, in Manchester and in Turkey. ""It costs me $67 million, for one goal, two goals a year? I prefer to invest that for the use football in the grassroots."" Championed as a possible successor to FIFA president Sepp Blatter at the next election in 2015, Platini would not be drawn on whether he has ambitions to succeed the 77-year-old Swiss. ""He will be 79,"" said Platini. referring to how old Blatter will be at FIFA's next presidential elections. ""If he thinks it's time to stop, it's up to him."" If Platini does succeed Blatter as head of football's global governing body, one item on his agenda will be the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, particularly with regard to what time of the year that tournament should be staged. Fears have been raised over playing the tournament in its usual June-July slot, which would see players compete in high temperatures. Platini has long been an advocate of playing the tournament in the European winter, a proposal which has been met with staunch opposition as it would disrupt the traditional season for Europe's major leagues. ""If I am president of FIFA or not president of FIFA,"" declared Platini, ""I will always support we have to play in winter.""","Michel Platini urges players not to walk off the pitch if racially abused .

"(CNN) -- One was a ""nice guy,"" who was ""friendly and very polite"" and ""just wanted to help everybody."" Then there was the ""crazed ... animal"" -- someone who'd brutally hack to death a man in broad daylight on the streets of London, then tried to justify it and suggested there was more violence to come. Two vastly descriptions, for one person: Michael Adebolajo. While British police have not named any of the men arrested in connection with Wednesday's gory slaying of British soldier Lee Rigby, one of them didn't hide his identity at the time. That man -- toting a meat cleaver and large kitchen knife in his bloody hands -- sought out a cell phone camera minutes after the attack to justify what he and another man allegedly had just done. ""The only reason we killed this man ... is because Muslims are dying daily,"" he said in a video later aired by CNN affiliate ITN. ""This British soldier is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."" He was not done. The man insisted British people should force their government to remove troops from ""our lands"" -- an apparent reference to largely Islamic countries like Iraq and Afghanistan -- or else they'd see more bloodshed. ""You will never be safe,"" he said. Friends, acquaintances and British media identified the man of this video as Adebolajo. He hasn't been heard from in public since he made those remarks, as Rigby's mutilated body lay behind him. He and the 22-year-old with him rushed at armed police when they arrived at the site of the attack on southeast London's Woolwich neighborhood. Both were wounded by gunfire, and are now under guard in South London hospitals. Others, though, have spoken about the 28-year-old Adebolajo -- explaining who he was and, in some cases, why he allegedly did what he did. ""He was dedicated to Islam and wanted to put himself at its service and defend it,"" said one of his former associates in Al-Muhajiroun, a British group of Islamic extremists virulently opposed to UK intervention in Iraq and openly supportive of al Qaeda. Described as polite, passionate about Islam . A British national of Nigerian descent, Adebolajo was born into a Catholic family, according to this former associate. At least a decade ago, he converted to Islam. The Guardian newspaper reported that he attended Marshalls Park School, Havering Sixth Form College, then Greenwich University. A former girlfriend told the Independent that Adebolajo was ""really friendly and really polite,"" saying she didn't detect anything that may suggest he was capable of horrific violence. Syrian cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed, who founded Al-Muhajiroun in the late 1990s, said by phone from Tripoli, Lebanon, that he was acquainted with the man he knew by his Muslim name, Mujahid. Adebolajo had been particularly impressed that Islam was a brotherhood between all races ""whites, black and Arabs,"" Bakri said. He described him as ""quiet and shy"" and highly respectful. Adebolajo had two wives, whom he married at the same time during a religious ceremony, said the former associate, who said he was among the attendees. At the time, Al-Muhajiroun frequently conducted marriage ceremonies for followers who were not registered with the British government. Abu Baraa said he's been friends with Adebolajo for seven years. In that time, Baraa came to know him as a ""very caring"" man who ""just wanted to help everybody."" And Adebolajo, who the ex-associate said had children, was especially passionate in his faith, as well as his desire to protect it and his fellow followers. ""He's always been very vocal and very concerned about the affairs of Muslims and people being oppressed,"" Baraa told CNN. ""And he could never tolerate anybody believed to really be oppressed."" Ex-associate: May have been tired of 'no action' Adebolajo attended several talks that Bakri Mohammed gave in London from 2003 to 2004, the radical cleric told CNN. In fact, Bakri Mohammed said Adebolajo was at his side at a number of Al-Muhajiroun protests against the war in Iraq around that time. One talk Adebolajo attended was at a community center in Woolwich -- the neighborhood where Rigby was killed -- recalled Bakri Mohammed, who noted the group met in such locations because they were not welcomed in mosques. The vast majority of British Muslims reject the views of Bakri Mohammed -- who hasn't been allowed back in the United Kingdom since the 2005 bombings of London's transit system. His group has been barred since that time as well, though it's continued to operate under different guises. Its leaders drum home the idea that the British government is at war with Islam, but have been careful to cross legal red lines that would implicate them for inciting terrorism. Bakri Mohammed said that, although they did not have many interactions, Adebolajo stood out because he was a new convert to the religion. The former associate -- who was himself ""born again"" into Islam, but has since shed his radical views -- said that ""like all of us, (Adebolajo) had a literal understanding of Islam."" Even after Bakri Mohammed left England, Adebolajo remained active in Islam circles. British Muslim radical leader Anjem Choudary told CNN that he knew Adebolajo, noting the suspect attended demonstrations and a few lectures organized by Choudary's group Al-Muhajiroun. In fact, an ITN video from April 2007 shows Adebolajo standing behind Choudary at a rally protesting the arrest of men who allegedly made inflammatory speeches inside a mosque. Two or three years ago, Al-Muhajiroun leaders have said that Adebolajo moved away from the group. The former associate -- who last saw Adebolajo in 2005 -- suspects this break might be related to this week's attack in Woolwich. ""What tends to happen is some of the group's members start to see Al-Muhajiroun as all talk and no action,"" he said. ""So they leave the group, and then they do something."" CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta, and CNN's Paul Cruickshank -- CNN's Terrorism Analyst -- reported from London. CNN's Dan Rivers contributed to this report.","NEW: Adebolajo was married to two women and had children, ex-associate says .

"(CNN) -- Italy is famed for fashion, food and, of course, history. In fact, Italy has the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites of any country in the world. As other social needs have taken priority in economically turbulent times, however, the country's budget for maintaining and restoring some of its greatest tourist attractions has been drastically reduced. While the Italian State Tourist Board said it couldn't supply statistics, as much as a third of culture budgets (€1.42 billion/$1.83 billion) have been cut over the past three years, according to a September 2012 report in The Daily Beast. Restoration of historic monuments has instead been left largely to the generosity of private donors. Step forward Italian fashion industry. Over the past two years, several Italian fashion brands have pledged substantial amounts of money for the restoration of well known heritage sites. In 2011, luxury leather goods company Tod's pledged €25 million ($32 million) toward the restoration of the Colosseum. In May 2013, Diesel agreed to restore the Rialto Bridge in Venice to the tune of €5 million ($6.4 million). In Solomeo, Umbria, cashmere brand Brunello Cucinelli is helping to restore the town that it's based in, one building at a time. The Prada Foundation, the brand's charitable art branch, has helped restore the Venetian palazzo Ca' Corner Della Regina for use as an exhibition space. The latest to pledge funds is Fendi. The maker of high-end leather handbags has pledged €2.5 million ($3.2 million) for the restoration of Trevi Fountain, as well as Le Quattro Fontane, both in Rome. Fendi to finance Trevi Fountain makeover . What brands get back . In addition to the PR value of maintaining a heritage site, some brands also gain substantial marketing advantages. During the restoration of Trevi fountain, Fendi will be allowed to display its logo at the site. A plaque dedicated to the brand will be displayed at the site for four years after completion of the restoration. Diesel is reportedly allowed to place advertising billboards over a part of the Rialto Bridge during that restoration. Advertisements on some of their most cherished monuments don't seem to bother locals. ""If someone or a company is spending money to renovate a public building, which will be covered in scaffolding, green netting or white sheeting anyway, why shouldn't they be allowed to brand their contribution?"" says Primo Franco of Nino Franco Winery, speaking about the Rialto Bridge renovations. ""It is a temporary situation and renovation and restoration requires a huge amount of financing and shouldn't this investment be recognized? Funding large scale projects via the private sector is a way to protect the future of the cultural monuments in Italy."" ""We were delighted to learn of Diesel's generosity in contributing to the restoration of the Rialto Bridge,"" said Jane da Mosto, environmental scientist, activist and co-founder of weareherevenice, an organization that seeks to preserve Venice's unique heritage. ""Each time I walk over it, I notice another facet of the incredible construction and it is an eternal reminder of the ingeniousness of Venetian architects and craftsmanship. It is also appropriate that the shop benefiting from a strategic position at the foot of the bridge is contributing to safeguarding the heritage of the city that brings it so many customers."" 12 alternative Italian destinations . Private donation scandals . The marriage of corporate donors and restoration projects isn't always so warm. In 2011, the UK-based Art Newspaper reported that the Church of Santa Maria di Portosalvo in Naples signed a contract in 2009 with restoration firm Grandi Progetti that allowed the firm to sell advertising space on its scaffolding in exchange for free restoration work. While Grandi Progetti profited with €3 million ($3.8 million) in advertising revenue, none of the contracted restoration work was done. The article cited similar cases in at least 22 other Italian cities. There are, of course, alternative sources of funding. According to the Italian State Tourism Board, some restoration projects are funded by the Italian National Lottery. Private charitable trusts such as Venice in Peril have raised funds in partnership with restaurant chain Pizza Express to support restoration projects. For now, however, cash infusions from big brands, with commercial images strongly tied to their Italian roots, seem to be just the prescription for the problems ailing various monuments. Especially with traditional entities of public maintenance lacking the necessary resources. ""The city administration is being remarkably inefficient in managing Venice and should not be allowed to become too reliant on the private sector to mop up the mess of its own messy housekeeping,"" says activist da Mosto. For now, though, most locals seem happy that at least someone is around to clean up the mess, even if it means identifying history with commercial promotion.","Tod's, Fendi and Diesel all pledge big bucks to restore Italy's top tourist spots .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Japan's main trading index, the Tokyo Nikkei, plunged more than 7% Thursday, ending a red-hot rally that saw the bourse climb nearly 50% since the start of the year. Investors reacted to negative news from the United States and China. U.S. Fed Chair Ben Bernanke left an open question on whether quantitative easing would end earlier than hoped, while new China data revealed factory activity fell the first time in seven months. Though questions loom over the world's first and second largest economies, analysts and economists agree that for Japan, the world's third largest, things are just fine -- despite this week's stock slump. The fact that investors pulled out is ""a sign of health rather than a sign of worry,"" said Jesper Koll, Director of Japan Equity Research at JPMorgan in Tokyo. ""When markets go one way then it's time to be concerned. The (Nikkei) has been up basically 70% over the last seven months."" In the history of global stock markets, such a major rally is very rare, added Koll. Since World War II, similar events have happened less than eight times. A correction was due. ""This looks like the selloff that so many on the sidelines have been waiting for,"" said Nicholas Smith, CLSA's Japan Strategist in Tokyo. ""The Topix was undoubtedly overbought."" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's fiscal policies for growth and inflation -- known to many now as Abenomics -- are not to blame so much as financial quakes and questions from the world's other major economies. In support of Abenomics, the Bank of Japan this past Wednesday affirmed its own policies to buy long-term debt and securities. The move would double the central bank's monetary base over two years. ""Such conduct of monetary policy will support the positive movements in economic activity and financial markets, contribute to a rise in inflation expectations, and lead Japan's economy to overcome deflation that has lasted for nearly 15 years,"" the bank said in its policy statement. During those years of deflation and up through Abe's election to the premiership in December 2012, Japan had a fiscal policy of ""musaku"" or ""no policy"" -- ""all talk but no action,"" explained JPMorgan's Koll. Now ""the most import thing is that Japan does have a policy. With Abe there is action. That's what has been making investors confident."" Signs of proof can be found in the return to profit of some of Japan's exporters, in part due to the yen's weakening against the U.S. dollar past the 100-yen mark. Toyota, the world's biggest automaker, reported net income of $9.7 billion in the fiscal year that ended March 31 -- more than triple its earnings from the year prior. Panasonic forecasts a net income of nearly $500 million in the 2014 fiscal year, versus a net loss of some $7 billion in 2013. ""We think they (corporate profits) are going to rise by about 50% over the next twelve months,"" said Koll, who also forecasts Japan's Topix -- considered more representative of Japan's stock markets -- will climb to 1,400 by the end of 2013 -- a rise of nearly 17%.","Koll: Tokyo Nikkei 7% plunge Thursday more 'sign of health' than 'sign of worry'

"(CNN) -- ""For the workers at Ford and their families absorbing this difficult news today, we will make sure that you are not left behind."" So tweeted the Australian premier Julia Gillard, as Ford Australia, the local subsidiary of the U.S. giant, this week confirmed the worst kept secret in Australian manufacturing. More than 1,000 workers will lose their jobs when Ford closes two production facilities in the state of Victoria by October 2016. The decision came after Ford Australia declared a A$141 million [$135.4 million] tax loss for the year 2012/13. The company has lost around A$600 million [$575 million] over the last five years, making it unviable, it says, to continue producing cars in Australia. The decision is a blow not only to those who will lose their jobs. It's also bad news for the ruling Labor government, about to face an election it's tipped to lose. It also comes amid concerns that while Australia's mining boom appears to have peaked, the country's manufacturing base is in decline. Ford Australia president and chief executive Bob Graziano said the company had failed to ""make the numbers work"" when it modeled a number of different scenarios in an attempt to maintain its Australian production base. A small and fragmented Australian market and uncompetitive cost structures are to blame, according to Graziano. ""There's been a significant change in terms of the total number of vehicles sold in the large car segment,"" he told a media conference. He added ""costs are double that of Europe and nearly four times Ford in Asia."" The news, which will also impact the vehicle manufacturing supply chain across the country, comes despite attempts by the Australian government to prop up the industry. In the past decade the Australian government has given the auto industry A$12 billion [$11.5 billion] in subsidies -- with Ford itself the beneficiary of A$2.5 billion of those subsidies. But the automaker's decision to close manufacturing completely by 2016 is likely to add to the growing concerns that Australia is too reliant on its mining industry and resource exports to China in particular, whilst its manufacturing base has been in steady decline over more than four decades. In the 1960s, manufacturing accounted for close to 30% of GDP. In 2012, it accounted 7.2%. The Australian Industry Group, an employers organization, said manufacturers were doing it tough in a ""high cost economy"" while opposition leader Tony Abbott lamented a ""black day for manufacturing in Australia."" But respected commentator Bernard Keane said the news was long overdue and unrepresentative of the state of Australian manufacturing. ""These aren't the numbers of a company suffering increased competition from a stronger currency, but a company that can't convince consumers to buy its flagship product any more, a company that has lost touch with consumers, as so often happens with protected industries,"" he wrote in news outlet Crikey. ""Nor is the closure representative of Australian manufacturing. For all the stories about high-profile manufacturers struggling, in the year to February the total manufacturing workforce fell by just 3,000, or a third of 1%, to 954,000 in trend terms -- the lowest fall in years."" But manufacturing, once Australia's largest employer, has seen its share of total employment eclipsed by the health, retail and construction sectors. Contrary to popular belief, the mining industry upon which Australia remains reliant is not the countries biggest employer, according to analysis published on Crikey. George Megalogenis, economic commentator and author of ""The Australian Moment,"" a book that tracks Australia's economic development said ""all first world economies have roughly similar stories to tell on manufacturing. ""Manufacturing was the single biggest employer through till the 90s in some countries. But its share of employment and of GDP is declining. And it's quite a smooth line, which started in the 60s,"" he told CNN. ""But now we are at that point where societies are starting to ask themselves whether they let the trend continue to the point where they actually lose the know-how to make things."" He added: ""China will see the same decline in 20 or 30 years time. They will replicate first world trends but with a lag."" Though it employs fewer Australians, and despite the boom appearing to have peaked, Australia's mining industry remains the headline act. Profitable, it provides a significant percentage of company tax revenue to government, even if the tax on super profits imposed by the Gillard government has been a disappointment; the government's projections of a A$2 billion windfall delivered only A$127 million because the tax is structured to allow the miners to offset the value of their mines against the tax. Former finance minister Lindsay Tanner has warned in the past that Australia needs to reduce its reliance on mining and focus its efforts on other export industries. ""Minerals are always going to be critical for Australia. There's no question about that,"" he told ABC radio. However, the diversification of Australian exports had stagnated in the 90s, with growth in tourism, education and specialized manufacturing moving into reverse, he said. ""So it's not so much that there's one country that we're dependent on. It's that we have I think to some extent too many eggs in that basket,"" said Tanner. For Megalogenis, Australia's economic reliance on mining would be more acceptable if it had the future firmly in sight. ""When mining crowds everything out and the economy makes room for that, to service China, knowing that it's a highly volatile global cycle, it becomes a question of what Australia does with the spoils,"" he told CNN. ""Because there will be a bust,"" he added. Megalogenis says historically, Australia has wisely invested the spoils. ""We built Melbourne out of the gold boom,"" he said. ""But we haven't really taken the cash from this mining boom and reinvested it in expanding the capacity of the rest of the economy."" The Gillard government has anticipated a second mining boom, he says, and allocated spending in anticipation. ""But the second chance has been denied us by Europe and the global financial crisis. We had a second crisis and Europe is still in recession. "" Even so, though mining profits are down because of lower commodity prices, profit margins remain high. According to the Minerals Council of Australia, last year the industry paid in excess of $20 billion in company tax and royalties combined -- a four-fold increase on the $4 billion to $5 billion paid at the start of the boom. What future exists for manufacturing in Australia when the countries finite resources are depleted is a question that no doubt will have to wait until after the September 14 poll.","More than 1,000 workers will lose their jobs when Ford closes two production facilities .

"(CNN) -- A day after a jury deadlocked on whether Jodi Arias should be sentenced to death for the murder of her ex-boyfriend, the jury foreman described the decision process as tense and emotional. ""It was a gut-wrenching thing we had to go through, and everybody had to make their own decision,"" William Zervakos told ABC's ""Good Morning America."" The foreman said some of the most difficult testimony to hear came from the dead man's relatives. ""Until you're face to face with people that have gone through something like that, it's something that you really can't put into words,"" he said. ""I'm 6 feet away from somebody talking about a horrendous loss, and if you can't feel that, then you have no emotion, no soul. And yet we couldn't allow ourselves to be emotional on the stand. ""We couldn't allow ourselves to show emotion, although I'm sure some came through, and I'm very, very proud of my peers and my jurors that were with us because they did a fantastic job of holding it together."" That stoicism in the face of emotional testimony disappeared in the jury room, he said. Zervakos said the 32-year-old defendant simply did not fit his image of a murderer. ""When you look at a young woman and you think of the crime, and then you see the brutality of the crime, it just doesn't wash,"" he said. ""It's very difficult to divest yourself from the personal, from the emotional part of it."" Though the jury did not believe Arias' story that she killed Travis Alexander in self-defense, Zervakos said he believed Alexander abused her. ""I'm very sure, in my own mind, that she was mentally and verbally abused,"" he said. ""Now, is that an excuse? Of course not. Does it factor into decisions we make? It has to."" Zervakos said Arias' 18 days on the stand hurt her case. ""She was not a good witness,"" he said. ""There were so many contradicting stories."" But he expressed sympathy for her ability to endure her time on the stand. ""I think the way the prosecutor was with her -- he's known for an aggressive style -- I think it was very hard, I think it would be difficult for anybody."" A retrial for the penalty phase will begin on July 18, Judge Sherry Stephens said. Jurors had deliberated since Tuesday on whether Arias should get a death sentence for the 2008 murder. A source with knowledge of the jury's vote said there was an 8-4 split in favor of sentencing Arias to death. Jurors refused to talk to reporters and immediately left the courtroom. The hung jury brought to a close a chapter in the high-profile case, which has lasted for months. But the trial isn't over. In many states, the death penalty would be off the table if the jury couldn't agree. Not Arizona. In a written statement, Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery said prosecutors ""will proceed with the intent to retry the penalty phase."" ""We appreciate the jury's work in the guilt and aggravation phases of the trial, and now we will assess, based upon available information, what the next steps will be,"" he said. Emotions ran high in the courtroom as the jury's deadlock was announced. Arias appeared to be on the verge of tears. One of Alexander's sisters sobbed. Even the voice of the normally stoic judge cracked as she dismissed jurors. ""Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the participants in this trial, I wish to thank you for your extraordinary service to this community,"" she told them. ""This was not your typical trial. You were asked to perform very difficult responsibilities."" As the jury filed out of the courtroom, one juror said, ""I'm sorry"" to Alexander's family. Jurors had deliberated for more than 13 hours in the penalty phase of the trial when they told the court they wouldn't be able to agree on a verdict. On May 8, the same jurors decided in 15 hours that Arias was ""exceptionally cruel"" when she stabbed Alexander 29 times, slit his neck from ear to ear and shot him in the face. They pronounced her guilty of first-degree murder. For Arias to be sentenced to death, a jury's decision must be unanimous. If Arias is sentenced to death, she would be the fourth woman on death row in Arizona. On Tuesday, she pleaded with jurors to spare her. She called Alexander's murder ""the worst mistake"" she had ever made, ""the worst thing I've ever done."" She couldn't have imagined herself capable of such a grisly crime, Arias told the jury. ""But I know that I was,"" she said. ""And for that I'm going to be sorry for the rest of my life -- probably longer."" Arias was living in Yreka, California, when she met Alexander at a business convention in Las Vegas in September 2006. That November, he baptized Arias into the Mormon faith, a ceremony Arias said was followed by anal sex. Arias became his girlfriend two months later, she testified. They broke up in the summer of 2007, and Alexander began dating other women. In June 2008, Alexander missed two appointments, prompting friends to go to his house. They found his naked body crammed in a stand-up shower. He had been stabbed 29 times in the back and torso and shot in the head. His throat was slit. After her arrest, Arias told an elaborate lie about masked intruders breaking into Alexander's house and killing him before she narrowly escaped. Relatives who spoke with police described her as mentally unstable. The trial, which started in January, has been rife with talk of sex, lies and digital images -- among them graphic autopsy photos.

"(CNN) -- A valuable necklace was stolen from a party at the Cannes Film Festival, the second major jewelry theft at the event this year, police said Thursday. Jeweler de Grisogono said the necklace, which was part of a collection making its debut, was worth 2 million euros ($2.6 million). The company said it was the first theft in the company's 20-year history. Police in Nice, France, confirmed the heist but said the necklace was only worth 1 million euros ($1.3 million U.S.). Police in Cap d'Antibes, the posh resort town where the party was held, gave a third figure -- $1 million (773,000 euros). The de Grisogono statement said it had hired more than 80 security guards for the event at the Cap Eden Roc hotel in Cap d'Antibes, just east of Cannes. On Friday, police in Nice said that more than $1 million in jewels belonging to the Swiss firm Chopard had been stolen from a hotel room in Cannes. Chopard later said in a statement that the value of the stolen pieces was ""far lower than those in the figures circulating in the media."" The theft of the jewels occurred May 16, on the second day of the festival, which runs through May 26. Commandant Bernard Mascarelli of the Nice police said the jewelry was stolen from a room in the Suite Novotel hotel on Boulevard Carnot in Cannes. A Chopard employee who was staying in the room left it for several hours to go to dinner, he said. She returned to discover the whole safe containing the jewels had been unscrewed and taken away. No detailed description of the stolen jewels has been given, but a Chopard spokeswoman said they were not part of the firm's ""Red Carpet Collection 2013"" and were not due to be worn by any actresses in Cannes. There was no immediate indication the two thefts were connected. The annual festival brings together the rich and famous from around the world for movie screenings and glittering parties.

"Okolona, Mississippi (CNN) -- For more than three months, Linda Smith has wondered how the man who police say was driving drunk and involved in a crash last year that killed her daughter could be pardoned for a previous felony drunken driving offense. Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour has said he didn't know that retired IRS investigator Harry Bostick had been arrested for a DUI months after the state's parole board recommended that Barbour grant him a full pardon. (Police have determined that while Bostick was driving under the influence, he was not at fault for the accident) But e-mails recently obtained by CNN show that Barbour's office was aware of Bostick's October DUI arrest months before Barbour pardoned him along with more than 200 other convicted felons during his last days in office in January. ""They knew it, and they didn't stop it,"" said Smith, referring to the pardon. ""Why didn't they do something?"" Smith spoke to CNN, overcome with emotion after reading the e-mails obtained through a public records request from Mississippi's Department of Archives and History. The e-mails show that Amanda Jones, the governor's chief counsel, and Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann were told about the October car crash that killed Linda Smith's 18-year-old daughter, Charity Smith, just days after it happened. Read the e-mails (PDF) Jones and Hosemann were even urged by a lawyer in the firm that represented Bostick not to issue the pardon, according to the e-mails. It is not known whether anyone communicated this information to Barbour. His spokeswoman would not comment on the e-mails, citing an ongoing case on executive pardon power that is before the state Supreme Court. Barbour granted Bostick a full pardon in January for a felony drunken driving offense in March 2009. It was Bostick's third drunken driving arrest in a little more than year. The full pardon gave Bostick back the rights that were taken away as a felon, such as voting, but his two other DUI convictions remain on his record, according to the state attorney's office in Lafayette County. Bostick was still going through a court-mandated drug rehab program when he applied for a pardon last summer. On September 30, the Mississippi Parole Board sent its review of Bostick's application to Barbour, recommending a full pardon in a 3-2 vote. A week later, on October 7, Bostick was driving under the influence again, according to the Mississippi Highway Patrol. Charity Smith attempted to pull out onto a highway just outside Tupelo when Bostick's truck slammed into the side of her car. Charity Smith was killed, and her older sister suffered serious injuries. Bostick was jailed for violating his probation from his previous DUI cases. When he received the pardon in January, the convicted DUI felon still sat in an Oxford, Mississippi, jail cell, awaiting formal charges for his fourth drunken driving arrest. A police investigation found that Bostick was under the influence of alcohol while driving but has determined that he was not at fault for the accident, according to the Mississippi Highway Patrol. Bostick has not been charged, and his case is expected to go before a grand jury, according to the state attorney's office. If he is charged and convicted for the DUI offense, he will avoid the possibility of a stiffer sentence because it will be treated as his third DUI offense, instead of his fourth. However, he could go back to being a felon, and losing the rights restored to him under the pardon, with a third conviction. Neither Bostick nor his lawyers have returned calls from CNN seeking comment. Bostick's case offers a close look into the pardon process and the friendships and ties that often intersect with the political world. High-profile friends of the former federal investigator's, including lawyers and former U.S. attorneys, wrote letters to Barbour touting what they called Bostick's genuine lifestyle change. The letters detail what friends described as Bostick's slide into alcoholism after the tragic death of his teenage son in a ""freakish house fire"" and his subsequent divorce, according to pardon and parole documents obtained by CNN. ""Harry Bostick has led a tragic life. A life that has now been turned around by a grace that is bigger than him,"" wrote retired U.S. Attorney Jim Greenlee. ""He can now be a positive factor in many lives."" Another former federal prosecutor, Bob Whitwell, who is married to the sister of Greenlee's wife, also tried to help Bostick get his pardon. ""Bostick is a friend. He was a very good agent and worked a lot of drug cases and money laundering cases for me,"" Whitwell told CNN. ""He was an outstanding officer. I knew him as a friend."" Whitwell, an attorney in the firm that has represented Bostick in his DUI cases, said he called Hosemann, his old law school friend, to help with the pardon, even though the secretary of state's office has no official authority to issue pardons. After the October crash that killed Charity Smith, Whitwell reached out to Hosemann in an October 11 e-mail, asking him to back off on the pardon. ""You asked me if he was straight and I gave you my word yes. For this I give you my sincere apology. I had no idea he had messed up. Therefore. Hold up on helping him. All of us are in shock. Sorry,"" Whitwell wrote. He signed the letter, ""Your friend bob."" Hosemann forwarded this e-mail to Barbour's chief counsel, Amanda Jones. Her e-mail reply: ""ok will do."" It's not known whether Jones spoke to Barbour about this before he issued Bostick's pardon. She did not return calls seeking comment. A spokeswoman for Hosemann said he never discussed the matter directly with Barbour. Jones no longer works in the governor's office and is currently employed by the Mississippi law firm Butler Snow, the same firm that employs the former governor. Whitwell said the October e-mail was the last communication he had about Bostick's pardon. ""I told Delbert that I wanted him to pull back that pardon. It must not have gotten to the governor if he got pardoned,"" he said. Barbour has repeatedly said that as a Christian, he believes in forgiveness and second chances. Wearing a pendant with her daughter's image emblazoned on it, Linda Smith said she sees the whole affair as the good ol' boy network at its worst. ""All I think about is my child every day, but I do know that certain people had to know, and they didn't do anything,"" she said with tears in her eyes. ""Haley Barbour had to have known. It's their job to tell him, so he had to have known,"" she said. ""How do you do that?"" Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

"(CNN) -- European football's governing body UEFA says it will continue to monitor security ahead of Saturday's Champions League final in London. The British government held an emergency meeting on Thursday following the daylight murder of a British soldier in the capital the previous day. Owned by the English Football Association, Wembley is hosting the final of the prestigious European club competition for the second time in two years, but on match day it is UEFA which assumes responsibility for the stadium in north London. UEFA said it was ""confident"" that the all-German final between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund would not be affected by wider events in London. ""We obviously have a lot of security measures in place,"" a UEFA spokeswoman told CNN. ""We are confident they will guarantee there is a positive atmosphere in the city as well as inside the stadium. ""As for each final we contact the [local] police and security is in their hands. We will of course be monitoring the situation. ""Each time we hold a final we discuss various security matters [with the venues] where we discuss the number of stewards, security and police officers required."" London's Metropolitan Police Service has not changed the ""threat level"" for the final since the murder, though the police will continue to keep their plans under constant review. ""In light of events in Woolwich we have looked at our policing plan for the Champions League final,"" said Chief Superintendent Julia Pendry, who is heading up the policing operation for the final, said in a statement. ""We would like to reassure travelling fans and visitors to London that there is nothing at this stage to suggest any threat to this event and an appropriate policing response will be in place to ensure the safety and security of those who attend the event. ""We are working closely with British Transport Police and our other emergency service partners and as always our plans are flexible and kept under continuous review."" Firearms officers are used as a response service by the Metropolitan Police Service and would not routinely be on patrol at events such as Champions League finals. Security in London has come under renewed focus after a British soldier was brutally killed close to barracks in Woolwich, south London on Wednesday. There has been increased security at army bases around London amid fears of additional attacks, but Prime Minister David Cameron urged people to ""go about their normal lives."" Borussia Dortmund has not changed its advice to fans traveling to London ahead of Saturday's match. The club has sold all of its allocation of 25,000 tickets for the London final after 500,000 had applied for tickets, though Dortmund did not know how many fans were planning to travel to the UK without a ticket for the match. Bayern Munich was not immediately available for comment. The capacity of Wembley Stadium for the match will be 86,000, with each team receiving 25,000 seats with 9,000 going on sale to fans around the world. Wembley will be open to fans from 1630 (BST) ahead of the Champions League finale.","UEFA to monitor security for Saturday's Champions League final .

"(CNN) -- When a man with hands drenched in blood stands just feet away from the body of a person he just hacked to death, still holding the murder weapons, we want to believe he must be crazy. How else can our minds grasp the evidence that someone would carry out an act of such inconceivable brutality? We don't yet know all the details surrounding Wednesday's killing in London. But the fact is we have seen this type of attack before, and even before one of the suspects started ranting to passers-by, we had a pretty good idea what to expect. This killing of a young British soldier was not an act of insanity. It was part of a pattern that has struck in many parts of the world before. This was the product of extreme Islamist radicalism we have all come to recognize. Some will rush to blame Muslims or Islam for what happened, but it's important to be clear and not to mince words. Islam is not the enemy. Muslims are not the enemy. Terrorism is not the enemy. The enemy is the radical Islamist ideology that justifies any atrocity committed for political motives. The enemies are the people who promote this dogma and encourage others to engage in actions that offend and assault our humanity -- and theirs. As information started trickling in from London, the familiar phrases started emerging, confirming our initial suspicions and no doubt disheartening Muslims who would like to see their religion stop having any association with these atrocities. Witnesses said they heard the two men shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" as they worked to dismember their victim. They say one of them breathlessly declared ""By almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone."" A similar attack happened a few years ago in Amsterdam. The Dutch filmmaker and columnist Theo van Gogh was assassinated and nearly decapitated by a Muslim radical angered by van Gogh's work criticizing Islam. The London murderers apparently justified their butchery as resentment over Western troops fighting in Muslim lands. ""Muslims are dying daily,"" the man with the bloody hands said. But before accepting that argument at face value, consider that radical Islamists have found other reasons to slaughter those who offend them. And the threshold for triggering brutality seems rather movable. The Islamist radical who murdered van Gogh, Mohammed Bouyeri, used a knife to pin a letter to his victim's body, explaining his actions and threatening to kill Ayaan Hirsi Ali, an ex-Muslim and friend of the director, who remains a fierce critic of Islam. The letter is a screed against Jews and an attempt to intimidate anyone who speaks critically of Islam. Islamist radicalism provided the twisted justification for the Boston Marathon bombings, for the videotaped decapitation of journalist Daniel Pearl, for the shooting rampage of Maj. Nidal Hassan, who killed 13 people in Fort Hood, Texas. And let's not forget 9/11, the crown jewel of murderous achievements. Their political/religious ideology has motivated killers in Madrid, London, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, as well as Syria, Nigeria, Indonesia and Iraq. The creed that demands murder, sometimes murder-suicide, for perceived offenses against Islam and against Muslims constitutes a threat to societies at large, not just to Westerners and non-Muslims. In fact, a study finds that Muslims are its most numerous victims. While police were still working the crime scene in London, British Prime Minister David Cameron said the attack was probably an act of terrorism. The question of whether this particular incident falls under the label of terrorism is not particularly useful. We will hear discussions about whether the perpetrators belonged to a larger organization or were, instead, ""lone wolves"" or ""self-radicalized."" In the end, the purpose was political intimidation, and inciting fear was its political objective. For what it's worth, that's terrorism. But that does not identify the enemy that must be fought. The killing in broad daylight in London's Woolwich neighborhood belongs in the category of Islamist radical attacks, the same that brought 9/11, the Boko Haram massacres in Nigeria, restaurant bombings in Tel Aviv, night club killings in Bali, street explosions in Baghdad, hotel bombings in Amman and many other massacres in many countries. Each incident has its own peculiarities, its own list of grievances. But they all contain the same explosive ideology. Most Muslims strongly oppose this kind of brutality. But a recent Pew poll showed significant minorities favor actions such as suicide bombings ""in defense of Islam."" A troubling 29% of Egyptian Muslims say suicide bombings can be justified, so do 40% of Muslims in the Palestinian Territories, 15% in Jordan and 18% in Malaysia. The ""defense of Islam"" means different things to different people. Extremists have killed to defend Islam from modern westernized culture. They have killed women for daring to go to school. The victims often have nothing to do with the alleged offense. The Tsarnaev brothers' victims in Boston had nothing to do with the offenses that angered their killers. An important element in the fight against this pernicious, callous enemy is a campaign to undermine the ideology's appeal within Muslim communities everywhere. There is much work to do, particularly by the vast majority of Muslims who reject extremism, by their leaders who must be pressured by all of us to make the ironclad case that nothing, nothing in the world, justifies the kind of viciousness that assaulted our senses in London and has done so in too many places for too many years.

"(CNN) -- In the battle against cancer, one video game is taking the deadly disease head-on. And some young patients are the winners. ""Re-Mission 2"" is a collection of online minigames designed to get teen and young-adult cancer patients involved in understanding more about their conditions and how the body benefits from sometimes unpleasant treatments. Researchers at HopeLab, a nonprofit organization searching for products that positively impact health behavior, were emboldened by the success of their original 2006 title, ""Re-Mission,"" and were looking for a better way to help patients. ""Research on the original 'Re-Mission' showed that it impacted biology and behavior, primarily by energizing positive motivation circuits in the human brain and giving players a sense of power and control over cancer,"" said Dr. Steve Cole, a vice president at HopeLab and professor of medicine at UCLA. ""That gave us a whole new recipe for engineering the games in 'Re-Mission 2' by harnessing the power of positive motivation circuits in the human brain."" The Flash-based games in ""Re-Mission 2"" mimic what the patients are going through in their therapy, but in a way that gamifies the treatment and involves the patient in ""destroying"" their cancer. Weapons in the game include chemotherapy, cancer drugs and cells in the body's own immune system. A 2008 study into the effectiveness of the ""ReMission"" idea found that, for patients from 13 to 29, sticking to a treatment regimen when managing chronic illness was a significant problem. Playing the game greatly improved treatment adherence and understanding of that treatment in that age group, according to the study. ""(Cancer) can be incredibly disruptive and rips you away from your identity of being a normal kid,"" said HopeLab spokesman Richard Tate. ""The games give them the experience of what it means to be inside the body fighting cancer, using these prescriptions as weapons in their arsenal and the fight to regain a sense of control with your life."" Many game developers lent their talents to the project. But developers also got some inside help. Former cancer patients worked with the design teams to help create the right mood, challenges and visual design for ""ReMission's"" five games. Brooke Jaffe, a 21-year-old English major at Barnard College in New York, and Justin Lambert, a 20-year-old nursing major at Concordia University in Portland, Oregon, are two cancer patients in remission who helped with the project. Both worked on concept art, images and play testing. But both said that the most important aspect of the game, to them, was how it would make a patient undergoing cancer treatment feel. ""Other than feeling like crap all the time, you don't see the results,"" said Lambert, who was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia at 2. ""You don't see the impact that's brought to the body fighting the cancer. (The game) puts it into perspective -- something they can visualize and definitely get hope from that."" Jaffe was diagnosed with papillary carcinoma in 2011 and said the cancer experience can make young people feel powerless -- like their recovery is based on passively allowing doctors and others to do their work. ""You actually don't feel like you're doing that much because it's all these outside forces acting upon you,"" she said. ""I think what's really beneficial about a game like 'Re-Mission 2' is the whole concept of using games to help people get a sense of activity in a situation that can rob you of that activity. ""I think that's a very powerful thing even on a psychological level."" Dr. Brandon Hayes-Lattin, a cancer and blood disorders specialist at the Oregon Health & Science University, has been involved in a field of cancer care called adolescent and young adult oncology. He and his colleagues have been working on understanding why patients in that age group don't show improvement in cancer-care rates on par with young kids or older adult patients. ""Across the board, no matter what the age, it is difficult to adhere to a common cancer schedule,"" he said. ""The number of medications, the tracking of medications can be difficult. ""You can really engage young adults through a video game as long as the video game is cool. There is also this underlying theme of empowering patients to understand what they are going through and what their own role is in their cancer care."" With ""Re-Mission 2,"" he said, the mobile aspect of the minigames allow patients to be involved even while they are waiting for, or receiving, treatment. The free minigames are available for the iPad or online. Tate said teams are working to expand the number of platforms to get the game into as many hands as possible.","""Re-Mission 2"" is a video game designed for young cancer patients .

"(CNN) -- A magnitude 8.2 earthquake struck the Russian Far East on Friday, the U.S. Geologicial Survey reported. The epicenter for the extremely powerful quake was located in the Sea of Okhotsk, just to the west of the Kamchatka Peninsula, and about 600 kilometers (nearly 375 miles) underground. The quake was felt for five minutes in the region, Russia's Ria Novosti news agency reported. Many people ran into the streets as the temblor shook. No tsunami warnings were issued in the quake's immediate aftermath. The region is located along the Pacific ""ring of fire,"" an area of high seismic and volcanic activity stretching from New Zealand in the South Pacific up through Japan, across to Alaska and down the west coasts of North and South America.

"(CNN) -- Beth Bartley clutched anything within reach to steady herself on the bathroom floor of her shuddering Manhattan apartment. Sandy had knocked out power. East 96th Street below was a river. She was on the fifth floor, bracing herself as the building shuddered and creaked. ""The winds were so strong that the building heaved. It was eerie,"" said Bartley, an actress. ""It was really scary."" Monday night, Superstorm Sandy descended on the Northeast with a fury that astonished even veteran weather watchers. Buildings crumbled, floods and fires have destroyed homes and millions are without power. Ice and rain whipped off Sandy's edge, blanketing West Virginia with several feet of snow. Bartley was safe after riding out the storm but that was more than could be said for her neighbors miles west of upper Manhattan in Bergen County, New Jersey. Hundreds of people were rescued after they were stranded on the roofs of their homes floating in a tidal surge. A natural berm had broken. In New Jersey alone, millions of households had no electricity, twice the number left in the dark during Hurricane Irene last year, Gov. Chris Christie said. Sandy brings death, flooding, outages . Flooding was a huge problem everywhere. New York City's subway tunnels were soaked as water coursed into elevator shafts. The storm sparked fires that destroyed dozens of homes, left a giant crane wobbling dangerously near a luxury apartment building in Manhattan, ripped up part of Atlantic City's fabled boardwalk and turned the historic Jane's Carousel into an island. It claimed life after life. Millions left in the dark . ""This is a nor'easter on steroids,"" said Reed Timmer, a meteorologist who appears on the TV show ""Storm Chasers."" Even though New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie bluntly asked residents not to be ""stupid"" and get out, Trevor Mann was one of the few in his area of Ocean City who did not heed the evacuation calls. He watched as the eye of storm passed over his coastal city Monday evening, and floodwater rushed in like a relentless linebacker. The wind threw patio furniture into homes. Rushing waters made beach houses disappear. The destruction was breathtaking. ""I am not going outside,"" Mann said. ""But when people do go outside, the cleanup is going to be tremendous and there is going to be a lot of damage."" In the dead quiet of the night, lights out in his home in Union City, New Jersey, Shane Didier heard a thunderous crash. A huge generator on the street had exploded, sending a fireball into the sky worthy of a Bruce Willis movie. The 25-year-old Barclays analyst had the wherewithal to start filming. ""I ran outside and live wires were whipping like crazy,"" he told CNN. ""Two cars caught fire. The police, they got there right away, but everybody was really scared. Thank goodness trees were down in the street so even if someone felt compelled to walk toward this thing, the trees were in everyone's way."" The smoke was overwhelming. Didier didn't know what else to do but go back inside. Please let this end, he thought. By dawn Tuesday, he said the stench of burned rubber filled his neighborhood. ""It's amazing we're all alright,"" he said. ""My neighbor is thrilled that his kids are OK. We made it through."" Sandy's impact: State by state . Shahir Daud was watching the lights go out in his Upper East Side New York neighborhood Monday evening, hoping that his place would not be next. He saw manhole covers blown out of the street and wondered if there was a fire nearby. He watched as dark waters from the East River submerged parts of Franklin D. Roosevelt East River Drive. By late Monday evening, it seemed the worst of the storm had passed his neighborhood. The 33-year-old filmmaker wondered when he would be able to get back to his job at MTV. ""I work in lower Manhattan, I don't know when the (trains) are going to run again,"" Daud said. ""We are just going to hunker down here. We are lucky."" Earl Bateman, a stockbroker who has lived in New York for 30 years, was stunned seeing so much water coursing through New York City. Transit systems struggling to restart . ""There's this river flowing through the middle of Manhattan,"" he said. The power was still on in his building, but the elevators had stopped working. Not a good thing for a man who lives on the 18th floor. Unlike Bateman, more than 7 million people in 13 states spent a chilly Monday night in the dark. In southern Vermont, Caleb Clark said he felt the howling winds, and watched as rain battered his town. It was his son Shaw's 6-month birthday, and the family spent it listening to weather reports about downed trees and closed roads. ""Shaw, what do you think about this storm?"" the father asked. ""Ba ba baaa,"" the baby said and then burst into a wide, toothless smile. Little Shaw may have been one of the few smiling as Sandy continued to affect millions.

"Beijing (CNN) -- When China's new leader Xi Jinping spoke to the media last week, one sound bite struck me as especially noteworthy. The Chinese people love life, he said, and they wish for better education, more stable jobs, better medical care -- in short, ""more comfortable living conditions and a more beautiful environment."" This, he said, is the goal that China must strive for, one that is surely shared by many Chinese. To achieve that, however, China needs to square the circle: to grow fast while mitigating the degradation of its environment and ecology, especially its air and water. Read more: Protest stops China sewage pipeline project . China, for one, has a drinking problem. I discussed this topic with a group of experts in a Fortune magazine forum recently held in Beijing. China's water crisis looks grim, the panelists agreed. The United Nations says China is one of 13 countries with extreme water shortages. The problem is partly demographic -- it hosts 20% of the world's population yet only holds six percent of the world's water resources -- but is also exacerbated by rapid and short-sighted development. Read more: Taking a swim? App lets users check water's cleanliness first . Strong economic growth has turned the country into the world's second largest economy but at the expense of the environment. The Yangtze River, once the lifeblood of the country, now flows a foreboding blood red, possibly due to industrial pollution, experts said. Chronic droughts plague important agricultural regions like Shandong province, which produces most of China's grain. For Guo Peiyuan, general manager at SynTao, a Beijing-based corporate sustainability consulting firm, the problem is close and personal. ""I was born in a farmer's family in southern China, and there are a lot of rivers there,"" he recalled. ""When I was a child we could swim in the river. But as I grew up in the 1990s, a lot of factories came in. One summer vacation I went to my hometown, and my mother told me that the local farmers would not use the water for the crops because water was polluted, and the vegetables would die."" Read more: River in China turns red . Stories like Guo's are common. Citizens lodge not-in-my-background public protests amid fears of industrial pollution. In October, for instance, thousands of residents protested in Ningbo, a thriving coastal city, and forced local officials to shelve plans to expand a chemical plant. Such successes are still rare, and experts worry the water crisis is going to worsen in years. China's water demand will reach 818 billion cubic meters, experts say, and yet there's only 616 billion cubic meters available. Beijing has about 100 cubic meters of water available per person, well below the U.N. standard of 1,000 cubic meters per person, a threshold used to measure chronic water shortage. Read more: ConocoPhillips to pay $191 million more to China over oil spill . Debra Tan, a specialist at China Water Risk, a Hong Kong-based non-profit group, suggested a way to visualize the crisis. Imagine, she said, that China has 25 bathtubs of water per person. The U.S. will have the equivalent of 125 bathtubs. Polluted water is both deadly and costly. China now has around 300 million people with no access to potable water, resulting in some 66,000 deaths per year, according to the World Bank. It estimates the cost of water pollution to China at $22 billion, roughly 1.1 percent of the country's GDP. The Chinese government recognizes the problem and is seeking to cut water consumption by 30%. Read more: Experts detail 5 challenges for China . But that target, experts said, is hard to reach. ""Because of population growth, because of distribution of populations, there's even greater demand. There's an expected increase of up to 10% demand in the agricultural spaces in northern China. This increase is going to put ever increasing stress on those already stressed water systems,"" said Matthew Durnin, director of science programs in Asia for The Nature Conservancy. Read more: Why booming China needs to learn the three R's . China's rapacious water consumption is in part boosted by an illogical scenario: water, while scarce, is unusually cheap. ""In China, water really should be three to five times more expensive,"" said Tan of China Water Risk. One way to reduce consumption, she said, will be to keep raising water prices, a step China has been taking since 2009. Tan believes the solution lies in targeting industry and agriculture, the ""largest users and polluters."" They use about 85% of the water in China, she said, and should face higher disincentives and harsher punishments. Ma Jun, who runs the non-profit Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs in Beijing, seeks pollution control, especially of water resources, by blacklisting notorious violators. Read more: China's famed Pearl River under denim threat . Ma, one of China's most tenacious ""green warriors,"" has made some headway but said environmental litigation is nearly impossible because enforcement of existing environmental laws is weak. ""We need to bring in more stakeholders and apply public pressure, like putting these companies on a list of polluters,"" he said. Pressure, shaming and wish to make amends, he said, is changing behavior. ""So far we have some 720 companies on our list coming to our NGOs to figure out what they did wrong and how they can fix their problems."" Read more: Red river brings cancer, Chinese villagers say . Ordinary Chinese consumers need to change consumption habits, too, experts said, just like those in developed countries.

We can't keep saying that we want everyone to rise up to the same standard because that is an unsustainable standard."" Durnin proposed a simple step for China and other countries to take: fix leaky pipes. ""There's a lot of waste in urban environments, in the transfer of water in the pipes. There's literally hundreds of millions of miles of pipe laid around the world that are leaking and wasting water. These are some simple fixes that we could do right away.""

"San Diego (CNN) -- Eulalia Barrientos spent the last four months in a detention cell in New Jersey. After being apprehended by agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement in June, the illegal immigrant was just steps away from being deported back to her native Guatemala. Then, this week, suddenly, the cell doors swung open, and the married mother of two U.S.-born children was sent home to her family. Barrientos has been granted a one-year stay of removal; after the year, she'll have to go before an immigration judge and plead her case as to why she should be given a green card and allowed to remain in the United States permanently. There's no explanation for what melted ICE. After all, this isn't a touchy-feely agency. All ICE officials will say is that this was a result of ""prosecutorial discretion."" But that doesn't explain why an agency that, for weeks, didn't return the calls of Barrientos' lawyer, Bryan Johnson, suddenly became much more accommodating. It might have something to do with the call I made this week to an ICE representative to ask about the case or the story that the Spanish-language television network NBC-Telemundo did on Barrientos or the fact that New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez took an interest in the fate of a woman who has resided in Newark for nearly 20 years or the fact that, according to Johnson, there may even be a congressional inquiry into whether Barrientos should have been taken into custody in the first place. Whatever the reason, it had probably had nothing to do with the facts of the case or the letter of the law. Barrientos didn't have either on her side. She and her husband, Jose DeLeon, came to the United States illegally in the early 1990s. In 1998, they were discovered and ordered deported, but they defied the removal order and continued living in the United States because she had just given birth to their first daughter. Several months ago, on the bad advice of another lawyer, the couple went to check on the progress of their green card application and again came to the attention of federal authorities. On June 2, ICE raided the family home and arrested Barrientos in front of her two daughters -- ages 12 and 14 -- while her husband was at work. Authorities haven't arrested the husband, because he's the only parent left at home to care for the children, who are U.S. citizens. Barrientos was slated for deportation. All that stood between her and a one-way flight to Managua was some media interest and political pressure. Oh, and a memo. The ""Morton memo"" is a June 17 in-house memorandum (PDF) from ICE Director John Morton to all field office directors, field agents and chief counsel. In the document, Morton advised the bureaucrats that they ""may"" exercise discretion and show leniency toward some illegal immigrants by weighing certain factors. They include the length of time the person has lived in the United States, whether the person was brought as a child, whether the person is pursuing an education, whether the person has a criminal record, whether the person or immediate relative served in the U.S. military, whether the person has a spouse, child or parent who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, and other circumstances. When he heard about the memo, Johnson decided to play that card. ""Two days after the Morton memo came out, I sent immigration officials at the local ICE field office a copy of it in along with a statement explaining all the factors,"" Johnson told me. ""And I asked them: 'So did you change your policy? ... So can she be released, right?' And they said: 'No, we can't do that.' "" In the past few months, I've heard from about a dozen immigration attorneys who have likewise tried to use the Morton memo to spring clients and likewise struck out. As illogical as it sounds, ICE field agents whose job it is to apprehend folks who break the rules for entering the United States seem to be themselves breaking a set of rules laid out by their supervisor. I have three theories as to what's going on here: The memorandum was written by Morton, or people above him, in a deliberately vague manner to allow local agents to skirt it and continue to rack up deportations; there is massive insubordination within ICE at the local level; or this was a political stunt intended to con Latinos into thinking the Obama administration is being more compassionate and lenient in deportations when really nothing has changed. I asked Johnson which theory he thought was at work here. All three, he said. ""I think it's a political stunt intended to fool Latinos into voting for this administration,"" Johnson said. ""The whole thing is a farce, at least at the local enforcement level."" In less than three years, the administration, eager to show that it is enforcing the immigration laws, has deported more than 1 million people. And just this week, in a speech at American University, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano bragged that her department is poised to set another record for deportations in the just-concluded 2011 fiscal year. Write this down: The Morton memo isn't worth the paper it's written on. Latinos shouldn't be fooled into thinking otherwise, and neither should anyone else. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","An illegal immigrant mother threatened with deportation was released .

"(CNN) -- President Goodluck Jonathan's response to the Boko Haram insurgency, including his recently declared state of emergency in three northern Nigerian states, is eerily reminiscent of previous approaches to sectarian violence in that region. The Maitatsine uprising of 1980 is perhaps the single most important precedent-setting example. In December 1980, the confrontation between the Al-Masifu Islamic sect -- which advocated purity in the practice of Islam -- and the people of Kano came to a head. The Nigerian army and air force mounted a campaign against the sect. In the end, more than 4,000 people were dead with double this number injured alongside massive destruction of property. Times have certainly changed. Nigeria's population has doubled since the Maitatsine uprising. Nigeria continues to experience the ""youth bulge"" -- a growing youth population -- that was not planned for. The resulting pressure on socio-economic systems is evident in limited education and health and dwindling economic opportunities for young people. Poor policies and bad planning have produced youth vulnerability and exclusion from mainstream life. This is doubly so in northern Nigeria, where class divides have further created a community of people with nothing to lose. Read this: Nigerians ask, are we at war? The global environment has also changed amid growing transnational threats. Al Qaeda continues to lurk in the neighborhood. Excluded groups in the region with affinity for Boko Haram are potential support networks amid an ever-rising flow of illicit weapons into the region. One thing has hardly changed: elite behavior. Nigeria's power elite remains far removed from the realities of life experienced by ordinary citizens. The ruling elite's framing of the Boko Haram challenge lends itself easily to just one set of responses -- the use of force to rout Boko Haram, although more recently the federal government of Nigeria proposed an amnesty for Boko Haram. To be certain, a military approach is only part of the solution. It is by no means a panacea. This military campaign, coupled with amnesty, rings hollow. It does not offer much hope for dealing comprehensively with the underlying causes of the Boko Haram phenomenon. It is no wonder Boko Haram has treated the offer of amnesty by the Jonathan-led government with disdain. For one, it may be worth holding out for a greater prize, knowing that it probably has this regime by the jugular. Besides, how could it trust that the offer of amnesty -- which will unveil Boko Haram -- is not a ploy by the regime to round them up and execute them? The allegedly extra-judicial killing of the sect's late leader, Mohammed Yusuf, serves as a constant warning. Watch this: Who are Boko Haram? Perhaps more importantly, this military solution and current state of emergency is potentially damaging for the military. The Nigerian military only recently managed to repair its image, winning accolades abroad for its peacekeeping role. Asking it to employ maximum force in internal operations -- causing casualties in the process among the very people it is meant to protect -- has repercussions. Surely, this will diminish its stature abroad and reduce citizens' confidence in the military at home, while drawing more support to Boko Haram and weakening troops' morale. That said, it is also the case that Nigerians far removed from the locus of the crisis may not see the military's role in such negative terms. This crisis will potentially deepen religious and regional cleavages. Perhaps the country's saving grace is that for the time being, Nigeria's youth population mostly buys into these divides. They do not yet have a common narrative about who their ""real enemy"" is. Barring a small number of states, where genuine effort is being made to confront serious governance deficits, the picture of elite marginalization and widening inequality is consistent countrywide. Boko Haram commands the loyalty of the excluded at several levels. At this moment, Boko Haram is obviously asserting influence, and that assertion of influence is accepted by a significant number of people who see no change in their primary condition. This factor partly attracted large crowds to the preaching of Boko Haram's late leader, Yusuf. His narratives about the ills of Western education were enriched by evident gaps in governance. The breakdown of the education system, growing youth unemployment and insecurity amid rampant corruption swelled the ranks of Boko Haram. When the sense of ""nothing to lose"" is mixed with these strong narratives, the issue is not whether or not they are true but that there are no strong counter-narratives or genuine counter actions. A lasting solution to the crisis in northern Nigeria might lie in a missing trinity: a meaningful but powerful narrative to counter Boko Haram's narrative; an action plan akin to a ""Marshal Plan"" for northern Nigeria; and isolation of what Jonathan has described as Boko Haram sympathizers in the government and security forces. Developing a powerful counter narrative will demand a measure of sincerity and consistency among the country's ruling elite. Such a narrative must stand up to the seeming lure of Boko Haram and have the ability to hold a young population captive for the foreseeable future. An action plan akin to a Marshal Plan for northern Nigeria must be developed to suit the context. The federal government's investment in regeneration of northern Nigeria, with a focus on youth sensitization, education and development of social and economic entrepreneurship, will be key. This might entail deliberate forms of youth cantonment, census-based planning, community-based programs, and innovative education schemes to kick start regeneration. To be sure, an action plan for northern Nigeria will not be sustainable in an environment where youth exclusion is a countrywide problem even if it is more chronic in the north. Expressed intention to do this nationally in due course might persuade a captive youth audience. The question remains as to whether alleged Boko Haram sympathizers among the elite can be dislodged from this process. This might be the single most important obstacle in a situation where retaining political power in 2015 seems more valuable to the regime than the welfare of a few million disposable citizens. In the immediate term, we can expect the Nigerian military to record successes against the Boko Haram sect. But the victory will be hollow. Without the trinity of measures earlier described, Jonathan's government risks sacrificing the ordinary people of northern Nigeria, the military's reputation, and innocent bloodshed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of 'Funmi Olonisakin.","Response to Boko Haram insurgency has echoes of the past, says 'Funmi Olonisakin .

"(CNN) -- The parents of American Shane Todd, found hanging in his Singapore apartment last June, tell CNN they may exhume their son's body to conduct an autopsy in the United States. Todd's mother Mary says an exhumation may be the only way to prove ""for sure"" the family's contention that he was murdered. The Todds walked out of the Singapore inquiry into their son's death earlier this week, saying, ""We've lost faith in the process"" and Singapore's inquiry process was ""pre-determined"" to conclude their son's death was a suicide, and that police and investigators never considered evidence that may suggest Todd was murdered. ""We told the police at the very beginning. We talked to Shane every week for three months at least, all the way up to June when he passed away, (and he said) that he was in fear for his life,"" Todd's father Rick told CNN. ""You would think they would look into it. But none of that happened."" The inquiry into the death of Todd, found hanging in his Singapore apartment on June 24, comes after Singapore's medical examiner concluded that Todd committed suicide. State attorneys said during the hearing that Todd's laptop shows he accessed suicide-related web pages in the months before his death, with a search in March on how to tie a hangman's noose. But Todd's parents -- who had flown from their home in Montana to attend the hearings -- claimed there was evidence that his death was a homicide. The Todds claim their son was murdered because of sensitive knowledge he had of a project using gallium nitride (GaN) between the Institute of Microelectronics (IME) -- a Singapore government-backed research agency -- and the Chinese telecom giant Huawei. GaN is material that can withstand high temperatures and can be used in power amplifiers with a range of applications from light emitting displays to radar communications. Documents found on Todd's laptop after his death reportedly indicate IME may have had plans with Chinese telecom giant Huawei to co-develop an amplifier using GaN. Such a device could have both military as well as civilian uses. The 31-year-old Todd had been working for 18 months at IME when he decided to quit his job and return home to the United States shortly before his death. Employees of IME have testified that there were several meetings held with Huawei, including a meeting with their senior level employees that Todd attended, but both IME and Huawei assert no project agreement was concluded, according to testimony. Patrick Lo, deputy executive director of research at IME and Todd's supervisor, testified that his agency does not conduct any classified military research. The Todds say they have evidence to show their son had been instructed to hand copy a GaN ""recipe"" or formula from a U.S. vendor where Todd had been sent for training. The family says he had been left alone in a room to hand copy formulas, and say evidence from Shane's computer shows he had handwritten ""highly sensitive recipes."" Lo denied in court that he had instructed Todd to hand copy recipes and said hand copied recipes would be inaccurate and therefore ""useless."" The Todds stood up in the middle of the inquest proceedings Tuesday and walked out in objection to a witness they were unfamiliar with -- a friend and former work colleague of their son's who testified he'd had a beer with him the night before Todd was found hanging on June 24. ""We're getting sprung stuff at the last moment,"" Rick Todd said outside court. He said the state had given them no prior notice of the witness Frenchman Luis Alejandro Andro Montes. The Todds said they had been ""told from the beginning that this will be honest and open"" and pointed out that their own lawyers had just hours before been chastised by Singapore's judge Chay Yuen Fatt for introducing last-minute documents. Singapore Senior Counsel Tai Wei Shyong referenced Montes in his May 13 opening statement and at that same time said the state would try to bring Montes in as a witness. Just hours before, a key witness for the Todd family, American medical examiner Dr Edward Adelstein, retracted his original assertion that Shane Todd had been strangled by a cord and hanged. Testifying via video link, Adelstein agreed with other forensic pathologists in the case including two U.S. medical examiners, who reviewed the case at Singapore's request, that there would need to be evidence of internal neck injuries if Todd had been ""garroted."" However, Adelstein continued to assert that Todd had been murdered and speculated that he had been killed and then hanged to make it look like suicide. ""I have to assume that people who know how to kill you can do it in a way that is difficult to detect,"" Adelstein added. He did not examine Todd's body and came to his initial conclusions on the basis of photographs taken by the family just before the funeral and Singapore's autopsy report. His new opinions come after the family provided him with a series of photos obtained from Singapore police and forensic officials. Questioned about the photos by a lawyer for the state, Adelstein admitted, ""The cause of death is difficult for me to say.""","Parents of American Shane Todd walk out of Singapore inquiry into engineer's death .

"London (CNN) -- The only thing more horrifying than the murder of a British soldier in a London street is the fear that there is little police can do in the age of ""open-source jihad"" to prevent these types of terror attacks. ""It's always the one we feared, the lone wolf that can come from nowhere and not be on our radar,"" said ex-London police chief John Yates. On Wednesday two men hacked the soldier to death near his military barracks in Woolwich, southeast London before delivering a message to a witness's camera: ""We swear by almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone ... this British soldier is an eye for an eye, a tooth for tooth."" LATEST: London murder victim named . The message has all the hallmarks of classic al Qaeda rhetoric, and experts believe the blood-soaked men wielding cleavers for the cameras in London are just the latest proponents of the ""open-source jihad"" that seems to have grown just as the U.S.-led ""War on Terror"" scattered the organization's terror cells around the world. ""Nearly a decade ago there was a debate within al Qaeda about the future of the organization,"" according to Shiraz Maher, Head of Outreach at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation. ""Afghanistan had been overrun by U.S. forces, the Taliban had been forced to retreat, and as a result al Qaeda lost its ability to train recruits there."" The organization needed a new plan to stay relevant as the U.S. struck at the heart of its traditional operation in places like Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen. Enter a man called Abu Musab al-Suri, the so-called architect of the new al Qaeda, who had a simple plan to change the way al Qaeda took the fight to the West. ""Every Muslim should be an army of one,"" Maher told CNN. ""That was his grand idea -- every individual Muslim should be an autonomous hub that goes out and strikes the West and you can't contain it."" Al-Suri may have had the vision, but it was al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) that translated it into reality in 2010 through the online speeches of radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki -- since killed by a U.S. drone strike -- and the publishing of ""Inspire,"" the English-language magazine that acts as a how-to guide for followers to carry out small-scale terrorist attacks in the West. ""Since 2010 al Qaeda has been telling its followers in the West: 'Don't try and do another 9/11 or 7/7-style attack because invariably these things catch the attention of security services and you go to jail. Think small, think easy, think unsophisticated. Really scale it down to make it difficult to detect, because really it's a detection battle,'"" Maher said. ""What they're demonstrating is you can do something very easy -- go buy a knife, go stab somebody, it's impossible to stop. Provided you pick a sensitive target, you can still cause absolute pandemonium."" So this is the growing struggle facing police forces around the world today, say experts -- not more traditional terror cells, which are more likely to show up through traditional surveillance methods, but self-starters who become radicalized through online sermons and publications. READ MORE: The changing face of terrorism . In 2011 New York police arrested Jose Pimentel and accused him of plotting to detonate pipe bombs that he allegedly learned to make after reading ""Inspire"" magazine. Pimental pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges and is awaiting trial. The pressure cooker bombs that killed three people near the finish line of April's Boston Marathon bore strong similarities to a design laid out in the first issue of the magazine titled ""How to Build a Bomb in Your Mom's Kitchen,"" according to CNN's Paul Cruickshank. In 2010 British MP Stephen Timms was nearly killed when a 21-year-old British student stabbed him during a meeting with his constituents in east London. The student, Roshonara Choudhry, told police she had become radicalized after watching the speeches of al-Awlaki online, and tried to kill Timms because he voted in favor of the Iraq War. Yates, who was Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner until he retired in 2011, told CNN: ""As someone who has tried to prevent these attacks in the past, they're the most difficult ones. ""If we have some serious targets, then of course you can apply the correct level of resources and tactics ... (but) Choudhry had never come to the attention of any authorities at any point."" OPINION: Real enemy in London hacking death . So what, if anything, can be done to prevent lone wolf attacks? The grisly murder in Woolwich has prompted calls for Britain's government to look again at a shelved bill that would greatly expand law enforcement's powers to monitor suspects' use of the internet, which is currently only possible on a more limited basis. ""There is some internet surveillance going on,"" said Yates. ""It's been made very clear by police chiefs in recent weeks that if you download something like 'Inspire' you will be arrested, it is an offence and you will be charged."" So where to draw the line between free speech and invasion of privacy? The proposal to expand police powers for collecting online data caused uproar among privacy advocates in late 2012, but the government says more robust surveillance tools are now needed to effectively combat terrorism. While acknowledging there are ""powerful"" arguments on both sides, Yates said: ""All I know is that you've got to do something, because the level of sophistication in technology is going to make it extraordinarily challenging to improve the way that the internet and other means of communication are monitored if nothing's done."" READ MORE: UK Muslims condemn London slaying . But radicalization expert Maher said monitoring the internet and tracking down anyone who downloads an al-Awlaki speech or a bomb-making guide won't solve the lone wolf problem. ""You don't have to have read 'Inspire' anymore -- everyone knows what's going on because, if nothing else, the media talks about it so much. The idea of committing an unsophisticated attack against a high-profile symbol is out there. It's an impossible thing to work against,"" he said. Yates says in order to prevent future attacks, counter-terrorism police must bolster their community engagement strategy -- making local people feel ""free and able to provide relevant information at the right time."" ""It comes back to the line from the 1980s with the IRA: 'Communities defeat terrorism.' That was the strap-line then, and it's no different today.""","Two men murder British soldier in broad daylight on busy London street .

"London (CNN) -- London's Heathrow Airport is ""fully operational"" and returning to normal after an emergency landing Friday forced the closing of both runways, the airport said -- but many travelers are likely to suffer delays anyway. British Airways has canceled all its inbound and outbound short-haul flights until 4 p.m. (11 a.m. ET) as a result of the incident. And Heathrow Airport has warned of disruption to travel that could last all day. So far, 23 planes have been diverted to other airports and 19 flights canceled, some arrivals and some departures, a spokeswoman said Friday morning. The airport is working to return to normal service as soon as possible, she said, but passengers are advised to check with their airlines. A British Airways plane bound for Oslo was forced to make the emergency landing ""due to a technical fault,"" the airline said. Flight BA762 turned back less than half an hour after taking off for the Norwegian capital, it said. The Airbus A319 aircraft was carrying 75 passengers and five crew members, the airline said. The passengers were evacuated from the plane on emergency slides. ""Airline colleagues are now caring for customers in the airport terminal,"" said British Airways. London Ambulance Service treated three patients for minor injuries after the emergency landing, it said on Twitter. British Airways said it would be carrying out a full investigation into the incident, alongside the Air Accident Investigation Branch, part of the UK Department for Transport. The slides were deployed on the left side of the aircraft, indicating that the problem was with the right engine, said CNN's Richard Quest. Planes can fly safely even if only one engine is operational, he said. London Fire Brigade said one of its crews helped the airport fire service put out an aircraft fire. ""We believe the fire is now out,"" it said via Twitter. Heathrow, which is a major international hub, was ranked the third busiest airport in the world in 2012 after Atlanta and Beijing, according to Airports Council International. Monday is a holiday in the United Kingdom, so many people will be taking flights Friday to take advantage of the long weekend. Holidaymaker Aileen Wilson was one of many travelers whose flight was grounded by the incident. ""We've just been sitting, waiting in a plane meant to take off"" this morning, she told CNN iReport. ""At first we were told ongoing incident and then emergency landing. We (are) still waiting to take off (and) not allowed out of plane!"" Instagram user Shazia Shaikh took a photograph from the office where she works at Heathrow Airport of emergency vehicles surrounding a plane. ""Runways closed (and) lots of smoke,"" she told CNN iReport. ""The rain doesn't help. Emergency vehicles were quick to the aircraft I'm told."" On average, 190,000 passengers travel through the airport each day, half arriving and half departing, according to Heathrow's website. CNN's Claudia Rebaza, Richard Allen Greene, Sarah Brown and Dominique Van Heerden contributed to this report.","NEW: British Airways cancels all its short-haul flights through Heathrow until 4 p.m.

"(CNN) -- When the Boy Scouts of America found out den leader Jennifer Tyrrell is a lesbian, the organization's Ohio River Valley Council sent her a letter saying ""you must immediately sever any relationship you may have"" with the Scouts. ""You should understand that BSA (Boy Scouts of America) membership registration is a privilege and is not automatically granted to everyone who applies,"" the group wrote in the April 12, 2012, letter that Tyrrell, a 33-year-old mom in Ohio, photographed and sent to me recently. ""We reserve the right to refuse registration whenever there is concern that an individual may not meet the high standards of membership the BSA seeks."" That reference to ""high standards"" is apparently the Boy Scouts way of saying gays and lesbian scout leaders need not apply. You may have heard people describe the Boy Scouts as gay-friendly this week, since the group voted to amend its draconian policies that banned ""open or avowed homosexuals"" from participating in the group as Scouts. The 103-year-old organization -- known for its worthwhile efforts to teach kids to tie knots, survive in the woods and become more civic-minded adults -- decided on Thursday that gay Scouts should be able to participate in the organization. But not gay and lesbian leaders. The Boy Scouts' 1,400 voting members approved the change with more than 60% of the vote. Still, the Scouts will have a hard time escaping the organization's new reputation as a den for outdated thinking and discrimination. The group's attitudes on gay rights are ""more out of style than the scout socks,"" said Kelsey Timmerman, a former Eagle Scout who mailed his badge back to the organization because of its discriminatory policies. ""I never wore those damn socks,"" he said, laughing. It's clear the Boy Scouts are lost in the woods. Timmerman represents the core of the scouting organization's problem. He's 34, straight and the father of two kids. He credits the Scouts with helping him become an outgoing, confident and successful person. ""Scouting was awesome,"" he said. But he wouldn't enroll his son in the program unless gays and lesbians are allowed to be Scouts and Scout leaders, too. He doesn't want them to learn to discriminate from an organization that claims to value kindness and bravery. The same goes for Tyrrell, the former Tiger Cub den leader in Ohio. Her son Cruz would love to be able to participate in the Scouts again, she said. And she would love for him to be able to do so. She noticed improvements in his maturity and confidence when he was part of the group. But she won't go back unless everyone is welcome. ""They're teaching them to be bigots essentially,"" she said. ""This world is changing so quickly. You can't raise leaders for tomorrow on principles founded 100 years ago."" When I spoke with Tyrrell earlier, I sympathized with her wanting to celebrate the proposal to include gay Scouts as a ""tiny step in the right direction."" Hundreds of thousands of people had petitioned the Scouts to allow gay kids to participate. Ryan Andresen became a national celebrity of sorts after he was refused his Eagle Scout award because he's openly gay. (Ellen DeGeneres had him on her show and gave him a $20,000 scholarship.) I am certainly thankful the Boy Scouts did decide to allow all openly gay kids to be members. But it's frustrating and unfair that Boy Scout leaders also affirmed discrimination against adult scout leaders. The Scouts shouldn't tell children there's nothing wrong with gay kids, but that there is something mysterious and dangerous about gay and lesbian adults. For one thing, it's illogical. ""How does a (gay Scout) commit his life to an organization who he knows full well is going to dump him the day he turns 18?"" Tyrrell asked when we spoke in April, before this week's vote. ""It would be really hard for that boy to believe in trustworthiness and loyalty and all those things that are important as a Scout."" Gay kids: fine. Adults? Not so much. The problem may be that the Scouts are listening too much instead of making decisions with conviction. They're ""licking their finger and testing the wind,"" as Timmerman put it, trying to figure out how to please all constituencies. That's, of course, impossible. The anti-gay Family Research Council recently uploaded a YouTube video (watch it; this sort of over-produced fear-mongering has become a hilarious parody of itself) saying that the Boy Scouts were ""abandoning their moral compass"" by thinking of including gay Scouts. I don't think the Boy Scouts of America has abandoned its compass. But it's clear it still needs to be recalibrated to the times. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Boy Scouts of America voted to end its ban on gay Scouts .

"(CNN) -- Nelson Mandela, anti-apartheid icon, Nobel peace laureate and South Africa's first black president, celebrated his 90th birthday Friday by doing something he had indicated he would not do again -- grant an interview to journalists. Mandela sits at the 6th Nelson Mandela Lecture in Soweto, Johannesburg. A cheerful-looking Mandela welcomed CNN's Robyn Curnow, along with reporters from two other organizations, into the sitting room of his home in Qunu, a small village in the rolling hills of South Africa's eastern Cape region where he grew up. ""What day is this?"" Mandela joked, pretending not to realize it was his birthday. He used a smile to dodge Curnow's first question of what was his favorite memory from his long life. He did say he was very happy to have lived to be 90. Mandela credited his longevity to the way he conducted his life. He is known to be disciplined with his diet and exercise. Asked if, in hindsight, he wishes he had spent more time with his family, he answered yes. ""I don't regret it because the things that attracted me were things that pleased my soul."" Graca Machel, whom he married on his 80th birthday, sat nearby and Mandela was surrounded by grandchildren.  Watch what Mandela's grandchildren have to say » . Mandela then lamented the gap between rich and poor in South Africa. ""Poverty still grips our people. If you're poor, you're not likely to live for long,"" he said.  Watch CNN's Mandela interview » . This was Mandela's first meeting with reporters since he announced in 2004 that he would give no more interviews. While he stayed out of the spotlight over the last four years, he has stayed busy with his charitable causes. All week residents of Qunu, 600 miles south of Johannesburg, have been making preparations for the celebrations. Events planned include a soccer festival, a pop concert and lunch for 500 politicians, veterans of the anti-apartheid struggle and other guests at his home Saturday. An exhibition of letters that children wrote to Mandela and the late U.S. civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks will be displayed at the Nelson Mandela Museum, a short distance from his house. ""We are very excited,"" local school principal Mpondomise Ndzambo told the Associated Press, sitting in his office beneath a photograph of the former president. ""Usually these celebrations are done in Johannesburg, so this is a way of being part of it."" Send your birthday messages . In 1964, a court sentenced Mandela to life in prison for plotting to overthrow the government by violence. He spent the first 18 years at Robben Island Prison, off Cape Town, South Africa, and later spent time at Pollsmoor prison and Victor Verster Prison, closer to the mainland. While in prison, Mandela became recognized as the most significant black leader in South Africa, and he became a potent symbol of resistance in the anti-apartheid movement. Mandela consistently refused to compromise his political position to obtain his freedom. South Africa's last apartheid-era president who also served as Mandela's vice president, F.W. de Klerk, released Mandela in February 1990 after 27 years in prison. Mandela was elected president of the African National Congress the following year, and in 1994, he was elected president of his country. As South Africa's first black president -- he only ran for one term -- Mandela ushered in a democratic, multiracial society that is still going strong. In a fitting tribute de Klerk described Mandela as ""one of the greatest figures of the 20th century,"" AP reported. Mandela's recent birthday tribute concert in London's Hyde Park marked the 20 year anniversary of the Free Mandela event that was held in the same city to demand his release from prison. During the concert a frail Mandela told cheering fans, ""Your voices carried across the water to inspire us in our prison cells far away. Tonight, we can stand before you free. ""We are honored to be back in London for this wonderful occasion. ""But even as we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. ""Where there is poverty and sickness, including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done. Our work is for freedom for all."" Proceeds from the London concert went toward the 46664 Campaign, which Mandela founded in 2003 to raise awareness about the impact of AIDS, especially in Africa, and to promote HIV-prevention measures around the world. The name of the charity represents Mandela's prison number when he was incarcerated at Robben Island. Organizers put 46,664 tickets up for sale.","Mandela: Called on the rich to help the poor in birthday interview .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Demonstrators braved a heavy police presence and the threat of arrest by massing Thursday in the streets of Kunming, China, to protest the planned construction of a chemical plant, they said. ""It was mostly a peaceful protest,"" said an activist who asked to be identified only by his family name, Young. ""We were singing the national anthem, shouting 'Get out, refinery!' together."" He added, ""We were scattered by the heavy police force in the area. I saw locals scuffling with police, people getting arrested and pulled away."" Read more: Can social media clear air over China? The plant is a hot topic in the city, which is the capital of Yunnan province in southwestern China. ""Every Kunming person cares about this issue,"" said another Kunming native, a 50-year-old man who said rows of police thwarted his efforts to reach the heart of the protest. ""The police kept blocking off the protest, block by block."" Local government officials did not respond to CNN phone calls for comment. Photos posted on Chinese social media sites showed uniformed and riot police surrounding groups of demonstrators. The five activists who spoke to CNN asked not to be named for fear of reprisals from Chinese authorities. The oil refinery and chemical plant would be built in Anning city, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Kunming, according to Xinhua, China's state news agency. Report: China lax in treating, policing lead poisoning . Opponents fear the chemical plant would produce tons of paraxylene, a carcinogenic chemical identified by the acronym PX. Several days after a May 4 protest, the Kunming mayor joined executives from the state China National Petroleum Corp. and the Yuntianhua Group for a joint news conference. ""The government will call off the project if most of our citizens say no to it,"" said Mayor Li Wenrong, according to Xinhua. The provincial general manager of China National Petroleum Corp. has said the refinery will not use the chemical. ""The project has no PX facilities, nor will it produce PX products,"" Hu Jingke said, according to Xinhua. Kunming residents expressed deep distrust of government officials and the state-owned enterprises behind the refinery project. Several said authorities took draconian measures in the days running up to Thursday's protest in an attempt to prevent demonstrators from taking to the streets. Opinion: Why booming China needs to act fast . A 25-year-old Kunming native who asked to be identified as Claire told CNN that police detained and interrogated her for more than nine hours after she was caught distributing anti-refinery fliers on a city street Tuesday. ""I understand we need oil refineries,"" Claire said in a phone interview. She said she opposed this one because ""it's just so close to the city and the fact that the whole process was not transparent and we're not allowed to ask questions."" Claire said police accused her of staging an ""illegal gathering."" As part of the interrogation, she said, police took her to the print shop where she had made copies of her fliers. Then they escorted her to her parents' home, where they demanded that she erase files about the refinery from her computer. Finally, she said, they threatened her and banned her from attending Thursday's protest. CNN Blog: Why China's leaders should worry about climate change . ""Basically, they're saying if I have this on my record, I won't get any government job or state-owned enterprise job,"" Claire said. Several other Kunming residents said students and employees of state-owned companies had been warned not to attend the demonstration. ""Kunming is a beautiful city, where we have cleaner air than any other cities in this country,"" Young said. ""We fear the refinery will destroy the city's natural environment, and we demanded to see the environmental impact assessment report of this project. But we were rejected by the government who told us it's a 'state secret.' "" An executive from Yuntianhua, which also has a major stake in the chemical plant, told journalists that an environmental impact assessment for the project had not been completed, Xinhua said. In March, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao promised that health safeguards would be improved and efforts would be made to control air pollution and make water supplies safer. China air pollution: 'Slightly polluted' or 'hazardous'? ""We should adopt effective measures to prevent and control pollution and change the way we work and live,"" Wen said. The emphasis on environmental and health issues comes as China's leaders confront growing anger about choking pollution, contaminated food, and water that is unsafe to drink. The statistics are staggering. China now burns 3.8 billion tons of coal each year, nearly as much as the rest of the world combined. In January, the smog over Beijing was so thick, it could be seen from space. China's CO2 emissions rose by 720 million tons in 2011 -- a 9.3% increase. Pollution and dust generated in China have been found as far away as California. Maintaining blockbuster growth has sometimes come at the expense of environmental protections. The government has made explicit its intention to weigh environmental regulation against the cost to the economy. But analysts say the public outcry over pollution has tipped the scales. China has already tried to boost the use of alternative sources of power, setting standards for solar energy installation and switching from coal to gas in some cities.

"London (CNN) -- British Muslim groups voiced their horror and condemnation Thursday over the slaying of a soldier in a London street by attackers who said they were acting to avenge Muslim deaths overseas. But Muslim commentators also suggested there is more that the country's leaders can do to address issues within the Muslim community, particularly among alienated young men. Woolwich attack: Latest developments . According to 2011 census figures, Muslims make up the second-largest religious group in Britain, with 2.7 million people. That represents an increase of 1.2 million (from 3% to 5% of the population) since 2001. The suspected attackers in the Woolwich slaying, who are hospitalized under police guard, claimed to be acting for Islam, but it's not yet clear if they were affiliated with any group. ""The only reasons we killed this man ... is because Muslims are dying daily,"" said one of the suspects, wielding a cleaver with bloody hands, in video aired by CNN affiliate ITN. ""This British soldier is an eye for an eye, a tooth for tooth,"" he said. ""We swear by almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone."" The Muslim Council of Britain condemned what it called ""a truly barbaric act that has no basis in Islam."" Read more: London attack mirrors plot to behead Muslim soldier . It urged Muslims and non-Muslims alike ""to come together in solidarity to ensure the forces of hatred do not prevail."" Political and social commentator Mohammed Ansar also urged restraint. ""What we have seen on the streets of London has been particularly sickening, a really, really heinous act of I would say criminality -- and I'm being careful to say criminality, not terrorism,"" he told CNN. The motivation for what happened in Woolwich remains unclear, he pointed out. ""What we need at this time is a sense of calm, a sense of measure and a sense of perspective. What we don't need are knee-jerk reactions ... to really ratchet up tensions and really stoke and inflame anxieties within communities."" Asghar Bukhari, of the UK Muslim Public Affairs Committee, described the attack as shocking, but said there had been failures by both the UK government and the Muslim community when it came to tackling extremism in Britain. London attack: Terrorist targeting soldiers at home again? The British government is ""completely denying that it has anything to do with the political situation around the Muslim world,"" including its foreign policy, he said. Britain has been involved in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. At the same time, Muslim organizations ""have failed their own community by not teaching these young, angry men how to get a democratic change to this policy that's ruining so many lives,"" he said. He said Muslim leaders were unwilling to bring about change, saying they preferred to debate minor theological issues than take practical steps to educate young people about political action. As a result, young people's outrage over what is happening in the Muslim world is creating a ""blow-back"" effect as they take violent action in the West, he said, as seen with the Boston bombings. The attack in Britain is ""very, very sad,"" he added, but reflects an anger bubbling under the surface that could boil over at any time. 'Heads in the sand' Shiraz Maher, of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at Kings College London, said Wednesday's attack appeared to reflect a tactical shift by terror network al Qaeda toward targeted rather than mass casualty attacks. The suspects may have been radicalized online, he suggested, although police have as yet released no details in the Woolwich case. Authorities have been trying to counter radical websites and messages, but it's a difficult task, Maher said. Witness: Attackers 'were just animals' Alongside that, Maher said he believes Muslim leaders in Britain can and should do more to root out radicalization in the community. ""A lot of Muslim leaders have had their heads in the sand for a very long time,"" he said. ""A lot of Muslim leaders in this country weren't born here, they don't speak the language necessarily, they don't understand a lot of the pressures and debates and issues that young Muslims are having."" There has been a sense of inertia in some cases, he said, and Muslim communities haven't always reacted as quickly as they should have. There has been a small shift in the right direction with the emergence of new community groups and civil society initiatives, he said, but changes need to happen faster. ""We need to have a very strong counter-narrative to the ideas of al Qaeda,"" he said, which suggest that there is a war against Muslims led by non-Muslims. ""We need a civic identity, we need to make people understand that we are all British citizens, we are all part of this society. Whether you disagree with a particular issue or not, there are ways to voice your feelings, and killing a serviceman is not one of those."" There is apprehension across Britain, not just in London, in the face of demonstrations by groups like the far-right English Defence League, he said. As each side gets more radical, it fuels the other, he said -- and that has consequences for the vast majority of people who do not share those opposing views. ""Ordinary people always get caught up in the crossfire of extremism,"" he said. CNN's Zain Verjee contributed to this report.","Muslim Council of Britain condemns ""a truly barbaric act that has no basis in Islam""

"Washington (CNN) -- A day after the United States published a blacklist of alleged Russian human rights abusers, whom Washington slapped with personal sanctions, the Kremlin answered with a list of its own. It slaps alleged American rights violators with similar sanctions, official Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported Saturday. The U.S. list is part of a December 2012 law, the Magnitsky Act, which imposes visa bans and freezes assets of Russian officials believed to be connected to the death of whistleblower Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who uncovered the country's largest known tax fraud. U.S. releases blacklist tied to alleged Russia rights abuses . Magnitsky was allegedly beaten to death in detention, a claim which Russian authorities dispute. The new law has been a thorn in the side of Moscow, which banned U.S. adoption of Russian children shortly after it passed. Washington's blacklist, published Friday, contains 18 names. The Russian list also contains 18 and is a conscious, incensed reply to the U.S. list. Russian news agency Interfax published the names of Americans on Moscow's list. It includes an FBI agent, a DEA agent and officials at a New York district court. ""This war of lists was not our decision, but we do not have the right to ignore such open blackmail,"" Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement according to RIA Novosti. It accused the United States of basing its relationship with Russia on ""mentorship."" Washington's blacklist includes people said to be linked to the Magnitsky case, including senior officials in the Russian interior ministry, prosecutors, judges, prison officials and tax officers. The people on Russia's mirror list have a connection to the U.S. detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, RIA Novosti reported. It also includes Americans who were allegedly ""involved in the abduction and removal to other countries of Russian citizens and in threats to their lives and health."" More on the Magnitsky Act . An additional, classified list, which was submitted to the U.S. Congress, includes people who are subject only to the travel ban. Other blacklisted names were tied to other high profile cases. One was accused in the 2006 shooting death of a Chechen man who filed claims against Moscow with the European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg for human rights violations in Chechnya. The other is believed to have played a part in the 2004 murder of American Paul Klebnikov, the editor of Forbes' magazine's Russian edition, in what was viewed as an attempt to quash investigative journalism in the country. A senior State Department official told reporters the list was the product of an investigation based on information from non-governmental organizations and other information made available to the United States. The official said the rigorous standards used to develop this list were similar to those used to designate individuals and companies on other U.S. blacklists. Additional names would be added to the blacklist, should more information become available, the official said. Absent from the list were certain Russian officials close to President Vladimir Putin. But the senior State Department official said ""political considerations"" in the U.S. relationship with Russia were ""not a factor"" and that additional names could be added to the blacklist, should additional information become available.

Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, warned Friday that the publication of the list risked overshadowing the visit of National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, who is scheduled to visit Moscow on Monday.

"(CNN) -- The sign that covered a set of doors read, ""We Love You Plaza Towers."" Children, toting big book bags and balloons, hugged their teachers and said goodbye before departing for the summer. Many managed a smile despite the sad fact these end-of-the-year moments took place at Eastlake Elementary School because Plaza Towers is just a huge pile of rubble. Kaylee Sanchez, a kindergartner who was shielded by one of her teachers as the storm plowed over Plaza Towers, said she was ""freaking out"" before going to Thursday's reunion. But once she and the other children got there, laughter and playfulness returned to a group that suffered the worst when an EF5 tornado struck Monday. Seven of their schoolmates were killed by the storm, which lead to 17 other deaths. Kaylee's mother, Maria, applauded administrators for putting together the sendoff where students also received a backpack full of activities, snacks, stuffed animals and some basic necessities for the coming days. ""It's a really good thing because they get to see all their friends to make sure they are OK,"" Maria Sanchez said. ""It's a good atmosphere to see the all these kids laughing and playing. ... My own daughter has been scared until today. When it started storming this morning she didn't want to come."" Pounding rain soaked Moore on Thursday morning, and winds sent pieces of debris flying, hindering recovery efforts three days after the devastating tornado. Once she got there, Maria and the other children spilled around, and raced up to each other when they saw someone they had been worrying about. Emily Stephens, a student at Plaza Towers, said she was in an underground shelter when the tornado hit. ""I just hope everyone's OK,"" she said. ""I hope they get a new house -- and a better one."" Stephens said ""some of my house got ripped down."" She was happy to get the crayons, books and candy and, most importantly, see her classmates. ""It makes me glad to see my friends and that they're alive,"" she said. Flash flood warning issued . Two people died elsewhere in the state in storms Sunday, the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said. In all, 377 people have been treated for injuries as a result of this week's storms, the Department of Emergency Management said. It did not say how many were injured Monday. Of the 24 people killed Monday, 10 were children -- including two infants, the state medical examiner's office said. ""All people thought missing have been accounted for at this time,"" Gov. Mary Fallin said. As water gushed through the streets Thursday, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the Oklahoma City area, including Moore, and a severe thunderstorm warning. Strong storms in southwestern Oklahoma City ""are making a (southeast) turn toward Moore,"" the National Weather Service tweeted at 10:30 a.m. ""Small hail, gusty winds, lightning and flooding main threats!"" But shortly after, the service said storms were moving out of the metropolitan Oklahoma City area. ""Next chance of storms is late tonight,"" the weather service tweeted.

Some people may choose to move to another neighborhood, but most are indicating they want to rebuild in Moore, Doak said. The two elementary schools destroyed will be rebuilt, the incoming superintendent of Moore public schools said Thursday. ""That's the beginning of the healing process,"" Robert Romines said. The schools did not have storm shelters. Romines said he supports the effort to add storm shelters during the rebuilding. He called for funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to cover it. Other schools that were rebuilt after a 1999 tornado have such shelters, he said. But numerous other schools don't. ""As funds become available, we will look at that,"" Romines said, adding that money ""is an obstacle."" High school commencement ceremonies will take place Saturday in downtown Oklahoma City, Romines said. The community will ""do the best we can and make sure that our students are all taken care of.""

"(CNN) -- As I knelt on the bedroom floor, on the phone with 911, I didn't understand what was happening at first. I thought something had gone wrong -- or at least that the paramedics would have plenty of time to arrive. When your wife is pregnant, no one tells you, ""By the way, she might skip labor, suddenly fall to the floor, and give birth. Oh, and the umbilical cord might be tangled around the baby's neck five times."" But that's what happened at our house. Minutes earlier, things had been fine. My wife thought that perhaps contractions were beginning, and it was possible -- she was about three weeks from her due date. We have a son who's 3 years older. For his birth, she labored at home for about 16 hours before we went to the hospital, and still waited eight hours for the baby. This time, she suddenly doubled over, saying she was having intense contractions and needed me to do what I had done three years earlier -- push down on her hips to help relieve the pain. But it wasn't enough. She quickly got down on all fours, moaning, and managed to get out the words, ""Call an ambulance."" I thought that meant she'd need a stretcher to get to the hospital. Turns out, she knew that our kid had decided to come crashing into the world without all the usual fanfare. But she was hurting too much to speak. All the agony of childbirth had hit her in a single wave. I told the 911 operator about the ""glop of blood"" coming out, and followed her instructions to set up towels and help my wife lie on her back -- though actually she lay on her side. Then: ""Oh my God it's the head. It's the head. What do I do? I'm holding my baby's head!"" Most people who hear I delivered my son imagine a sitcom. If this were one, the camera would zoom over to the list of delivery plans that my wife had created with our doula. In a hospital room, she would use ""yoga techniques,"" massage, a ""birth ball,"" and music as pain management techniques. Best laid plans. ""OK listen, I want you to support the shoulders and hold the hips and legs firmly. And remember the baby will be slippery so don't drop it OK?"" the 911 operator said. I reached in, palms facing up, put my pointer fingers into the baby's armpits, and helped guide the baby out. That's when my heart started pounding even faster, and my adrenaline went from overdrive to supersonic. The umbilical cord was snaked around the baby's neck, tightly. Think a turtleneck with five circles. The baby's eyes were shut and I saw no sign of breathing. As far as I knew, no sign of life. So as the operator went on reading the standard directions: ""Wrap the baby in a clean cloth or towel... tie a shoelace tightly around the umbilical cord..."" I stopped following her. I focused on the neck. Didn't even look down to see what gender the baby was. ""Oh my God, the baby's not breathing,"" I said. ""Breathe baby, breathe."" My mind operates with briefcases of information. I opened up one filled with everything I had ever heard about real life births, including a child I know who was born not breathing for a couple of minutes. He turned out perfectly fine -- he had been getting oxygen through the umbilical cord. So I didn't want to tie it off just yet. I carefully unraveled the cord from his neck, trying not to jostle him, and placed him down on the towel. ""Let me give you CPR instructions,"" the operator offered. But then, when I stroked him gently a couple of times, the baby opened his eyes, began to move, and began to breathe -- about a minute after he was out. I used a shoelace to tie off the cord just as the paramedics arrived. I picked up our 3-year-old, who was on the other side of the room for all of this, and whom I had been reassuring throughout the whole process. ""It's OK buddy, don't worry, everything's fine, this just happens,"" I kept telling him. Together we ran downstairs to let the paramedics in. We all ran back up to the bedroom. That's when my wife looked at me and spoke her first words since collapsing 14 minutes earlier: ""It's a boy."" For weeks after, that first image of my beautiful son as he emerged -- eyes closed, still, so pure in his newness -- was emblazoned on the inside of my eyelids. I saw it every time I blinked. To this day, I can still see and feel just about everything about that moment. I wouldn't recommend this, and it's not something we'd choose to do. If anything had gone wrong, the minutes it could take to get to the hospital could be the difference between life and death. But for my family, it turned out to be an incredible thing. It will always have been an experience of a lifetime, one the four of us shared -- just us. Our older child already likes to tell the story of how Daddy caught his brother, who was ""covered in red paint."" It gives me a unique connection to my son, one I'll feel throughout our lives. Knowing that the first thing he heard upon emerging from the womb was me making sure he could breathe, that the first thing he felt was me holding him and unwrapping the cord, changes my relationship to him a little. It reinforces, in a powerful way, what just about all dads want our kids to have -- the feeling, the knowledge, that we will take care of them, protect them, provide for them. And don't think I won't hold this over his head when we go through his rebellious teen phase. It's given me a new appreciation for doctors who successfully deliver thousands of babies, and most of all for the heroics of women -- especially my wife -- in that moment, suffering through all they suffer through for the sake of bringing life into the world. I am in awe. And grateful beyond description. It's also heightened my own awareness of the gift of life. When it's up to you to help your kid take his first breaths, you appreciate not only his but your own in a new way. The whole adventure of life -- growing, exploring, contributing, loving, all of it -- feels more exciting and more precious. It's easy to get caught up in the rat race, the excitement of work, and the inner drive to chase all the great things the world has to offer. We all sometimes fall into traps that make us forget to seek balance -- to try to carve out enough time for family and for just enjoying life. But in the moment I delivered my son, what matters most -- my real values and priorities -- became crystal clear. Nothing else even existed. Every time I look at him, I'm reminded of that feeling. By being born into my arms, my son gave me the ultimate reality check. Josh will be answering your questions and discussing this story on Facebook and Twitter.","CNN's Josh Levs delivered his son at home, just moments after his wife went into labor .

"London (CNN) -- A soldier lies in a pool of blood in the middle of a nondescript inner-city London street. His two apparent killers brandish bloodied kitchen knives and meat cleavers. One of them rants at a passer-by who films the whole extraordinary encounter on a mobile phone. These shocking images are unlike anything seen before on the streets of Britain, where the murder rate is one of the lowest in the world and where police officers do not routinely carry guns. London attack: Terrorists targeting soldiers at home again? There is little sense of panic among the dozens of witnesses, some of whom argue rationally with the suspected killer. If the British can still be characterized as being hard to panic with stiff upper lips, this street scene was a bizarre illustration. Others mill round taking photos -- as if a celebrity has arrived. At one point a woman with a shopping trolley even walks past the man without changing course as he makes his radical statement. In the distance is the sound of police sirens: later the men will be shot -- although both survive -- by armed officers. This is suburban London on a quiet day in May 2013. The attack, which is being treated as a suspected terrorist incident by the UK government, begins in a fairly anonymous road in Woolwich, a deprived largely blue-collar neighborhood in comparison to its historic neighbors Greenwich and Blackheath. The area was hit hard, as was much of London, by the summer riots of 2011, when several shops and properties were burned to the ground. But beyond that violence is rare: thousands of visitors attended Olympic shooting events last year at the army barracks where the soldier was heading, without incident. At 2.20pm on Wednesday, a small blue Vauxall Tigra hatchback with blacked-out windows mounts the sidewalk of Artillery Place and mows down a soldier. Read more: London attack mirrors plot to behead Muslim soldier . The soldier, later named as Lee Rigby, 25, a father of a 2-year-old boy, is wearing a T-shirt bearing the logo of ""Help for Heroes,"" a military charity that in little more than five years has raised well over Â£100 million ($150 million) for members of the Armed Forces wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. The two attackers get out of the car, then fall on Rigby, stabbing and slashing him to death with their knives and cleavers before they drag his body into the middle of the road. The murder brings the mid-afternoon traffic on Artillery Place, just yards from the busy arterial John Wilson Street, to a standstill. From the relative safety of a stationary bus, passengers start to film: later the footage will be broadcast by the world's media. One clip starts by showing the car smashed into a lamp-post: then the camera pans round to show that this is no ordinary traffic accident. The footage reveals that the victim lying in the road being tenderly stroked by a passer-by. We do not know at this stage at what point Rigby died. Watch: Terrorism analyst on soldier killing . About 50 yards behind the commotion a silent crowd of people has gathered to watch proceedings. One woman, apparently oblivious to the unfolding carnage, casually walks past the scene carrying her shopping bag. In one clip that will later be streamed on a newspaper website, one bus passenger feels sufficiently emboldened to leave the vehicle while filming -- even though it is far from clear that the attackers will not strike out at other people. Then, amazingly, one of the two suspected assailants walks up to the camera in an agitated state. He is dressed in black and wearing a black beanie hat, his hands drenched in blood. In his left hand he grips a knife and machete. Opinion: The real enemy in London hacking death . The suspect begins to address the camera, as if explaining himself to a wider audience that goes beyond those gathered on the street. ""The only reason we killed this man today is because Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers,"" he begins. ""And this British soldier is one. It is an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. I apologize that women had to witness this today but in our lands our women have to see the same. You people will never be safe. Remove your governments. They don't care about you. You think David Cameron is going to get caught in the street when we start busting our guns, you think politicians are going to die?"" At this point in his rant, an elderly woman pulling a shopping trolley bustles past the man without even slowing and continues on her way. Both ignore each other. The man continues. ""No, it's going to be the average guy like you, and your children. So, get rid of them. Tell them to bring our troops back so we can all live in peace."" He then walks back up the road, towards the victim and a second man with whom he has a conversation. They make no attempt to flee the scene. Instead they walk up and down the street, having heated conversations with passers-by, some of whom plead with the pair to refrain from further violence. One such bystander, Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, will later tell the Guardian newspaper she spoke to one of the attackers. ""He was very excited and he told me not to get close to the body. I didn't really feel anything. I was not scared because he was not drunk, he was not on drugs. He was normal. I could speak to him and he wanted to speak and that's what we did."" Loyau-Kennett, a passenger on the bus, will tell reporters that she asked the suspect what he was going to do next. ""He said it was a war and if the police were coming, he was going to kill them. I asked him if that was a reasonable thing to do but it was clear that he really wanted to do that. He talked about war but he did not talk about dying and then he left to speak to someone else."" But the violence is not yet over. Fourteen minutes after the attack, police say, armed officers arrive. According to eyewitnesses, the two attackers, one of whom was brandishing a handgun, charged at the officers who opened fire, wounding both of the men. The men are left at the scene while crowds surge around them, according to media reports. A police helicopter then arrives to take the men under armed guard to separate London hospitals. A large section of Woolwich is sealed off for the evening by forensics officers who comb the area around Artillery Place for evidence. Wednesday's attack is not the first time that soldiers in Woolwich have been visited with violence. In 1974 a bomb was thrown through the window of the King's Arms pub at the far end of Artillery Place, killing a gunner as well as a sales clerk. The Provisional IRA claimed responsibility for that attack -- but unlike the two attackers on Wednesday, they were far less brazen. They fled after the bombing and went on to kill more than 30 others in a 14-month campaign across London before surrendering to police in December 1975 following a six-day siege. Wednesday's killing is the first jihadist attack that has killed a victim since the July 7, 2005 bombings in London that killed 52 people and the four bombers. Just like the 1970s IRA bombing campaign and the 7/7 attacks, it is likely to resonate in London and the wider British society for a long period.","As soldier lay dying in London street, apparent attackers posed for photos .

"(Time ) -- In April, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated the warning to finasteride, Merck & Co.'s drug marketed to treat both male pattern baldness (Propecia) and enlarged prostate (Proscar). The new warnings noted that the sexual side effects associated with the medication, including problems with libido, ejaculations and orgasm, could last even after patients stop taking the drug. Now a new study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine finds that side effects may not only continue after stopping finasteride, but they may last for months or even years. In the study, Dr. Michael Irwig of George Washington University and his colleagues surveyed 54 men under age 40 who reported experiencing side effects for three months or more after stopping the medication Propecia. The patients reported a variety of sexual problems including erectile dysfunction, low libido, trouble having an orgasm, and shrinking and painful genitals. Some men also reported neurological problems like depression, anxiety and cognitive haziness. Time.com: FDA warns statin users of memory loss and diabetes risks . For 96% of the men, the sexual problems lasted more than a year after they quit using the drug. None of the men had sexual, medical or psychiatric complaints before taking Propecia. The study sample was small and the authors acknowledge that it may be skewed to include only men who were most negatively impacted by the drug. Most of the participants were recruited through an Internet forum called Propeciahelp.com, for men experiencing persistent side effects. Still, the authors argue their findings may signal potentially serious risks for men using finasteride. ""Our findings make me suspicious that this drug may have done permanent damage to these men,"" Irwig told ABC News. The FDA's updated warning labels for finasteride were based on a review of post-marketing reports of sexual dysfunction. The agency reviewed 421 post-marketing reports of sexual side effects related to Propecia from 1998 to 2011; out of these cases, 59 reported adverse sexual effects lasting over three months after discontinuing the drug. For Proscar, the FDA reviewed 131 cases of erectile dysfunction and 68 cases of decreased libido from 1992 to 2010. As Healthland reported in April: . Finasteride labels will now warn users that Propecia's side effects can include libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders that continue after discontinuation of the drug and that Proscar can lead to decreased libido that continues after quitting the drug. Both medications will receive a new description of reports of male infertility and poor semen quality that normalized or improved after stopping therapy. ""Despite the fact that clear causal links between finasteride (Propecia and Proscar) and sexual adverse events have not been established, the cases suggest a broader range of adverse effects than previously reported in patients taking these drugs,"" the FDA said in a statement. Time.com: Study finds pattern in male baldness: Could there be a cure? Irwig acknowledges that the number of men experiencing long-lasting side effects from finasteride is small, although the incidence of sexual side effects in clinical trials was around 2%, the incidence of persistent sexual side effects is unknown, but likely less than 0.1%. ""But because the medication is prescribed so commonly, it's still a lot of people, likely several thousand men around the world,"" Irwig told ABC News. Both the FDA and Merck maintain that finasteride is safe and effective.

"(CNN) -- Throughout his prolific career Mel Brooks has gone by many titles -- actor, filmmaker, producer, songwriter -- but comedy is the epicenter of his life, drawing together his early work on TV shows like ""Your Show of Shows"" and ""Get Smart,"" with his notable career in film with movies like ""The Producers,"" ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Blazing Saddles,"" a few of which have been translated to the Broadway stage. Brooks, now 86, has won numerous awards and is presently one of only 14 people to receive the coveted EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony). On May 20 PBS will premiere a documentary on Brooks, ""American Masters Mel Brooks: Make A Noise,"" a film directed by Robert Trachtenberg that chronicles Brooks' career and lasting influence. The film, which recently premiered at The Paley Center in Los Angeles, where Brooks was joined by longtime collaborator and friend Carl Reiner, is an exhaustive look at the continually hilarious -- and often moving -- output of a filmmaker and writer who is largely responsible for the tone of contemporary comedy. Brooks spoke with CNN at Brooks Films, a humble second-floor office in The Culver Studios in Los Angeles where the filmmaker still works, about what it means to have your life compressed into a 90-minute documentary. For Brooks, who keeps all his awards gathered on a table behind his desk, the film is a way to understand his own impact and to see that his story, which may continue with a Broadway version of ""Blazing Saddles,"" has been meaningful to so many. CNN: What does it feel like to have someone create a film that recaps your entire life? Mel Brooks: You know, it's lucky I'm smart because I understand it. If I didn't understand it I'd be very angry. Like, ""You left out New York!"" Big swaths of my life were completely left out, but it's OK. CNN: Had you worked with the director prior to this film? Brooks: Yeah, he took some beautiful pictures of me and my friend Carl Reiner. Sweet, wonderful pictures. He's just a great photographer. I had heard of him as a director, but I didn't know what he had directed. I saw one thing he had directed and I said, ""That's the guy!"" He did [an ""American Masters""] on Gene Kelly. It was beautiful. It caught the essence of Gene Kelly. CNN: As someone who tells stories for a living, do you have a sense of what your own narrative is? Brooks: I had five aunts and one uncle on my mother's side -- just on my mother's side. Uncle Joe was the only boy. This is crazy, but let me explain. If you were to try to do the story of Uncle Joe the cab driver, and the various celebrities or passengers he picked up, you couldn't do it totally and correctly in an hour and a half. And that's just Uncle Joe, a cab driver. So how are you going to do Mel Brooks? I made a movie in Yugoslavia! Wouldn't that be an hour and a half if I just talked about ""The Twelve Chairs"" and how it came together? CNN: When you look back over your career, does one film stand out as the one you're most proud of? Brooks: The only thing that really stands out is the miracle of the firstborn. That miracle is represented in ""The Producers."" They actually encouraged me and gave me the money to make a movie. And it was born. Of course, it was killed almost in childbirth by The New York Times. Renata Adler, she stuck a half of a scissor in my neck and gave me one of the worst reviews. It was my first movie. But I was lucky. The newspapers were not that kind and I thought I'd have to go back and do television where I'd had success. But then the magazines, about a month later, came out and they saved me. And they saved my confidence in myself. I knew I could make a funny movie. CNN: Do you feel like you were able to take on all the different film styles and genres in your work? Brooks: No, not everything. I haven't covered -- which is a big swath of movies -- a light, romantic movie comedy. Girl-meets-boy type. It was never a primary interest. I was always more interested in history or Broadway. CNN: Is there something you still hope to achieve? Brooks: I like the music in ""Blazing Saddles"" and I think it would make a good musical. It already has two or three musical numbers, so I'm thinking, maybe. If it keeps pestering me maybe I'll write it. You write things out because they bother you and you just want to get rid of that thing in your head. So you create something to get rid of it. CNN: There seems to be an agreement that your work set the stage for modern comedy -- does that feel true? Brooks: I think I'm the father of ""Spamalot"" and ""Book of Mormon"" [on Broadway]. Because for 20 years Broadway was serious. I loved ""Anything Goes,"" which I saw at 9 years old, and I liked ""Guys and Dolls."" I just liked musical comedy and it wasn't around. So when David Geffen bothered me morning, noon and night to make a musical of ""The Producers"" I said, ""No, no, no, no, yes."" And I did it and part of why I did it was my duty to bring back the musical comedy. CNN: Do you have any scripts sitting around that have never actually been made into movies? Brooks: I think maybe two, of all the stuff I've ever written that I never pursued again to get made. They were done very early. Before ""The Producers,"" when I had no reputation, I did a script called ""Marriage Is A Dirty Rotten Fraud."" It's about a guy who gets divorced and the only way out of his big alimony payments is if his ex-wife gets married again. But she hasn't met anybody and it's been going on two years, all he's got left in his life is a grapefruit plant. He has no money. Every penny he makes goes to the alimony. So he decides to make a fictitious character -- he knows what she likes -- and wear a beard and marry her and then disappear in a drowning accident or something and be off the hook. I never got it sold. CNN: When you look back over your work, have you found that there's something universally true of a good joke? Brooks: Yes -- I think its reference has to not be an incident, but a condition. I think a good joke always refers to the human condition, to how our dreams fall apart or how we expect something and it doesn't happen. A good joke translates in human experience. Maybe not necessarily based on a movie or based on anything -- it doesn't have to parody anything. A good joke is a human event.

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday night, TP Mazembe, a Congolese team hailing from the country's second city of Lubumbashi, and New Zealand's Auckland City FC will play a FIFA Club World Cup fifth place play-off in an unseasonably wet and no doubt half-empty stadium in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates. There are arguably few fixtures in international club football that come as obscure as the match up between the surprise champions of Africa and Oceania's amateur representatives. In the hierarchy of the game, the match-up will barely register a second look amongst the sport's elite. But the match holds huge significance, not just in both of the respective countries, but by also performing an invaluable service for world football: giving a much needed leg-up to football's outsiders. The tournament has long been seen as an inconvenience to the fans of the top European teams, thanks to the fact that it falls in the middle of the domestic season. The schedules have been tweaked accordingly: Barcelona will be parachuted in for the semi-finals, needing only two games to win the title. Yet for the poorer teams from far-flung confederations, the Club World Cup offers those on the fringes a chance to shine against some of the world's top clubs and earn prize money that would take decades to earn in their home continents. ""New Zealand qualified for the World Cup, now we've won our first game at the Club World Cup so it has been a great year for New Zealand football,"" said Auckland City FC goalkeeper Jason Spoonley after his team beat Dubai's Al Ahli in their first round match, an amazing feat for a club that doesn't have a single professional player. The victory followed New Zealand's two-leg intercontinental play-off against Bahrain, which saw the All Whites qualify for South Africa 2010. For Spoonley, who was in the All Whites' squad, both that qualification and the Club World Cup victory gives football in New Zealand, a country dominated by rugby, a huge lift back home. More importantly, it gives the players a chance to show off their skills to European scouts. ""This tournament gives us amazing exposure that millions of players would die for. I've just heard a couple of rumors that some of the boys were being looked at by Spanish La Liga clubs,"" he said. But the largest impact comes from the sheer scale of the money involved. For winning the O-League, the Oceania Champions League, Auckland City FC received nothing. The total prize pot in Abu Dhabi, however, is $16.5 million. Even coming last guarantees $500,000, but their heroics against Al Ahli, followed by a tough 3-0 defeat to Mexico's Atlante, means they will now pocket at least $1million, even if they lose to TP Mazembe. ""The money allows us a bit more freedom. It means I can travel for trials abroad which can be expensive,"" explained Spoonley, who splits his time playing for Auckland and studying for a joint honors law and political science degree. ""It is a fantastic relief for amateur clubs."" TP Mazembe have also overcome large obstacles to get to Abu Dhabi. When the team broke North Africa's recent dominance to win the African Champions League this year, it marked the return of Congolese (DR) football to the top of the African game. More than 40 years ago they were considered one of the best teams on the continent reaching four Champions League finals between 1967 and 1970 and winning two of them. But two brutal wars, the second of which took more lives than any conflict since World War Two, an estimated 5.4 million according to a 2008 International Rescue Committee mortality survey, destroyed almost every aspect of civil society and decimated its sporting infrastructure. ""There were many times my life was at risk, it was a difficult time. With the end of the war I am happy that there is now peace,"" said Tresor Mputu, the side's captain who is currently considered one of the best players in Africa following a nomination for the 2009 BBC African Player of the Year and finishing top scorer in the African Champions League in 2007 and 2008. TP Mazembe will benefit handsomely from their appearance in Abu Dhabi, even after narrowly losing to South Korea's Pohang Steelers 2-1. The prize money for winning the African Champions League is $950,000. In comparison a win on Wednesday, which will secure fifth place, will clinch the Congolese side $1.5 million. Yet the attack-minded midfielder sees the team's international success as more than just the pursuit of footballing glory and financial gain. ""Football is a huge factor for development in Africa, in DR Congo especially,"" he said. ""People love football so much, it unifies even in times of war. Winning is so important. To win, win, win all the time can only be a good thing. The greatest feeling was in the [African] Champions League, to be united in the football stadium to see all the fans come to support."" The stadium on Wednesday night might well only contain a smattering of truly die-hard football fans, and few in Europe will care who comes fifth and sixth in a minor footnote on the international football calendar. But for millions of fans in Congo and New Zealand, not to mention those that will aspire to take their places next year, Wednesday night will be anything but an irrelevance. ""It has been the dream of my career to play at the FIFA Club World Cup,"" said Mputu, who has begun to attract the attentions of English Premier League clubs. ""It will be a great moment, a great challenge, but I have the support of all the Congolese people behind me.""","FIFA Club World will see a fifth place play-off between TP Mazembe and Auckland City FC .

"(CNN) -- ""The Searchers"" may be the greatest movie Western, and that reputation has only grown since its 1956 premiere. It boasted three major reasons for its stellar reputation: actor John Wayne, director John Ford and the spectacular location shooting in Monument Valley, Arizona. But perhaps the key ingredient to its success lies in the foundation of all creative endeavors: the story. ""The Searchers"" is a mix of truth and legend, obsession and violence -- played out on the rim of a growing nation. A young white girl is abducted by warring Indians and assimilated into the tribe, while a vengeful uncle launches a years-long quest to find her. Modern directors like Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas have sung the film's praises and borrowed its themes of racial hatred, obsession and redemption. For the first time, this movie -- and the true story of the girl, Cynthia Ann Parker -- is fully chronicled, in Glenn Frankel's new book ""The Searchers: The Making of an American Legend"" (Bloomsbury USA). The author, a former Washington Post foreign correspondent and now director of the University of Texas at Austin's journalism school, brings a reporter's sparkling eye for nuanced detail and context to explore the film's creation. It is a winning account filled with larger-than-life characters: women and men who share the power to endure through personal and creative trial. CNN spoke with Frankel recently about his New York Times best-seller. CNN: This is a chronicle of myths and truths meshed together. Was your goal in writing this book to divide them? Glenn Frankel: As a journalist, we're always trying to separate fact from fiction as best we can, but the farther back in time we go, the more dangerous an exercise that is. I never pretended that I was going to be able to provide a definitive version of the kidnapping of Cynthia Anne Parker in 1836 by Comanches. It was more that I was going to put things into the right perspective. When I started out, I hadn't planned on doing any of that. I was just going to do a making-of-the-movie book. But I quickly found that there was a story that it was loosely based on and that there were all these layers. Once I went there, there was no escape. CNN: The Western is seen as essential to understanding the American identity. Frankel: Novelist and screenwriter Alan LeMay takes that true story and changes the focus in the movie from the kidnapped little girl to the people who were searching for her over the years. (Director) John Ford put a real emphasis on the uncle who searches for her, because he asked John Wayne to play the character. So they deepened and darkened that character. And they go on to make a movie that is really about the impact of the kidnapping and of the violence of the Comanche/Texas wars-- the impact on the pioneer families. By the early 1950s, the Western had become a deeply embedded film genre. It has its own myths -- the themes of the lone gunman, the laconic guy on horseback, the Indian fighter. And John Ford was the ultimate Western myth-maker. Ford gives us both John Wayne in all his charismatic glory and at the same time, undermining this myth all through this movie. He gives us the great hero, and yet the great hero is on this quest that is very dangerous and one that becomes almost homicidal. CNN: Cynthia Ann Parker's story of survival was incredible -- was she a victim of competing cultures? Frankel: Texas history has different ways of thinking about her. She's the Comanche white princess and in a sense they've glorified her, especially in recent history, as this tough Texas woman who is a survivor and comes through the ordeal in high spirits. Painting her as the ultimate victim has its problems, too, because victims aren't very interesting, are they? Cynthia Ann was a victim of the war because she was damaged and traumatized by both sides. First, these Comanches and Kiowa come along in 1836, they murder her father and grandfather in front of her, they haul her off with four other young people. She doesn't know if they're going to kill her, they speak a foreign language. She spends 24 years as a Comanche and then a second traumatic event. This time Texas Rangers and U.S. Cavalry descend on the little camp she's in. They kill the people around her, they haul her off again. She never sees her Comanche husband or her two Comanche sons again. So really she's wrenched, and both sides feel they have a right to do this, they feel that she should be grateful for this in some way. I see her as a symbol of the damage and the violence of this protracted Comanche/Texan war. She left no narrative. When it became clear to her family that she was miserable, she became an embarrassment to them, and they packed her off to a sawmill in East Texas. This onetime celebrity died in obscurity. CNN: The movie was ignored at first to a large extent, then later fully appreciated. What changed? Frankel: It initially got pretty good reviews, but nobody was digging into the layers of this movie, especially with racism and gender. It was before its time. It starts emerging, I'd say, in the 1970s. Scorsese and Spielberg-- it was very formative for them. They quoted from it in many of their own films. It's an enduring film -- it's a beautiful piece of visual storytelling. Yet it's so ambiguous, and it's about such important themes, not just racism and sexism, but also about this conflict between love and hate that's going on in the movie. CNN: You write that what entranced you most were the Comanches. Frankel: They're such a fascinating group. They were up on the limestone plains, it was a real hard life. They were great horsemen, developed an empire, they were raiders and traders. And there were never that many of them, the tribes started kidnapping basically to replenish their population. They treated their enemies with great cruelty at times and yet they treated each other with great love and dignity. Parker's (Indian and white) families are still around, they have annual separate family reunions. CNN: Tell us about John Ford. Frankel: Ford was a tough guy. He was a lifelong alcoholic, but he was a great filmmaker. He managed to get this loyal band of actors and craftsmen around him, people who worked for him time and time again. He could be very abusive to them. At the same time, they would bleed for him. They knew that Ford was special and that the kind of films he was making were enduring. Wayne knew he would be stretched here as an actor. CNN: This is John Wayne's movie. Frankel: I think it's his greatest role. A lot of us have a problem with John Wayne. We have this vision of him as this guy in the 1960s and 1970s who was very right-wing, very pro-Vietnam War, a caricature. But before he was that guy, he was this very supple and interesting character. On the one hand, he's John Wayne -- he's very charismatic and we're rooting for him to succeed on his quest and yet, what is the quest? Our white knight is planning to kill the young damsel. He's very burdened by this mission, but he's driven by vengeance and his brand of justice. CNN: It's a pretty amazing cast of characters. Frankel: In many ways, they're all storytellers, they're all trying to explain themselves through stories and trying to find a safe place in the world. For Cynthia and her Comanche son Quanah, it's trying to survive. For LeMay and Ford, it's about turning this into art. I took great joy in studying these storytellers. It's a great American story they're telling and it's one that's still being told by the families.","Glenn Frankel's new book reveals the true story behind the film ""The Searchers""

"(CNN) -- Eighteen-year-old Kaitlyn Hunt, charged with a crime for having sex with a 14-year-old girl, rejected a deal Friday that would have required her to plead guilty to child abuse, according to Hunt's attorney. Hunt was charged with two felony counts of lewd and lascivious battery after the parents of the 14-year-old went to authorities. Hunt's family says their relationship was consensual, but in Florida a person under the age of 16 is not legally able to give consent to sex. If Hunt is convicted, she could go to prison for 15 years -- a reality that touched off a maelstrom of controversy across the country this past week. The case became widely known when Hunt's family began an online campaign in defense of their daughter. The plea deal from the Indian River County prosecutor's office would have required Hunt to plead no contest to child abuse, spend two years ""on community control,"" which usually involves strict supervision, followed by one year of probation. According to the plea deal document, during her probation, Hunt would have had to agree to stay away from the 14-year-old, and to provide her probation officer with immediate access to her Internet and telephone communication. Read the report, offer . In a statement saying that Hunt was rejecting the plea deal, her attorney, Julia Graves, wrote: . ""This is a situation of two teenagers who happen to be of the same sex involved in a relationship. If this case involved a boy and girl, there would be no media attention to this case. ""Our client is a model citizen. She has been placed in an environment of school with her classmates where they go to school together, have lunch together, and play on the same team and are allowed to have communication and contact without barriers. Then when something develops between the two as a result of this environment created by the state, it leads to criminal prosecution."" ""If this incident occurred 108 days earlier when she was 17, we wouldn't even be here,"" the attorney wrote. The parents of the young girl Friday evening said they are prepared to go forward with the case. His daughter's innocence was taken away, Jim Smith told CNN affiliate WPEC. ""There deserves some type of punishment for that."" The office of State Attorney Bruce Colton said it tendered an ""extremely lenient plea offer in this case which would have ensured that the defendant avoided any term of incarceration and the stigma of being labeled a sex offender. ""In fact, in all probability the defendant would have avoided being a convicted felon,"" the statement continued. Colton will prepare for a mid-July trial. Earlier this week, Hunt cried in front of news crews. ""I'm scared of losing my life, the rest of my life,"" she said, ""not being able to go to college or be around kids, be around my sisters and my family."" In response, Charles Sullivan Jr., the attorney for the 14-year-old girl's family, said they had been hoping the case would be resolved by now. Now the 14-year-old girl may have to take the witness stand if the case goes to court, Sullivan said. ""No parent wants their child to have to testify in court, but unfortunately the reality of our system is we have a system where a defendant has the right to have all the witnesses present. It's just the aspect of our law,"" Sullivan said. ""It's a difficult process but it's a necessary process in our system of justice."" A case catches fire on Facebook . The case has been a lightning rod for controversy after Hunt's family went public on Facebook, describing their daughter's case and essentially accusing the victim's family of going after their daughter because she is gay. The victim's family said that isn't true; they are only trying to protect their 14-year-old. The American Civil Liberties Union has spoken out in defense of Hunt and an online petition by Change.org had attracted some 279,000 signatures by Friday evening. They say the punishment does not equal the crime. Despite the online furor, a case like this isn't all that unusual, said David LaBahn, president of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, a national professional group. ""Prosecutors get these kinds of cases all the time, and it's almost always parents who come to them saying that something like this has happened,"" said LaBahn, who worked as a trial attorney in California for 10 years and focused on prosecuting sex crimes for four years. The amount of difference between the alleged perpetrator's age and the victim's age weighs heavily in whether a prosecutor moves forward on a case, he said. ""If you had an 18- and 17-year-old, there may be some investigation,"" he said. ""If the 17-year-old says it was consensual, that would probably be the end of it and you wouldn't have charges."" But in this case, 18 and 14 is a wide gap, he said. ""According to law in Florida, this is a crime."" It doesn't matter -- and shouldn't matter -- what people in an online community who don't have the investigative details of a case believe, he said. He drew a comparison to the Jodi Arias case currently under way in Arizona. Many people -- even those on the jury -- said they couldn't conceive how a petite woman who claimed she'd been the victim of domestic violence could repeatedly stab her boyfriend, as she admits doing. ""As a prosecutor you cannot be influenced by anything other than the facts,"" he said. While some have suggested this case is being handled differently because it involves two females, Indian River County Sheriff Deryl Loar said that has nothing to do with it. ""If this was an 18-year-old male and that was a 14-year-old girl, it would have been prosecuted the same way,"" he said. Parents of girl, 14, say they are protecting her . At trial, the prosecutor is likely to try to put on witnesses who can show that the 14-year-old was damaged psychologically by engaging in sex at such a young age, and that she wouldn't have normally done such a thing. In an earlier interview with CNN affiliate WPEC, Jim and Laurie Smith insisted that the girls' gender has nothing to do with the case. They are concerned about ages. ""Our daughter was 14, and this girl was 18,"" said Jim Smith. According to the Smiths, they twice warned Hunt to stop. ""I had another adult, who is a mother, she came to me and said, 'Ms. Smith, you need to know this.' She said, 'We told Ms. Hunt to leave your daughter alone but they are in a relationship. And, she's 18.'"" Laurie Smith said she was shocked. Her daughter was just too young, she thought. The 14-year-old began to act out, the Smiths told WPEC. Then one weekend morning the Smiths went to their daughter's bedroom and discovered she was missing. They panicked, thinking someone took their daughter or that she was hurt. ""Her running away was the furthest thing from our mind,"" said Jim Smith. ""We thought ... you hear about kids getting abducted from their homes."" But they later learned that Hunt had picked their daughter up, they told WPEC. ""We had no other alternative but to turn to the law, use it basically as a last resort,"" Jim Smith said. Bloggers have called Laurie Smith a gay basher and accused her of being abusive to her daughter. Numerous news reports have asked whether the Smiths went after the teen because of her sexual orientation. But Smith says her goal is to protect her 14-year-old, and she will not relent. ""I will be an advocate of what she needs,"" the mother told WPEC. ""The stories that people are saying ... I love my daughter. ... I'm willing to do whatever to protect her."" ""This whole story about you blaming Kate for making your daughter gay ... where did that come from?"" a reporter asked the parents. ""I don't know. It didn't come from us. That's not how we feel,"" Jim Smith answered. Still, Hunt's supporters say she is being prosecuted because she was in a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex. A Facebook support page the Hunt family set up called ""Free Kate"" has gathered more than 47,000 names. Not everyone who is posting online might have the facts of the case. A glance at postings on Facebook and Twitter show that some people are getting the ages of the girls wrong. Others have posted erroneously that Hunt is being prosecuted for numerous other charges. Regardless, everyone seems upset about the effect a felony child abuse conviction would have on Hunt, if she agreed to the plea deal. LaBahn told CNN that a felony child abuse conviction would mean that Hunt would have to disclose her felony conviction on employment applications and she could never serve on a jury. She would be prohibited from voting for a period of time, though each state has different time frames for that rule, the attorney said. She may not be able to secure student loans either, he said, and she might not be allowed to adopt or obtain a childcare license. Graves, Hunt's attorney, had earlier asked that the charges be reduced to a misdemeanor. ""This is a life sentence for behavior that is all too common, whether male, female, gay, straight,"" Graves said at a Wednesday news conference. ""High school relationships may be fleeting,"" she said, ""but felony convictions are forever."" CNN's Sara Ganim and Kim Segal contributed to this report.","Prosecutor says plea offer ""extremely lenient""

"(CNN) -- Lately, the scandals just keep on coming about military men's sexual harassment of their female colleagues. The headlines bring up a number of questions (in addition to a rising feeling of nausea) about male sexual predation: Are men biologically, unstoppably, wired for sexual aggression? Or are they only sexually volatile if the culture where they grew up or where they work supports ideas about the sexual domination and objectification of women? OK, we already know a lot about the answer to this question. Yes, there is some biological underpinning for male sexual aggression but also men will have different sexual beliefs and behaviors based on their early models (both family and friends): whether or not they had close relationships with sisters or women friends, and whether they have been exposed to a culture of respect or disdain for women. Men are not helpless slaves to their DNA or their hormones. Your average Dad or boyfriend is not surreptitiously videotaping women in a school shower . On the other hand, a sergeant at West Point (!) has been accused of doing just that, and taken with the variety of sexual offenses that seem to be epidemic in the military, one might reasonably assume that there is a vulnerability in a certain kind of man, in a certain kind of environment, for foul sexual behavior. (Can women be guilty of similar sexual trespass, yes, but it is rare, and not systemic in any institution.) Hagel: Scourge of sexual assault 'must be stamped out' This proclivity for ignoring women's right to choose who sees them naked or who has sex with them is a manifestation of an unhealthy gender culture in the military, but it isn't unique to that institution. Many men still believe that their sexual appetite is irresistible, and that sexual access to women, by any means necessary, is a natural, even inalienable, right of men. Tempt men by putting women in a macho man's club, and what do you expect? I am not too sympathetic with this line of reasoning. If we follow its logic to its natural conclusion, we'll need to cover up women everywhere, institute American purdah and get women out of public life so that men can harness their sexuality and focus on their job. But that isn't going to happen. Then what will it take to end this seemingly endless parade of men who harass and undermine military women? I think we need a serious re-education program for all military men. Most young men will not have reviewed their sexual values or thought about why they feel or act the way they do in sexual situations before they enter the service. But particularly as more women enter combat roles, military men need to learn more about their own sexual psyche and why they may have feelings of aggression, entitlement or expect sexual privileges. I am not so naive that I believe a program or series of programs will change all men into feminists and gentlemen, but it will change many of them into safer colleagues and partners. Those men who can't be respectful need to be dismissed from service. Sex assaults threaten military trust, Obama tells Naval graduates . This isn't an immediate fix. These kinds of programs would have to be instituted for every man at every rank throughout each branch of our military operations. Why? Because let's face it: You can only have so many cases of foxes guarding the hen house until you know that contempt for women's sexual rights is threaded through the leadership as well as the rank and file. Tell me how several men, who were in charge of sexual harassment policy, were implicated in sex harassment? What kind of careful selection process for those jobs would have produced the result of the enforcer becoming the offender? Ultimately the debate over men's true sexual nature is of minimal importance. I don't care if we can prove that men are horny by nature; civic and social life is by definition unnatural. We all have to learn how to work with our desires and operate in ways that respect everyone's integrity and safety. If we change the gender culture in the military by changing men's hearts and minds, their sexual ""nature"" won't be a problem. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pepper Schwartz.","Pepper Schwartz: Many stories of males' sex harassment of female colleagues .

"(CNN) -- It was like any other day. If anything, it might have been a little better than usual -- with more deserved honors for the kids, more jokes and songs, more smiles. Even Mother Nature, after storms the previous day, seemed at first to cooperate as the sun shone brightly. But things changed quickly. And in Oklahoma, where adults and children alike habitually practice what to do if a tornado strikes, change can prove deadly. Things are different, more heartbreaking now for students and staff at Plaza Towers and Briarwood elementary schools in Moore, both of them leveled by a tornado. ""A lot of pain, a lot of tears, very little food and very little sleep is the way you get through it,"" Plaza Towers principal Amy Simpson said Friday. The memories linger. They are not just of the horrible moments when the twister tore through their schools, but the minutes before as teachers did what they could to keep their students safe and in control as it approached, the short time before that as frenzied parents rushed in looking for their sons and daughters, and the hours before that when everything seemed perfect. ""What started off as a normal day at Plaza Towers tuned into a horrible, horrible thing for seven families,"" said Simpson, referring to the seven of her students killed by the storm. Inside a tornado-ravaged school . A frenzied, yet controlled few horrific minutes . Each school week at Plaza Towers starts with ""Rise and Shine."" It's a chance for students to see their teachers and counselors, to sing and recite the school creed, and to honor youngsters' accomplishments inside and outside school. ""During that morning meeting, we celebrate kids,"" the school's principal said. On Monday, the celebrations didn't end there. Simpson recalled then heading to an hour-long award ceremony for first and second graders to toast their many achievements, then to a practice for sixth-graders' commencement exercises. After that, kids started filing into the cafeteria for the first of six lunch sessions the school has. ""Everything in the morning went exactly as it has for the last 170 days,"" Simpson recalled. It was after lunch that teachers first got word to be on alert for severe weather. Still, at that point, no one knew a twister was heading their way. Simpson continued to go about her business, interviewing a candidate for a pre-kindergarten position, when she noticed heavy thunderstorms roll through. A balm after the storm . Simpson ended the interview and noticed parents starting to stream in to pick up their kids. This happens often when it rains heavily, but the principal sensed something abnormal was up as parents rushed in faster and in greater numbers than usual. ""At that point, I made a decision that you didn't have to check out your child the formal way,"" Simpson recalled, saying she stood out front to see who was coming and going. Some parents were noticeably scared. One father, Simpson said, was ""in a panic."" She told him that he had to calm down -- so as not to alarm any students -- before he went through the hallways to retrieve his child. This steady stream lasted 5 or 6 minutes before the sirens went off, indicating a tornado on the ground. Simpson got on the intercom and told everyone to do what they'd practiced in all those drills. Then she walked up and down the hallways. (She couldn't get to where her second and third-graders were, however, as they were in a different building.) Some teachers tracked the twister on mobile devices, until Simpson asked them to turn them off. She did another walk-through and saw her staffers rubbing the backs of their students, some of whom -- with their heads down and hands over their heads -- sang. When the principal got back to the front of the school, the tornado was nearly on top of them. She got on the intercom one more time. ""It's here."" Just doing their jobs? Teachers save lives during tornado . Rising from the rubble . Simpson huddled in a bathroom with four other women. ""The only time I yelled (I said), 'In God's name, go away, go away.' I said it about four times."" Debris was still flying when Simpson pushed out the door, stepped over a sink, and noticed ""the whole neighborhood was gone."" Somehow, her phone rang. It was her mother, and she told her to call 911. There were no more walls left in her school. The bumper of a car sat between the pre-kindergarten and kindergarten students. ""I could see the kids peeking around what used to be a corner,"" Simpson said. Justin Ayres, a fifth-grade teacher who was the first to spot the twister, was the first one out on one side of what had been the school. Men and women, meanwhile, were running foward to help. Within minutes, Simpson recalled, the pre-K, kindergarten and first graders were safely out. Her husband soon arrived and put his hand on her shoulder. ""I said, 'Go help second and third grade,'"" referring to those students who were in a different, nearby building. ""I haven't seen any of them yet."" More and more students emerged, some of them heading to a nearby church. But what had been the second- and third-grade building was precarious, at best. ""I made my way around there, then I begged and pleaded for the human chain to get me up there,"" Simpson said. ""They did. And they were pulling out students and teachers."" All seven killed at Plaza Towers died in that rubble. ""The rest of the evening was a nightmare."" One block, two tornadoes: Life in the crosshairs . 'They grew up really fast' Briarwood Elementary Principal Shelley Jaques-McMillin's first impression of Monday? ""I remember thinking, ""Yeah, it's sunny! So we're going to be able to go outside."" School started, as it always does, with what's called the Grizzly Growl -- a time for singing, dancing, celebrating. ""(I remember) the happy faces, how excited they were, just seeing them smile,"" said Jaques-McMillin. And there was laughter when a special guest -- a sheep -- made a special appearance. Staffers had to give it a kiss, because a group of students had reached their reading goal. Lunchtime that day was especially fun. ""This is what school is about,"" Jaques-McMillin remembered saying at the time. ""This is why we do what we do. They're so happy."" The next few hours went by in a blur -- in some ways, much like at Plaza Towers. There were the students and staff doing what they'd practiced in tornado drills -- the sirens, and more. Jaques-McMillin felt stronger, more resolute this time than when the last EF5 tornado -- the strongest such classification -- came through Moore. When that happened, she was alone and horrified. This time was different. She had a sense of purpose, beyond simply making sure they survived. ""I have 675 students that I promise their parents every single day, I will protect your kids,"" Jaques-McMillin said. ""I'll feed them, they'll be safe, and I'll give them back at the end of the day."" Briarwood Elementary didn't survive the tornado, but everyone who had been inside did. They included 4-year-olds and students set to move onto seventh grade, though they were still kids at heart. Yet on Monday, one of them reached down to a teacher, who was trapped in the rubble with water from a busted pipe blowing in her face. ""He grabbed her hand and said, 'Calm down, I'm going to dig you out."" And he did, just a few days after letting loose during a ""Glow in the Dark"" party. ""Here they were, being silly on Friday night, ... dancing, being sixth-graders,"" Jaques-McMillin said. ""They grew up really fast.""

"(CNN) -- Sweden's capital endured a fourth consecutive night of rioting Wednesday, with fires and clashes with authorities decreasing in the original flashpoint in the northern suburbs but increasing to the south, police said. Rioters continued to set fires to vehicles and other structures in Stockholm and suburbs, and they pelted responding firefighters and police with rocks and other objects, Stockholm police press officer Kjell Lindgren said Thursday. Early media reports said the four days of riots, which started in the high-unemployment, low-income northern suburb of Husby on Sunday, might have been triggered by last week's shooting death of a man by police. But police said Wednesday they were not sure of the cause. Among Wednesday's incidents: Rioters set fire to a restaurant and tried to burn two police stations, Lindgren said. The fires at the police stations were extinguished before the stations were destroyed. ""In the southern parts of our city ... we've seen an increase in violence, and most of our police officers and firemen who were working overnight have said that this has been very difficult, with so many incidents in so many places,"" Lindgren said. He said 10 fires were set in the northern Stockholm area overnight, but he didn't have a number for the southern suburbs. The Local, an English-language online newspaper, reported that Stockholm's fire service had responded to at least 75 incidents throughout the city by 2 a.m. Thursday. Police were so busy escorting firefighters, ""we've only had time to arrest one person"" overnight -- a 16-year-old girl on suspicion of preparing arson, Lindgren said. Eight people were arrested in Husby on Tuesday night, according to police. More than 100 vehicles were set on fire Sunday night just in Husby, police said. Another 29 were set on fire Tuesday night in the wider district, they said. Husby is an area that has a lot of problems and a high crime rate, according to Lindgren. Tensions have been brewing since May 13, when police shot dead a 69-year-old Husby man who had a machete, The Local newspaper said. On Wednesday, Stockholm police spokesman Lars Bystrom told CNN that authorities weren't sure why the riots began. ""We have ... heard the reports that some are making the connection to the 69-year-old man who was shot dead by police this past Monday on May 13 in his apartment after he threatened police with a machete, and the officers attending felt their life was in danger and had to react,"" Bystrom said. ""But we don't know for sure what is actually behind this. At this point, it is pure speculation. ""It would be very unfortunate if we started hesitating to go in when serious incidents happen because of this."" The Local also quoted a local youth leader as saying some police officers used racial slurs against residents Sunday as the trouble flared. Bystrom said Wednesday that police are investigating ""possible use of inappropriate language or excessive use of force."" The disorder led Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt to issue a statement Tuesday appealing for calm. ""We have had two nights of great worry, damage to property and a threatening mood in Husby. There is a risk that it will continue. Now everyone must help out to calm things down,"" he said. ""We have groups of young men who believe one should and can change our society through violence. We cannot let violence govern."" Reinfeldt said the trouble reflects a broader problem in Swedish society: More should be done to support education and help young people into work, he said. CNN's Jason Hanna, Stephanie Halasz and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Police: Rioters set fires, then pelt responding firefighters and police with rocks .

"(CNN) -- ""I do not use crack cocaine, nor am I an addict of crack cocaine."" Those words aren't what might normally be expected from the mayor of Canada's largest city. But little is normal nowadays for Rob Ford. Eight days ago, Gawker and the Toronto Star published stories stating their reporters had seen a cell-phone video showing Ford, as the Star described it, ""inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe."" Later in the video as described by the Star, an ""incoherent"" man both the Star and Gawker claimed to be Ford ranted on a number of subjects, from Liberal leader Justin Trudeau to the high school football team he coached. Except for a brief comment the next day deriding the stories as ""ridiculous,"" the characteristically voluble Toronto mayor has been quiet -- at the advice of his lawyer, he said then, who advised him ""not to say a word."" Until Friday, when he made a statement. In his statement, Ford alluded to the end of his time as a coach for the Don Bosco Eagles high school team, as well as the departure of his mayoral chief of staff Mark Towhey. He didn't elaborate on either relationship. Nor did he admit to any wrongdoing -- saying there was no real proof that he did anything wrong. ""I cannot comment on a video that I have never seen or does not exist,"" Ford said, referring to the 90 seconds of footage that two Star reporters and one Gawker journalist claimed to have seen but that hasn't been aired on TV or posted online. ""It is most unfortunate, very unfortunate, that my colleagues and the great people of this city have been exposed to the fact that I have been judged by the media without any evidence,"" the mayor said. Amid the media firestorm, Ford insisted that he's still hard at work for the people of Toronto, as a conservative leader focused on making the city government more efficient and effective. ""We're continuing to fight for the taxpayers every day and it's business as usual at City Hall,"" he said. His demeanor Friday was markedly different from the man Star reporters described in the video, which the newspaper claimed was shot last winter. In it, the Star journalists wrote that ""an off-camera speaker ... goads the clearly impaired mayor,"" who at one point seems to mutter, ""Everyone expects me to be right-wing."" The newspaper said that the mayor appears to refer to the players on his Don Bosco football team as ""just f---ing minorities."" The video ends, according to the Star, when the cell phone starts to ring. ""That phone better not be on,"" the mayor says, according to the newspaper. Doug Ford, a city councilor, stood behind his brother on Friday -- and lashed out at the news reports. Echoing the mayor, Doug Ford questioned the Star for its ""accusation of a video that does not exist or we haven't seen."" The city councilor had especially harsh words for Gawker, accusing it of dealing ""with a bunch of extortionists"" and unfairly tarnishing Somalis who live in Toronto by claiming Somali drug dealers were behind the video. ""I think it's disgusting,"" Doug Ford said.","NEW: Toronto's deputy mayor blasts the news reports, calling one of them ""disgusting""

"London (CNN) -- Three more people were arrested Saturday in connection with last week's grisly killing of British soldier Lee Rigby, police said. The men were being held on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. Police did not detail how they were allegedly tied to the killing, nor did they release their identities, saying only that the men -- ages 21, 24 and 28 -- were arrested by detectives from the Counter Terrorism Command and taken to a south London police station. Police said a Taser was used on two of the men, who ""did not require hospital treatment."" Police also were carrying out search warrants at four residential addresses associated with the three men, the statement said. The brutal slaying Wednesday of Rigby near the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, a working-class neighborhood in southeast London, shocked people across the United Kingdom. One of the two suspects arrested at the scene approached a man filming the scene in the Woolwich neighborhood and suggested that Rigby had been targeted only ""because Muslims are dying daily"" at the hands of British troops such as him. ""We must fight them as they fight us. An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,"" he said in the video aired by CNN affiliate ITN. Britain's armed forces have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. All its combat troops are due to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014. Another man, 29, who was arrested Thursday on suspicion of conspiracy to murder in connection with the Woolwich investigation was released on bail, police said Saturday. BBC arrest . British counterterrorism police arrested a man who said he was a friend of a suspect in the Woolwich soldier killing, after he gave an interview to the BBC on Friday night, the British broadcaster said. The man, Abu Nusaybah, was arrested on suspected terrorism offenses after telling on air how his friend had been approached by Britain's domestic intelligence service, known as MI5, according to the broadcaster. A BBC staffer, who did not want to be named, told CNN that police were inside the BBC Broadcasting House building in central London waiting for the interview to conclude before they made the arrest. Friends, acquaintances and British media identified 28-year-old Michael Adebolajo, a British national of Nigerian descent, as the suspect seen in a gory video from the scene of the Woolwich killing. Authorities have not identified that individual or the 22-year-old man seized with him at the scene by armed police. Both suspects were shot and remain in hospital. A Scotland Yard spokesman told CNN the arrest at the BBC was not connected to the murder investigation in Woolwich. The attack has sparked concerns that anti-Muslim sentiment may flare up in communities angered by the killing of the soldier, drummer Lee Rigby. Members of a far-right group, the English Defence League, called for Muslims to leave Britain as they rallied in Newcastle, northern England, on Saturday. The protest march came only hours after a group that monitors anti-Muslim abuse told CNN of a big spike in reported incidents in the past two days. 'Changed and withdrawn' In the interview with BBC's ""Newsnight,"" Abu Nusaybah said MI5 had approached Adebolajo in the past year, asking if he wanted to work for them. Adebolajo rejected the approach, according to his friend. Abu Nusaybah said the contact from MI5 occurred last year after Adebolajo returned from a visit to Kenya during which he was detained by security forces. Adebolajo told his friend that he was physically assaulted and sexually threatened during his detention. CNN is working to independently verify the allegations made by Abu Nusaybah about his friend's treatment in detention. Abu Nusaybah went on to say that Adebolajo appeared changed and withdrawn after his return from Kenya. The pair first met in 2002, he said. Abu Nusaybah had converted to Islam in late 2004 and Adebolajo followed suit about four months later, he said. A security source told CNN that ""we would never comment"" on the kind of allegations made in the interview. London's Metropolitan Police Service said a 31-year-old man had been arrested in London on Friday night on terrorism-related offenses, but following standard practice, would not give the arrested man's name. Officers from Counter Terrorism Command arrested the man under the Terrorism Act, on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. He was taken to a south London police station, where he remains in custody, a police statement said. Search warrants were being executed at two homes in east London, police said. Kenya arrest . Kenyan counterterrorism sources told CNN on Saturday that Adebolajo traveled to Kenya in November 2010 and was arrested in the coastal town of Lamu for trying to cross illegally into Somalia. A spokesman for the Kenyan government said Sunday that Adebolajo used the name Michael Olemindis Ndemolajo when he was arrested and taken to a court in Mombasa. Kenyan officials turned him over to British authorities in Kenya when they discovered he was a British citizen, Muthui Kariuki said. ""He was interrogated by British security officials,"" he said. Lamu is part of an area near the Somali border that has been the stage for attacks by armed gangs and suspected operatives from the al Qaeda-linked Al-Shabaab militant group. No charges were filed against Adebolajo, according to the Kenyan media. The British Foreign Office said: ""We can confirm a British national was arrested in Kenya in 2010. (We) provided consular assistance as normal for British nationals."" It's not clear whether Adebolajo may have traveled to the region on more than one occasion. CNN understands that one line of inquiry being examined in the Woolwich terror investigation is that Adebolajo might have attempted -- but failed -- to travel to Somalia some time last year. Al-Muhajiroun connections claimed . A self-proclaimed former radical associate of Abu Nusaybah told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank he had been a follower of the group Al-Muhajiroun, a British group of Islamic extremists virulently opposed to UK intervention in Iraq and openly supportive of al Qaeda. The former associate -- who spoke to CNN on condition of not being named -- spent time with Abu Nusaybah in Al-Muhajiroun study groups in Luton, a town north of London, in the years leading up to the July 7, 2005, attacks on London's transit system, he said. At the time, Adebolajo himself was a follower of the group and attended meetings in London, according to several Al-Muhajiroun insiders, before moving away from the group two or three years ago. ""Abu Nusaybah was very quiet, always smiling, and very religious,"" said his former friend, who has now shed his radical views. He said their circle of friends in Luton included Taimour Abdulwahab al Abdaly, who carried out a suicide bombing in Stockholm in December 2010 in which he was the only fatality. He said Abu Nusaybah had connections to a group of Somali extremists in Luton. It is understood that the two individuals suspected in the knife and cleaver attack were known to Britain's domestic security service. They had featured in previous investigations into other individuals, but were not themselves under surveillance.

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan sacked coach Andrea Stramaccioni Friday and replaced him immediately with Walter Mazzarri. Stramaccioni departs after a dismal season for the famed Nerazzurri, who finished the season a lowly ninth in Serie A and missed out on European competition. By contrast, Mazzari, who has been at Napoli for four seasons, has guided them back into the Champions League and they finished second to champions Juventus in this year's standings. He recently announced he would be leaving at the end of the season and was immediately linked with Inter, who will be appointing their sixth coach since the departure of Jose Mourinho three years ago. Mourinho guided Inter to the Champions League crown before joining Real Madrid but his old charges have been in decline since that triumph. Stramaccioni was the latest to attempt to turn it around at the San Siro, but despite the poor results club president Massimo Moratti had kind words. ""I've chosen Mazzarri, I'm sorry for Stramaccioni,"" he was quoted on the official Inter website. He added ""That takes nothing away from the esteem I hold for Stramaccioni's talent and potential. ""I'm convinced he'll become one of the great Italian coaches but it might also be necessary to save his professional future after a particularly unlucky year, and maybe he needs to find an easier situation than Inter. ""We're coming to a difficult season and I thought we'd need a coach with Mazzarri's experience."" It has left Napoli without a coach, but reports have strongly linked Rafael Benitez with the vacant post after the Spaniard's interim spell at Chelsea ended with a Europa Cup win. Benitez was Mourinho's first successor at Inter Milan, but was unable to repeat his success.","Inter Milan sack coach Andrea Stramaccioni .

"(CNN) -- You might have seen the video last week. I'm talking about Lt. Col. Will Adams, away from his family for nearly two years while he served in Afghanistan, taking off a catcher's mask and surprising his 9-year-old daughter in a well-executed stunt as she threw out the first pitch at a Tampa Bay Rays game. When you watched third-grader Alayna Adams run to embrace the father who'd been away at war for so long, you might even have shed a tear. The reunion was so heartwarming that you could easily forget that this 9-year-old girl had not even been born when President George W. Bush launched the military action in Afghanistan in 2001. Indeed, could anyone have imagined that U.S. troops would still be fighting and dying in that mountainous, isolated country 7,500 miles away a dozen years later? Thank God that Lt. Col. Adams is home safely, but about 63,000 other American troops are still in country, and generals envision as many 8,000 to 12,000 troops still ""over there"" when -- or if -- the U.S. combat role winds down next year. On the same day the Adams family was reunited in South Florida, two American soldiers and four U.S. contractors were among the dead when a bomb struck a military convoy in Kabul. And yet I'd bet that the average American who wept watching the first-pitch video could not give a good answer when asked what fighting men like Adams or his killed comrades are doing in Afghanistan today. It all made sense in 2001, when the rubble of the World Trade Center was still smoldering, for Congress to pass the Authorization for the Use of Military Force act, which gave the White House the OK to wage the war. It seemed wise, certainly, to target Afghanistan, where an unfriendly Taliban government had harbored 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden and allowed his al Qaeda minions to train there. Since then, the Taliban has been ousted, bin Laden has been killed, and al Qaeda shattered, with many of its top lieutenants killed or in American custody. Yet ongoing warfare in a nation beset by violence for decades continues to claim U.S. lives, and it's difficult to see how it improves the safety of citizens here at home. The authorization for military force act has been invoked to justify drone strikes and other types of military action in places that no one could have predicted in 2001: places like Yemen and, increasingly, Africa. President Barack Obama, after earning what seemed to be anti-war bona fides by opposing the 2003 Iraq invasion, has driven this expansion. Some critics are calling the fighting that began in 2001, branded as ""the global war on terror,"" America's ""forever war."" I say some critics because frankly most Americans have stopped paying attention, which the White House and the Pentagon are probably counting on. Just hours before Lt. Col. Adams reconnected with his daughter last week, the assistant secretary of defense for special operations, Michael Sheehan, went before a congressional hearing on the topic of that 2001 war authorization. Yet few if any members of the Senate Armed Services Committee seemed eager to end the authorization act after 12 years; instead, senators such as Arizona's John McCain -- increasingly the pied piper of American military intervention -- spoke of expanding the measure, to make sure that new terrorist groups that formed after 2001 could be legally targeted by U.S. weapons. What Sheehan told the senators must have sounded like a Hallmark Channel ad for the romance of ""the forever war."" The Pentagon official told Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, that the war against terrorism ""is going to go on for quite a while, and, yes, beyond the second term of the president,"" adding a second later, ""at least 10 to 20 years."" That's mind-numbing. The Pentagon believes that we could still be fighting the conflict that began on 9/11 in the year 2033. It's hard to even find the right analogy. Imagine if U.S. involvement in World War II that began at Pearl Harbor was still taking place in 1973, a long strange trip from the Andrews Sisters to Led Zeppelin. I'm the parent of a 20-year-old -- will I be telling my grandson someday not to worry, that the war should be over before he hits draft age? The ""forever war"" might be defensible is it were making you, me and all other Americans safer. The cold reality is that the effect has been the opposite, that the increasing length and scope of the war puts us at greater risk. The trillions of dollars in debt to pay for the war has left us in deeper hock to China and other foreign creditors. At home, or ""the homeland"" as it came to be called, the war has been used to justify a flurry of civil rights abuses, including warrantless wiretaps and monitoring of e-mails, harassing whistle-blowers and clamping down on press freedom. Since 9/11, the all-too-human desire to avenge the attacks has trumped common sense. The ultimate goal, after all, is to stop any further attacks on Americans. But too many actions such as the abuses of waterboarding, and lack of trials for prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, and the flurry of drone strikes that have killed innocent civilians along with terrorists, have provoked rising anti-Americanism and possibly motivated newer attackers. In other words, revoking the 2001 war authorization would save money and lives. It should be a no-brainer, but for some hard-to-explain reason it requires a courage that can't be found in either the White House or the halls of Congress. Yes, it was joyous to watch a 9-year-old girl welcome her father home from Afghanistan. But the notion that her elementary school pals could someday fight in the same war should blow the American mind. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Will Bunch.","Will Bunch: Reunions of troops with families great, but why are we still in Afghanistan?
Bunch: It made sense in 2001, but 12 years later, bin Laden is dead and al Qaeda in ruins .

"(CNN) -- Richard III's burial was hardly fit for a king. The awkward position of the English monarch's body, and the inferior quality of his grave, suggests medieval gravediggers placed him there in a hurry or didn't care much for him, according to researchers. Or perhaps both. British archaeologists, in the first academic paper since the discovery of his skeleton under a parking lot, said Richard's body was buried in Leicester, central England, ""with minimal reverence."" The king, 32, was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. It was the last fight in the War of the Roses, which ended with the ascension of Henry VII and the Tudors. Richard's naked body was returned to Leicester for public display before he was interred three days after death. His torso was lowered into a too-short grave, leaving it in an ""odd position"" that left the head partially propped up against the grave side. ""Only a little extra effort by the gravediggers to tidy the grave ends would have made this grave long enough to receive the body conventionally,"" the University of Leicester researchers wrote in an article published Friday in the journal Antiquity. ""That they did not, instead placing the body on one side of the grave, its torso crammed against the northern side, may suggest haste or little respect for the deceased."" They suggested one possible factor. ""The haste may partially be explained by the fact that Richard's damaged body had already been on public display for several days in the height of summer, and was thus in poor condition."" Richard was discovered buried among the remains of what was once the city's Grey Friars friary. Other graves were of correct length and neat rectangular with vertical sides, according to researchers. ""This grave was an untidy lozenge shape with a concave base and sloping sides, leaving the bottom of the grave much smaller than its extent at ground level,"" researchers wrote. There was no evidence of a shroud or coffin. In February, scientists announced that they were convinced ""beyond reasonable doubt"" that the skeleton belonged to Richard. Mitochondrial DNA extracted from the bones was matched to Michael Ibsen, a Canadian cabinetmaker and direct descendant of Richard III's sister, Anne of York, and a second distant relative, who wished to remain anonymous. Experts say other evidence -- including battle wounds and signs of scoliosis, or curvature of the spine -- found during the search and the more than four months of tests since strongly supported the DNA findings. Richard III met a very violent death . Some of findings have been publicized before. The king's feet had been lost at some point in the intervening five centuries, but the rest of the bones were in good condition, which archaeologists and historians say was incredibly lucky, given how close later building work came to them -- brick foundations ran alongside part of the trench, within inches of the body. Archaeologists said their examination of the skeleton shows Richard met a violent death: They found evidence of 10 wounds -- eight to the head and two to the body -- which they believe were inflicted at or around the time of death. Wounds to the face and two other cuts to the body may be ""humiliation injuries"" delivered after death, scientists said. The skeleton also showed marks that could have come from period-appropriate weapons. In particular, a large wound at the base of his skull seemed likely to have been made by a blade like a halberd. Other wounds seemed similar to those inflicted by daggers and knives of the time. Richard's hands also may have been bound. More recent analysis of the remains, using radiocarbon dating, indicates a high-protein diet, heavy on seafood, indicating a high status in society. After centuries of demolition and rebuilding work, the exact location of Richard's grave had been lost to history, and there were even reports that the defeated monarch's body had been dug up and thrown into a nearby river. ""The skull was in good condition, although fragile, and was able to give us detailed information,"" bioarchaeologist Jo Appleby, who led the exhumation of the remains in 2012, said earlier this year. Clues coaxed from the skeleton may shed ""a new light"" on the physical description of Richard III as a humpbacked man with a ""withered arm,"" which was used to support history's evil image of him, Professor Lin Foxhall, head of the University of Leicester's School of Archaeology and Ancient History, said then. One immediate discovery was that the skeleton does not have a ""withered arm"" as depicted by Shakespeare, researchers said. While not humpbacked, Richard III did suffer from the ""severe scoliosis"" that appeared to start around the time of puberty, they said. The king will finally get respect next year. His remains will be reburied in Leicester Cathedral, close to the site of his original grave. CNN's Bryony Jones, Alan Duke and Alden Mahler Levine contributed to this report.","Researchers update their research on Richard III .

"(CNN) -- According to a leading senator, it presented ""an intolerable risk"" to national security. According to a consortium of retired generals, it would ""break"" the U.S. military. And according to a leading advocacy group, over ""528,000"" servicemen and women would be lost. Something this terrible must be averted. We must take action now! Except it is too late. The scary danger that these generals, John McCain, and the Family Research Council were warning about wasn't a future terrorist attack or war with China, it was allowing gay and lesbian service men and women to openly serve in the U.S. military. That ""grave risk"" is now celebrating its one year anniversary, and none of the dire predictions proved correct. News: One year later, no overall negative impact on military after repeal of DADT . ""Don't ask, don't tell"" was one of the most controversial issues in American politics, with tens of thousands of articles and speeches on the topic. And yet, once it happened, it played out a lot like Y2K. There was a huge amount of hype and hysteria, but the world did not end. Far from the U.S. military being broken by allowing gays to serve openly, a recent report by a group of U.S. military school professors writing for the Palm Center found, ""The repeal of DADT has had no overall negative impact on military readiness or its component dimensions, including cohesion, recruitment, retention, assaults, harassment or morale."" The U.S. military today has the same level of readiness as it did in 2011. It didn't have over half a million servicemen exit in protest, as these opponents claimed would happen. In fact, only two service members resigned, neither of them combat troops. Recruitment is just as high now as then. And when the CIA recently did an assessment of the risks to American national security, they found dangers that ranged from loose nukes to terrorism. Gays and lesbians in uniform didn't make it into the threat matrix. Politics: The grades are in -- Obama's first-term report card . Those who predicted doom ignored that the military of today is staffed by young, millennial men and women who do not share the anti-gay sentiments of previous generations. They ignored empirical research, drawn from over half a century of evidence gathered by independent researchers and the U.S. military itself. They ignored the experiences of allied militaries in places like the UK, Australia, and Israel, all of which found that open service would not be destructive. They ignored that planning and leadership are the keys to successful policy change, and that the U.S. military excels at both. Simply put, their predictions of peril were endemic of the ""post-truth"" practice so common in politics today: hype and hysteria as a poor substitute for facts and substance. That DADT's end has been a relative non-story is the best evidence of how the transition to allowing open service has been an unmitigated success by all measures. But the experience of the last year is still instructive to keep in mind. The journey does not end here. Only one year in, the policy could easily be overturned or mismanaged into something less successful. Indeed, there are still some who appear interested in returning to the past and forcing troops back into the closet. The 2012 Republican National Convention platform called for a ""review"" of such policies, while Mitt Romney has sent mixed signals on his personal position. When running for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts, he supported ""gays and lesbians being able to serve openly and honestly in our nation's military,"" but when running for president he argued that the policy should not have been changed to allow it ""until conflict was over."" It is also useful to keep the experience on ""don't ask, don't tell"" in mind, when the same tactics are used in other debates. Indeed, many of the very same people are at it once more on topics that range from the role of women in the military to budget cuts. These too are again ""the most destructive thing in the world"" and would ""destroy the military."" If we are ever going to push past the poisonous political climate of today, we have to start turning to the facts to build our positions, and when we genuinely disagree in our opinions, stop painting the other as hell bent only on total destruction and treason. News: Army general is military's first openly gay flag officer . Perhaps that is the biggest lesson of looking back on the differences between the hype back then of ending DADT and the reality today. Our political leaders can continue to speak the language of the extreme. Or, they can just show a little bit of faith in the resilience and maturity of both the American military and the people they represent. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter W. Singer and Aaron Belkin.","Peter Singer, Aaron Belkin: The big ""scare"" over DADT repeal a year ago was unfounded .

"(CNN) -- The past 24 hours have left the city of London stunned. A brazen attack on a serving soldier in the British army, brutally hacked to death in broad daylight in the southeast district of Woolwich, has sparked fear, anger and a search for answers -- but also moving tributes to the man who died. Many Britons, including soldiers, used photo-sharing service Instagram to post picture tributes in the hours following the attack. Shock at the incident moved user Ali Martin to create her own impromptu memorial -- a candle with a remembrance poppy, worn by many in the UK during Remembrance Sunday in November, when those killed in war are honored. ""I live very close to where this happened and wanted to light a candle in remembrance for the soldier,"" she said. ""It will stay alight all day."" British PM condemns brutal attack on soldier in London . A particularly popular tribute was of armbands emblazoned with the name of the charity Help for Heroes, a British armed forces organization that supports wounded soldiers. The British soldier was reportedly wearing a T-shirt with the organization's logo when he was attacked. Chelsey Hampson-Carroll showed off her Help for Heroes armband, along with her army camouflage jacket. ""I wanted to show my support,"" she said. ""I am a British soldier myself (and) I wear my wrist band with pride."" Instagram user Jordan Rees posted an image of himself wearing the band both in sympathy and in protest against such attacks. ""In light of (these) events I think it's especially important that we show sympathy for those directly affected, solidarity with military personnel, and also resilience in the face of a political ideology that would like to see our society and way of life destroyed,"" he said. Meanwhile in Woolwich itself, resident Felix Rios captured a poignant image of a black flower placed at Woolwich Arsenal train station Thursday morning. ""People on the streets of Woolwich are quiet,"" he observed. ""You could feel in the air that something horrible had happened, just no-one talks openly about it.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission released Tuesday about 3,000 pages of transcripts of conversations recorded in its operations center after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, conversations that underscore the difficulty the agency had in responding to the nuclear crisis that was unfolding halfway around the world. ""I want to be clear, the early hours of the first day or two were very hectic,"" NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko told reporters Tuesday. ""There was not a lot of information. Much of what we knew came from a variety of sources -- some from the Japanese, some from the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) and a great deal from the news media."" The transcripts, released in response to Freedom of Information Act requests, show agency officials struggling to get information about the disaster and trying to ascertain its potential impact on U.S. citizens in Japan, on potential fallout victims in the United States, and on operators of U.S. nuclear reactors of similar design. An agency spokesman said the ""basic facts"" of the disaster are already known, but the trove of information provides an inside look at the inner workings of a government agency at a key moment in history. ""I don't know if there were recordings at Three Mile Island,"" NRC spokesman Eliot Brenner said, referring to the 1979 meltdown at a Pennsylvania nuclear power plant. ""This is a way for us to give the American public a look -- a firsthand look -- at what we do in a time of crisis."" The transcripts are of conversations and phone calls at the NRC's operations center in Rockville, Maryland. Jaczko acknowledged the transcripts show the confusion within the agency during the early days of the crisis triggered by the massive earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011, but said he believes they reflect well on the agency.

""What we're making public today is in effect a very important historical record, and I'm tremendously proud of the important work here by the staff of the NRC.""

Officials also said that previous exercises in the command center had not fully prepared them for what turned out to be a months-long event that required teams of people working round-the-clock for months. They said they didn't communicate as fully as they should have with state officials, who were seeking information about the potential for fallout and the safety of their own nuclear plants.

"(CNN) -- From fighting cancer and sparking revolutions to digitally transferring cash and bringing people together, mobile phones are increasingly being used in pioneering ways across Africa, helping to save lives and transform the continent. And the omnipresent devices are also on the front line in the fight against sexual harassment. In Egypt, where verbal harassment, groping, stalking and indecent exposure are a common problem for women, an innovative tool has emerged to empower victims. Called HarassMap, the volunteer-based initiative is aiming to stop the social acceptability of sexual harassment in the North African country. It uses online and offline technology to invite women to speak out and also mobilize communities to stand up to harassers. How it works . HarassMap uses a simple SMS-based system to enable victims and witnesses to anonymously report sexual harassment incidents as soon as they happen. ""You dial 6069 and then you type what happened and where,"" explains Rebecca Chiao, who co-founded HarassMap at the end of 2010. ""Then you send and then in a minute or so you should get an auto-response."" Read: Innovation to save lives in Africa . The group then verifies the incoming reports and places them on a Google map of Egypt, creating a web-based documentation of the extent of the problem. When sexual harassment hotspots are identified, HarrassMap volunteers visit these areas as part of a community outreach program aimed at raising awareness and ending tolerance of these kinds of incidents. ""We are trying to change the social attitude and make it completely unacceptable,"" says Chiao, an American who moved to Egypt in 2004 to work for an NGO. She adds: ""We have teams of volunteers that go out once per month in their own neighborhoods and talk to their own neighbors in groups. ""They ask people who have a presence in the street -- shop owners, police, the guys that park the car, the doormen, the people who are hanging out in the street all the time -- and ask them to be watchful guardians of their neighborhoods. ""They ask them to watch out for sexual harassment and not ignore it and to speak against the harassers when they see it happen."" Chiao says the community outreach program has already had a big impact. ""About eight out of every 10 people they talk to in the street agree by the end of the conversation,"" she explains. ""At the beginning everyone disagrees but by the time the conversation is over most people are not just agreeing but they are enthusiastic and want to take action."" 'Do you like sex with me?' On the HarrassMap website, victims' reports give a disturbing insight into sexual harassment on the streets of Egypt. ""On friday this week i went to a burger stand on sharia mansouriya near al aded street in Darassa and was asked where i was from. after i said i was from canada he said ""canada helwa"" and grabbed my hand towards his and said 'do you like sex with me'? this was at 12pm,"" reads one report posted on December 7. Another one, from November 29, says: ""I was getting off the train from Cairo to Alexandria in Sidi Gaber train station. The train porter groped me three times while I was trying to get off the train with my suitcase. I challenged him the first time, and he pretended it was an accident, and then he did it two more times."" The issue of sexual harassment in Egypt grabbed international headlines in 2011 when CBS reporter Lara Logan was attacked in Cairo's Tahrir Square after former president Hosni Mubarak stepped down. Other women reported incidents ranging from mild harassment to violent attacks. According to a 2008 survey of 1,010 women conducted by the Egyptian Center for Women's Rights, 98% of foreign women in the country and 83% of Egyptian women said they had been sexually harassed. Chiao, however, says that more studies are needed to get a better insight into the problem. ""We can't say today how bad the problem really is and that's one of the things that we're trying to do with HarassMap,"" she says. The power of mobile . In Egypt, total mobile subscriptions have jumped from nearly 13 million in 2005 to over 80 million last year, according to a recent World Bank study. In the whole of Africa, there were nearly 650 million mobile subscriptions in early 2012, more than in the United States or the European Union, making the continent the second fastest growing region in the world, after South Asia. It is this explosive growth in mobile usage that initiatives like HarassMap are tapping into in order to change behaviors. Chiao, who set up the group after experiencing sexual harassment herself in Egypt, says that HarassMap is also using mobile technology to provide victims with details of how to access free support services. ""A lot of the women's NGOs in Egypt offer services like free legal help, how to make a police report, psychological counseling, self-defense classes,"" explains Chiao. ""So we took this opportunity to send an outgoing message to everyone who sends a report, telling them how to access these services.""","HarassMap aims to end the social acceptability of sexual harassment in Egypt .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Three managers at a Bangladeshi clothing factory were arrested and accused of locking a main gate of the facility hampering people trying to flee a weekend inferno that killed more than 100 workers, police said. The arrest of the mid-level managers did not stop the continued protests of thousands in the capital city Dhaka Wednesday, as many mourned and called for a full investigation into what happened. Read more: Factory deaths highlight flaws in global supply chain . The clothing factory, housed in a multistory building near Dhaka, caught fire Saturday night. More than 100 people were killed and at least 200 were injured as they rushed to escape the factory in Ashulia, police said. ""How the factory caught fire, I don't know. But when we heard 'fire,' we all rushed out and we were trying to get out of the factory,"" said Parul Begum, a survivor. ""One factory worker broke a window and one of the workers pulled me through. After the fire, we tried to run out the door, but it was locked. When the floor (became) dark with smoke, the boys came to rescue me,"" she said. The blaze is part of a rash of arsons, the country's prime minister said earlier this week. The Saturday fire as well another factory blaze Monday were ""planned arson,"" Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Monday. Also two people were arrested Monday trying to set fire to an apparel factory on the outskirts of Dhaka, but local police said they had not yet found any links between the arrests and the other factory fires. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. put some distance between it and the clothing factory, saying the factory was no longer authorized to produce merchandise for the company. ""A supplier subcontracted work to this factory without authorization and in direct violation of our policies.

"(CNN) -- North Korea reacted with indignation to a United Nations decision to investigate allegations of human rights abuses inside the isolated state, claiming it has one of the best systems worldwide for protecting citizens' rights. The United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva said delegates agreed Thursday to set up a commission of inquiry to examine what it called ""grave, widespread and systematic"" violations of human rights in North Korea. The decision followed a recent report submitted to the council by an independent expert alleging North Korea had committed a range of abuses, including torture, enslavement, enforced disappearances and murder. Many of the alleged acts ""may amount to crimes against humanity,"" according to the report's author, Marzuki Darusman, an Indonesian lawyer. The council's decision to take action on his report comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula following the North's latest underground nuclear test last month that prompted tougher U.N. sanctions on the regime of Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang has ramped up its rhetoric, issuing threats to Washington and Seoul on a near daily basis. Annual joint military exercises by U.S. and South Korean forces this month have fueled the North's ire. Unsurprisingly, the North Korean representative at the U.N. Human Rights Council, So Se Pyong, had strong words Thursday about the move to establish the commission of inquiry. North Korean video shows imagined attack on Washington . The draft resolution on the matter, adopted by the council without a vote, ""is no more than an instrument that serves the political purposes of the hostile forces in their attempt to discredit the image of the DPRK,"" So said, using the shortened form of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He warned of ""serious consequences"" if the council went ahead with the inquiry. North Korean citizens are ""happy with pride and honor that they have one of the best systems for promotion and protection of human rights in the world,"" So told the council, according to the U.N. Reports of suffering . His assertions run counter to the accounts of many North Koreans who have fled the country telling of horrific conditions. Humanitarian workers and others who have visited the reclusive state have also described a suffering population. Officials from other countries at the U.N. council disagreed with the North's version of reality. ""For too long, the population of the country has been subjected to widespread and systematic human rights violations and abuses,"" said Gerard Corr, the Irish representative speaking on behalf of the European Union. Human rights groups estimate that as many as 200,000 people are being held in a network of prison camps in North Korea that the regime is believed to use to crush political dissent. In his report to the U.N. council, Darusman identified nine patterns of rights violations in North Korea, such as depriving people of food, arbitrary detentions and heavy restrictions on freedom of expression. Under the issue of enforced disappearances, he also included the abductions of foreign citizens. A leading human rights group called the decision to set up the commission ""a landmark step."" ""This long awaited inquiry will help expose decades of abuse by the North Korean government,"" said Julie de Rivero, advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. ""The establishment of this commission sends a strong message to Pyongyang that the world is watching and its abuses must end,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- The anti-shark's fin campaign is crusading on in Asia Pacific. Air New Zealand has become the latest airline to stop flying shipments of shark's fin to Hong Kong, the shark's fin capital of the world. The decision came about after the New Zealand Shark Alliance revealed the airline's shipments in local media. ""Air New Zealand has taken the decision to suspend the carriage of shark fins while we undertake a review of the issue,"" Air New Zealand spokesperson Andrew Aitken told CNN. ""We have no further comment to make while this review is underway."" The topic is a particularly sensitive environmental issue in Hong Kong, the world's biggest market for shark's fin, as campaigns highlighting the cruelty and devastation stemming from the practice are becoming more and more successful. Prominent hotels and restaurants in the city have been publicly striking shark's fin from their menus, while Hong Kong's main carrier Cathay Pacific also announced a ban on shark's fin cargo last September. ""Due to the vulnerable nature of sharks, their rapidly declining population, and the impacts of overfishing for their parts and products, our carriage of these is inconsistent with our commitment to sustainable development,"" said Cathay Pacific's statement at the time. The Peninsula Hotels Group bans shark's fin from menus . Approximately 72 million sharks are killed each year and 10,000 tons of fins are traded through Hong Kong. Conservation groups say there is still far to go in terms of education and awareness. ""We were delighted to hear that Air New Zealand is following suit of the Cathay Pacific announcement,"" Hong Kong Shark Foundation director Claire Garner told CNN. ""Airlines need to know what they're carrying and how they are impacting environmental sustainability."" ""It can be quite tricky in terms of monitoring and managing shipping as shark's fin is transported in a dried form and the packaging can be made to look like other kinds of dried seafood,"" said Doug Woodring of the Ocean Recovery Alliance in Hong Kong. ""Decisions [like Air New Zealand's] can have a big impact on reducing consumption in Hong Kong."" Fiji-based Air Pacific was another airline that came under fire from environmental groups for carrying shark's fin cargo earlier this month. A report in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post said the airline had run a contest for Hong Kong weddings that didn't feature shark's fin in the menu (a popular wedding banquet menu item) and offered honeymoon flights to Fiji as the prize. Air Pacific and New Zealand Shark Alliance were not available for immediate comment. Shark finning thrives on Hong Kong rooftops .

"(CNN) -- Train the brain. Until recently, this phrase made me picture Neo from ""The Matrix"" proclaiming ""I know kung fu"" after he had martial arts abilities uploaded into his brain. But what if we really could harness technology, Neo-style, to help train our brains to better cope with everyday stress? For many of us, the days seem to pass in one anxiety-ridden blur after another. Mental health professional increasingly agree that these daily sprints, accompanied by a soundtrack of endless beeps, chirps and vibrations emitting from various devices, set off our stress systems, keeping us in a persistent and physiologically damaging state of fight-or-flight. ""The way we live our lives now is like running marathons,"" said Dr. Leslie Sherlin, a neuroscientist and chief science officer of Neurotopia, a company that provides brain training to athletes. ""And in some ways, that's great, but you can't run marathons all the time."" Keep that pace, says Sherlin, and at some point, you will burn out. You may also suffer from a weakened immune system that can lead to an increased risk of disease. Most of us have received some kind of formal instruction about diet, exercise, the birds and the bees. So why aren't we training our brains to better manage stress? Some of the most compelling training to help prepare people to better handle stress is going on right now with athletes and soldiers. For these two distinct groups, performance under high stress is a must (albeit for very different reasons). But the technologies being used to train them could benefit the rest of us as well. Technology could help us reduce stress, too . Training athletes for the field . I became interested in the way athletes train for peak performance in high-stakes environments last year, when I interviewed Michael Gervais, a sports psychologist who works with Sherlin to train elite athletes to perform optimally during high-stress competition. Gervais and Sherlin work with athletes from the NFL, NBA and NHL as well as Olympians, golfers and many others. What Gervais told me then was that the key to high performance was a disciplined mind. While not exactly news, the methods Gervais and his colleagues use to teach mental discipline were quite interesting. They were using older Eastern disciplines like mindfulness, presence, meditation, deep breathing and neurofeedback. As part of their training, Gervais and his colleagues hook up athletes to electrodes and perform a baseline qEEG: a quantitative electroencephalogram. They use the results to create an individualized brain map. The map helps these sports psychologists assess and quantify mental aspects of performance like focus, decision speed, reaction time and stress regulation. Once the brain is mapped, the psychologists conduct half-hour neurofeedback sessions to teach athletes how to reach optimal brain wave patterns. In a typical session, the athlete will sit before a large screen as sensors monitoring electrical activity in his or her brain are placed on the scalp. The athlete then focuses on achieving desirable brain wave patterns that, in turn, influence what happens on the screen. It's bit like controlling a video game with only your thoughts. The version I saw involved cars racing through a desert. The training is meant to teach athletes how to respond quickly to stressor stimuli, how to focus during stressful situations, how to recover from errors and finally how to shut down and still their minds when it's all over. These sports psychologists have collected a proprietary brain bank of assessments over years of working with elite athletes. They use the brain bank to identify optimal brainwave patterns associated with the highest levels of performance. According to Sherlin, it takes roughly 15 to 20 neurofeedback sessions for elite athletes to learn some of these techniques. (Probably about 30 for you and me, he says.) Your questions about stress, answered! Originally developed as a technique to measure brain activity in NASA pilots during flight simulation exercises, neurofeedback has shown promising initial results for helping retrain the brainwaves of children with ADHD and autism and people suffering from chronic migraines. In one study, student eye surgeons were trained to significantly improve their surgical skills by regulating their own brainwave activity. The method is being examined in a diverse number of other contexts, including to help relieve symptoms of chemotherapy-induced nerve damage. Controlled, randomized trials will help validate these promising starts. The kind of training that the athletes working with Gervais and Sherlin receive is not available to most of us right now, but it may be in our near future. A few weeks ago, Sherlin's company, Neurotopia, began beta-testing a dry (no goo in your hair) sensor, mobile headphone and tablet system that purports to do the same kind of assessment and training as the older model. At least in theory, this might make the product accessible to the rest of us. Training soldiers for the battlefield . A conversation with Dr. Albert ""Skip"" Rizzo, psychologist and research professor at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, is like a lesson in applied science fiction, with your mind reeling from ""Star Trek"" to the original ""Total Recall."" Except Rizzo's jaw-dropping efforts are not fiction, nor are they ""on the horizon."" They are here, now. In a collaboration between the military, Hollywood and USC's Institute for Creative Technologies, where he serves as the associate director for medical virtual reality, Rizzo and his colleagues have developed cutting-edge gaming and virtual reality technologies to serve the clinical needs of soldiers. One project, Stress Resilience in Virtual Environments (STRIVE), helps train service members to have better resilience and emotional coping skills in realistic virtual-reality combat scenarios before they are exposed to the real stresses of combat. A second project, called Virtual Iraq (there is also a Virtual Afghanistan), helps soldiers returning from combat work through their trauma by donning a helmet geared with video goggles, earphones and a scent machine, and revisiting the scene in a virtual reality setting, complete with sound and smell. Both STRIVE and Virtual Iraq (and Afghanistan) are based on exposure therapy, which has been effective in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. The problem with PTSD is that the person often avoids anything that reminds them of the trauma, and this avoidance begins to generalize to everyday things, says Rizzo. ""It's a snowball cascade effect. The things that evoke the fear and anxiety are no longer directly tied to the original trauma but generalized to the outside world. You see people with PTSD who will no longer leave their house, and if they do, they're a nervous wreck."" The idea, says Rizzo, is to re-create the stressful environment in a doctor's office, to help the patients confront and challenge the trauma and to give them the tools to better cope emotionally with what happened. Both of these technologies require specialists and a clinical setting, but SimCoach, a ""virtual human"" designed for interactive use on the Internet, does not. Though at this point, SimCoach is targeted toward active-duty military personnel, veterans and their families, it may also have wider utility for everyday stress and anxiety. SimCoach users can select one of several avatars to talk to when they are feeling stressed out. The virtual human coaches can serve as an ""online companion for anyone who may be too introverted to seek help, someone who may not want to reach out to a clinician or who may feel stigma about seeing a therapist,"" said John Hart, program manager at the Institute for Creative Technologies. ""SimCoach is not a doc-in-the-box, and it's not going to make a diagnosis,"" Hart observed. Nor is it meant to replace human interaction. What SimCoach does do is help those suffering from stress and anxiety symptoms begin the conversation about what they may be going through. It may also provide users with more information about what they may be experiencing, suggest local facilities where they can go for care and perhaps even walk them through breathing exercises or stress reduction techniques. Hart summed up what I find most compelling about SimCoach: ""Here we are, sitting on a mountain of valuable information about what to do when you're stressed or feeling depressed. You can see how SimCoach can help people access the right information when they need it."" Imagine the possibilities! An interactive virtual-reality source for information on stress, anxiety and PTSD -- the precursor, perhaps, to a real-life version of ""Star Trek's"" Emergency Medical Hologram Doctor. Home sweet home . I recently attended a conference in Portugal. As I made my way through customs at Philadelphia International, a customs agent asked me what I did for a living. ""I write,"" I said, ""mostly about stress."" He stared me down for few moments before saying in a low, gruff tone: ""If you really want to understand stress, then you need to spend a day with us here."" And here's the thing: Regardless of what we do, most of us are feeling that same way about our runaway lives. The genie is out of the bottle, and there is little likelihood of us ever going back to a simpler time (if there ever was such a thing). So, yes, let's discuss technology addiction, always being ""on,"" tech fasting and the need to design devices and apps for greater serenity. But let's also consider how to harness some of these technologies to help us move easier in this new world, Neo-style. Is personalized medicine a myth?","Experts are mapping elite athletes' brains to determine optimal brain wave patterns .

"(CNN) -- So now the world knows that Buzz Bissinger likes to shop. Really likes it. In a detailed essay in GQ magazine, the famous writer confessed to spending more than $600,000 in the past two years. ""Is this for real?"" -- you may wonder. Could a man be so into clothing he would shell out that much money to worship at the temple of Gucci? Believe it or not, shopping can be an addiction. Upwards of 6% of the U.S. adult population shops compulsively, and most are women. It tends to start early in the teen years or early 20s, and it can rapidly become chronic. For some people, shopping is a major leisure activity. For others, it can be like nicotine, alcohol or other drugs. In other words, those addicted to shopping find it difficult or even impossible to quit. These are the compulsive shoppers whose lives are organized around a variety of shopping experiences. Buzz may or may not fit the bill, but he acknowledges his shopping is a problem: ""It isn't drugs or gambling ... but there are similarities."" Most compulsive shoppers are ordinary people, although the problem has been noted among the rich and powerful for hundreds of years. Famous examples include: . -- Marie Antoinette, during the turbulent time before the French Revolution, was known for her extravagances. -- Mary Todd Lincoln had spending binges that greatly distressed her husband. -- Publisher and magnate William Randolph Hearst had an insatiable appetite for art and antiques that nearly drove him to bankruptcy during the Great Depression in the 1930s. -- Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, known for her personal charm and great fashion sense, was an obsessive shopper whose uncontrolled behavior dismayed both of her husbands. Some might assume compulsive shopping is relatively recent -- perhaps a product of Madison Avenue. But the disorder has always been around, manifesting itself in various forms. It is also found worldwide, except perhaps among the world's poor. It is a clinical disorder? Compulsive shopping was described over a century ago by German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin. Even today, his description remains fresh. Apart from the dated language, it could have been written yesterday. Its hallmark is excessive shopping and spending behavior that leads to a sense of personal distress. It often impairs a person's life in some way (finances, marriage, family). Compulsive shoppers have reported experiencing a sense of tension or anxiety before buying and feeling a sense of relief after a purchase. They tend to spend many hours each week shopping and spending. Most tend to focus on clothes and shoes and seem to be intensely interested in fashion and design. Compulsive shopping has little to do with income, though money does determine the shopping venue. Ordinary Iowans, for example, shop compulsively at discount stores rather than Saks Fifth Avenue. And because the Internet allows shopping 24/7, its impact on shopping addiction can be considerable. Most compulsive shoppers have other problems as well, including depression, anxiety or other addictions, including compulsive sexual behavior, Internet addiction or compulsive gambling. These disorders ""travel"" together, so to speak. There is no special ""shopping"" personality, though I hear patients from time to time say they have an ""addictive"" personality. The good news is that we know a lot more about compulsive shopping than 20 years ago. The bad news is that we have no standard treatments. That said, cognitive therapy as pioneered by Dr. April Benson can be effective in curbing shopping appetites. To those who call seeking advice, I tell them: Don't shop alone and get rid of your credit cards and checkbooks. For those who shop on the Internet, either stop your Internet service or put your home computer in the kitchen or other place where family members can see it and will try to temper your enthusiasm. You must try and find other meaningful ways to spend your time. Get to it! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donald W. Black.","Donald Black: Upwards of 6% of the U.S. adult population shops compulsively .

"(CNN) -- Ariel Castro used the promise of a puppy to lure Michelle Knight into the Cleveland home where he held her hostage for 11 years. ""He tells me, 'Just come in for a little while. The puppies are upstairs. You can take one home to your son,'"" Knight said in an interview broadcast Tuesday on the syndicated ""Dr. Phil"" talk show. But she soon realized there were no puppies inside Castro's home. And it wasn't long, Knight said, before he trapped her in an upstairs room and tied her up with an extension cord. From there, he took her down into the basement about 24 hours later, she said. It was the beginning of more than a decade of torture, rape, starvation and beatings for Knight. The hope of seeing her son again, she said, inspired her fight to survive. ""I want my son to know me as a victor, not a victim,"" Knight told host Dr. Phil McGraw. ""And I wanted him to know that I survived, loving him. His love got me through."" Castro lured Knight into his vehicle from a Family Dollar store in Cleveland in 2002, promising to give her a ride. She was the first of three women he would capture and imprison in his home for about a decade. They were freed in May after one of the women, Amanda Berry, called out to neighbors for help. In August, Castro was sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years after he pleaded guilty to 937 counts, including murder and kidnapping. He committed suicide in his prison cell in September. Knight, Berry and the third woman, Gina DeJesus, have since been trying to readjust to life as free women. Knight, whose disappearance generated the least public notice of the three, has been the most outspoken. ""After 11 years, I am finally being heard, and it's liberating,"" she said in a powerful statement at Castro's sentencing, describing the abuse she endured. Her interview with ""Dr. Phil,"" which began airing Tuesday and is set to continue Wednesday, provides a detailed glimpse into some of the horrors she suffered and her struggle to survive. ""How she continued to put one foot in front of the other during these 11 years is just very humbling. I mean, I said to her during the interview, 'Michelle, I will never complain about another thing the rest of my life,'"" McGraw told CNN's AC 360. ""When you realize what she went through, it makes everything else seem so trivial."" 'It's God's will if you die' Knight said she remembered the warning, the one Castro delivered while wrapping a chain around her neck and shackling her to a metal pole in the basement of his Cleveland home. ""Now, if I do it too tight and you don't make it, that means you wasn't meant to stay here. That means God wanted to take you,"" Castro said, according to Knight. Knight told McGraw she sometimes spent days in the basement, chained to the pole, unable to lie down and with a motorcycle helmet over her head. The helmet made it hard to breathe, she said, ""and later on I didn't remember a thing 'cause I had passed out."" A photograph of the pole showed white paint had been scraped away. ""That's where I tried to get out,"" Knight said. ""And I couldn't pull the pole down because I wasn't strong enough."" Knight told McGraw that she didn't always fight back, though, at least not at first. She said she was in shock after being taken and all she could do was cry and beg him to let her go back to her son. Several attempts to escape were met with harsh punishment, she said. ""He took a pipe and he held it ... over my head, and he said, 'If you scream, I'll ram this down your throat and I'll kill you,'"" Knight recalled, describing what she said was Castro's response after she used a pair of pliers and a wire cutter to remove a chain around her neck. ""So I didn't scream. I didn't make a noise. I just laid there."" Knight returns to Cleveland house where she was held for 11 years . Other victims . Knight, 32, was 21 years old when she was reported missing in 2002. Castro, she said, would tell her of his plans to abduct other women and also implied he'd done it before. She said he showed her an area in the basement where it said, ""Rest in Peace."" ""I begged him not to bring any more there to suffer the hell I went through,"" Knight said. But it wasn't long before Knight learned that she wasn't the only captive. In 2003, Berry joined her inside the house. At first, she said, they rarely saw each other. ""When we did, it was like a quick hug and 'bye,' because he wouldn't let us stay in the same room for that long,"" she said. When they were in separate rooms, Knight said, she would blare her television if she saw Berry's mother on air, to make sure Berry knew to watch. And when she saw Berry, Knight said, she tried to comfort her. ""Sometimes she would cry, and I'd tell her everything would be OK, and that one day we'll get home,"" Knight told McGraw. ""We just have to, you know, wait it out."" Castro's main 'punching bag' Since their release, accounts have depicted Knight as someone who cared for the other victims during their captivity while also enduring great suffering herself. A family friend of one of the victims said this year that Castro used Knight as his main ""punching bag."" The friend said Castro hit Knight with a variety of objects, including hand weights. She has suffered vision loss, joint and muscle damage, and other problems from her time in captivity. According to an initial incident report obtained by CNN, Knight said she became pregnant at least five times while in Castro's home. In the interview with McGraw, Knight said she once watched Castro kill a beloved dog by breaking its neck. She said she was kept nearly naked in a frigid room with windows boarded up. And she said Castro once punched her in the stomach with a barbell when he learned she was pregnant. ""I fell to the floor. ... He said, 'Tomorrow it'd better be gone. That's all he said,'"" Knight recalled. ""Then when I did miscarry, he blamed me. He said that I hated him, that I killed his kid, and he punched me in the face, saying that it was all my fault."" A troubled past . During Knight's time in captivity, her case got less media attention than the disappearances of Berry and DeJesus, whose family members posted fliers and held candlelight vigils for them. Knight's grandmother, Deborah Knight, told The Plain Dealer in May that the family had concluded that Michelle had left of her own accord because she was angry that she had lost custody of her then-2-year-old son. That conclusion was supported by police and social workers, she told the newspaper. Knight told McGraw that her son was taken away after her mother's boyfriend abused him. ""And then they tried to say that I never protected him, and I did,"" she said. ""I did all I could do."" She was still trying to do all she could on the day when she was abducted in 2002, Knight said. She told McGraw she got lost on the way to a meeting with social services to discuss her son's custody. That's when she stopped at the dollar store to ask for directions, she said, and when Castro offered her a ride. In the interview, Knight also gave a glimpse into what she described as a troubled childhood before her abduction, which she said was why she didn't want to see her mother after she was released. ""I wished my mother wasn't my mother. ... I wasn't allowed out. I wasn't allowed to have friends. She made sure I was dumber than a doorknob,"" she said. In response, her mother, Barbara Knight, issued a statement to the ""Dr. Phil"" show. ""Michelle, my daughter, has been the victim of long-term and profound and unspeakable torture. Her point of view has been altered by that monster and what he did to her,"" the statement said. ""What I have heard that she said about me breaks my heart. That is because what she now believes, while not true, increases her pain. I love my daughter. I always have and always will. I pray that someday she will heal enough to know that again.""

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- As Saudi women artists, Reem Al Faisal and Lulwah Al Homoud, feel they are fighting against multiple stereotypes. They are caught between conservative attitudes at home and western critics who expect them to address women's rights in their work. ""They want you to talk about very limited things like sexual oppression, search for identity and if you don't fit these criteria you're excluded and you are not considered a good artist,"" said Al Faisal. Al Faisal, a photographer, has another reason for being wary of people's expectations: She is a princess, a granddaughter of the first king of Saudi Arabia. She avoids being photographed or showing her face in interviews to allow her to travel the world anonymously without bodyguards. Her work has taken her to China, Japan, India, Europe, America and all around the Middle East, capturing striking black-and-white photographs of people and landscapes. Al Homoud, a single mother who brought up her two sons in London, creates abstract art, often geometric black-and-white drawings. She said: ""People kind of concentrate on you and give you more attention because you have female Saudi artists, but it's kind of upsetting because it's related to stereotype, and I think what we are doing is changing this stereotype."" Her work includes ""infinite square,"" in which she uses the word Allah -- the Arabic word for God -- to create geometric shapes and lines connecting the artist to a timeless world unlimited by borders. Al Homoud said: ""I am trying to say that I am not a prisoner of a moment or a place. My work is -- I would say -- eternal. It's not restricted to an event or an experience or anything. It's spiritual, it's higher than senses."" Al Faisal and Al Homoud, along with other Saudi artists, displayed their work at the Nabatt exhibition of modern Saudi artists in Shanghai last year and more recently in Beirut. The position of Saudi women has gained attention worldwide after King Abdullah announced in September that women will in future be allowed to serve as members of the Shura Council, the appointed consultative council that advises the king. He also said women will be allowed to run as candidates and nominate candidates in the next set of municipal elections. They could not participate in municipal elections that were held last month for only the second time in the kingdom's history. Women are also subject to male guardianship laws, in which they have to seek permission from their husband, father or even son to work, travel, study and many other activities. Saudi women have been campaigning for the right to drive. Last month King Abdullah revoked a flogging sentence of 10 lashes for a woman allegedly arrested for driving a car. Nuha Al Sulaiman, who founded the Saudi Women Revolution earlier this year to campaign for greater rights, welcomed King Abdullah's announcements but said they did not go far enough. ""We are afraid that it's not going to happen the way we want it to,"" she said. ""Also we think that this decision is good but it's not enough."" Al Sulaiman said she still wanted to see the end of male guardianship, the introduction of laws to protect women from violence and discrimination, and driving licenses for women. She said: ""We suffer every day. The improvement process is so slow we wish the next step won't delay more. ""The king mentioned very impressive and effective words in his speech towards women's dignity and rights, we hope it's an obligation to give Saudi women back their dignity step by step."" Al Faisal, too, wants to see an improvement in women's rights, but believes sometimes the issue of driving has distracted from more important issues. ""I would like to see women in the judiciary system as far more important for me. A car will come naturally if she is a supreme court judge or traveling without a permission.""","Critics expect our work to address women's rights, says Reem Al Faisal .
Having women judges is more important than driving, she adds .
People stereotype us as Saudi women, says artist Lulwah Al-Homoud ."
"(CNN) -- By hosting ""Saturday Night Live"" this weekend, Miley Cyrus might have just had the last laugh. The 20-year-old pop star has eclipsed nearly every other figure in popular culture in the weeks following her salacious twerking-with-teddy-bears routine with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards on August 25. There was no way ""Saturday Night Live"" was not going to address the subsequent tidal wave of reaction, and the sketch comedy series smartly attacked it right at the start of the cold open. With ""SNL"" cast member Kenan Thompson playing a wise old-timer in the year 2045, he recounts what led America to an apocalyptic state of destruction. ""Most folks say it was the government shutdown. Others blame Obamacare. But I remember the exact day America ended: it was the 2013 Video Music Awards,"" Thompson said. Photos: Miley Cyrus wild child . Cyrus was in on the joke from the start, as the camera cut to her being warned not to take the stage by ""old Miley,"" as played by ""SNL's"" Miley impressionist, Vanessa Bayer. (""I think I'm hallucinating,"" Cyrus said in a winking joke. ""I must've smoked too much ... cigarettes."") ""Old Miley"" was there to warn that the VMAs routine ""might be too controversial"" and hit all the references in the process: Cyrus' revealing costume that could potentially land her in prison; the constant tongue wagging (""I'm having tiny strokes, yo!"" Cyrus explained); and the stuffed animals as stage props. (Cried one stuffed bear before going on stage, ""We shouldn't be doing this! This is for kids!"") But in the end, Cyrus told her old self that while she knows kids look up to her as a role model, she's still growing up herself. ""I'm only 20 years old, I need some freedom to grow up and make mistakes,"" she said. ""And no matter what happens, I promise I'll always be true to Miley Cyrus."" Just don't expect her to feel the same way about her former Disney character, ""Hannah Montana."" As the 20-year-old said in her opening monologue, ""I don't apologize for my VMAs performance. If I owe anybody an apology, it's the people who make the bottom half of shirts. There are a few subjects I'm not going to get into tonight: I'm not going to do Hannah Montana, but I can give you an update. She was murdered."" And thus began an extremely Miley-heavy episode of ""SNL,"" as she appeared in most of the night's sketches and gave two pared-down performances of her hits, ""We Can't Stop"" and ""Wrecking Ball."" While she's made headlines for both the music videos for those songs and her attire while performing them live, on ""SNL"" Cyrus turned in two tasteful sets that were focused less on her dance moves and more on her voice. She also provided impersonations of a few famous faces, including Scarlett Johansson and Hillary Clinton, but the favorite of the night was her take on Michele Bachmann in a parody of her ""We Can't Stop"" music video, ""We Did Stop (The Government)."" With Taran Killam playing Speaker John Boehner in a tight white tank and matching leggings, the parody was easily one of the night's best sketches. Sample lyrics: ""To my government workers on the furlough, even though you're already paid low: Remember only God can judge us, forget the haters, because somebody elected us."" One topic conspicuously missing from the broadcast was any mention of Sinead O'Connor, the singer Cyrus has been publicly battling with over social media. It all began when O'Connor wrote an open letter to Cyrus last week about her nudity and suggestiveness in the ""Wrecking Ball"" music video. Cyrus hit back with a tweeted dig at O'Connor's past mental health issues, as well as the infamous moment in 1992 when the ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" singer ripped up a photo of Pope John Paul II on ""SNL."" Yet for all those who waited patiently to see how ""SNL"" and Cyrus would tackle the back-and-forth -- which on Friday grew to threats of legal action -- they were left disappointed. Sinead O'Connor wasn't mentioned, nor was a photo dramatically torn in her honor. Overall, the episode was smooth, light on nudity and mainly twerk-free. ""Hey, look at that,"" tweeted the Huffington Post's Mike Ryan. ""Miley Cyrus didn't just play an exaggerated version of herself and she was really good."" For The Hollywood Reporter, Cyrus' episode outshone last week's ""SNL"" premiere with veteran Tina Fey. Even Kirstie Alley weighed in with support. So why didn't Cyrus incorporate the one dance move that's been at the center of the insane amount of debate she's caused? Well, ""I used to think twerking was cool,"" Cyrus explained during her monologue. ""But now that white people are doing it it seems kinda lame.""","Miley Cyrus hosted and performed as a musical guest on ""SNL""

"(CNN) -- Google is a company focused on problem solving. It has untold amounts of computing power at its disposal working away to try and solve big problems. But one issue requires a more analog approach: upping the number of female computer engineers. During his keynote address at the Google I/O developers conference this month, co-founder Larry Page said that Google had been focused on recruiting more women ""forever"" to ensure that the company didn't end up all male. ""The only answer is, we have to start early and make sure we get more women and girls excited in technology,"" said Page. ""There's no question we will double the rate of progress."" The company has a number of year-round initiatives aimed at hiring and educating more women programmers, including scholarships and events. The annual developers' conference offers a rare public, visual example of the industry's gender gap and the company's progress. In the past, women attendees and speakers have been underrepresented in the conference halls and on its stages. Since the conference started in 2008, Google has been working to shift the numbers. According to Google Vice President Megan Smith, the percentage of women at this year's Google I/O was in the teens, up from a single-digit slice at last year's conference. Google has worked to shine a spotlight on the accomplshed women working in technology now, as well as the women who have done important work in the field throughout history. The Women Techmakers Fireside Chat featured some of Google's high-ranking women, and the event was quickly filled to capacity with a mix of men and women. ""Its been a priority from the beginning ... the visibly of technical women is something we really want to work on,"" said Smith, who works at Google[x], Google's semi-secretive experimental wing that works on futuristic projects and prototypes. First Google made a concerted effort to find talented women in the field from around the world to invite to the conference. ""We felt like there were incredible technical women who should be at I/O, who for whatever reason weren't there,"" said Smith. ""We did a lot of work to just make sure that we were increasing the presence of women leaders ... on the stage and in demos."" They also organized a social event for all the women attendees and offered on-site day care for all parents attending the conference. Kids were also welcome on the floor, and one dad wrote in to say it had been a great father-daughter event. Another continuing part of Google's approach is community building for women already in the field so that they feel less isolated. The company held a Women Techmakers social for female I/O attendees before the conference. Women were invited to meet their peers, enjoy some wine and food from the Google kitchen, and then break off into teams up to create unique projects using littleBits and arts and crafts supplies. Developer Rony Rozen was at the event and came all the way from Israel to attend the conference after Google invited her. Rozen is the founder of poccaDot, an iOS and Android app development company in Tel Aviv. She started the company after serving as a programmer with the Israeli Air Force, and she is a mentor for mobile development at Google's Israel campus. ""I think Google can (and should) expand their efforts to be more visible to the general public and not just to the people who are already in the industry,"" said Rozen. ""Incorporate more women into their commercials, make sure to advertise women tech-makers events throughout the year and eventually also expand the relevant age groups to focus on younger girls."" Smith is influenced by the success of the Harvey Mudd school in southern California, headed up by president Maria Klawe. Its computer science department is now 44% women, thanks to efforts by the school to figure out why more women weren't joining in the first place. What it found was partially a PR problem. Some women didn't think the field sounded interesting due to a lack of understanding of what the work entailed. They also didn't think they'd be good at it. ""Young women are very interested in having an impact on the world,"" said Smith. ""We haven't connected the dots for them"" that coding can have a direct impact on issues that are important to them. It's not just a matter of reaching out to young people. Women are getting into computer science later in life as returning professionals. And going back to college isn't the only way to learn programming, according to Smith. Anyone can take classes on sites like Khan Academy, Codecademy and Coursera. Female programmers are also spreading the word on their own. Rozen is doing her part by teaching her young nieces how to program. ""We as a society need to make sure that more young boys and girls are exposed to this kind of education as early in possible in life, and I think that Google plays a major role in our achieving that goal.""","Google is encouraging more women to enter male-dominated tech fields .

"(CNN) -- When he got a concussion playing football in junior high, Kevin Guskiewicz didn't even see a doctor. No one cautioned him about the dangers of repeated head trauma in sports. He stopped playing that day and suffered headaches, but came back to the field a couple of days later. ""That would have been in the early '80s, and we certainly didn't know half of what we know now about the injury,"" he said. Guskiewicz, 45, dedicated his career to discovering and harnessing knowledge about head injuries. Now, he's a highly regarded concussion expert and the recipient of $500,000 from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. He is one of 22 distinguished individuals to receive the no-strings-attached award, informally called the ""genius grant,"" for 2011. His research on retired sports players shows that repeated head injuries in sports increase the risk of memory loss, depression and other long-term consequences. In fact, in July, 75 former professional football players said they were suing the National Football League, accusing it of hiding that information. Figuring he wouldn't make it big-time in football (or his other interests, baseball and tennis), Guskiewicz got interested in sports medicine as a way to use other skills while remaining involved in athletics. In junior high, he took an introductory sports medicine course over the summer at Pennsylvania State University and became a student athletic trainer in high school. ""It's a bit scary how little I knew then, but I thought I knew everything. And here I am 30 years later, certainly very happy that I stayed with that passion,"" he said. He worked as a graduate student athletic trainer with the Pittsburgh Steelers while earning his master's at the University of Pittsburgh, which he completed in 1992, and came to realize just how little was known about concussions. ""It was pretty much a guessing game about whether someone was ready to play again. It's such a subjective injury,"" he said. He went on to get his Ph.D. at the University of Virginia, where he got involved with technologies for more objectively assessing concussions. In 1995, he came to the University of North Carolina, where he is the chairman of the Department of Exercise and Sport Science. Guskiewicz sees his work as piecing together a puzzle: preventing, diagnosing and treating concussions are all pieces that he wants to fit together. He and colleagues developed the Balance Error Scoring System, a cost-effective tool that is being widely used in scholastic athletics for diagnosing and managing concussions. Athletes are asked to stand in three different ways on both firm and foam surfaces, and an athletic trainer or other clinician follows the guidebook to rate their balance. It's a quick way to assess damage from a head injury, because concussions often affect balance, especially in the first days after the impact. My concussion: Be nice to your brain . Guskiewicz's group has proposed that all student athletes get a baseline test -- that is, an evaluation when they are healthy -- so if they do suffer a head injury, medical professionals can compare their performance after impact to the scores from when they were healthy. Part of that is the Balance Error Scoring System. Memory testing and self-reporting of symptoms are also taken into account, so clinicians have a clear idea of what the athlete's functioning is like normally vs. after a concussion. Another tool he's exploring is a helmet with a built-in accelerometer, called the Head Impact Telemetry System. It allows clinicians to see on a computer exactly how hard a player was hit. Analyzing the information from this helmet also helps clinicians see exactly where and in what ways players get hit, so they can make recommendations about how to avoid concussions in the future. Athletes can be taught how not to lead with their heads inappropriately and to position their bodies better to withstand an impact, Guskiewicz said. There is no concussion-proof helmet, and there won't be for many years, but in the meantime Guskiewicz urges a focus on behavior modification. Only about one of every 15 concussion patients get a CT scan at UNC, Guskiewicz said, and the ones who do get imaged are athletes who report worsening symptoms, such as headache and light sensitivity, which could signal a brain bleed. Guskiewicz and colleagues are also using a newer imaging technique called diffusion tensor imaging, a type of magnetic resonance imaging that lets doctors look at how water diffuses in the brain's white matter tracts. It can show areas where neurons have been disrupted. The use of this technique for concussions is still being analyzed. Major sports groups such as the National Football League, the National Hockey League and the National College Athletics Association have done a better job of increasing awareness about concussions over the last few years, Guskiewicz said. ""I think we're certainly in a better position today to educate athletes and prevent these catastrophic outcomes because of some of the initiatives they put in place,"" he said. The NFL, for example, has instituted a new rule that kickoffs must be moved from the 30-yard line to the 35-yard line. This distance adjustment would theoretically reduce the number of high-speed collisions at kickoff. Although there is some skepticism about this, Guskiewicz is confident that there will be fewer concussions this season as a result. After the blow in junior high school, Guskiewicz suffered two concussions as an adult: one in a cycling accident and, most recently, on a roller coaster. Just as his own research suggested, having had two concussions in the past made him more susceptible to a third. But because he is not additionally exposed to repeated smaller head injuries the way contact sports players are, he's hopeful he isn't at as high a risk of memory loss and other symptoms. It might come as a surprise that Guskiewicz puts no restrictions on the contact sports playing of his four children -- 11, 13, and 15-year-old boys, and a 4-year-old girl. The boys have already played a lot of football, including tackle football. Their dad wants them to learn the skills early so they'll be able to protect themselves better later in their teens, when they're more susceptible to more serious injuries. ""Many of my friends think I'm crazy for allowing it, but I'm also out there helping to educate parents about this, so I'm hopeful that we're making a difference,"" he said. ""If we can see it happening in a positive way in one community, it can be extended to the next community."" As for what he'll do with the grant, Guskiewicz wants to develop rehabilitation protocols, not just for athletes with head injuries but also for soldiers, since there has been a documented similarity between blast injuries and sports concussions. Coincidentally, he had scheduled a meeting with a military group on Tuesday to discuss possibilities, unrelated to the announcement of the award. ""I also hope that our MacArthur award will allow us to explore creative ways to expand that work for youth athletes, and helping to protect them as they move up through the ranks,"" he said.","Kevin Guskiewicz has won a MacArthur Foundation award for concussion research .

"(CNN) -- Spike Lee says he's never going to see Quentin Tarantino's ""Django Unchained"" because he's certain it is ""disrespectful of my ancestors."" Tarantino says he doesn't need to waste time responding to Lee's accusation. That, as they say, is that. So why do we insist on staring at two egomaniacs staring down each other? Race. Again. The subject that never fails to provoke, antagonize, alienate -- and fascinate rubber-necking onlookers from sea to shining sea. Fixating on race is an absurdity that has no rational reason to exist, yet no one quite knows how to eliminate it from humankind. The only thing dumber than race is underestimating its importance. ""Django Unchained"" is Tarantino's latest exercise in genre-bending audacity, an antic ripsnorter folding in most of what its director knows and loves about spaghetti westerns, 1970s blaxploitation thrillers and his own ribald, recklessly violent body of work. Its title character, played by Jamie Foxx, is a slave bought and freed by a drolly effective German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz), who agrees to help Django emancipate his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), from a decadent plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio). ""Django"" makes no pretense of being anything other than a phantasmagoric pseudo-western, rife with calculated vulgarity, anachronism and impropriety. Its body count rivals that of Tarantino's 2003 martial-arts epic, ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" (to whose messily operatic set pieces of slaughter ""Django"" bears an uncanny resemblance). Marquee blog: What's the verdict on ""Django Unchanied""? The movie has so far grossed more than $100 million since its Christmas Day nationwide release. Critics' reactions have ranged from wild-eyed enthusiasm (The Boston Globe's Wesley Morris: ""Corkscrewed, inside-out, upside-down, simultaneously clear-eyed and out of its mind"") to wary detachment (The Detroit News' Tom Long: ""(Y)ou may leave ... wishing for both more and less"") to borderline outrage (Slate's Dana Stevens: ""There's something about (Tarantino's) directorial delectation in all these acts of racial violence that left me not just physically, but morally queasy."") Given advance hype for the movie as extravagant as its violence, I doubt that audience members, whatever their race or age, bought tickets with the expectation of seeing some historically faithful saga of antebellum life, and neither did I. We were buying a comic book. Many people have a grievance against the very notion of comic books, but I don't. Expect a movie or a comic book to explain everything about anything and all you earn is surplus sadness that you don't really need. Nevertheless, there are many who, unlike Lee, have seen the movie and carry the same grievances as he does. The most scathing attack came from that novelist-satirist-poet Ishmael Reed, writing in The Wall Street Journal: ""To compare this movie to a spaghetti western and a blaxploitation film is an insult to both genres. It's a Tarantino home movie with all the racist licks of his other movies."" He aimed this laser shot at the Oscar-nominated actor who plays the treacherous ""house slave"" to DiCaprio's character: ""Samuel L. Jackson ... plays himself."" I doubt Jackson felt the blow. He has, in fact, further provoked the movie's antagonists by running straight at an interviewer asking about the movie's prolific use of the ""N-word,"" refusing to answer the question unless the reporter, who is white, actually says the dread epithet aloud. (He didn't.) Still, Reed's condemnation discloses what may lie at the heart of Lee's objection: the debate over whether white artists have the right to tell any part of the black American story -- which, as Reed writes, is as old as Harriet Beecher Stowe's 1852 abolitionist novel, ""Uncle Tom's Cabin."" It is also as recent as 1967 when the white Southern novelist William Styron published, ""The Confessions of Nat Turner,"" a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel told in the first-person voice of the brilliant-but-doomed leader of an 1838 slave rebellion. The outcry from African-American novelists was so intense that a collection of essays, ""William Styron's Nat Turner: Ten Black Writers Respond"" was published a year later. James Baldwin, a friend of Styron's who was one of the few African-American authors speaking out on the book's behalf, put his position as succinctly as possible: ""I will not tell another writer what to write. If you don't like their alternative, write yours."" It's still sound advice -- and in the intervening years, black authors have taken it, from Alex Haley's 1976 blockbuster, ""Roots,"" to Toni Morrison's haunting ""Beloved"" from 1987. Both were adapted for the screen, and while ""Roots,"" the television miniseries, delivered a resounding national impact, the 1998 movie adaptation of ""Beloved,"" even with Oprah Winfrey as producer and co-star, earned about $26 million, roughly half of its $50 million budget. I remember many of my African-American relatives and friends who told me they were not going to see ""Beloved,"" no matter how good it was or who was in it, because they simply did not want to watch a movie about slavery's legacy. Some of these same folks, on the other hand, tell me they were psyched about seeing a movie, however ""incorrect"" on several levels, in which a black ex-slave secures freedom for his wife, kills every white man who stands in his way -- and gets away with it. Exasperated? If you're not, you should be. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: Spike Lee, Quentin Tarantino spatting over ""Django Unchained""

"(CNN) -- A personal envoy to North Korea's leader indicated Kim Jung Un was open to restarting nuclear disarmament talks, a move that came as China's leader delivered a blunt message to Pyongyang to return to the negotiating table, Chinese state-run media reported Friday. Kim's personal envoy, who was on a three-day visit to China, hand-delivered a letter from Kim to President Xi Jinping at a meeting in Beijing before returning to North Korea on Friday, according to state media. While the contents of the letter were not released by the government, the envoy -- Choe Ryong-hae -- told Chinese officials that his country is willing to ""take positive actions to solve problems through dialogue, "" the state-run China Daily reported. Choe did not offer any details on when or how it would jumpstart the so-called six-party talks. The talks, which include the United States and China, fell apart in 2008 when Pyongyang pulled out over disagreements over proposed nuclear inspections. Most observers agree that Pyongyang is unlikely to return to talks where there are pre-conditions that it rid itself of nuclear weapons. North Korea is believed to have a limited nuclear ballistic missile capability, but with a low reliability. Choe said Kim's goal with sending the letter is to ""improve, consolidate and develop"" relations between North Korea and China, state news agency Xinhua reported. During the meeting, Xi told Choe that North Korea needed to ""stick to solving problems through dialogue and consultation,"" according to China Daily and CCTV. Xi's demand comes just two weeks before he is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Barack Obama in California. In another meeting, Chinese Gen. Fan Changlong told Choe that recent tensions have ""jeopardized the peace and stability of the peninsula,"" Xinhua reported. Tensions between Pyongyang, Beijing and Washington spiked this year amid a flurry of fiery North Korean threats against the United States and South Korea. The angry rhetoric appeared to be fueled by tougher U.N. sanctions against the North after it carried out its third underground nuclear test in February, as well as by annual military drills in the region by the United States and South Korea. The intensity of the North's rhetoric appears to have subsided in recent weeks, and the U.S.-South Korean drills finished at the end of April. This month, North Korea test-fired rockets after criticizing the presence of a U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at a South Korean port and its reported participation in joint naval drills.

"(CNN) -- Embroiled by successive racism scandals throughout much of the season, football was engulfed in a sexism storm on Wednesday after a leading ex-French international footballer advised women to look after their ""pots and pans"" rather than talk about the sport. During a radio phone-in following France's 1-0 defeat to Spain in Tuesday's 2014 World Cup qualifier, Bernard Lacombe, who scored over 100 goals for Lyon between 1969 and 1978 before returning to coach the team in 1996, advise a woman caller Sonia that her place was in the kitchen rather than airing her opinions on football. ""I don't talk about football with women,"" said Lacombe on the RMC radio station. ""It's my character, that's my way. They should look after their pots and pans, that would be better."" Pedro's Point of View: Juve Europe's dark horses? Sonia had called the station to criticize France striker Karim Benzema, a Real Madrid star who made his name at Lyon, for his performance against Spain. He last scored for France in June 2012. But Lacombe was quickly forced to reconsider his view of women and their right to engage in a football debate as he issued an apology via Lyon's website, explaining he had only meant to defend Benzema. ""I'm sorry if my remarks yesterday on RMC have hurt women and in particular sportswomen and female footballers,"" read the statement on Lyon's website. ""My only intention was to respond with a quip to the umpteenth criticism of Karim Benzema about his skills that struck me as particularly gratuitous and unacceptable. ""I would like to convey to Sonia and her partners the respect I hold for them and my admiration for their skills as footballers and for their outstanding performances."" Benzema has failed to score in any of France's five qualifying matches and hasn't found the net for Les Bleus since a friendly win over Estonia eight months ago. ""I want to say that I would have reacted as vehemently if the criticism of Karim Benzema had come from a man, obviously with different words but certainly as colorful,"" continued Lacombe. ""I do not want to attack anyone, but simply to defend a player who does not deserve such treatment."" Lacombe now serves as an unofficial ""special adviser"" Lyon to club president Jean-Michel Aulas and his jibe is acutely embarrassing for the French club given its women's team have dominated European football in recent years . On Sunday, Lyon's women's team underlined their status as the finest in Europe with an 11-0 demolition of Soyaux in the Coupe de France. Patrice Lair's team have won the European Champions League in each of the last two season in addition to collecting 10 French league titles. This is not the first time a senior football figure has uttered sexist remarks. FIFA president Sepp Blatter suggested female players should play in tighter shorts, similar to the ones worn by volleyball players.","Former France striker Bernard Lacombe apologizes following sexist outburst .

Each of these events is the direct byproduct of two central philosophies of the Obama administration -- the massive expansion of the size and power of the federal government and a lack of trust in the American people. These scandals were bound to happen. In fact, it was inevitable, and there will be more. President Obama has grown the size, the scope, the debt and the power of the federal government to such irresponsible proportions that problems like these are an inevitable result. Lord Acton famously noted that ""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."" In a pathetic attempt to defend President Obama, another noted statesman, David Axelrod, said that the president couldn't possibly know about all these scandals because ""the government is so vast."" Therein lies the problem. The government is so vast. Just a few years ago, President Clinton assured us that the era of big government was over. He could not have been more wrong. Now we have not just big government, but big brother running big government. We don't know what the president knew of these matters before they became public, and it strains credulity to suggest that his top political advisers were in the dark. But again, when you grow government this big, these kinds of scandals are inevitable, and he bears the responsibility for that. Are these scandals the byproduct of liberalism or incompetence? I'd say the answer to that question is yes, both. The Obama presidency, and liberalism in general, are based on not trusting the American people -- a belief that big government is better for people. The latest scandals show why liberalism and big government don't work. The scandals cut at the core ideology of the Obama presidency. Indeed, these issues aren't just the failure of an individual, but the failure of a system in which liberals put too much trust in big government. Look at liberalism across every issue, from healthcare to energy to spending, and one thing is crystal clear: Liberals don't believe in the dynamic and transformative power of freedom. Bigger government and more power in the hands of a few means the interests of the public will be violated. Many are wondering aloud if these scandals will tarnish Obama's legacy or weaken his presidency or cause his popularity to drop. Some of that will probably occur, but it's not the ever-charming Obama who will suffer the most from these scandals. No, fortunately the biggest loser here will be the paternalistic big government liberalism that Obama has foisted upon us. We need leaders who have more confidence in the American people, and more skepticism for big government. Maybe we can get Clinton to pronounce the second end of the era of big government? It's time for Big Brother to be put down. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gov. Bobby Jindal.","Gov.

"(CNN) -- A state of emergency in Myanmar was put in place to stop ""attempts by a small number of people to spread ... violence to other parts of the country,"" President Thein Sein said Thursday. In his first speech since making the emergency declaration last week in response to clashes between Buddhists and Muslims, he accused ""instigators"" of escalating a private dispute into sectarian violence that killed at least 40 people last week. ""We did not resort to the use of force immediately mainly because we do not want any possible endangerment of our ongoing democratic transition and reform efforts,"" the president said. ""That said, I am firmly committed to use the power vested in me by the constitution to deploy our security forces and to use existing laws to prevent and protect the life, liberty and security of my fellow citizens."" The president said some were exploiting the situation to engineer violence in other parts of the country. ""I would like to warn all political opportunists and religious extremists who try to exploit the noble teachings of these religions and have tried to plant hatred among people of different faiths for their own self-interest: Their efforts will not be tolerated,"" he said. During the clashes in Meiktila, which were reportedly set off by a dispute between a Muslim gold shop owner and two Buddhist sellers, rioters set fire to houses, schools and mosques, prompting thousands of residents to flee their homes. The government declared a state of emergency in the city Friday, allowing the military to help reinstate order. But as the situation there appeared to calm, authorities reported arson attacks by groups of Buddhists in other towns in the region over the weekend. One group, the Myanmar Islamic Religious Organization, blamed the government for the loss of lives. ""It is analyzed that loss of Muslims' lives and properties, mosques and religious schools in this way are due to weakness and omission of administrative authorities to provide protection and take action effectively,"" the organization said in a statement. The unrest highlights the fragility of ethnic relations in Myanmar, also known as Burma, as it emerges from decades of military repression. Authorities have released thousands of political prisoners and pursued peace talks with rebel groups in the past two years. The clashes in Meiktila and elsewhere have drawn expressions of concern from U.N. and U.S. officials. The sudden boiling over of tensions between Buddhists and Muslims in central Myanmar follows sectarian troubles that killed scores of people in the western part of the country last year. Those clashes, in Rakhine state, took place between the Buddhist majority and the Rohingya, a stateless ethnic Muslim group. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","Myanmar's president speaks for the first time since declaring state of emergency .

"(CNN) -- Is paying a fine to get out of military service fair? The question is at the center of a debate surging in Peru this month as the South American country's government reveals new rules for a possible draft. Authorities say if the government can't fill thousands of vacancies with volunteers, it will start a draft this May. Men and women 18 and over are eligible. But those called up who do not want to serve can pay a fine of 1,850 soles ($715). Critics say the measure will allow the wealthy to avoid military service and leave the poor with no other choice than to join. Military leaders say the new measure isn't discriminatory and that the draft is a necessary step to shore up dwindling ranks. The option of paying a fine to avoid service has drawn sharp criticism from Peru's government ombudsman. And opposition lawmakers have said they will summon Peru's defense minister to testify over the matter. An editorial in the El Comercio newspaper this week described the new policy as ""discrimination against those who have the least."" ""This is a hurdle designed so that only the people who have economic resources can jump over it,"" the editorial said. Nearly a third of Peru's population lives below the poverty line, according to government statistics. A minimum wage salary is 750 soles ($290) per month. The debate over who serves in the military, and why they join the ranks, resonates far beyond Peru's borders. In Israel, thousands of demonstrators last year demanded an end to rules that make ultra-Orthodox Jews exempt from that country's military draft. For more than a decade U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel has been pushing a controversial proposal to reinstate a draft in the United States. ""Currently the burden of defending our nation is carried by less than 1% of the American population,"" the New York Democrat wrote in an opinion column published on CNN.com in January. ""The 2.2 million members of the armed forces in active duty, the National Guard and the Reserve have become a virtual military class that makes the ultimate sacrifice of laying down life and limb for our country."" Bringing back the draft, he argued, ""would compel the American public to have a stake in the wars we fight as a nation."" Many countries around the world require military service. Colombia, which borders Peru, also fines those who refuse to serve after they're called up. In Peru, officials say sheer numbers have forced them to consider a draft, more than a decade after the country passed a law eliminating obligatory military service. Jose Cueto, chief of the joint command of Peru's armed forces, told the state-run Andina news agency that there has been a ""drastic decrease"" in the number of people who join the military since the country switched to a volunteer force. Journalist Maria Elena Belaunde contributed to this report from Lima, Peru.","Authorities say Peru will likely hold a selective draft this May .

"(CNN) -- Wichita State used its Cinderella slipper on Saturday night to trounce Ohio State early and hold on late to advance to the Final Four of the NCAA men's basketball tournament, where it will be joined by Syracuse. The Shockers, the No. 9 seed in the West region, shocked the basketball world by beating the Buckeyes 70-66 in Los Angeles. Though dominating most of the way, they had to sweat out the game's final minutes. Their 20-point advantage with 12 minutes to go dwindled steadily as the contest wore on, with Ohio State pulling within 5 points with just over three minutes to go.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- The Kenyan Supreme Court on Saturday upheld Uhuru Kenyatta's victory in the presidential election, dismissing a challenge by his chief rival and ending a drawn-out case that has riveted the nation. The nation's highest court declared the election ""free and fair,"" ending weeks of uncertainty after the disputed March 4 poll. Kenyatta, the 51-year-old son of Kenya's founding leader, won the election with 50.07% of the vote. Raila Odinga, who got 43.31%, had challenged the outcome in court on the grounds that it was flawed and marred by technical problems. After the court issued its ruling, he said he accepted its judgment and would abide by it. ""The court has now spoken,"" Odinga said, ""I wish the president-elect and his team well."" Odinga said his petition focused on valid failures in the election process. ""My decision to file a petition in the Supreme Court to challenge the validity of the election was a testament of my faith in the independence of our judiciary,"" he said. ""I did so for the sake of our democracy and for the sake of all Kenyans."" Kenyatta will be sworn in April 9, making him the nation's fourth and youngest president. Political dynasty . Kenyatta and Odinga are the sons of the nation's first president and vice president, respectively, bringing back memories of a political dynasty that dates to the 1960s. Their fathers started out as allies in the quest for Kenyan independence from Britain. But the elder politicians' relationship ended in bad blood when founding President Jomo Kenyatta forced out his vice president, Jaramogi Odinga, following a series of disputes. Some five decades later, it is the sons' turn in the spotlight. 'Accept the ruling' Last week, both leaders pledged to accept the court's decision, assuring citizens that the ruling would end the uncertainty in the nation. A peaceful response will go a long way toward restoring the nation's image as a bastion of stability in the region after disputed election results led to bloody chaos in 2007. In that election, more than 1,200 were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced after Odinga disputed the results, which showed incumbent President Mwai Kibaki as the winner. At the time, supporters of both candidates battled on the streets with crude weapons, not in court. The outgoing president urged citizens to honor the court ruling and shun violence. ""As the country awaits the Supreme Court ruling, I call upon all of us to accept the ruling and maintain peace,"" Kibaki said Thursday. ""Kenyans should resume their routine economic activities as soon as possible to return normalcy in the country."" Beyond borders . The March 4 election was the first general poll since the disputed election. It was conducted under a reformed judicial system and a more inclusive electoral commission. The significance of Kenya's democratic process extends beyond the country's borders. Kenya is East Africa's biggest economy and a crucial trade route into the rest of the continent. It provides an important buffer of stability in a region that includes the fledgling Somali government and the politically tense Sudan and South Sudan. Kenya is also a major U.S. ally in the war against Islamist militants in the region and has remained relatively peaceful amid civil wars in neighboring nations. Complicated relations . The upholding of Kenyatta's victory raises the prospect of complicated diplomatic ties with the West. The International Criminal Court has indicted him for allegedly funding a local militia that conducted reprisal attacks in the last election in 2007. His running mate, William Ruto, also faces ICC charges at The Hague, in the Netherlands. Both have denied the charges and have said they will cooperate with the court to clear their names. Defiance of the West . Analysts say the ICC indictment may have rallied citizens to Kenyatta's side in defiance of the West. ""Many Africans have lost faith in ICC and view it as targeting African leaders and failing to discharge its justice among non-African leaders,"" said Ayo Johnson, director of ViewPoint Africa. ""Kenya sent a loud message to the ICC ... don't interfere. And it does not matter if you brand our leaders as criminals."" But rights group say the courts are vital to providing justice in cases largely overlooked by governments. Kenyatta has said the indictment will not affect his ability to do his job, and has urged the international community to respect the will of Kenyans. The United States and Britain sent accolades to Kenyatta following the ruling. Before elections, officials from both nations had expressed concerns over ICC charges against the president-elect. British Prime Minister David Cameron wrote to Kenyatta to congratulate him, a Downing Street spokesman said Saturday. Cameron ""urged the Kenyan people to be proud of the strong signal they have sent to the world about their determination to exercise their democratic right peacefully,"" the spokesman said. In a statement, the White House also congratulated Kenyatta and urged Kenyans ""to peacefully accept the results"" of the election. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also talked to Kenyatta and Odinga and pledged the United Nations' support for the country. CNN's Nima Elbagir reported from Nairobi. Faith Karimi wrote and reported in Atlanta, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.

"(CNN) -- Preeti Varma was inconsolable after seeing her pet cat crushed to death at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport as the creature was loaded onto a flight to Singapore. ""You see a crowd forming round her but she is given no medical aid and no one does anything,"" Varma says of the March 23 incident. Her grief soon turned to rage among tens of thousands of online pet lovers worldwide. The day after Varma's cat, James Dean, died, a friend published online an open letter to Jet Airways, the international airline that had been carrying the cat. The letter demanded a full explanation and apology from the privately owned Indian airline and blasted its ""insensitive"" handling of the tragedy and pet travel procedures. The blog post spread quickly across social media sites and within 24 hours had 20,000 hits from across the world. Hundreds of furious animal lovers also unleashed Twitter fury at Jet Airways, forcing the airline to issue two public statements on Facebook. Varma, 26, a brand strategist, paid Rs 4,500 (US$83) to fly her rescued Indian street cat called James Dean on her flight. She got engaged last August and moved to Singapore six months ago to be with her fiancÃ© but left her pet with friends in New Delhi while she sorted out the paperwork and quarantine. After check-in, Varma was asked to remove James Dean from the cage so it could be X-rayed. The cat immediately escaped Varma's grip and scuttled under the machine. Half an hour later Varma got her cat back inside the IATA-approved cage. She added an extra wire on top, double checked it was locked and handed her to the staff. But her biggest nightmare came while waiting at the gate to board her 8.55 a.m. flight. Jet Airways staff approached her and informed her: ""The cage is empty. The cat is no more."" Shocked, she broke down in tears and refused to board the flight demanding to see her one-year-old kitty. After having her Duty Free bottle of gin confiscated, she was escorted back to check-in where she was handed her beloved cat's corpse in its cage. Jet Airways staff then tried to escort her out of the airport but she demanded to see the CCTV footage. After waiting for two hours, she watched in horror as footage showed her cat jumping out of a luggage trolley onto the tarmac and being run over by a trolley coming in the opposite direction. ""She squirms a bit and then dies. Three airline staff stand around and they motion to a garbage man to pick her,"" Varma says, speaking from Singapore. "" He picks her up with newspaper by the neck and drops her into the cage."" More than 300 people have since signed a petition calling for better training of Jet Airways staff on handling pets and better infrastructure for pet travel. A Jet Airways spokesperson tells CNN.com: ""On close inspection of the container, it was observed that the wire mesh in the front of the container was bent outwards and pushed out of the main frame. ""It is inferred that the pet forced itself out of the container by pushing the wire mesh and thereby creating a gap for it to come free."" Varma insists negligence by Jet Airways caused the death of her cat. ""I think either the cage was thrown so violently onto the trolley that it snapped open, or someone let her out. There is no way my cat could have pushed the cage open by herself,"" she says. Varma now wants Jet Airways to apologize not just for the incident but the ""insensitive way"" she claims she was treated, being left alone shaking and crying for hours. She also wants the airline to tell her what steps they are taking to improve pet travel safety. ""I don't want any compensation. They should make a donation to an animal organization,"" she adds. ""They should have a vet present at the airport and an animal handler to accompany the pet to the aircraft."" The Jet Airways spokesperson says the airline has embarked on a global review of other airport and airline procedures. The spokesperson said: ""We sincerely regret the accidental demise of James Dean, pet cat of Ms. Preeti Varma. All our staff are fully conversant and trained in the process of handling household pets and necessary infrastructure is available at the airports to deal with such movements of pets. ""If the actions of any members of our team came across as insensitive we would like to assure that this was unintentional and to apologize to Ms. Varma."" International Pet Travel Consultant Anupama Vinayak, who runs pet relocation service Furry Flyers in India, which flies 40-50 pets in and out of India each month, said she had never heard of an incident like this. But she added: ""Pet travel is still in a very nascent stage in India. Airlines are trying to put their best foot forward but there still is a lot of room for improvement because India itself is not a very pet-friendly country,"" she said.","Preeti Varma books to fly pet cat from New Delhi to Singapore .

"Nicosia, Cyprus (CNN) -- ""It is a jungle,"" the taxi driver told me. ""It is a jungle and we are the rabbit surrounded by lions."" It's a dramatic analogy, but one that accurately sums up Cypriots' disgust and helplessness at what they perceive to be the ultimate betrayal by the European Union. The last two weeks have been the most dramatic in decades for Greek Cyprus, still reeling from the harsh terms of a â‚¬10 billion bailout from international lenders to save the island nation's banking sector. Large bank deposit holders are being forced to take huge losses, and unprecedented limits on the movement of cash have been imposed here. LATEST: Cyprus' banks reopen for first time in two weeks . The prevailing mood is one of utter helplessness. Greek Cypriots are used to fighting. They fought Turkey for the very land they live on. But today there is no battle to fight against the nameless, faceless group of EU and International Monetary Fund bureaucrats and officials who have now become deeply involved in the future of their country. ""We wanted to be Europe's friend,"" continues the driver, ""but now it is turning on us."" It's difficult not to sympathize. Groups of locals sit in pavement cafes in the capital city of Nicosia, anxiously watching state television, waiting for the next move, waiting for the next development in a seismic event which has rocked the Cyprus economy to its very core. Every interview, every comment is being dissected assiduously. The biggest question this week was whether money would really be there when Cyprus' banks finally reopened Thursday. It is, but it can only be withdrawn â‚¬300 at a time. But Cypriots are also discussing and arguing about the long-term effects of the bailout. What does austerity mean? How come the Irish and the Spanish didn't lose their savings? Why us? Walking down Nicosia's main shopping streets, there is little sign of an economic crisis. No queues at the ATMs. Restaurants are busy. Tourists are browsing through the many local stores. Heated discussions over Cypriot coffee can be heard everywhere, and although I can't understand the words, I can sense the frustration. These people are stuck in a state of limbo. Journalists bandy the term ""an uneasy calm"" around quite a lot, but it seems a perfect fit to describe the mood here. What's the point in getting angry if you don't know what you're getting angry about? What can you say to the government when their hands are being forced by Europe? What does it all mean for Cyprus? Ironically, it is Cyprus' youth who seem to have foreseen the long term effect of the bailout. Hundreds of high school students have taken to the streets to voice their dismay over what they see as a threat to their future, though they weren't blaming the government for everything. Placards bearing unflattering comments about the German Chancellor Angela Merkel peppered their morning marches, orchestrated to pass under the gaze of the cameras of hundreds of journalists who set up camp in one of Nicosia's main squares and at the parliament building. The feeling of worry was palpable. The Russians might lose their money, the young protesters seemed to be saying, but what about us? We could have just lost our future. I reached the end of the street and at the border crossing stumbled across a completely different, more Turkish side of Cyprus. I walked about 100 meters and spotted the bank. The bank's doors were open, its Turkish flag blowing in the wind. Here people are pleased with the weather. Summer is coming. It's the high season for tourists and hopefully this year will be fruitful. Spare a thought for your Greek counterparts? A shop assistant shrugged. What the long term effect of this bailout will be is anybody's guess. The rules change every day and while the government insists that the bailout -- and all that comes with it -- is the lesser of two evils, the people sitting in the cafes, those trying to run a business, and the shoe shiner trying to eek out a living remain unconvinced. The last two weeks have shattered Cypriots' confidence in their country, and the people are fully aware that like a rabbit in the jungle, Cyprus has been well and truly cornered.","Cyprus' banks reopen for first time in nearly two weeks .

"(CNN) -- Veteran Tommy Haas described his fourth round victory over world No. 1 Novak Djokovic at the Miami Masters as ""one of the best wins of my career"". The German, who reached No. 2 in the world rankings in 2002, kept his cool to become only the second player this year to beat double defending champion Djokovic in an ATP Tour event. The 6-2 6-4 triumph was Haas' third win over six-time grand slam winner Djokovic in seven career meetings and his first win against a top-ranked player since he beat Andre Agassi in 1999.

"(CNN) -- David Petraeus, who has wandered for months in his own private wilderness, is superbly poised for a major comeback. Why? Because he has apologized, and it appears that he means it. Americans like that. Compared with some other American public figures toppled by scandal, Petraeus is coming back the right way. Unlike Richard Nixon after Watergate, Petraeus has offered a clear, sincere sounding public apology. Nixon squirmed and sweated and prevaricated for years after he hurled himself out of the White House, but he could never find in himself enough manhood and public relations common sense to declare the simple words that might have saved his presidency in the first place: ""I made some major mistakes, I acknowledge them unreservedly, and I ask the nation to consider forgiving me."" Similarly, a John Edwards comeback was never going to happen. Not only did he get tangled up with another woman while his wife was dying of cancer, he denied it, and then a ""love child"" appeared in the tabloids, as did a chatty mistress. Then Edwards offered TV quasi-apologies so weird and painful to watch that America decided just to switch him off permanently, shaking him off like a bad dream. In contrast, Republican U.S. Sen. David Vitter's career seemed doomed by a call-girl scandal in 2007, until he held a press conference, took responsibility for his actions and asked for forgiveness. Result: He was re-elected in 2010, and is now considered a front-runner for the Louisiana Republican gubernatorial race in 2015. Photos: Public figures, private missteps . Other polarizing figures have come back from messy, highly chaotic personal lives, like Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich and Rudy Giuliani. It ain't easy. When I interviewed Petraeus for my book about the Iraq War a few years ago, I held a healthy dose of skepticism about his reputation as the man who turned the war around with the ""surge."" I felt that momentum for a turnaround had already developed before Petraeus got back to Iraq in early 2007, thanks in part to the Iraqi Awakening movement of 2006 and its American supporters, largely fairly junior U.S. military officers in Anbar Province, like Capt. Travis Patriquin and his colleagues. The funny thing was, Petraeus told me he thought pretty much the same thing himself. That impressed me. Either he is a self-aware man with a dose of humility or a shrewd manipulator of his audience. Either trait will serve him well. I doubt we'll see Petraeus in a straight government job anytime soon. The circumstances of his CIA departure were just too messy. But other than public service, the world is his oyster, thanks to the towering reputation he had before the scandal. Petraeus might even run for office someday. Given his intelligence and communication skills, and the often wretched choices voters are presented with, he might even have a shot. After that, would a President Petraeus be in the cards? A real long shot. But don't laugh too hard. Stranger things have happened. For now, though, he is well-positioned to become a highly sought-after TV pundit, corporate board member, Silicon Valley partner, you name it. He might write a big book about his career and military insights. He'll be courted by Hollywood and the press. In the right Hollywood hands, his book might even make a hell of a good movie. He will give big speeches on the national security issues of the day, and might even advise a president or two again someday. Americans seem to have limited patience for public figures who lie, cheat, steal or make spectacles that make everyone look silly. But when people foul up in a spectacular fashion, especially when it involves a personal matter, Americans will give them a break and a second chance -- as long as they stand up like a man or a woman, admit they screwed up, say they're sorry and look like they damn well mean it. Welcome back, Gen. Petraeus. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Doyle.","David Petraeus has apologized for his extramarital affair since resigning from the CIA .

"(CNN) -- Tablets, laptops, e-readers, smartphones. They keep us plugged in everywhere we go, except when we're on a plane. Many travelers don't believe there is anything wrong with leaving their personal electronic devices on while in flight, but it's a no-no during takeoffs and landings. In August, the Federal Aviation Administration announced plans for a working group that would study the issue of portable electronics on flights and make suggestions for changes. The committee is due to report its findings this summer. Advocates say it's time for a change. ""It certainly appears that using an electronic device to read a magazine, to read a newspaper is not a safety factor,"" said John Walls, vice president of public affairs for CTIA-The Wireless Association. Harlem shake reaches new heights; FAA not amused . Using personal electronic devices below 10,000 feet is banned on most airlines. Electronic health devices such as hearing aids and pacemakers are allowed at all times. Anyone who flies could tell you how often the rule is ignored, but it's announced before every flight. While many airlines now offer Wi-Fi access via portable electronic devices from laptops to smartphones, cellular voice and data services on domestic airlines fall under that Federal Communications Commission ban. There hasn't been any conclusive proof that devices such as tablets and e-readers are a danger, but a study released in 2011 found 75 instances of interference that may have been related to personal electronic devices, However, it is difficult to verify pilots' suspicions because of the difficulty replicating incidents. The FAA has said it does not know of any aviation accidents linked to interference from personal electronic devices. Flight attendants say it's a matter of getting your attention during the most sensitive parts of the flight. ""If someone is listening to their music or they're watching a video, and they've got their beats on or their noise-canceling headphones, we want to make sure that, if there is a situation that passengers need to hear and understand, that they will be able to do so,"" said Veda Shook, president of the Association of Flight Attendants. The National Association of Airline Passengers agrees that unplugging for a few minutes is a small price to pay for safety. ""So we do not as passengers want to do anything that will interfere or distract the pilots at this critical time of the flight,"" said Douglas Kidd, the organization's executive director. The pressure is to bring the rules up to date with the proliferation of electronic devices. Even the FCC recommended the increased use of some electronic devices. ""I write to urge the FAA to enable greater use of tablets, e-readers, and other portable electronic devices during flight, consistent with public safety,"" FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said in an August letter. Delta Air Lines is also on record urging the FAA to expand the use of electronic devices in flight but to limit cell phone calls to the ground only. There is congressional pressure for change as well. Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri says the restrictions threaten to undermine public confidence in the FAA.

"Moscow (CNN) -- Boris Berezovsky has died in self-imposed exile in England. He died, whether in total loneliness, or in his murderer's company, we don't yet know, but what we do know is that his death was not natural. Death could not be natural for him -- he was the most alive, the most active, the most unpacified Russian politician. Police have said that the death was consistent with hanging and that there were no signs of a struggle. There is a saying in politics, ""any reference in media is beneficial, except obituary."" And Berezovsky always followed that rule. But now it is possible to speak well of the dead, too. He was no great mathematician or manager -- but he made up for it with his inventive power and tenacity. Almost singlehandedly, he helped to reorganize Russian industrial giants after years of Soviet nepotism, inefficiency and degrading service. He amassed massive wealth and political influence in the early 1990s during the privatization of Russia following the fall of the Soviet Union. Just a few years later this ""entry-level used car seller,"" as the free press of the time had described him, was instrumental in persuading Russian business to join forces and encourage then-President Boris Yeltsin, despite his poor public standing, to protect the country from a Communist return. By this time politics had become his main passion but he unwisely allowed his oil and airline companies to be run by partners and assistants whom he had not known for long. When he went into opposition and his support started to fall away, he lost much of his money while his former friends and opponents received limitless wealth -- paid for through loyalty to the new political regime. The baptized Jew very nearly helped to stop the first Chechen war, by bringing Russian General Alexander Lebed and Yeltsin together to sign an agreement in Khasavyurt -- effectively conceding defeat to the small Islamic nation but the deal would probably have preserved the territorial unity of the country and dozens of thousands of lives. Later he was instrumental in stitching back together the shreds of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), giving autonomy to 11 local kinglets -- that would have guaranteed common trade routes and military collaboration instead of the imperial suppression of the past and the useless dog-poor independence of the present. The free press berated Berezovsky for both of the projects, accusing him of deriving ""private benefits"" then of ""betraying interests of Russian people."" President Vladimir Putin ended the second Chechen war with basically the same agreement -- pulling out Russian forces and effecting more than lavish funding of separatist leader Ahmad Kadyrov -- but the press, its freedom already limited, said little to oppose the deal. The differences between Putin and Berezovsky are less significant than many believe, that's exactly why they worked together so easily. Both believed in the power of media and money, both longed for the greatness of Russia, but neither really believed in the possibility of true people power. Neither really had a considered opinion on anything -- and were ready to change the views to fit. Their differences was merely methodological, but the ruins of the great Soviet Empire that has no religious, ethnic, ideological and cultural unity is a place where people don't need much to become allies and friends and even less to become enemies for life. The last judgement on Berezovsky was made while he was still alive, and while many believed much of it was unfair, it was accurate in related details. Victory in court over his former junior partner Roman Abramovich last year would have meant for Berezovsky not just money that ran out within 10 years of opposition activity, but a recognition of being a contributor to the system that provided Russian oligarchs with football clubs, yachts and billions of dollars. This recognition would have come not just from the left-wing press, but by a civilized Western court from the mouth of Lady Justice Gloster. Berezovsky was an unregistered shareholder of Sibneft, a Russian oil company the government bought back from loyal Abramovich for $13 billion. He sued Abramovich for $5.1 billion, alleging that he was forced to sell his stake for a fraction of its true value. But Berezovsky didn't just lose a lawsuit and money; he was refused any recognition, Judge Gloster didn't just judge, she basically impeached Berezovsky -- for deception, but what is more degrading -- for self-deception. And she was right on this count. Politician Berezovsky had a lot of charmless features. He often did wrong, but his timing was usually good. Many years before his death, while he still lived in Moscow, he was leaving the Russian parliament, and joked: ""Englishmen slip away, Jews bid farewell, but do not leave, I'll be an exception, happily."" He was an exception: he was both a minion of fortune and its ""scapegoat:"" he escaped when his time was up, first from the parliament, then from Russia, finally from life. Nobody ever caught him.","Boris Berezovsky has died in self-imposed exile in England .

"(CNN) -- What was a 60-year-old American with a heart condition doing in the midst of the months-long protests in Bangladesh? To understand the answer, you have to go back a few years in Ruhel Ahmed's life. At 18, he was a student-turned-guerilla freedom fighter wounded in action in the 1971 independence war -- a war that started 42 years ago to the week. Earlier this year, he returned to the homeland where he fought, weaker, but still strong at heart, and inspired by what he has seen. This demonstration is personal for the solar technician from Austin, Texas. ""There's an unfinished job of trying the war criminals,"" said Ahmed, who was in Dhaka on business when the demonstrations started in February. He joined as quickly as he could, camera in hand, documenting his experiences along the way for six weeks. ""I was here for 20 years in America. Now that my family is settled and my kids have grown up, my lifelong dream has been to go back to Bangladesh and see that justice is done. The time has come now,"" he said. The Shahbag protests, named after a Dhaka neighborhood, center on that brutal nine-month war in which Ahmed and other Bangladeshis fought for independence from Pakistan. When one of the top officials in the opposition Jamaat-e-Islami party, Abdul Quader Mollah, was sentenced to life in prison for war crimes on February 5, protesters demanded a death sentence. (Since then, violence has escalated as other war criminals received death sentences, and Jamaat supporters launched counterprotests.) Photos: Shahbag takes over Dhaka intersection . During Ahmed's time in Bangladesh, he would spend about six hours a day among the protesters, as they shared their stories about why they were there. He encountered many among the hundreds of thousands in the crowd who shared the protests with the world via social media, all the while knowing they could be in danger. Ahmed himself said he is willing to die for the cause. Dozens have been killed in incidents related to the protests since February. ""One of the bloggers I met spent the day talking to me. The next day he was chopped in pieces."" Bangladesh on the brink? On March 8, Ahmed was documenting the protest with his camera when chaos erupted. Three Molotov cocktails were tossed from a five-story building, allegedly by supporters of Jamaat. ""Everybody panicked,"" he said. ""One of the speakers at the demonstration said, 'Our parents were not afraid in 1971; we won't be afraid now,'"" according to Ahmed. ""Within 30 seconds, everyone sat down and started chanting slogans."" Of course, scenes of large protests have become more common in recent years, with varying results. When he sees how other protests like those in Egypt's Tahrir Square turned out, he is concerned with how that country still lacks stability, but he says this demonstration is different. ""We are taking Gandhi's approach, we are nonviolent. This is unprecedented. You see kids, mothers, old people who cannot walk,"" he said. Bangladeshi freedom fighter explains why he's protesting . Though he has personal reasons to see ""justice"" and the war criminals punished, many of the protesters he encountered weren't even born in 1971. However, they were familiar with the war through school, and many had fathers, grandfathers or uncles who fought. ""The new generation -- the Facebook generation -- is totally determined,"" he said. He even suggested renaming the site of the protests ""Facebook Square."" ""They're not going to leave until justice is done. I ask them, 'How long?' They say 'As long as it takes.' They want the extreme jihadist party (Jamaat-e-Islami) banned; they want the country to be a secular country. I hope I survive that long to see it is done."" Ahmed recently returned to the United States because of his health. He is going to have a heart procedure done this week. Then he is ready to return for as long as four months to join the continuing protest. Though his return to Bangladesh has been short, his life is forever changed. He has been touched by so many things he saw: from balloons filled with written messages for those who died in the war, to a candlelit vigil, where his camera panned the crowd, showing the ""hopeful, determined"" faces of the demonstrators. ""I'm dying to go back, believe me.""","What was an American doing in the midst of an intense protest in Bangladesh?

"Cairo (CNN) -- It was a welcome more suited for a rock star than a wanted man. A mob of cheering fans surrounded Egypt's high court on Sunday, chanting Bassem Youssef's name. Two years ago, Youssef was a heart surgeon producing satirical YouTube videos from inside his Cairo apartment. Now, he's one of Egypt's best-known television personalities, with a nationally broadcast program that has drawn comparisons to Jon Stewart's ""The Daily Show"" for its irreverent take on Egyptian politics. But the popularity he won by pushing the boundaries of free speech comes with a price. Egypt's public prosecutor summoned Youssef for questioning on Sunday, accusing him of insulting President Mohamed Morsy and Islam. He was released on $2,200 bail in response to three lawsuits filed against him, the prosecutor general's office told CNN. Youssef's satirical commentary didn't stop during his questioning on Sunday. The blue-eyed comedian offered a steady stream of Twitter posts about the experience. He mocked officers recording his physical description for asking him his eye color as he stood in front of them. He poked fun at the prosecutor's office, tweeting that officials could not find a laptop to see episodes from his show. ""A policeman and a lawyer from the General Prosecutors Office want to take their pictures with (me). Could this be the reason I was summoned?"" he wrote. The prosecutor has said Youssef's weekly show is insulting not just to the president but to Islam itself. In recent days, some lawyers filed complaints on behalf of Egyptians making those allegations. But the prosecutor has provided no details, and Youssef is a practicing Muslim. It is a crime in Egypt to insult any religion. In December, Youssef said that he thought Morsy and other Egyptian politicians were accepting his show, ""Al Bernameg"" (""The Program""). ""I think this is actually the best time to have a political satire program in Egypt,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""Basically we are the drama queen of the world, with everything happening. We're kind of the international political soap opera,"" he said. ""So it's a great time and era to have a political satire to comment on everything that's happening."" But he noted that some Egyptians had accused him of being anti-Islam. ""I'm proud to be an Egyptian and a Muslim,"" he told Amanpour. ""My mom is always concerned every time I go on TV. She's afraid that I'm going to be caught and put in prison. But you know, that's what moms do. But I satirize. The way it goes down with people, many are actually accepting it. And actually, it's empowering a lot of people that they think that this speaks on their behalf."" Recently some people critical of Morsy's government have been arrested or brought in for questioning, a tactic critics have said is reminiscent of the ousted Hosni Mubarak government. Some have accused the government of trying to stifle free speech. ""Pathetic efforts to smother dissent and intimidate media is a sign of a shaky regime and a bunker mentality,"" Mohamed ElBaradei, an Egyptian opposition leader and former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, wrote in a Twitter post Saturday. In January, Morsy told CNN he was committed to allowing free speech in his country. Social media helped propel Youssef to fame, and social media posts swelled in support of him Sunday. But after he was released on bail, the TV host offered a more serious message to his 1.2 million Twitter followers: ""Touched by people's support and media attention, however, there are many more activists being prosecuted that deserve to get that support."" CNN's Ian Lee reported from Cairo. CNN's Amir Ahmed reported from Atlanta. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Neda Farshbaf and journalist Adam Makary contributed to this report.","Complaints have been filed alleging that Bassem Youssef insulted Islam, Egypt's president .

"London (CNN) -- Ever wondered where your cat goes after it leaves the house at night? Curious what your dog gets up to when it is off the leash? One man was and he has now designed a GPS tracking collar to get a glimpse into the private life of his pet. Dave Evans, from Marlborough in the UK, wanted to work out why his cat Yollo was putting on weight, so he designed a ""cat nav"" to track where he went at night. With his new GPS collar, Yollo's secrets have been revealed, including his penchant for chasing chickens in the early hours of the morning. ""He was actually traveling a couple of miles pretty much every night, visiting other houses and we suspect those other houses were feeding him,"" says Evans. Now that the mystery of Yollo's expanding waistline has been solved, Evans has developed the ""G-Paws"" device he says will be available soon for purchase by other curious pet owners. Animal tracking devices have been available for years using various technologies and at a wide range of costs so make sure to compare the various brands before purchasing one. G-Paws is based on existing GPS technology and the data can be plotted directly onto Google Earth. The light weight, waterproof device takes a recording every five seconds and Evans says it is accurate to two or three meters so you can see the precise route of your furry friend. But G-Paws doesn't give live data -- so no real-time stalking -- which Evans says has helped him keep the cost and weight of the unit down. It's not just cats who are going to have their secrets blown -- the G-Paws device can also be fitted to a dog's collar. If you want to catch your lazy dog-walker, this could tell you exactly how many miles your pet is getting exercised each day. And Evans says he's even been approached by pigeon racers and hawk owners to see if the G-Paws might work for their birds. ""Everyone who owns a pet -- whether it's a cat, a dog, a pigeon -- has got a curiosity that when they're not around, what's that animal up to?"" he said. For all those greedy cats doing the nightly neighborhood rounds, the multiple dinner days may soon be over.","Pet owner Dave Evans wanted to work out why his cat Yollo was putting on weight .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Sectarian violence flared anew in Iraq Friday as bombers struck several Shiite mosques, killing at least 18 worshipers and wounding scores more, police said. Five of the attacks -- all of them car bombs -- targeted five mosques in Baghdad, killing at least 14 people and wounding 30. According to Baghdad police: . -- One of the blasts struck worshipers leaving the al-Mustafa Mosque in the al-Jihad neighborhood of southwestern Baghdad, killing at least three people and wounding eight. -- In the Zafaraniya neighborhood of southeastern Baghdad, five people were killed and seven wounded when a car bomb exploded outside the al-Sadreen Shiite Mosque. -- In the al-Binook neighborhood, also in southeastern Baghdad, four people were killed and five were wounded when a car bomb exploded outside a Shiite mosque as worshipers were departing. -- In the al-Qahira neighborhood of northeastern Baghdad, two people were killed and five wounded when a car bomb detonated outside the Ahal al-Bayt Shiite Mosque. -- And a car bomb exploded outside a Shiite mosque in eastern Baghdad's Talabiya neighborhood, wounding 10 people. About 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Baghdad, in southern Kirkuk, police said four people were killed and 60 wounded by a car bomb followed by a suicide blast that targeted a Shiite mosque. Most of the casualties were Shiite worshipers, police told CNN. After the blast at the al-Mustafa Mosque, people rushed from the neighborhood to the place of worship to check on their relatives' welfare. ""I told my son not to go to the mosque today, I had a feeling. Thank God he is OK,"" Um Zainab told CNN as she breathed deeply. ""We cannot live like this, we are tired of these ongoing attacks. Oh God, we are tired."" She accused Iraqi politicians of not doing their jobs. ""Shame on you if you can't protect our sons and our areas,"" she said in comments directed to them. The blast shattered glass in the mosque, outside of which bloodstains were visible. Abbas Jaber, who was in the al-Mustafa Mosque when the blast erupted, told CNN in a telephone interview that he blames al Qaeda and Baathists for Friday's attacks, but he also expressed frustration with the Iraqi government and security forces. ""If they can't protect us, then they should leave their positions,"" he said. ""Enough is enough. We cannot stand still like this, watching our relatives and friends get killed every day."" The attacks came as thousands of Sunni demonstrators took to the streets for the third consecutive month in the cities of Falluja, Ramadi, Mosul, Baiji, Samarra, Tikrit and Baquba, in the provinces of Anbar, Nineveh, Salaheddin and Diyala. The protesters have been denouncing what they call second-class treatment by the Shiite-led government. They began in late December, when Sunnis took to the streets in Anbar province, which borders Jordan and Syria, to protest Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's order to arrest the bodyguards of Finance Minister Rafaie al-Esawi, a Sunni. The arrests came hours after President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd who was widely viewed as a stabilizing political force in Iraq, left the country to undergo treatment from a stroke. Al-Esawi then announced his resignation, effective in March, over the government's failure to meet the demands of Sunni demonstrators to end their marginalization, his spokesman, Aysar Ali, said. The protesters, who have also demanded the release of detainees they say have been held without charges, called the government corrupt and accused it of unfairly targeting Iraq's Sunni people. They were angry over an incident that occurred on January 25, also a Friday, when soldiers fired on Sunnis in Falluja who were demanding the Shiite prime minister step down, health officials said. Iraq's Arab Sunnis and Kurds have accused al-Maliki and his Shiite political party of working to consolidate power by cutting them out of the political process, an allegation that comes as U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns about Iraq strengthening its ties with Shiite-dominated Iran. Sunnis make up about 20% of Iraq's estimated population of more than 27 million; about 60% to 65% are Shiite. Since the ouster of Saddam Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime in 2003, Sunnis in Iraq have been largely disaffected. The gulf widened in 2005, when Sunnis boycotted the country's election, opening the way to a government dominated by Shiites. The sectarian divisions translated into violence in the streets in 2006 and 2007, with fighting that nearly ripped the country apart. In the past six years, Iraq has grown safer as a robust form of democracy took hold. Sunnis, Shiites, Kurds and others often work together; there has been more political, economic and social stability. Coalition forces that ousted Saddam Hussein's government have departed. But sectarian violence and instability still grip the country. Read more: Iraq newsmakers: Where are they now?

"(CNN) -- With everyone missing now accounted for from this week's deadly tornado, the long and difficult work of recovery can begin. ""We are beginning the recovery operations,"" Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin told CNN's Piers Morgan late Wednesday. ""There's a lot of debris removal going on throughout the public areas of the street,"" she said. ""You see a lot of utility crews that are out here. There's a lot of construction trucks. You're seeing people walking down the street pulling some wagons, going back into their homes to get their prized possessions."" At least 24 people, including 10 children, were killed in Monday's monster tornado. Another 353 people were injured. The twister ripped through 17 miles of central Oklahoma and pummeled 2,400 homes. The hardest-hit city was Moore. Moore Mayor Glenn Lewis told CNN's Jake Tapper, also Wednesday, that six people previously unaccounted for have been located. Five were found alive. The sixth is dead, and the body was located at the medical examiner's office. The mayor was not sure whether that death was included in the official count of 24. He also told CNN that he would push for a law requiring storm shelters or safe rooms in new homes. ""What we will do is get the stakeholders here in the city ... and we'll discuss what we think we need to have,"" he said. ""Anybody that lives in any tornado area should have (a storm shelter), but it's just the matter of cost."" Young lives remembered . One of the most heartbreaking scenes in Moore is a pile of wreckage where Plaza Towers Elementary School once stood. Seven of the 10 children killed in the storm were inside the school when it collapsed. Heroes or just doing their jobs? Teachers save lives during tornado .

Local resident Adam Baker said he rushed to the school to help in the aftermath. He found some children who had died in a shallow space. ""The ones that were deceased had bumps, scrapes, and they probably would have made it if they weren't pinned. It looked like most of them just drowned -- all blue and stuff.""

Her daughter, who was also at Plaza Towers when the storm struck, survived. ""There should be a place that if this ever happened again during school that kids can get to a safe place,"" she said.

Mayor Lewis said the devastation was so catastrophic that city officials rushed to print new street signs to help guide rescuers and residents through the newly mangled and unfamiliar landscape. President Obama will travel to the area Sunday to witness the damage. He spoke about the people of Oklahoma, briefly, during a presentation at the White House on Wednesday. ""While the road ahead will be long, their country will be with them every single step of the way.

Craig Fugate, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, told CNN the agency is in ""good shape"" to support the recovery in Oklahoma and in other disaster zones, such as rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey and New York. ""We got full allocation last year with the Sandy supplemental funds. We are looking to continue the response here as well as the previous disasters.""

Those helping in Moore include police and firefighters from Joplin, Missouri -- a city all too familiar with grief and devastation. Wednesday marks the second anniversary of a tornado that pulverized Joplin, killing at least 158 people. It was the deadliest single U.S. tornado since federal record-keeping began in 1950.

"Rome (CNN) -- Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito have been ordered to face an Italian appellate court again for the murder of Meredith Kercher. The scene in the Italian courtroom on Tuesday morning was oddly reminiscent of verdicts past in the complicated case, with the exception of two missing characters: Knox and Sollecito. The rest were there, including the lawyers who defended the two former lovers and the lawyers who represented the family of the victim -- and of course the hoard of television cameras who had come for the latest installment of the seemingly endless saga. Kercher, who shared an apartment with Knox in Perugia near the University for Foreigners, was stabbed in her bedroom and left for dead on November 1, 2007. Her autopsy showed that she choked on her own blood. She had not been raped, according to her autopsy, but she was found partially nude, adding an element of mystery to the case that laid the groundwork for what would become a theory that Kercher died as part of a ""sex game gone wrong."" The door to her bedroom was locked from the inside and pulled closed. Knox vows to fight on as Italian judges order retrial . There were no fingerprints on the outside of the door and scant blood in the rest of the house, which eventually led to the theory of a cleanup. Rudy Guede, an Ivory Coast native who was raised by a local family in Perugia, was the first to be found guilty of the crime in a fast-track trial in 2008. His conviction was upheld on appeal but his sentence was reduced from 30 years to just 16 years. Knox and Sollecito were initially found guilty in connection with Kercher's murder, but were ultimately acquitted two years later on appeal. Knox went home to Seattle to finish her studies at the University of Washington. Sollecito moved to Verona to take up studies in robotic surgery. The case seemed to be over. For most people, especially those of us who followed the case closely, the high court hearing was supposed to be just a formality -- they would confirm the acquittal and we could all go home and put the case to rest. Now everything is up in the air again. Italy's highest court decided to reject the acquittal in its entirety and send the case back to a panel of appellate judges to reconsider. What that means in practical terms is nothing short of a complicated, confusing mess. When Knox was first convicted of murder, there was outcry in the United States that she was wrongfully convicted, based on shoddy evidence collected by sloppy Italian police. When she was acquitted two years later, there was nearly as much of an outcry in Italy that the courts had succumbed to American pressure. Now, the outcome is again uncertain, with the only guarantee that whatever happens, it will again cause an outcry -- it's just not clear yet by whom. But even though retrying the case may seem something like dÃ©jÃ  vu, there is going to be one stark difference. Knox will not be in court this time around. During the first trial in which she was convicted and the appeal in which she was acquitted, she was the star of the show that drew the masses to court each week. Her lawyer, Carlo Dalla Vedova, believes Knox will not attend and will be tried in absentia this time. Timeline: Meredith Kercher murder case . Without her presence, it remains to be seen whether the media will be as interested. Even if Knox is convicted this time around, it is unlikely she will ever come back to Italy. There is a valid extradition agreement between the two nations, but the U.S. has not set much of a precedence in returning suspects for such matters. In 1998, an American fighter jet clipped a ski lift cable sending a gondola of 20 passengers to their death in the Italian Dolomite mountain range. Italy had requested their extradition to try them for multiple manslaughter, but the U.S. refused and tried them in a military tribunal instead. They were found not guilty. And in 2012, Italy's high court upheld the conviction of 22 CIA agents and an Air Force colonel in conjunction with the extraordinary rendition of Egyptian cleric Abu Omar from a street in Milan. Again, the U.S. refused to comply with the extradition order. Both previous high-profile cases involved state employees or military members. Knox's case is a private matter with very little precedence. Knox may be safe in Seattle, but her erstwhile boyfriend is far more vulnerable here in Italy. By the same law that protects Knox, Sollecito is also free to skip the retrial. But because he is an Italian citizen, he will not have to face extradition if reconvicted. Experts disagree over extradition for Amanda Knox . The police can simply pick him up and put him in jail. Sollecito's father attended the high court hearing on Monday but he was not present for Tuesday's verdict. He has staunchly defended his son's innocence, but it remains to be seen if he supports having him stay here in Italy for the retrial. The only people who expressed relief at Tuesday's verdict and news of the retrial were Kercher's family. Their lawyer Francesco Maresca said they felt that now, finally, ""justice might be served.""

"(CNN) -- You may remember the episode of ""Seinfeld"" in which George Costanza struggles to find a way to break up with the woman he's dating without hurting her feelings. ""It's not you,"" he tells her. ""It's me."" After decades of saying gay people were depraved and deviant, a bunch of dangerous predators out to recruit children and destroy families, in the last few years those opposed to equal rights for gay people have retreated to a very different message. It's not you, they tell gay Americans. It's us. It's true that you can still find some people on the fringe who will rail against homosexuality as an inherent evil. But watch the mainstream debate, from newspapers to television to the Supreme Court, and what you see are conservatives arguing that the problem isn't gay people themselves, it's how straight people are affected by them. Five things we learned from the arguments . Opponents of gay marriage want everyone to know that they aren't motivated by bigotry, only by a concern for straight people with tender feelings and fragile marriages. We saw this at the Supreme Court on Wednesday, when Chief Justice John Roberts tried to argue that the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act wasn't actually motivated by any disapproval of gay people. He seemed incredulous at the very idea when it was brought up by the attorneys seeking to overturn DOMA. ""So that was the view of the 84 senators who voted in favor of it and the president who signed it?"" he asked repeatedly. ""They were motivated by animus?"" Opinion: Chief justice reveals he's fed up with Obama . The chief justice has a short memory. Back in 1996, those pushing for DOMA were quite forthright about what they thought about gay people. ""I come from a district in Oklahoma who has very profound beliefs that homosexuality is wrong,"" said Tom Coburn, now a U.S. Senator and then a member of the House. ""What they believe is, is that homosexuality is immoral, that it is based on perversion, that it is based on lust... We hear about diversity, but we do not hear about perversity."" His Oklahoma colleague Steve Largent said, ""No culture that has ever embraced homosexuality has survived."" During oral arguments in the DOMA case, Justice Elena Kagan read from a 1996 House Judiciary Committee report on the bill, which said in part, ""Civil laws that permit only heterosexual marriage reflect and honor a collective moral judgment about human sexuality. This judgment entails both moral disapproval of homosexuality, and a moral conviction that heterosexuality better comports with traditional (especially Judeo-Christian) morality."" That kind of rhetoric was common in 1996, but you don't hear it coming from members of Congress much anymore. Why shouldn't gay people be allowed to serve openly in the military? The answer, they say, isn't because gay soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines won't do their jobs well. It's because the straight ones will feel uncomfortable if they have to be in close quarters with gay comrades. It's not about gay service members' performance, it's about the feelings of straight service members (and if you're wondering why we haven't heard too much about the end of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" it's because it turned out that straight military personnel could handle it just fine). Opinion: Bigotry drags marriage back to Supreme Court . The marriage debate has followed the same course. Opponents of gay rights used to argue that gay people were promiscuous and sexually debauched. But when it turned out that many of them just want to join in stable, permanent family commitments, that argument no longer made much sense. So now opponents say the problem isn't the gay marriages themselves, it's the effect those marriages will have on straight marriages. What, in particular, will that effect be? Opponents of marriage equality are having difficulty saying, but it seems they believe that if marriage is ""devalued"" by being open to gay couples, straight people will start ignoring their children, cheating on one another and getting divorced. Opinion: Is 2013 the 'Year of the Gay'? Here again, they have retreated to ground that is increasingly difficult to defend. They now argue that the only real purpose of marriage is to rear children biologically related to both parents, a rather pinched definition. When Justice Kagan asked during oral arguments on Proposition 8 whether, if that was the case, it would be constitutional for a state to ban anyone over 55 from being married, the attorney defending the initiative said no, because marriages between older heterosexuals still foster ""the marital norm, which imposes the obligations of fidelity and monogamy,"" which ""make it less likely that either party to that marriage will engage in irresponsible procreative conduct outside of that marriage."" In other words, existing marriage laws discourage people from cheating on their spouses, but if you let gay people get married, the whole country will turn into an episode of ""Desperate Housewives,"" with husbands and wives jumping in and out of their neighbors' beds willy-nilly. Opinion: How gay rights went mainstream . If that sounds ridiculous to you, you're absolutely right. But that's where ""It's not you, it's me"" eventually leads. If you want to argue that gay rights have to be restricted because of how heterosexuals will react, then you end up saying not only that straight people are frightened of gays and ready to abandon their spouses at the slightest provocation, but that those personal feelings and weaknesses deserve legal protection. At this point, that's about all opponents of gay rights have left. They don't want to sound like bigots, so they've almost stopped talking about gay people entirely. It's not you, they say, it's us. Well, they're right about that. Just maybe not in the way they think. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Waldman.","Paul Waldman: Opponents of marriage equality say they aren't motivated by bigotry .

"(CNN) -- Franklin D. Roosevelt had his Hundred Days. Papa Francesco has had a little less than a month. Yet, like FDR, he has used bold gestures to alert the world that things in the Catholic Church would not be returning to business as usual. For Catholics, images conveyed in a genuine way can be symbols of deeper realities. We are a sacramental church. God speaks to us through his word, but that word is often accompanied by ritual, gesture and symbol. Pope Francis really believes in simplicity. So far, he has waved off any vestige of opulence (gold pectoral crosses and ermine lined mantles), walks rather than rides in a chauffeured limo, and for now at least refuses to live in the Apostolic Palace (a complex oxymoron, what apostle ever lived in a palace?). He chooses to live in a less pretentious guest house. He invokes the patron saint of evangelical poverty, St. Francis, but this also comes from his Jesuit formation. The vow of poverty and the commitment to the poor is taken seriously among the Sons of Loyolaâ€”at least the ones I know. Forming young people to be ""men and women for others"" is not an idle slogan for a lamppost banner. Jesuits really do it and do it well. Pope Francis washes youths' feet at detention center . This may seem to the cynical a mere show or public relations, and a few of those cynics are in the church. But something tells me this is the real thing. This is how he lived in Buenos Aires. He could have had a palace and all the accoutrements of fine living, and yet he chose something elseâ€”something simple, and closer to the people he wished to serve. On Thursday, he washed the feet of young juvenile offenders at a detention center in Rome. Among them were two women; one of them was a Muslim. Let Catholics around the world take note. I can only marvel at this generous and loving gesture. But in Catholic life, rituals are usually accompanied by words. Sometimes the words are difficult to understand or are prayed in flat and boring tones as though the celebrant doesn't believe them. But when word and ritual come together in the best way, it can strike fire in human hearts. Pope Francis has uttered some marvelous words to accompany his actions. To his frail predecessor, ""We are brothers."" To the gardeners and janitors of the Vatican, ""If we have a closed heart, we have a heart of stone."" To priests, an exhortation to ""pray over the realities of the everyday lives"" of their parishioners, and ""their troubles, their joys, their burdens and their hopes."" To the young people at the prison, ""Help one another. This is what Jesus teaches us. This is what I do and I do it with my heart."" Why did the pope wash prisoners' feet? Simple, direct words from the heart of a pastorâ€”words people can and will remember because they are accompanied by actions. Eventually, the novelty of all this will fade, but the tasks ahead for the Catholic Church will not. Repairing its shattered credibility, especially with the young, will be awaiting Pope Francis each morning with his coffee. Who will advise him? What kinds of men will he choose as bishops? How strong will he be in the face of certain opposition within and outside the church? We will see. ""Francis, rebuild my church,"" said the Lord to the Poverello of Assisi. Pope Francis I'm sure also hears this same, ""small, still, voice."" But perhaps we are in for even more surprises. The new pontiff has yet to complete the ritual of taking possession of his four basilicas in Rome. These highly ritualized events are accompanied by droves of cardinals and other clerics and offer the pope an occasion to say a few words to mark the occasion. Opinion: Pope Francis' humble superiority . It was during one such ceremony in January 1959, at St. Paul Outside the Walls, that Pope John XXIII shocked the world by calling for an ecumenical council. Could Pope Francis do the same? If he did, another Roosevelt --Teddy--might say, ""Bully! "" So would I. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steven Avella.","Steven Avella: Pope Francis has used bold gestures to signal changes to come .

"(CNN) -- Out of all the case files made public by the FBI online, the most popular is a memo from 1950 titled ""FLYING SAUCERS,"" the agency said this week. The mysterious report from Guy Hottel, special agent in charge in Washington, begins with this: . ""An investigator for the Air Force stated that three so-called flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico. They were described as being circular in shape with raised centers, approximately 50 feet in diameter. Each one was occupied by three bodies of human shape but only 3 feet tall."" The name of the source is blacked out. So did the bureau take it seriously? ""It certainly looks like, they thought this was third-hand information,"" said FBI historian John Fox. Either it was the result of a hoax, he said, or ""someone was simply reporting hearsay."" Still, over a million people have looked at the sensational memo online. The account goes on to say that the bodies were ""dressed in metallic cloth of a very fine texture. Each body was bandaged in a manner similar to the blackout suits used by speed fliers and test pilots."" The memo also relays a potential explanation for why the flying saucers were found in New Mexico. ""The Government has a very high-powered radar set up in that area,"" the allegation says, ""and it is believed the radar interferes with the controlling mechanism of the saucers."" The FBI took no further action on the case. Although the file was first released in the 1970s, it was posted online in 2011 as part of the Vault, unleashing a flood of tabloid headlines about little green men. In an article headlined "" 'Aliens exist' say real-life X-Files,"" the London tabloid The Sun said the memo appeared to back the claim that extraterrestrials landed in Roswell, New Mexico. But in a new commentary posted this week, the FBI said that since this memo was dated three years after the supposed Roswell landing, ""there is no reason to believe the two are connected."" The memo is part of a cache of hundreds of pages of accounts under the heading ""Unexplained Phenomenon,"" describing claims of UFO sightings, spacecraft debris and alien landings. Also posted in the Vault are hundreds of files on some of the FBI's most storied criminal cases such as Al Capone and Bonnie and Clyde and John Dillinger. It also includes entertainers: Marilyn Monroe and Frank Sinatra and Tupac Shakur. Many of the files chronicle cases in which agents used painstaking methodologies and high-risk raids to solve crimes and capture dangerous fugitives. By comparison, Fox says, ""the descriptions here of you know, 50-foot diameter saucers and human-shaped three-foot tall metallic-clothed aliens -- that's unique.""

"London (CNN) -- Try as it might, the British government just can't seem to get radical cleric Abu Qatada out of the UK. The government lost another round Wednesday in its long-running attempt to deport Abu Qatada to Jordan. The Court of Appeal in London denied the government's attempt to overturn a different panel's decision to keep Abu Qatada -- accused of raising money for terrorist groups and inspiring one of the 9/11 hijackers -- in Britain. Home Secretary Theresa May has until April 17 to appeal the latest ruling. ""This is not the end of the road. Government remains determined to deport Abu Qatada,"" the official UK Home Office Twitter feed said. ""We will consider the judgment on Abu Qatada carefully and plan to seek leave to appeal. ""In the meantime we continue to work with the Jordanians to address the outstanding legal issues preventing Abu Qatada's deportation."" A Jordanian national, Abu Qatada is wanted in his home country and has been been tried and convicted in absentia on two charges of conspiracy to cause explosions, court documents say. In January 2012, the European Court of Human Rights blocked Britain from sending him to Jordan because of fears that evidence obtained by torture could be used against him at the trial planned by the Middle Eastern country. The Home Secretary decided last April that assurances given by the Jordanian government had eliminated that risk and ordered that his deportation go ahead. But Abu Qatada appealed to the UK's Special Immigration Appeals Commission, which found in November that ""there still existed a real risk of a flagrant denial of justice."" The Court of Appeal ruled Wednesday that May's appeal against that SIAC ruling was not justified. UK authorities accuse Abu Qatada of raising funds for terrorist groups, including organizations linked to the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and say he has publicly supported the violent activities of those groups. Videos of his preaching were found in a German apartment used by some of those involved in the 9/11 attacks on the United States, including ringleader Mohammed Atta. Abu Qatada has denied the allegations against him. Also known as Omar Othman, Abu Qatada arrived in the United Kingdom in 1993 and applied for asylum on the grounds that he had been tortured by Jordanian authorities. He came to Britain on a forged United Arab Emirates passport, according to court documents, and claimed asylum for himself, his wife and their three children. Britain has been trying to deport Abu Qatada since 2005, but his legal appeals have kept him in the country. He was ordered back to prison earlier this month after evidence suggested he had violated his bail conditions. These include an order that prohibits him from allowing cell phones to be turned on in his house, and a ban on devices such as rewritable CDs and flash drives. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro contributed to this report.","British government loses its latest bid to deport Abu Qatada, also known as Omar Othman .

"(CNN) -- It's been a very swift turn of events. Until a few days ago Bosco Ntaganda, wanted for war crimes and for crimes against humanity, was at large. Then, in a surprising move, the Congolese Army general and ex-rebel leader turned himself in at the U.S. Embassy in Rwanda after spending the past few months in hiding in North Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). For over six years, Ntaganda has been sought as a suspect for crimes under international law that include murder, rape and the use of child soldiers. On Tuesday he was in front of the judge at the International Criminal Court. Some of us at Amnesty International who work on the DRC were in The Hague to see the proceedings get under way. We arrived at the courtroom early. Ntaganda sat before the presiding judge of Pre-Trial Chamber II, accompanied by his defense counsel, which is being led by Hassane Bel-Lakhdar. ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda was across the courtroom. The public gallery's 170 places were soon packed with members of the diplomatic corps, the press, representatives from several other NGOs, and various units of the court. We sat between representatives of the prosecution and the defense, following the trilingual hearing via simultaneous translation. Presiding Judge Ekaterina Trendafilova led the hearing in English, the defense counsel answered in French and Ntaganda replied in Kinyarwanda. The judge asked Ntaganda to confirm his identity, occupation and that he had been informed of the charges against him, as well as his rights as a defendant. ""Yes, I have been informed,"" Ntaganda stated quietly. He affirmed he was born in Rwanda in 1973 and that he was a member of the military before his transfer to The Hague. From leader of an armed group to a general in the Congolese army, Ntaganda has appeared in eastern DRC in various incarnations over the years. He is famously known for wining and dining in restaurants frequented by United Nations staffers and international journalists. Despite an existing ICC arrest warrant, Ntaganda was promoted within the army in 2009. Ntaganda was first named in an arrest warrant by the ICC more than six years ago. He faces charges for 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for crimes allegedly committed in DRC's Ituri Province between 2002 and 2003. But his decision to turn himself in on March 18, and the exact reasons behind his ""self-referral,"" remain unclear. Though neither the United States nor Rwanda are parties to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, Amnesty International welcomes both states' cooperation with the court in ensuring Ntaganda's transfer to The Hague. In April 2012, following mounting pressure from the Congolese authorities to arrest him, Ntaganda allegedly led a mutiny and created the M23 armed group. We have documented numerous human rights abuses by M23 fighters between March and September 2012, including unlawful killings, forced recruitment of children and rape. This first court appearance of Ntaganda hopefully provides a glimmer of hope for victims who have long awaited an opportunity for justice for crimes committed in Ituri in 2002 and 2003. In court, Ntaganda stated he did not believe the allegations against him. Before he could go any further, Judge Trendafilova politely interrupted him to state that this hearing was not meant to address questions of innocence or guilt, but was an initial appearance before the court. In his closing remarks, defence lawyer Bel-Lakhdar said he planned to request provisional release for his client, pending trial. Ntaganda will join Thomas Lubanga in prison, who was his former commander in the Patriotic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (FPLC) before Ntaganda went on to create M23. Lubanga is currently serving a 14 year sentence after being convicted by the ICC last year. Ntaganda's initial hearing marked the beginning of what may become a long process -- the next hearing is scheduled for September 23, when it will be determined whether or not the case will proceed to trial. It is, however, just one step towards bringing justice to victims and building sustained security in eastern DRC. Ultimately, it remains the responsibility of the Congolese authorities to bring all suspected perpetrators of crimes against international human rights and humanitarian law to trial. The DRC government must fulfill the promise made by Congolese Minister of Information Lambert Mende to fully cooperate with the ICC during its investigations into crimes committed in North Kivu. They must also commit to apprehending Sylvestre Mudacumura, the military commander of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), who has faced an ICC arrest warrant since July 2012. However, the alleged crimes of these two individuals represent only a fraction of the human rights abuses committed in eastern DRC over the past two decades. It is up to the Congolese authorities to urgently rebuild the national justice system to ensure that justice and reparation are available for all victims, instead of relying solely on the ICC.","Congolese general Bosco Ntaganda appears at ICC for first hearing .

"(CNN) -- It was announced a few hours before April Fool's Day, but the appointment of one of the most controversial characters in European football is no laughing matter for one English Premier League soccer club. Sunderland's American owner Ellis Short hopes Paolo Di Canio can keep the struggling team in the top flight, but his vice-chairman -- British MP David Miliband -- has already resigned his role in protest. ""In the light of the new manager's past political statements, I think it right to step down,"" the ex-foreign secretary said on his website following Sunday's news that Di Canio will replace the sacked Martin O'Neill on a two-and-a-half-year contract. Miliband, who had intended to retain his role at Sunderland despite taking a new job with an international humanitarian organization based in New York which will see him give up his South Shields constituency, was referring to the Italian's right-wing leanings. ""I am a fascist, not a racist,"" Di Canio infamously told Italian news agency ANSA after making a straight-arm salute to the fans of his hometown club Lazio during a match against Rome rival Lazio in 2005. He was later fined and suspended for one match by Italian football authorities after another so-called ""Roman salute"" during a match against Livorno. A ex-member of Lazio's notorious hardcore fan group the ""Irriducibili,"" Di Canio admitted in his autobiography that he is ""fascinated"" by Italy's former dictator Benito Mussolini, who enacted anti-Semitic laws and oversaw the deporting of thousands of Italian Jews to concentration and death camps. Lazio has this season been charged four times with racist behavior by its fans. Di Canio's politics seem to come in stark conflict with Sunderland's recent attempts to establish itself in the African market. Saturday's home match against Manchester United, a 1-0 defeat that proved to be O'Neill's last in charge, marked the start of a collaboration with the foundation of Nelson Mandela. The former South African leader's messages of peace and equality will be promoted for the next three years, Sunderland's marketing director Mike Farnan told CNN on Friday. Miliband had a key role in the club's African push, Farnan said. Di Canio is not a man who has a history of peace -- as a player he was banned for 11 matches for pushing over a referee while at English club Sheffield Wednesday in 1998. His only previous managerial job, at English third division club Swindon, ended in February when the 44-year-old quit due to the club's financial problems. His arrival at Swindon in May 2011 prompted one of the club's main sponsors -- the GMB trade union -- to withdraw its backing due to his political views. Di Canio did lead Swindon out of England's bottom division, and after he quit said he was ready for a top job in a country where he was widely recognized as one of the most talented players of his era during spells with West Ham and Sheffield Wednesday. ""Paolo is hugely enthused by the challenge that lies ahead of him,"" Short said on Sunderland's website. ""He is passionate, driven and raring to get started. ""The sole focus of everyone for the next seven games will be to ensure we gain enough points to maintain our top-flight status. I think that the chances of that are greatly increased with Paolo joining us."" Di Canio issued a statement through the club on Monday insisting that his personal politics had nothing to do with his job, and that past media reports had blown his comments out of proportion. ""I expressed an opinion in an interview many years ago. Some pieces were taken for media convenience. They took my expression in a very, very negative way -- but it was a long conversation and a long interview. It was not fair,"" he said. ""Talk about racism? That is absolutely stupid, stupid and ridiculous. The people who know me can change that idea quickly,"" he added, saying that former teammates Trevor Sinclair and Chris Powell -- who are black -- were his best friends when he was playing in England. ""I don't want to talk about politics because it's not my area. We are not in the Houses of Parliament, we are in a football club. I want to talk about sport. I want to talk about football, my players, the board and the fans."" Sunderland CEO Margaret Byrne added that the club ""has a strong ethos and ethics and that has not changed in any shape or form."" ""Paolo is an honest man, a man of principle and a driven, determined and passionate individual. To accuse him now, as some have done, of being a racist or having fascist sympathies, is insulting not only to him but to the integrity of this football club,"" she said. ""It is disappointing that some people are trying to turn the appointment of a head coach into a political circus."" Despite his controversies on and off the pitch, the charismatic Di Canio was popular with many fans of the clubs he played for. In 2001 he was given FIFA's Fair Play Award for a ""special act of good sportsmanship"" while playing for West Ham, when he picked the ball up and refused to score as an opposing goalkeeper lay injured. Having started his career with Lazio in 1985, he went on to play for top Serie A clubs Juventus, Napoli and AC Milan before a successful season in Scotland with Celtic earned him a move to England.","Former British politician quits soccer club in protest at controversial appointment .

"(CNN) -- He is one of Nollywood's most popular film directors, hailing from a famous family of movie stars that have shaped Nigeria's entertainment industry for decades. Yet Jeta Amata had other career plans while growing up. ""I wanted to be a pilot,"" says the award-winning filmmaker. ""I was about six and I was intrigued with the fact that something could fly up there and that some man could control it; I wanted to control the plane."" But Amata's dreams to conquer the skies were put aside as his family genes kicked in. Instead, Amata went on to reach great heights with his feature films, winning international acclaim and carving out a career as one of Nigeria's most prominent directors. Read this: Netflix of Africa' brings Nollywood to world . For his latest film, ""Black November,"" Amata broke new ground working with both Hollywood and Nollywood talent. An impressive roster of American film stars, including Mickey Rourke, Kim Basinger, Vivica Foxx, Michael Madsen and Tom Sizemore, as well as musicians Akon and Wyclef Jean, is joined by famous Nigerian actors Hakeem Kae-Kazim and Enyinna Nwigwe. Amata's family is also part of the star-studded cast. Along with Amata's father, Fred, the film stars his wife, Mbong Amata, as the female lead. Spotlight on Niger Delta . ""Black November"" is a drama about Nigeria's Niger Delta region -- a part of Nigeria still struggling to overcome a past history of rebel violence. The area is the world's third-largest wetland but decades of oil drilling had turned it into one of the most oil-polluted places on Earth. ""For years now I've been wanting to make something on Niger Delta,"" says Amata. ""I wrote three scripts over the past maybe eight years about the Niger Delta and as things kept escalating it became almost more difficult to make but I got to the point where I knew it just has to be now."" Amata, who grew up in the Niger Delta, titled his film ""Black November"" after the month when local environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa was killed. In 1995, Nigerian writer and Nobel Peace Prize nominee Saro-Wiwa was one of nine environmentalists arrested and executed by the then military regime. The news provoked international outrage and Nigeria was suspended from the British Commonwealth until 1999. Read this: Veteran director reveals secrets of Nollywood's success . Many of the Delta protests led by Saro-Wiwa targeted oil giant Royal Dutch Shell, which was sued by families of the activists, who accused the company of complicity in the deaths. The company said it never advocated any act of violence against the activists and tried to persuade the government to grant clemency. In 2009, the company agreed to an out-of-court settlement with the families, paying them $15.5 million. Amata, who had once met Saro-Wiwa through his father, says he was affected by the activist's death. ""I have always wanted to tell a part of his story,"" he says. ""Most of the politics in his story I didn't want to get into. I wanted to get to the human part of his story. What excites me about people's stories are the human parts of them, not necessarily the politics. Even in 'Black November' I know I touch on politics a bit but I'm more concerned about the feelings of the people, about what they've been through and where they are going through."" Amata says his goal is for viewers to realize what people in the region have been through over the past few decades. ""We want the world to stand with us,"" he says. ""We are not trying to fight the government, trying to fight the oil companies, no -- we are trying to repair what has been damaged,"" adds Amata. ""We can change the Niger Delta of Nigeria."" Nigeria's booming film industry . Nollywood, the term coined for Nigeria's mega film industry, has grown in recent years into a mighty movie-making machine, capturing audiences with its universal themes and arresting stories of urban culture. The booming industry has been notorious for churning out over 1,000 films a year which often struggle with shoe-string budgets and low production values. Amata, who is often praised for the high production values and strong narratives of his movies, says he initially disliked the Nollywood name, which sounded like ""not-Hollywood.""

""If I make a couple of Hollywood films its not going to change who I am and where I come from,"" he says. ""I built Nollywood with people out there,"" he adds. ""I was one of the first few people to make films. I worked hard for the market. I learned like all the Nollywood directors how to pull a camera apart and how to put it together.

"(CNN) -- Many people thought that the massacre of 20 young school children and six educators by a gunman wielding an assault weapon would change the terms of the debate over firearms regulation. It appears that they were wrong. Not only does it now seem that Congress will not reinstate the assault weapons ban, but it also appears unlikely to place restrictions on the size of magazines so as to reduce the number of bullets that can be fired before reloading is required. For opponents of these measures, such a result would be vindication of what they argue is the absolute right to bear arms set forth in the Second Amendment. Such arguments ignore the fact that in its 2008 decision recognizing that the Second Amendment created a personal right to bear arms unrelated to serving in a militia, the Supreme Court also recognized the permissibility of ""reasonable"" restrictions on that right, including potentially prohibiting carrying ""dangerous and unusual weapons."" For others, however, a legislative outcome that includes neither an assault weapons ban nor restrictions on magazines is just more of the same -- a powerful lobby using aggressive tactics to persuade Congress to ignore majority support for these measures. I must say, however, that if this turns out to be the result, I will be sad but hardly shocked. Gun bill filibuster? In 1978, while serving as the Treasury official overseeing the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, we proposed regulations that would have created a centralized database of firearms transactions (which would not have included the names of individual retail purchasers). The purpose of such a database was to allow speedier tracing of firearms used in crimes and to allow the ATF to analyze the flow of firearms to particular dealers, which would suggest which dealers were diverting firearms to the illegal market. Even though these proposals would have had no effect on anyone's right to own any firearm, the NRA mounted a campaign against them, and Congress voted to prohibit any such database from ever being established, a prohibition that remains in effect today. During the debate over these regulations, I heard from some members of Congress that while the proposals made sense, politics precluded them from expressing support. Thirty years later, it seems little has changed. So given this state of play, what should be the focus of those who believe that added regulations of firearms would help save lives? Despite emotions, little happens legislatively after mass shootings . Obviously, a first step is to continue to make the case for an assault weapons ban and limitations on the size of magazines. The issue, after all, should be not whether such steps avoid all mass shootings, but whether they could save some lives. Would it not have been worth it even if some of those murdered in Newtown could have survived because the shooter did not have an assault weapon? But there are other things that can and should be done: . 1. We need to work to ensure that Congress at least finally creates a system of universal background checks for all firearms purchasers. Many people believe such a system exists today; it does not. Along with such a system, we need to improve the databases used in connection with such checks. 2. Focus should be placed on what is happening in particular states. For example, states such as New York and Colorado have made meaningful changes in gun laws in response to the spate of recent mass shootings, and other states have meaningful restrictions on firearms possession. It is true, however, that attitudes toward guns are different in different regions of the country. If certain states choose to have fewer firearms regulations, those choices should not be allowed to interfere with the policy decisions of those states that decide that a safer society requires more firearms regulations and fewer guns on the streets. Yet this is precisely what happens now where guns sold in low- or no-regulation states end up on the streets of those cities and states with far stricter regulation. Thus, we need -- as is being proposed -- to toughen the laws on ""straw man"" purchases and firearms trafficking and to make it a federal crime to transport a gun into a state where possession of that gun would be illegal. 3. Congressionally imposed restrictions placed on ATF's ability to enforce existing laws should be removed. This includes ending the ban on the creation of a centralized firearms transaction database, but also ending restrictions like the ban on ATF's ability to require gun dealers to conduct annual inventories to determine whether firearms have been lost or stolen. (Unfortunately we are instead seeing moves to make these kinds of restrictions permanent.) Opponents of new firearms regulations often argue that existing laws should be enforced before we pass new ones. Unfortunately, Congress is too often pressed to impose rules that make such enforcement less effective. Opinion: More gun mayhem, and yet we wait for action . In the end, a sensible approach to gun violence would, among other non-law enforcement steps, include prohibitions directed at assault-type weapons, more regulation of handguns, less regulation of traditional long guns and working to make sure that federal, state and local law enforcement have the tools to enforce the laws relating to firearms. Unfortunately, logic does not always operate when the topic is guns. What are your views on gun control? Share your thoughts .

"(CNN) -- North Korea upped the ante Tuesday in its war of words, threatening to target South Korea and U.S. military bases. Even by North Korean standards, the series of threats this month by leader Kim Jong Un and ensuing actions have been incredibly provocative, making the situation on the Korean Peninsula more worrisome. Here's a look at Kim's escalating rhetoric and his country's actions since he came to power after his father's death in 2011: . March 2012 . As South Korea hosts world leaders at an international nuclear security summit in Seoul, North Korea moves a long-range rocket toward a launch pad. Pyongyang says it plans to carry out the test in mid-April as part of a commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the nation's founder. April 2012 . Defying warnings by U.S. President Barack Obama that Kim has nothing to gain from provocations, Pyongyang launches the rocket. It breaks apart and falls into the sea. August 2012 . Kim visits the same military unit behind a 2010 attack on South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island, where he reminds the troops to be ready to fight a ""sacred war"" against Seoul. The North Korean leader makes the veiled threat just ahead of an annual war games conducted on the Korean Peninsula by the United States and South Korea. The dictator calls the joint Seoul-Washington military exercises a ""war rehearsal"" to invade. October 2012 . North Korea claims to have developed missiles that can reach the U.S. mainland. December 2012 . Kim announces plans to launch another long-range rocket in a renewed effort to send a satellite into space. Two days after the government announces the launch window is being pushed back because of technical issues, the rocket lifts off from the west coast of North Korea. Pyongyang declares the mission a success. January 2013 . North Korea announces it is planning a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches, all of which it says are part of a new phase of confrontation with the United States. The threats come two days after the U.N. Security Council approves the broadening of sanctions in response to the rocket launch in December that apparently put a satellite in orbit. February 2013 . North Korea carries out an underground nuclear bomb test on February 12. The test is designed ""to defend the country's security and sovereignty in the face of the ferocious hostile act of the U.S.,"" the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency says at the time, referring to new U.S.-led sanctions. ""This nuclear test is our first measure, which displayed our maximum restraint. ... If the U.S. continues with their hostility and complicates the situation, it would be inevitable to continuously conduct a stronger second or third measure."" March 2013 . Angered by U.N. Security Council sanctions over its nuclear test, North Korea threatens for the first time to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the United States and South Korea. It's one of a series of provocative threats and, in some cases, actions by North Korea that begins with Pyongyang saying it is scrapping the 1953 truce that effectively ended the Korean War. At the same time, it cuts off its direct phone links with South Korea at Panmunjom, the abandoned village that sits on the border between the two countries. North Korea then doubles down on the threat, saying it is nullifying the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. One of the country's top generals, according to published reports, claims Pyongyang has nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that are ready to be fired. Although U.S. officials don't believe North Korea is in a position to strike the United States, the Obama administration responds to the threat by announcing plans to deploy additional ground-based missile interceptors on the West Coast. U.S. officials also say B-52 bombers are making flights over South Korea as part of annual, joint military exercises this month that have enraged North Korea. Pyongyang releases a new propaganda video that shows an imaged missile attack on U.S. government buildings in Washington, including the White House and the Capitol. The roughly four-minute video is posted on the YouTube channel of the North Korean government website Uriminzokkiri. North Korea threatens Tuesday to attack U.S. and South Korea bases, putting its troops on alert. It announces through state-run media that the military is ready for combat. The threat follows claims that U.S. B-52 bombers again made flights Monday over South Korea. CNN's Elise Labott, Jethro Mullen and Brad Lendon contributed to this report.","North Korea on Tuesday threatens to attack U.S. and South Korean bases .

"(CNN) -- What may be the most famous religious relic of them all, the Turin Shroud, made a rare appearance on Easter Saturday -- on Italians' TV screens. One of Benedict XVI's last acts as pope, according to Vatican Radio, was to authorize the broadcast of video of the shroud from Turin Cathedral, where the mysterious Christian relic is kept, out of sight, in a bulletproof, climate-controlled glass case. According to Vatican Radio, only once before have images of the centuries-old linen cloth been broadcast. That was in 1973, at the request of then-Pope Paul VI. Some Christians believe the shroud, which appears to bear the imprint of a man's body, to be Jesus Christ's burial cloth. The body appears to have wounds that match those the Bible describes as having been suffered by Jesus on the cross. Many scholars contest the shroud's authenticity, saying it dates to the Middle Ages, when many purported biblical relics -- like splinters from Jesus' cross -- surfaced across Europe. Even the Roman Catholic Church does not insist the shroud was used to wrap the body of Jesus. Its official position is that the shroud is an important tool for faith regardless of its authenticity. Archbishop of Turin Cesare Nosiglia will lead a service from the cathedral on Saturday afternoon during which the images of the shroud will be broadcast, according to Vatican Radio. A video message from Pope Francis was played as part of the broadcast. In it, he thanked God for the technological advances that have made it possible for the ""Man of the Shroud"" to be seen by, and reach out to, so many people. ""This image, impressed upon the cloth, speaks to our heart,"" he said. ""This disfigured face resembles all those faces of men and women marred by a life which does not respect their dignity, by war and violence which afflict the weakest ... And yet, at the same time, the face in the Shroud conveys a great peace; this tortured body expresses a sovereign majesty."" To coincide with the television broadcast, a new Shroud 2.0 app was launched Friday. The app, released in several languages, allows users to scroll over a high-definition image of the shroud and find out more about its history and religious significance. Giulio Fanti, a professor of mechanical engineering at Padua University in Italy and co-author of the book ""The Mystery of the Shroud,"" said the app will be ""very useful"" to the scientific community. Until now, researchers have not had access to a digitalized picture of the shroud, he told CNN. Studies looking into the formation of the image have been based on macroscopic data. ""I hope the app will give us the chance of having microscopic data that will be very useful to confront different scientific research on the shroud, which, until now, is still a mystery,"" he said. In 2010: Pope prays before Shroud of Turin . Disputed dating . Carbon dating conducted in the 1980s suggested the shroud dates from the Middle Ages. But researchers at Padua University say their more recent tests show the cloth does indeed date back to between 280 B.C. and 220 A.D. -- which could place it within Christ's lifetime . Fanti's book, written with religious journalist Saverio Gaeta and published last year, spells out those findings. ""We carried out three alternative dating tests on the shroud, two chemical and one mechanical, and they all gave the same result and they all traced back to the date of Jesus, with a possible margin of error of 250 years,"" Fanti told CNN. For the mechanical test, they constructed a machine at Padua University to carry out traction and compression tests on tiny fibers from the linen fabric, measuring only 10 thousandths of a millimeter, he said. The test samples were found in dust from the shroud, he said. Nosiglia said, "" ... since there is no degree of security on the belonging of the materials on which these experiments were carried out to the sheet Shroud, the Owners and Custodian declare that it can not recognize any serious value to the results of these alleged experiments."" Author and historian Stephen Mansfield uses the image of the Turin Shroud on the cover of his book, ""Killing Jesus,"" which reveals new details around the crucifixion. In 2010: Shroud of Turin on display for first time since 2002 restoration . The new research into whether the linen cloth dates back to Jesus' time is fascinating, he said. ""My understanding is that there's not unshakeable evidence but it's more difficult to dismiss the shroud now,"" he told CNN's Piers Morgan. ""Some of the scientific evidence has proven that it is, as you say, older, that there are some inexplicable factors, in the stains and the composition of it."" He chose to put the shroud's image on his book cover ""because it's simply an icon of Jesus in this generation,"" he said, whether its origins are proven or not. ""People say, 'that's maybe the oldest picture of Jesus' -- they don't think of it being something that has to be scientifically confirmed,"" he added. 'Truly mysterious image' Benedict prayed before the shroud in 2010, when it went on display for six weeks at Turin Cathedral, its first public showing since undergoing a major restoration in 2002. Before that, it was last on display in 2000. The shroud -- more than 14 feet long and 3 feet, 7 inches wide -- was restored to remove a patchwork repair done by 16th century nuns after the cloth was damaged in a fire. Thirteen years ago, when Benedict was still Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, he wrote that the shroud was ""a truly mysterious image, which no human artistry was capable of producing."" The shroud is not scheduled to go on public view again for more than a decade, so the TV broadcast represents a rare chance for the faithful to get a glimpse of the famous relic.

"Yeongpyeong Island, South Korea (CNN) -- It is easy to dismiss North Korea's threats against South Korea as bluster, unless you're on this island, within sight of North Korean waters. The residents of Yeongpyeong Island, like any other South Koreans, do their best to make ends meet, in their case mostly by fishing and trapping crabs. But they live in the shadow of a belligerent North Korea, a mere four miles away. Angered by tougher U.N. sanctions and joint military exercises by the United States and South Korea, Pyongyang has issued a range of bombastic threats in recent weeks. The slew of fiery rhetoric from Pyongyang has included threats of pre-emptive nuclear strikes against the United States and South Korea, as well as the declaration that the armistice that stopped the Korean War in 1953 is no longer valid. Those who live here worry about the poor weather that is dampening this year's fishing season; they also fear that their homes could be shelled. It's happened before. North Korea shelled Yeongpyeong Island in November 2010, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians. There was no warning. Shells just rained down on the small island, causing widespread panic and destruction. The memories of the attack are still fresh. A few of the destroyed houses have been preserved as a reminder that visitors can see. There are scorched walls, some of them pockmarked with shrapnel and broken glass. Family rooms that were burned out have been left empty. It's a memorial to those who lost their lives, but also a reminder of the danger that North Korea poses to the South, and this community in particular. ""It's been almost three years, and I remember how my heart sank when I witnessed the attacks. Now we are hearing more threats, and I am having this feeling in my chest all over again,"" said Kang In-Gu, a Yeongpyeong resident. The fear was made worse by recent images of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, being feted by the same artillery units that carried out the strike. Their attack is portrayed as a military victory that could be repeated, adding to pressure on South Korea to respond with tough action next time. ""If the North were to carry out another provocation like in 2010, I personally hope that my government will respond very strongly. By doing this, the North will not see South Korea as an easy target but as a strong country instead,"" Kang said. Yeongpyeong Island is a two-hour ferry trip from the South Korean mainland, but the sentiment among residents is that they will not flee. This is the only home they know, another resident said. Also, evacuating can be costly to the majority working-class residents. A mix of economics and loyalty keeps them here. In fact, many residents won't talk on the record to reporters, for fear of further upsetting the island's popularity among tourists. Most observers say North Korea is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile, but it does have plenty of conventional military firepower, including medium-range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles. The heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula came after the North carried out a long-range rocket launch in December and an underground nuclear test last month, prompting the U.N. Security Council to step up sanctions on the secretive government. Nowhere are those tensions felt stronger than on this island. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","Tensions between North Korea and the South have risen recently .

"(CNN) -- As prodigal golfer Tiger Woods resumes the world's No. 1 ranking, his chief sponsor, Nike, unveiled a slogan Tuesday that provokes robust debate on what is redemption and has Woods attained it. ""Winning takes care of everything"" is what Nike declared on its social media outlets after Woods completed his long climb back to the top ranking, more than three years after his extramarital affairs ruined his marriage and embarrassed him. Woods and ex-wife, Elin Nordegren, have two children. Many fans and consumers are now raging against the new campaign by Nike, which stood by Woods in his fall from grace as most other sponsors dumped him. ""Will not buy anything Nike again,"" wrote Melissa Santa-Cruz of Wisconsin on Nike's Facebook page. ""THIS AD MAKES ME SICK!"" wrote Julie Drake, a high school teacher who said she will use the ad for a classroom discussion. ""Shame on you!"" Others, however, endorsed the slogan. ""Love your Ad Nike,"" wrote Brian Edwards. ""Keep up the good work."" Opinion: For Tiger, winning does take care of everything . The passionate opinions roil during a week when redemption is on the minds of Jews celebrating Passover and Christians preparing for Easter. The controversy grows from whether winning indeed absolves transgressions -- and even prompts a return to grace. The narrative plays out in different ways for different public figures. ""I think that winning, especially in Tiger Woods' case, really does change things because it reminds people why they fell in love with him years ago. It was for his game and his ability to consistently make those tough shots over and over again. That's why we're in awe of Tiger,"" said CEO Melinda Travis of PRO Sports Communications, a strategic communications and crisis management firm in Los Angeles. ""Does it erase what he's done? No. But when is it enough?"" Travis said. ""It's easy to criticize from afar, but when you sit across from someone who's experienced public humiliation and a fall from grace and, in Tiger's case, a breakup of an entire family and a permanent change in the way people view him, that's a pretty high price to pay."" The slogan refers to how Woods has motivated himself to become the top golfer again, Nike said. He last held that rank in October 2010. ""Tiger has always said he competes to win,"" Nike said in a statement. ""When asked about his goals such as getting back to number one, he has said consistently winning is the way to get there. The statement references that sentiment and is a salute to his athletic performance."" In professional sports, winning can indeed overshadow a lot of quandaries, said sports analyst LZ Granderson, a CNN contributor. For example, a winning coach won't be fired for players accused of sexual assault or facing too many DUIs, he said. ""Usually a coach is fired because they're not winning,"" Granderson said. ""So it may make me cringe as a parent, I can't help but think of the fact that winning does seem to solve a lot of problems, and if you're losing, that's when everything else is more highlighted."" Analysts also cite how quarterback Michael Vick, who served an 18-month federal prison sentence after pleading guilty to dogfighting, is now playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. Linebacker Ray Lewis faced murder accusations -- later dropped by prosecutors -- in the deaths of two men after the 2000 Super Bowl in Atlanta; this year, Lewis and his teammates on the Baltimore Ravens won the Super Bowl. ""A lot of people have short memories when the person who had these issues starts winning,"" said Robert Tuchman, president of Goviva, a sports and entertainment marketing firm. ""As you can see with Ray Lewis, it doesn't take much to forgive and forget. America loves the story of a person falling down and getting back up and then maybe falling down and getting back up again."" Ethics expert Bruce Weinstein pointed out that Nike contradicts itself because it stopped sponsoring cyclist Lance Armstrong after he admitted to doping in winning seven Tour de France titles. ""This is an amazing story in the worst sense,"" said Weinstein. ""This is a company that dropped Lance Armstrong after mounting evidence made it pretty clear Lance Armstrong won by cheating. So Nike made it clear that winning does not take of everything."" Photos: Redemption through sports . In fact, Travis' firm is representing Tyler Hamilton, a cycling teammate of Armstrong. Hamilton was among those who broke from Armstrong, who then threatened to sue him. Hamilton also wrote about his own use of performance enhancing drugs. Travis declined to comment on Armstrong and Hamilton, but she spoke generally about how she helps athletes overcome setbacks. ""Look, everybody makes mistakes and sometimes they just need help in putting it in context for people: Here's what led me to the decision. And then let people judge it,"" she said. At issue for Woods is whether he, like so many other celebrities whose professional lives are damaged by the revelation of personal failures, has redeemed himself as merely a public figure -- or as a human being, too? ""Certainly in his job, it's a redemption story,"" said David W. Miller, a Princeton University business ethics professor who directs its Faith & Work Initiative. ""Whether it is for him as a human being and his character, I don't know. Time will tell. Someone else will be the judge of that,"" he added. Miller cited how winning didn't take care of everything for basketball star Kobe Bryant, who faced accusations of sexually assaulting a woman in Colorado in 2003 and later settled a federal civil lawsuit for an unspecified amount of monetary damages. ""You have an overly long list of people who are 'winning' -- whether they are in sports or a box office draw or selling platinum albums,"" Miller said. ""The world tells them they're wonderful and they're No. 1 and their sense of probity and respect for others or your own self tends to evaporate."" That's when a lot can go wrong, Miller said. ""I applaud Nike for taking up his rebirth,"" Miller said about Woods. But, he continued, ""the slogan sort of falls on its face, and Tiger Woods is exhibit A for the case because it didn't care of everything three years ago.""","""Winning takes care of everything,"" Nike says on its ad for Tiger Woods .
The slogan is unveiled as Wood is ranked No. 1 in the world, the first time since 2010 .
Some are outraged by the slogan in Woods' case but others laud it .
Has Woods been redeemed as solely a golfer -- or a human being, too?"
"Tasmania (CNN) -- As the sun sets, clouds of smoke begin to glow deep orange and pink. I watch as flames leap from the dark silhouettes of trees and embers are flung high into the night sky. I look over the forest that I have watched day in and day out for almost 15 months. As fire throws an eerie glow across my upper canopy home, I say goodbye. It was over a year ago that I first climbed a rope 60 meters to the top of an old growth Eucalypt in Tasmania's Southern Forests and vowed to remain at that lofty height until the forest was protected. For 449 days, I lived in constant uncertainty about when it would be that I would return to the ground. But I never imagined it would be like this. In early March, a fire started within two kilometers of my tree-sit. It was so close that any change in the wind direction could have brought the flames to my tree within minutes, and I may not have made it out of there alive. I had to get down. Early police investigations found the fire was deliberately lit. That first moment my feet touched earth was incredible and overwhelming. I clung to my climbing rope and didn't want to let go. After being attached physically to the tree by that rope for so long, it was a big step to take to finally let go and walk through the forest. The next big step was the car, which, after only moving as far as the tree could sway for all those months, felt like I was suddenly hurtling along at the speed of light. Then there was an even bigger step -- the house. Being surrounded by four walls and a roof again was certainly something to get used to. While I now hold the Australian record for the longest ever tree-sit, it was never about records. I went up that tree and remained there for one reason -- to protect Tasmania's unique, ancient forests that were, and still are, under threat from industrial scale logging. In early February, the Australian government made a nomination to include 124,000 hectares of threatened Tasmanian forest into the existing World Heritage Area. When I heard the news I sat and watched as honey eaters and pardalotes hopped from branch to branch around me, imagining what it would feel like to descend from the tree knowing this forest would never be logged. Within days the reality began to be exposed around the state logging was continuing unabated in those forests nominated for World Heritage. In response to protests for the logging to stop, Tasmania's deputy premier Bryan Green said that it was only occurring in a small number of coupes where ""existing harvesting operations"" were being completed. Clearly, the fight was far from over. And so, I renewed my determination -- I would stay in the tree for as long as it takes. After preparing myself to stay in the upper canopy of that magnificent tree for an indefinite period of time, the abrupt end of my action was a shock and something I am still coming to terms with. I do not regret one single day being in the tree tops. I am proud of what I have achieved in bringing an international spotlight to these spectacular forests. I can't say it was always easy. There were certainly times when I wondered what on earth I was doing on a tiny platform in the middle of a wild forest, exposed to storms, wind, rain and snow. However, through all the challenges the beauty of the forest shone through. I watched the forest change through all four seasons, as the tree exploded with flowers in summer right through to seeing the entire forest carpeted in thick white snow in the middle of winter. I was lucky enough to have a solar panel and Internet to communicate to the world, allowing me to Skype my way into conferences, festivals and school groups as well as update a blog about life in the tree. For all this technology and communication, the isolation of being alone in the tree tops was often overwhelming. The tree became my closest companion, along with the birds, skunks and many beetles that shared my upper canopy home. While I was in the tree I had thought many times about how much I missed my friends and family and how amazing it would be when I finally reach the earth again and can spend time with them. Now I begin to realize how I was never really alone in that tree. Being on the ground has its advantages of course, and I have enjoyed my first hot bath and sleeping in a proper bed. But there is a hard side to it too, and I miss the tree and the birds more than I could have imagined. I miss the daily visits from the curious currawongs who would hop around on my platform. I miss watching the trees sway in the wind. I miss the sound of boo-book owls calling gently across the moonlit valley. I miss the constant presence of the tree by my side. I may be on the ground but I am no less determined to continue this fight. I will be doing everything I can from the ground to keep the pressure up on the industry and the Australian government. Now that the government has recommended these areas for internationally recognized protection, it is even more critical that people around the globe take a stand to ensure these ancient forests survive for the future.

"(CNN) -- Justin Bieber has been a household name since before he was old enough to drive. We listened as his voice changed and watched him trade in his purple hoodies and signature swoopy hair for low-riding pants and a more voluminous 'do. The 19-year-old pop star is one of many celebrities who've grown up under the proverbial microscope, where the simplest rites of passage -- like grabbing your girlfriend's backside during a passionate make-out session -- are headline fodder. It's nothing we haven't seen before. Stars like Christina Aguilera and Shia LaBeouf would likely agree that the transition from teen sensation to adult icon is seldom seamless. For whatever reason, Bieber might have considered himself to be an exception. ""I think I'll make a smooth transition from a teen star to an adult star,"" he told USA Today in 2011. ""I don't want to grow up too quickly and do anything that's not smart."" Two years later, 2013 is shaping up to be that fateful time in the Canadian-born star's career. In January he was seen holding what sites identified as marijuana in one photograph, while another showed him getting handsy with a female fan. Earlier this month, Bieber had his ""worst birthday,"" and angered fans when he was late to the stage for a sold-out show at London's O2 Arena. The most recent Bieber news isn't any more flattering. According to authorities, the singer's neighbor is accusing him of ""battery and threats"" after a confrontation took place outside his California home on Tuesday. As The New York Times pointed out after the ""Girlfriend"" singer's 18th birthday last year, ""Mr. Bieber can be his own man, sure, so long as he continues to belong to everyone else too."" Despite rejecting comparisons to Justin Timberlake, Bieber would be lucky to moonwalk into adulthood the way the ""Suit & Tie"" singer has. Of course, Timberlake had the support of his boy band 'N Sync behind him when he made the leap. It also helped that there were other male stars around, like the Backstreet Boys, helping to dim the harsh limelight. Bieber doesn't exactly have a counterpart today. While ""Twilight"" stars Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson, or ""Hunger Games"" stars Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson, have distracted the media -- and countless tween fans -- Bieber remains in a league of his own. Miley Cyrus can likely relate. Every step of her own maturation -- from the time she danced with a pole at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards, to her drastic haircut in 2012 -- has made headlines. The ""Can't Be Tamed"" singer and ""Last Song"" actress issued a public apology after a video surfaced of her smoking salvia (an herb sold legally in many health food stores) in 2010. ""But do you really think it was a mistake?"" Marie Claire's Kimberly Cutter asked Cyrus in a 2011 interview. ""Obviously college kids your age all over America are smoking bongs with a lot more than salvia in them."" ""But they're not Miley Cyrus,"" she said. ""They're not role models. So for me it was a bad decision, because of my fans and because of what I stand for."" Cyrus is getting older, but she's not in and out of court (no offense, Lindsay), or getting into car wreck after car wreck (no offense, Amanda), so isn't the ""good girl gone bad"" label pushing it? Another former Disney princess who's growing up in the public eye is Bieber's former girlfriend, Selena Gomez. The singer-actress is attempting to shed her Disney image (without muddying her squeaky-clean off-screen persona) by co-starring in the raucous crime dramedy ""Spring Breakers."" Gomez hasn't taken nearly as much heat as Cyrus, though she has shown a fair amount of side boob with her red carpet choices of late. Despite the age-old idea that each generation is more reckless than the last, Bieber and his famous peers don't appear to be rebelling so much as they're just getting older. Jada Pinkett Smith, whose son Jaden is friends with Bieber, recently took to her Facebook page to express her frustrations with the way young stars are treated: . ""Is it okay to continually attack and criticize (Bieber) a famous 19 year old who is simply trying to build a life, exercise his talents while figuring out what manhood and fame is all about as he carries the weight of supporting his family as well as providing the paychecks to others who depend on him to work so they can feed their families as well?"" She wrote. ""Does that render being called a c--- by an adult male photographer as you try to return to your hotel after leaving the (sic) hospital?"" Sure, Bieber has consciously snapped a few pictures of his bare abs, and strolled through the airport topless, but the singer hasn't even been present for some of the events that produced the most scandalous and tragic headlines of all. In 2011, a California woman alleged in a paternity lawsuit that Bieber fathered her 3-month-old baby boy. And in January, a photographer was killed by oncoming traffic after he thought he saw Bieber sitting in his white Ferrari in Los Angeles. ""While I was not present nor directly involved with this tragic accident, my thoughts and prayers are with the family of the victim,"" Bieber said in a statement. ""There's a lot of pressure on this kid to do bigger, better things,"" Jennifer Chancellor wrote on TulsaWorld.com January. ""The adoration could be crushing. Bieber, so far, has mastered it by being himself. That means being human. He threw up on stage once; he's raced cars; he's partied ... some."" Maybe we should all take a page out of Internet sensation and Britney Spears' advocate Chris Crocker's book and just leave Bieber alone?","Justin Bieber is one of many celebs who've grown up under the proverbial microscope .
""I think I'll make a smooth transition from a teen star to an adult star,"" he said in 2011 .
2013 is already shaping up to be that fateful transition time in Bieber's career ."
"(CNN) -- Pope Francis celebrated his first Easter Mass with departures from the style of his predecessor even as he delivered a traditional call for peace. While it's traditional for the pope to deliver a message of peace on Easter Sunday, his direct interactions with the crowd reinforced stylistic differences between him and the austere, distant approach of Benedict XVI, observers said. Barely two weeks since his election, the first Latin American pope celebrated Easter Mass from an outdoor altar in the presence of tens of thousands of followers in St. Peter's Square. Dressed in white, unadorned vestments consistent with his modest image, Francis celebrated Easter Mass alone, without his cardinals. After Mass, he made his way through St. Peter's Square in an open-top popemobile free of bulletproof glass so he could stop to greet followers with handshakes, embraces and kisses. In his first Urbi et Orbi blessing from the papal balcony, Francis called for an end to conflicts in the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula. He also called for peace for Syrians -- both those devastated by violence in the country and refugees in need of help -- and harmony in the troubled African nations of Mali and the Central African Republic. Five things to know about Pope Francis . But while the world scrutinizes his every move, papal observers said it was too early to make judgments about how he intends to lead the Catholic Church. ""Benedict and Francis are like Pavarotti and Domingo -- the style is different but the songs are the same,"" said Raymond Arroyo, news director and lead anchor of EWTN Global Catholic Radio Network. What's clear for now, Arroyo said, is that Francis ""is intent on bringing the message of the church out to the world,"" as he demonstrated Sunday throughout Holy Week. When he told his priests Thursday ""to go look for the lost sheep,"" he added that when they come back, they ""better smell like those sheep,"" Arroyo said. ""He wants them amid the people in the muck of life."" The pope was elected almost three weeks ago, succeeding Benedict XVI. A former Argentinian cardinal, he became the first non-European pope of the modern era, the first from Latin America, the first Jesuit and the first to assume the name Francis. Already, Francis has repeatedly veered from tradition. Three days ago, on Holy Thursday, he went to a youth detention center in Rome -- rather than the city's chief cathedral -- and washed the feet of a dozen young detainees. Among the group at the Casal del Marmo were two females and two Muslims. The pontiff poured water over the young offenders' feet, wiped them with a white towel and kissed them. In his homily, given to about 50 young offenders, he said everyone should help one another. ""As a priest and as a bishop, I should be at your service. It is a duty that comes from my heart,"" he said. The act of foot-washing is part of the Christian tradition that mirrors Jesus' washing of his disciples' feet. Francis' decision to include two females -- an Italian and an Eastern European -- in the ceremony disturbed some traditionalists, who believe the 12 people should reflect the 12 male apostles. The Vatican Press Office responded Friday to ""questions and concerns"" related to the pope's washing the young offenders' feet, calling it a ""simple and spontaneous gesture of love, affection, forgiveness and mercy."" If anything, Francis' outreach to women, along with his emphasis on ""reinvigorating the Christian faith"" in parts of the world ""where secularism has the upper hand"" continues the tradition of Benedict and popes before him, said author and theologian Matthew Bunson, a senior fellow of the St. Paul Center for Biblical Theology. ""That hallmark of humility and simplicity are his personal expressions as pope,"" Bunson said. ""There is something wonderfully new about him, but he's also maintaining the teachings of the church in wonderful continuity with the popes who've gone before him."" CNN's Jim Bittermann contributed to this report.","Pope Francis continues to distinguish himself from predecessor in first Easter Mass .
