"Joachim Low piled the pressure on World Cup semi-final referee Marco Rodriguez with an extraordinary attack on the standard of officiating at the World Cup ahead of Germany’s semi-final with Brazil. Germany’s controversial coach claimed Brazil’s quarter-final victory over Colombia had turned into ‘a fight’ and went on to say that refereeing standards are better in Europe. Brazilian forward Neymar has been ruled out of the World Cup with a fractured vertebrae after he was kneed in the back by Colombia defender Juan Zuniga. VIDEO Scroll down for Fifa rejected claims that referees were instructed to be lenient . Poor: Germany coach Joachim Low believes the level of officiating at the World Cup has been sub-standard . Critical: Low has not been impressed with the brutality of some of the tackles at the World Cup . Attack: Low believes some of the tackles at the World Cup would not have been tolerated in Europe . Colombia forward James Rodriguez, the World Cup’s leading scorer, was deliberately targeted in Fortaleza, and a record 54 fouls at this World Cup were committed by both teams during the stormy clash which was refereed by Spaniard Carlos Velasco Carballo. Low said: ‘Colombia against Brazil was a real fight. ‘I hope the referee, Mr Rodriguez from Mexico, will clamp down on things. That physical energy in the match against Colombia went beyond the limits in Europe. ‘If that match had been played in Europe, 22 players wouldn't have ended that match. There were brutal fouls. People blocking opponents however they could. It was really exaggerated. 'That's what we saw on the pitch, so I hope these really brutal and crude fouls are stopped, or we won't see players like Messi, Ozil or Neymar, and we'll just see players who go out to destroy. ‘This is a World Cup that's full of dynamism and physical force, but I've seen matches where the limits have been surpassed. Out of action: Brazil's team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar said Neymar will be out for four-to-six weeks . Target: Brazil players took it in turns to foul Colombia's Jame Rodriguez during their quarter-final . Focused: Germany striker Thomas Muller is ready to strike a ball during training . Stopper: Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer dives as he practises saving penalties during training . VIDEO All Star XI: Manuel Neuer . ‘There were numerous fouls from both sides, not just the one foul against Neymar, but many others as well.’ And Rodriguez is the match official who missed Luis Suarez’s bite on Giorgio Chiellini in Uruguay’s final group game against Italy. He is now under massive pressure in front of a worldwide television audience after Low broke ranks to claim the standard of officiating was below that expected in European football. Germany’s head coach added: ’It affected playing time was only 38 or 39 minutes, so there were so many breaks in play. ‘I don't think players and fans like the match being constantly stopped. It's not a good match. The players were warned what would earn them a yellow or a red card. ‘You saw in the Colombia match many fouls from behind which were really dangerous for the players. There were slide tackles from behind and from the side. ‘You have to protect the players when you're a referee. That's something that's important for everyone working in football. You have to protect the attackers. Applaud: Muller (second left) claps his team-mates during their training session ahead of Brazil clash . Talking tactics: Germany coach Low stands in the centre of a group huddle during training . Tough: Rodriguez is tackled by Brazil's Fernandinho, who marshaled him for the entire game . Ready: Low (second right) looks on during Germany training at the Mineirao Stadium in Belo Horizonte . ‘They have been aggressed in a very bad way. I don't think it was a good thing that we saw there.’ Brazil’s highly-physical approach has been heavily criticised following last Friday’s brutal clash with Colombia in Fortaleza. Although Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari claims his team are playing within the rules, the five-time champions have attracted some unwanted attention ahead of this clash. Germany defender Jerome Boateng spoke in Belo Horizonte last night and claimed Low’s observations were all accurate ahead of this mouth-watering tie. Boateng, who was sluggish in Germany’s opening games at the tournament, said: ‘ I share the coach's opinion. We've never seen as many fouls like in that match, especially from behind. Quite a lot of things went beyond what is acceptable. ‘We’ll just have to impose our way of playing. I'm highly motivated and glad I'm playing here, like the whole team. We're happy and I'm eager to play that match.’ Germany’s head coach, who arrived for the press conference on Monday around 90 minutes ahead of schedule, claimed the absence of Neymar could be a motivating factor. Missing: Brazil captain Thiago Silva will be missing from the semi-final against Germany due to suspension . Ready: Germany defender Jerome Boateng (left) alongside coach Low during pre-match press conference . The Brazil forward has been ruled out of the rest of the tournament, but Low knows the passionate atmosphere inside the Estadio Mineairo could play into Brazil’s hands. Low, who is attempting to win Germany’s fourth World Cup, added: ‘You shouldn't believe the absence of Neymar or Thiago Silva will be a big disadvantage for Brazil. Dante won't deliver a bad match against Germany. ‘He's an excellent player, and others will feel invigorated. You've seen teams lose some players and others accept the responsibility. They'll be on the pitch fighting for Neymar and the nation to make sure they reach the final. That is my view. ‘This semi-final is very interesting: it’s the battle of the continents, Europe v South America. ‘There are 200million Brazilians here cheering for their team. The tournament has unleashed energy on the team. But we are self-assured. We know what we can deliver. If we tap into our tactical abilities tomorrow, we have a good chance. 'Brazil will unleash all its passion on us, emotional and physical. This is obvious. 'It's happened in previous matches. In this stadium, any attack will be accompanied by tremendous noise from their fans. What we have to do is concentrate and courageous doing our jobs.'","Germany coach Low believes some of the physical tackles in the World Cup so far have gone 'beyond the limits' that would be acceptable in Europe .

"A group of kayakers on the River Severn in Worcestershire got a surprise when they were joined by a lost seal who found himself nearly 100 miles from home. The misplaced mammal is remarkably thought to have negotiated at least three locks at Gloucester, Upper Lode and Diglis, and around three weirs to get so far upstream from the Bristol Channel. But the seal didn't seem too worried about where he was and playfully swam alongside the kayakers for half an hour. Tasty treat: The lost seal found himself nearly 100 miles from his normal home having swam up the River Severn at the weekend. He didn't seem too worried though and tucked in to this salmon near Worcester . Chomp! Totally oblivious that he was 75 miles upstream from the mouth of the River Severn, the mammal created quite a stir among kayakers and passers-by in Worcester . Epic journey: The harbour seal had negotiated a number of locks and weirs to get so far up the river . The harbour seal - more naturally at home in the Irish Sea - had followed boats in its journey to the Midlands after it got lost while hunting for fish. It was snapped in the river catching and eating a salmon by Mike Finn, 62, on Saturday afternoon. He said: 'I managed to squeeze between the trees and get a few pictures, when I dashed down to the river's edge it was gently bobbing along with the fish and struggling to consume it. 'It was quite an incredible sight and not something you're ever likely to see in landlocked Worcester.' Long way from home: The seal negotiated a route full of locks and weir (including at Maisemore and Tewkesbury) on the River Severn from Gloucester up to Worcester . Where am I? It is believed that the seal followed a boat while hunting for fish and ended up 75 miles inland . Hiding away: The seal takes a break from all the adulation. He had earlier swam playfully alongside a group of kayakers near Worcester . Caroline Attwood-Reusser, 53, was among the friends from Wychavon Kayak and Canoe Club who had a close encounter with the seal. She said: 'He was diving under our boats, playing under the waves, doing tumble turns and showing us his spotty belly. He looked very healthy. 'It’s just so exciting, to see something so unusual, especially with the kids, it just blew them away.' The seal was also spotted the next day tucking into fish nearby by dog-walker Carol Treagus. Carol added: 'It had a big fish in its mouth. 'There were a lot of people stood watching and taking pictures - as it’s not something you usually see.' Bobbing and biting: The harbour seal was able to find a tasty salmon to feast upon so far up river . Battle: It did look as though the seal was struggling to subdue his catch . Dan Jarvis, an animal care assistant at the National Seal Sanctuary, said it was very rare to see seals so far inland. He said: 'It is likely that the seal has come from Irish or Welsh seas. 'Although it is not unusual for seals to swim upriver - it is highly unusual for them to come this far inland. 'Chances are he has followed fish up the river and with quite strong spring tides this year he has probably come up further than usual. 'Either that or he is a young juvenile who is just inexperienced - either way as long as he has a good feed he shouldn’t be in any danger. 'It also pretty rare for them to get this close and personal with people as they can notoriously be antisocial animals.' An RSPCA spokesman said: 'Seals don’t tend to stay long and will eventually make their own way out. 'There is usually no reason for us to intervene unless the animal is injured, sick or distressed. 'People should just enjoy observing him as he won’t be there long.'","The harbour seal found himself 75 miles upstream after getting lost from his Bristol Channel home .

"A brutal head wound during a botched robbery left a brilliant, young Washington D.C. policy analyst with such debilitating brain damage that he now struggles to read his 2-year-old son children's books. Thomas 'TC' Maslin, 30, still retains much of his cognitive function, but the injury last year left him all but unable speak, blind in one eye and with limited motor function in one arm and one leg. Before the head trauma, he was an aggressive, career-driven Washington operative, who had risen to associate director for environmental policy at IHS, a major consulting firm, the Washington Post reports. Happy family: TC Maslin and wife Abby are seen here with their son Jack before the attack. TC had a high-flying career as a policy analyst . After: Mr Maslin lost the sight in one eye, the much of the use of his right arm and right leg and significant amounts of his cognitive function . Now, he struggles to read books meant for a second-grader. Mr Maslin's heartbreaking transformation has taken a toll on his . faithful wife Abby - who has stuck by his side throughout the trying . ordeal. 'Five little ducks went out one day. Over the hills and far away. The woman duck said quack, quack, quack,' he read aloud at a recent rehabilitation appointment. His instructor stops him and tells him to read it again. 'The mother duck said quack, quack, quack,' he corrects himself. On another occasion, he boasted that he had made a load from bread 'from trash.' The term he was looking for was, of course, 'from scratch.' Mrs Maslin, an English teacher, writes on her blog that the brain trauma 'catapulted us to the grayest of places: that space between life and death. If life is freedom and death is finality, we find ourselves stuck in that torturous place somewhere in the middle.' Mr Maslin's recovery has been painfully slow. He still struggles to read even children's books to his young son Jack . Mr Maslin was attacked and hit in the back of the head with an aluminum baseball bat during a botched robbery last August . The couple, facing $1million in medical bills, now travels to Halifax, Nova Scotia, regularly so Mr Maslin can undergo special therapy. He refuses to talk about the attack that left him disabled. Three days after the Maslin couple's third wedding anniversary, Mr Maslin was walking home near from a bar after a few drinks with friends following a Washington Nationals game. Three men approached and demanded his money. He was handing over his iPhone and debit card when one of the men smashed him in the back of the head with an aluminum baseball bat, according to police. Tommy Branch, 23, who was later arrested for assault, called the bat his 'Barry Bonds.' Police say he wound up and hit Mr Maslin in the head with a two-fisted grip on the bat. Mr and Mrs Maslin are struggling to cope with the recovery, but they remain optimistic that Mr Maslin - and life - will improve . Branch was sentenced to 24 years in prison earlier this year. The brutal blow shattered Mr Maslin's skull and severed his optic nerve. He lay unconscious on the street for eight hours while he bled internally. After a coma that lasted for days, he was left blind in one eye and with limited use of his right arm and right leg. Half his skull remains noticeably collapsed. But, he and his wife remain optimistic of his chances of recovery. 'I’m alive. For God’s sake. That’s good,' Mr Maslin told the Post.","Thomas Maslin, 20, was attacked with a baseball bat in a street mugging in Washington D.C.

"A telegram from playwright Noel Coward and a bill for 'ladies' delicates' sent to author Agatha Christie more than half a century ago have been discovered - in the back of an old bureau. Stunned furniture restorer Clive Payne, 46, was fixing up the valuable 18th century piece, bought at auction in 2006, when the two crumpled letters fell out. Coward's telegram, sent from Bermuda and dated September 1957, congratulated the author on her play The Mousetrap breaking the record for the longest running West End show. Long lost: The telegraph sent by Noel Coward to Agatha Christie more than half a century ago . He signs off: 'All my good wishes, Noel Coward.' The valuable typed telegram was discovered alongside an old 1952 receipt for Agatha Christie's underwear - for £562 in today's money - inside the antique bureau. Shocked Mr Payne told today how he unravelled the mystery.He said: 'I opened the letter and I could not believe it when it was addressed to Agatha Christie. 'I was doubly amazed when I saw it was from Noel Coward. Then I opened the receipt as well - it is a bit strange knowing the intimate details of someone so well-known. 'As a restorer you probably only get this once in a career. It's fantastic.' Treasure trove: Agatha Christie's bureau where the telegram and receipt were found . The shimmering pine bureau, plastered in a thick walnut veneer, is believed to date from around 1710 and contains three secret drawers. Author Christie bought the furniture piece in the 1950s and may have used it to pen many of her famous crime novels - including legendary detectives Miss Marple and Poirot. The bureau was snapped up by an anonymous collector at auction in 2006, when part of the crime novelist's estate went up for sale from her home on the River Dart, Devon. The secret collector - who still does not want to be identified - took the dilapidated bureau to be touched up by expert restorer Mr Payne, from Lechlade, Glos. Prolific: Dame Agatha Christie (pictured here in March 1971) wrote more than 80 detective novels . Mr Payne said: 'The bureau had been in my workshop for three or four years. 'A client had bought it in with lots of other furniture after buying it at auction. 'As part of the restoration process I needed to remove its back. The usual dirt and muck fell out, but also two pieces of paper. He unfolded the paper and was amazed at what he saw. The telegram congratulates Agatha . Christie on her play The Mousetrap breaking the record for the longest . running show in London's West End. Noel . Coward begrudgingly sent the note after Christie's play had beaten his . own, Blithe Spirit, which had held the previous record. The . note reads: 'Dear Agatha Christie, much as it pains me I really must . congratulate you on The Mousetrap breaking the long run record. 'All . my good wishes, Noel Coward.' The other piece of paper turned out to be . a receipt for model lingerie, housecoats and night wear from 1952 - . addressed to a Mrs Mallowan from a shop in London. It details a £24.13s.6d order. After . a bit of research Mr Payne cracked the mystery - discovering that . Christie's married name after her second marriage to archaeologist Max . Mallowan in 1930. Secret drawers: The receipt for Agatha Christie's underwear, found in the antique bureau . The two valuable documents, which both now belong to the anonymous owner of the bureau, are not expected to be sold. Mathew Prichard, Agatha Christie's grandson, said the letter would have caused his grandmother much pleasure. He said today: 'I'd have thought to have had acknowledgement of her achievements at The Mousetrap running so long would have pleased her very much. Gracious: Noel Coward congratulated Agatha Christie on beating his record for the longest running show in London's West End . 'The opinion of her peers and fellow entertainers meant a lot to her.' P . rolific writer Christie penned more than 80 crime novels, featuring some of the country's best-loved fictional detectives, including Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot. She is widely regarded as the best-selling author of all time and was made a Dame five years before she died in 1976, aged 85. The Torquay-born author is also known for her successful plays - including The Mousetrap. The Mousetrap, a murder mystery, opened in London's West End in 1952 and became the longest running play on September 13, 1957. Incredibly, it is still running today and has notched up more than 24,000 performances worldwide. The play is also known for its twist ending, which the audience is asked not to reveal at the end of every performance. English playwright Coward wrote more than 50 plays before his death in 1973. Comic play Blithe Spirit - whose record was broken by The Mousetrap - notched up 1,997 performances after appearing in the West End in 1941.

"The 1.5-metre (4ft 11inch) specimen was found by the Lim family in the southern state of Tasmania when they were collecting shells on a beach in Howden. They took a picture and contacted a marine biologist who said the type of jellyfish had been seen in the past, but she had never seen one so big, or one that has become beached. The 4ft 11 inch (1.5-metre) specimen, pictured, was found by a family in Tasmania. Scientists now have enough pictures and samples to begin a proper analysis to classify and name the creature. Yet much remains unknown, including how it eats and breeds, and its habitat . Although the 1.5-metre (4ft 11inch) specimen discovered in Hobart has not yet been classified, a scientist with the Australian government's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation believes it is related to the lion's mane jellyfish. The lion's mane jellyfish, also known as hari jelly, is the largest known species of jellyfish. It is usually found in Arctic, northern Atlantic, and northern Pacific Oceans. Similar jellyfish, which may be the same species, have been known to live in seas near Australia and New Zealand. The largest ever lion's mane jellyfish washed up on the shore of Massachusetts Bay in 1870. It  had a 7ft 6in body and tentacles that stretched 120ft. 'We know about this specimen but it hasn't been classified yet, it hasn't been named,' said Lisa Gershwin, a scientist with the government's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). She told the Sydney Morning Herald the new species was related to the lion's mane jellyfish, the largest known species of the marine animal in the world. 'It is so big it took our breath away,' added Gershwin, who has been working with jellyfish for 20 years. 'It's a whopper of an animal but it's not life-threatening, although it does sting.' According to Gershwin, there has been a massive jellyfish bloom in Tasmanian waters over the past month. Although the specimen has not yet been classified, a marine biologist believes it is related to the lion's mane jellyfish, pictured. The largest ever lion's mane jellyfish washed up on the shore of Massachusetts Bay in 1870. It  had a 7ft 6in body and tentacles that stretched 120ft . 'Probably about five years ago I finally put together in my head that there were really three different species of lion's mane jellyfish in Tasmania, or 'snotties' as they're also called', Gerswhin said. 'Yes snotties, they're a bit slimy.' CSIRO scientists now have enough pictures and samples to begin a proper analysis to classify and name the creature. Despite this, much remains unknown, including how it eats and breeds, and its habitat. The jellyfish was found on a beach in Hobart, Tasmania (marked at A). According to scientists, there has been a massive jellyfish bloom in Tasmanian waters over the past month . 'It's so big but we know nothing about it,' said Gershwin. 'It highlights again how much we still have to learn about the ocean.' The jellyfish was found by the Lim family on a beach south of the Tasmanian capital Hobart with mother Josie saying 'it blew our minds away'. 'It's not really jellyfish territory here and all we could do was stand back and admire it,' she told AFP.","Huge creature was found near Hobart, on the island of Tasmania .

"Victim: Hani Abou El-Kheir, pictured, was fatally stabbed by a gang wielding knives and swords in the Pimlico area of London last night . A boy of 16 pleaded ‘don’t do it’ moments before he was killed by a hooded gang wielding knives and swords in a street lined with multi-million-pound homes. Hani Abou El Kheir tripped as he desperately tried to escape from around 15 teenagers wearing hoods and bandanas who were chasing him. Moments later the gang pounced ‘like a pack of dogs’ and Hani was repeatedly kicked and stabbed as he pleaded for his life. His attackers left him for dead and jogged off ‘as if nothing had happened’. Hani’s mother Pauline Hickey, 39, with whom he lived in a nearby flat, was said to have been ‘wailing’ as she was held back at a police cordon while medics tried to save her son. He died in hospital less than two hours later. The attack took place at about 6.45pm on Sunday in Pimlico, an affluent district in central London where Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has a home. On the north side of the street where Hani was attacked are houses worth millions of pounds. However, to the south sits the crime-ridden Churchill Gardens estate, which has recently seen a sharp rise in drugs offences, according to a youth worker. Yesterday one witness to the attack said: ‘We saw him running really fast but then he tripped. 'There were about 15 of them, most wearing dark hoodies and bandanas over their faces. A lot of them were wearing tracksuits. Scene guard: A policewoman stands guard on Lupus Street this morning while a police investigation goes on . Horrific: The stabbing happened close to the junction of Lupus Street and Westmorland Place shortly before 7pm . ‘They had wide kitchen knives and . other knives and they jumped on him like a pack of dogs. He was shouting . ‘‘don’t do it’’ but they just went ahead. 'One put a blade in near his ribs. Others then kicked him before just jogging off as if nothing had happened. ‘They put their weapons in socks and . then shoved them up their sleeves as they were going. We tried to help . him as he was lying on the ground.’ Stabbing: Police forensics carry out investigations in the street, on one side of which houses sell for an average of £500,000 . Community: Neighbours this afternoon described the victim  as a 'nice boy, polite' Teodor Watson, 22, who lives in a flat overlooking the crime scene, said he heard what sounded like a brawl. ‘I heard a lot of commotion, the victim was shouting,’ he said. ‘I came outside and saw the victim standing and holding his stomach. 'There were about three or four young . blokes running down the street. He was reeling and swaying for about 20 . seconds and then fell.’ Mohammed Alzubaidi, 49, said his friend witnessed a gang of black and white teenagers carrying out the attack. ‘He said they were carrying knives, some of them with wide swords,’ he added. Hani is understood to have suffered multiple stab wounds to his chest and stomach. Within minutes of the stabbing, his mother ran up to the police cordon. Shocked: Nearby residents have said a gang of black and white teenagers were seen carrying out the attack . Crime scene: The scene in Lupus Street is still cordoned off this morning as police investigate the circumstances surrounding the attack on the boy . Steve Russell, 46, a project manager, . said: ‘She was screaming with grief and shouting her son’s name but they . wouldn’t let her through.’ Miss Hickey, who is separated from Hani’s father Hicham, was too upset to talk about the loss of her son yesterday. But in a note attached to a floral . tribute near the scene she wrote: ‘My heart is broken. I love you so . much. The pain is unbelievable. Your loving mum.’ A man at the family home said: ‘He didn’t deserve to end up on a slab. He was a nice boy.’ Forensics: Police were called to the scene on Lupus Street in Pimlico, central London, at 6:50pm last night . Investigation: A police forensics tent pictured at the scene where a 16-year-old boy was fatally stabbed in Pimlico, central London, last night . Forensics officers were  yesterday scouring the scene for clues. Last night Scotland Yard said no arrests had  been made. It remained unclear what led to the . murder. One theory is that Hani became caught up in a row over the sale . of drugs on the estate. Youth worker David Savizon said Hani was ‘on the periphery of having some sort of contact with gangs or activity such as drugs’. He added: ‘We are very concerned about the impact of drugs, and competition between dealers in this area. ‘Younger and younger children are . being recruited. From the ages of ten or 11 they are enticed by a £20 . note to act as runners and it escalates from there.’ Popular area: The boy was stabbed in Lupus Street in Pimlico, a popular residential area of central London, sitting just south of Victoria train station on the north bank of the River Thames . Inquiry: A police officer makes notes close to the scene where a 16-year-old boy was stabbed in Pimlico . Hani had been a pupil at the nearby Pimlico Academy but left some time ago and is thought to have been unemployed. Jerry Collins, head of Pimlico . Academy, said: ‘Hani was a popular boy who conducted himself in an . exemplary manner and will be much missed.’ Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: . ‘It is heartbreaking to see the life of another young Londoner taken so . tragically. My thoughts are with this young man’s family at such a . terrible moment. Scene: The stabbing took place in the Pimlico area of central London . Tributes: Flowers are left at the scene in Lupus Street where a teenager was stabbed yesterday evening . Heartfelt: A tribute is left for Hani Abou El-Kheir in pimlico today . Hunt for clues: Forensic police search bushes near the crime scene today . ‘This horrific incident serves as an . unwelcome reminder that although violent crime in the capital continues . to fall, we must continue our fight to tackle youth violence and get . knives off our streets.’ Hani is the first teenager to be murdered in London this year. Last year aspiring football coach Oliver Husseini, 17, was left fighting for his life after being stabbed in a nearby street.","Residents claim that a gang were seen armed with knives and swords .

"Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder sparked even more outrage over his team's name on Sunday when he invited the president of the largest Native American reservation to sit in his box at a game against the Arizona Cardinals. Outgoing Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly and his wife Martha even wore Redskins hats to rub elbows with Snyder, amid intense public debate over whether the D.C. team should be allowed to keep its name, which many civil rights groups have deemed insensitive and racist towards Native American people. Shelly, however, is  not the most convincing Native American ally  as he does not have an overwhelming support from his tribe.In August he finished seventh in the presidential primary elections, and will be exiting office on January 14. Snyder is currently in a legal battle with the U.S. Patent office, which cancelled the Redskins team name last June. Snyder has vowed never to change the name - saying it actually honors the legacy of American Indians. Unlikely ally: Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder (left, in blue shirt) invited the Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly (right, in blue shirt and glasses) to attend Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals. Shelly's wife Martha pictured far right . Nevertheless, a group of about 100 people gathered before Sunday game to protest the name, holding up signs reading 'Game Over Racism' and 'Snyder can't buy my support'. Bringing Shelly into the box was Snyder's latest attempt to kill the controversy by proving he has support in the Native American community. The Navajo Nation includes 27,000 square miles of land in Arizona, Utah and New Mexico - making it the largest Native American reservation in the United States. 'The Washington Redskins are proud to have President Ben Shelly and the Navajos along with Zuni and other Western region tribes that joined the us at the game today,' Redskins team spokesman Tony Wyllie said.  'This is representative of the support we have among Native Americans nationwide.' Team player: Many civil rights and Native American groups have called for Snyder to change his team's name, saying the continued use of the term Redskins is insensitive and racist. Above, Shelly even wore a Redskins hat to the Sunday game . Lame duck: Shelly is not exactly popular among his own people. He came in seventh in the Nation's August presidential primary election and will be vacating the position he's held since 2011 in January. Pictured above with his wife Martha at Sunday's game . Shelly was allegedly attending the game to discus an NFL franchising agreement involving Navajo artists with Snyder, his spokesman Desmood Tome said. Tome says the issues of Navajo education and job creation take 'far more precedence' than the mascot name. Last year, Shelly weighed in the controversial topic, issuing a statement via his spokesman who said not everyone finds the term is negative. 'We’ve always been proud of a lot of individuality,' spokesman Erny Zah said. 'If they (Navajo) want to assert themselves as Redskins and the community is fine with that, they are going to continue.' Racist: A group of about 100 came out to protest the Redskins name before the Sunday game against the Cardinals . In fact, one Navajo Nation high school has the Redskins mascot. Red Mesa High School is one of three high schools in the U.S. to use the mascot, and is one of two in that count that are majority-Native American. 'Native approved': This man spotted at Sunday's game proves that Shelly isn't the only Native American not offended by the Redskins name . But Zah added that the term should be avoided outside American Indian communities due to 'the legacy of negativity that the term has created'. Shelly's decision to back Snyder makes him a minority in his tribe, which voted last April to formally oppose the Redskins name, 9-2. Shelly has faced controversy ever since he entered office in 2011, when he was accused of stealing thousands of dollars from the tribe to benefit himself and his family members. Those charges were eventually dropped when Shelly agreed to pay back the $8,250 he was accused of taking. He also went behind tribal leaders backs to partner with Snyder previously, to sponsor a golf tournament with the NFL team owner's Original Americans Foundation (OAF). When other Native American groups found out about OAF's sponsorship the day before the event, a few pulled out. OAF also reached a sponsorship agreement with the Navajo Nation's radio station, which led to widespread protesting in the southwestern reservation. While many Native Americans consider the term Redskins to be slur, public opinion polls show that the majority of Americans support the Washington team keeping their name. Loss: The Cardinals beat the Redskins 30 - 20 at the game held Sunday at University of Phoenix field in Glendale, Arizona . Cancelled: Snyder is currently in a legal battle with the U.S. Patent Office which cancelled his trademark last June. The legal battle is ongoing and Snyder is able to keep the name in the meantime . According to a poll conducted this year, 71 per cent of Americans back the name. This past June, the U.S. Patent and Trademark office cancelled the Redskins team name for a second time, saying it was 'disparaging to Native Americans'. But Snyder has vowed never to change the name, and in August his lawyers have filed an appeal against the ruling. In the meantime, the team will be able to keep their name. They plan to argue the first amendment right to freedom of expression.","Snyder is currently in a legal battle with the U.S. Patent office which cancelled his trademark last June calling it 'disparaging to Native Americans'

"Senior civil servants were encouraged to wear party hats while discussing spending cuts in the run up to Christmas as staff faced losing their jobs. In a bizarre exercise at a directors meeting, attended by the director of strategy and director of finances for the Department of Education, participants were told they had to keep their party hats on until they had revealed where they would be making cuts to save money. The game, which was not allowed to be photographed, was posted on a internal government website in a blog by Simon Judge, director of finance and commercial. Simon Judge, the director of finance, right, and his blog on the internal government website in which he wrote that at a Board and Directors meeting attendees had to wear party hats while discussing spending cuts . Union representatives branded the activity as 'highly insensitive and crass', labeling it as a 'monumental lack of judgment' to discuss future services. The DfE responded to a letter written by the  Public and Commercial Services Union saying the meeting was about non-sensitive issues - not staff reductions - and criticised the union for its 'inaccurate' and 'unhelpful' description of events. Mr Judge wrote about the activity in his weekly blog - that is only viewable to civil servants and officials who have access to the government intranet. In the week commencing December 17 he wrote for Tuesday that he had attended a 'Board and Directors' meeting - a meeting which the DofE said was one of the regular meetings of Directors. Simon Judge, director of finances, wrote about the game in December. The purpose of the activity was for directors to propose how they intended to remove inefficiencies in systems and processes . He wrote: 'Hilary Spencer (director of strategy) then led some brief workshop activity to review policy delivery plans, and then we did an exercise with party hats that I was not allowed to photograph. 'We all had to stay (sic) what we were stopping, as part of the DfE Review, and we could then take our hat off.' The DfE said the meeting covered service improvements. The purpose of the activity was for directors to 'propose how they intended to remove inefficiencies in systems/processes and to reduce bureaucracy in their area', they said in a letter in response to the union. The 'removal of inefficiencies' included ways to save money. The PCS said DfE officials were encouraged to wear the hats while discussing the future of services and branded the game 'outrageous'. The DfE currently employs 480 staff at Mowden Hall, in Darlington, Durham. The Government is looking to cut about 1,000 jobs nationwide, and Mowden Hall staff could be moved elsewhere in the North-East. Kathy Prendiville, PCS' education group secretary, said the behaviour of staff was 'highly insensitive and crass', and wrote to Chris Wormald, DfE permanent secretary, expressing the union's upset. She said: 'This was a serious error of judgement and it is hard to understand how a group of senior civil servants could consider it appropriate. - PCS education group secretary . 'The Christmas period is no excuse for such a monumental loss of judgement, as virtually every member of staff in the department faced a Christmas of anxiety and worry for themselves and their families.' Hundreds of Mowden Hall workers last month staged a protest to keep their jobs in Darlington, and a petition has attracted more than 1,100 signatures. Darlington MP Jenny Chapman said she was disappointed with the conduct of DfE staff. She said: 'They shouldn't be making light entertainment out of the situation, they are public sector workers and we expect better from them.' A spokesman from the DfE said staff had not behaved insensitively. He said: 'The Department has replied to the PCS and their inaccurate and unhelpful description of events. 'This was a regular meeting of directors and included an item on strategic planning to remove inefficiencies in systems and not staff reductions. 'The approach used was designed to be engaging about a subject that is not sensitive, and had it been so, we would not have used it. 'The management committee is fully aware of the impact of headcount reductions and we are committed to minimising uncertainty through clear and consistent engagement with staff. 'We have always said this would be a difficult and challenging time, but these are necessary steps if we want this country to have the best education and children's services.'","Director of finance Simon Judge revealed exercise in his internal blog .

"A blind fashion designer who lost his sight in a horrific attack as a teenager has told how he overcame his nightmarish childhood to gain critical acclaim on the Parish fashion scene. Mason Ewing has been blind for half his life following savage abuse from relatives, but was determined to realise his dream of working at the height of the fashion world. Now, despite only being able to see vague shapes and colours, the 30-year-old has become an accomplished designer in Paris - and has even revealed plans to conquer Hollywood. Impressive: Mason Ewing has become a fashion designer despite being blind . Cameroon-born Mason creates elaborate dresses by describing his detailed designs to a team of artists, while his heightened sense of touch allows him to feel his creations and differentiate between materials. According to the Los Angeles Times, he has found that his blindness enhances his ability to distinguish between the textures of silks, lace, linen and cotton. And since overcoming his horrific childhood, Mason has launched his own t-shirt line and even completed his first fashion show in the French capital in 2006. Mason became inspired by fashion aged just four, after watching Naomi Campbell and other supermodels on the catwalk as a young boy. However, after his mother was murdered when he was a child, Mason was sent to live with his aunt and uncle in Paris aged six, and he was subjected to vicious beatings. The budding fashion designer was abused throughout his childhood, culminating in an attack where he was punched and kicked, causing a seizure which left him in hospital. Dream: Mason's next aspiration is to make it in the world of Hollywood . When he woke up, Mason found he had lost his sight, and he was placed in a series of foster homes by French authorities. Undetered though, Mason went on to study physical therapy at college, before deciding in 2001 he wanted to pursue his dream of fashion design. Other budding designers had been skeptical of his ability to succeed in the highly-competitive fashion world, but Mason was backed by a French organization for the handicapped, Agefiph, who financed his first show in 2006, according to reports. Mason has since created a line of t-shirts featuring a multi-ethnic cartoon character, Baby Madison. His t-shirts feature raised braille so that he can tell what colour the garment is and what image is printed on it. And after launching his own t-shirt range, Mason plans to now create his own televised teen drama. Mary E. Fry, a producer and casting director for independent films who is helping Mason realise his dream of creating a television series, told the LA Times: 'I grew up in an era of Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder and I know what they've accomplished. 'He'll have people at his side that are his eyes and ears. His biggest challenge is getting investors in line.'","Mason Ewing was blinded aged 15, but has gone on to realise fashion dream .

"Caught short: Mayor of March Bernard Keane was left red-faced after being reprimanded for urinating in bushes . Three senior council members have been caught urinating in public - in an area where they have earmarked a number of public toilets for closure. The three councillors - including the town mayor - were reprimanded in front of colleagues after a complaint was made against them, it has emerged. They had been spotted relieving themselves in a hedge after being caught short on an official fact-finding tour. The councillors, members of Fenland District Council Planning Committee in Cambridgeshire, were on a coach trip around towns and villages to look at sites which were the subject of planning applications. When they stopped near Wisbech, Councillor Bernard Keane, the octogenarian Mayor of March, was first off the bus to find a hedge. Half an hour later, as the coach pulled into another site, the veteran Tory set off again to attend the call of nature but this time was joined by two others. Planning committee member Jan French was on board the bus but refused to discuss the incidents. Cllr French said: 'How did you find out about this? You're blowing it all out of proportion.' In future the coach will be routed so that stops can be made. Ironically Fenland Council is set to shut seven of the 11 public toilets in the four market towns.

"Dozens of civil servants have found themselves in deep trouble after surfing the internet for porn while they were meant to be working. A total of 55 workers at the Welsh Government's offices were looking at explicit photographs and videos at their desks. Disciplinary action was taken against the officials after the material was found on their computers. Caught: 55 Welsh government workers, some of whom may have been based at its HQ in Cardiff (pictured), have looked at porn at work . One senior manager was forced to resign after it was revealed in 2008 he had been looking at child pornography. Two years later police were also called in when another worker, who was sacked, looked at illegal extreme porn. Top employment lawyers are recommending offices ban porn because it's distracting the bureaucrats from their work. Employment solicitor Leanne Thomas said: 'More than one in four people have admitted to watching inappropriate content online in the workplace. 'When it comes to porn, organisations are sitting on a potential time bomb. 'While accessing porn is not illegal the risks associated with last brand damage and employee harassment litigation are significant. 'The best cure is prevention and many workplaces ban access to, and the passing around of, inappropriate material in the office.' Disciplined: One senior manager was forced to resign after he looked at child porn on his office computer (picture posed by model) Information released by the Welsh Government revealed 55 workers have been disciplined for downloading porn. Fifteen civil servants were disciplined for downloading images showing sexy or full nudity and another 31 staff were caught looking at topless pictures.

'Like . so many jihadists before him, he then seems to have become radicalised . almost overnight and disappeared to travel to the Middle East.'

Gruesome footage showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley was released last month by the Islamic State, followed by a video of the execution of fellow American hostage Steven Sotloff last week. Authorities are now in a race against time to save the life of British hostage, aid worker David Haines, who the masked jihadi has revealed is next for execution. It comes after it was reported that father-of-two Mr Haines has been struggling to hold down food and suffering from acute gastric and other health problems in his cramped captivity. Meanwhile, David Cameron has revealed that Britain has begun arming the Kurds to fight back against ISIS. The Prime Minister told MPs, in a statement following last week’s Nato summit in Newport, that Britain ‘will continue to support the Kurds, including by providing them with arms and training their troops’. Until now the Government has limited itself to transporting weapons from former Soviet countries to the Kurds, for example from Albania. But Mr Cameron was asked if Britain will now be providing the Kurdish peshmerga militia directly with arms. The Prime Minister responded: ‘The short answer to that is yes.’ Britain has also offered to train the Kurdish fighters.","Masked executioner worked as low-level collector for genuine charities .

"Canadian author Farley Mowat, a master storyteller and tireless defender of nature and wildlife, has died. He was 92. Stephen Smith, a friend of Mowat's, said he died on Tuesday evening after collapsing at his house in Port Hope, Ontario. Smith said he couldn't confirm a cause of death, adding a family statement will be issued. Mowat wrote some 40 books, many based on his own adventures and travels. Among his best-known works are Never Cry Wolf, a fictional narrative about Mowat living among wolves in sub-arctic Canada, Lost in the Barrens, which follows a Cree Indian boy and a Canadian orphan's adventures in the Arctic. Call of the wild: Canadian author and nature campaigner Farley Mowat died at his home in Ontario on Tuesday at the age of 92 . He said he was lucky to be able to combine his two passions: writing and nature, calling the latter 'the only subject I really want to write about'. Acclaimed Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood tweeted that Mowat was a 'wonderful colleague & friend of many years'. From the age of 13, Mowat was fiercely dedicated to writing about the natural world. As a young teen he started a magazine called Nature Lore and had a column in the Saskatoon Star Phoenix. Mowat was born in Belleville, Ontario, on May 12, 1921. The son of a librarian, he grew up in Windsor, Ontario, and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. His novels and other non-fiction works have been translated into more than 20 languages. The award-winning author wrote Never Cry Wolf, a fictional narrative about Mowat living among wolves in sub-arctic Canada and Lost in the Barrens, which follows a Cree Indian boy and a Canadian orphan's adventures in the Arctic . Never one to shy away from controversy, Mowat was outspoken about many environmental and social issues. He called Canada's treatment of aboriginals 'abominable,' said Canada's annual seal hunt was, 'perhaps the most atrocious single trespass by human beings against the living world that's taking place today,' and said hunts in general were 'symbolic of the massive destruction that we've visited upon life'. He was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Medal in 1956, the Governor General's Award for Lost in the Barrens in 1956, the Leacock Medal for Humor for he Boat Who Wouldn't Float in 1970, the Order of Canada in 1981 and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Fund for Animal Welfare in 2003.","The author died on Tuesday evening after collapsing at his house in Port Hope, Ontario .

"Charged: California man Don Clark, 72, was charged in the triple murder of three Sacramento residents on his property in Chico . A 72-year-old California man was charged for allegedly shooting two teens and a mother before setting their bodies on fire after they wouldn't get off his property earlier this month. Don Clark, of Chico, was charged with three felony counts of murder and one count of arson in court Friday after firefighters found three dead Sacramento residents smouldering in a burnt car several miles from his home on June 13, according to the San Jose Mercury News. Prosecutors said Clark shot Roland Lowe, 15, his mother Colleen Lowe, 46, and Richard Jones Jr., 17, with a 12-gauge pump shotgun when he saw them walking to his home the evening of June 12. 'He saw them come into his place. He . wanted them off and that's when the shooting occurred,'Butte County . District Attorney Mike Ramsey said outside court after Clark's . arraignment Friday. Ramsey said Clark asked the victims to get off his property before opening fire, according to KRCRTV.com. Prosecutors said Clark then put the . bodies in the vehicle the group arrived in, driving over 20 miles away . to dump the car on Skyway Road near the community of DeSabla. Investigators believe Clark biked back to his home. Firefighters found the bodies shortly after midnight the next day after they extinguished the fire. Burnt: Prosecutors said Don Clark burned three people in this once-green 2000 Acura TL after shooting them when they wouldn't get off his property . Volunteer: Friends and neighbors said they were shocked to hear Don Clark was charged in a triple murder. He was an active volunteer in the community . Clark's neighbors told several news outlets they were shocked by the charges. Clark was known as a community volunteer--even recycling items on his own property. John Clark, no relation, said the accused murderer was quiet. He said he's known Clark for nine years. 'He was a good friend of mine at one point,' John Clark told KRCRTV.com. 'He didn't curse, he didn't smoke, he didn't drink and he did not steal,' he added. 'And he did not tolerate bad behavior from other people.' John Clark also told CBS13 that Clark was an 'upstanding man', though he had an angry streak. Speculating Clark's motive for the alleged triple-murder to CBS13, John Clark said Clark was 'taking the law into his own hands. He probably felt like an enforcer.' Clark volunteered for community projects, including parking cars at a recent pancake breakfast to raise money for a local bridge. He also volunteered to clean up Butte Creek Canyon. Secluded: The three victims, Roland Lowe, 15, his mother Colleen Lowe, 46 and Richard Jones Jr., 17, approached Don Clark's property from this dirt road . One friend who's known Clark for three years told KRCRTV.com that Clark called him Thursday following his arrest. 'He said ""I was afraid,""' said fellow volunteer Fred Thorne. 'That's what Don reported to me. That's all I can say, because I have no other details.' Ramsey said Clark knew one of the teenage victims, Jones, after he stayed at Clark's home for the previous three summers. Prosecutors said Clark accused the 17-year-old of stealing equipment from his property last summer, asking Jones to not return this year. It's unclear why the three victims were on Clark's property the night they died. Ramsey said investigators believe Ronald and Colleen Lowe merely tagged along in Jones' trip to Clark's property. They drove there in a green 2000 Acura TL, which Ramsey said was stolen the day before in Sacramento where the three are residents. The group were spotted on a survailance video making a call from a phone booth at Redding Oil in Shasta County, according to a Facebook post by one of the gas station's employees. Clutter: Prosecutors said Don Clark asked the victims to get off his property, where he sometimes recycled various items, before shooting them with a 12-gauge pump shotgun . When the group arrived at Clark's home, they parked the car on the 14000 block of Centerville Road and walked down a dirt path to Clark's property, where prosecutors said they were shot. One of the victims was shot in the side and the others were shot in the front, according to the Chico Enterprise-Record. Clark allegedly used gasoline to set the car on fire. Firefighters found two bodies in the trunk of the Acura and one in back seat. 'This is just a tragic situation where tempers flared and death occurred,' Ramsey said, noting the murders didn't appear to be drug related. Police are still waiting for DNA identification of the bodies found in the burnt Acura, but court papers named the victims reportedly based on circumstantial evidence. Investigation: Firefighters discovered three bodies in the Acura, which they believe had been set on fire by Don Clark with gasoline . In addition to other resources used to connect the bodies to Clark, Jones' mother called the Sheriff's Office to report her son was missing in the area. A week after the bodies were found, police served a search warrant on Clark's property at 5 a.m. on Wednesday. Investigators eventually found a shotgun in Clark's storage unit in Chico. Clark was questioned by police for a day and Sheriff's Lt Al Smith told the Enterprise-Record he was cooperative. He was eventually read his right to remain silent and police arrested him after several more interviews. The District Attorney's Office hasn't decided if they will consider the death sentence for Clark. If convicted, Clark also faces life in prison without parole. Clark is being held in the county jail without bail. He is expected in court again Tuesday where he will likely enter a plea.","Don Clark, of Chico, was charged with three felony counts of murder and one count of arson on Friday .

"The number of homes where no-one has a job has fallen by nearly half a million in just two years, new figures showed yesterday. There were fewer children living in families where nobody works even than at the height of the boom a decade ago, they said. The rapid drop in the ranks of benefit-dependent families comes against a background of rising employment, and of welfare reforms designed to make it less lucrative to choose to live on the state rather than to work. Iain Duncan Smith hailed the new figures that showed the number of homes where no-one has a job has fallen by nearly half a million in just two years . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith hailed the new figures as success for attempts to make work pay. 'The number of workless households has fallen by 450,000 since 2010, which means 290,000 fewer children are living in households where no one has a job,' he said. 'By reforming the welfare system to ensure that people are always better off in work than on benefits, and through our employment schemes we are helping people to turn their lives around so they can secure a better future for themselves and their families.' The Coalition's welfare reforms have come under ceaseless fire from Labour and the political left, which say changes like the 'bedroom tax' and the restriction of annual increases in benefits to below inflation have plunged large numbers of people into deep poverty. Their arguments have been backed by the bishops of the Church of England, who point to the popularity of food banks as evidence that hundreds of thousands of people are going hungry because of benefit cuts. But the figures showing levels of worklessness in the last three months of last year, published by the Office for National Statistics, indicate that large numbers of people are finding reason to take jobs. (Stock picture) The queue for the Job Centre at Unicorn House, Bromley . There were 3,843,000 homes where no-one worked in the autumn of 2010, they said, and the numbers rose the following year, to 3,857,000 in the last three months of 2011. However over the following 12 months numbers dropped by more than 300,000 and the new total, for the last three months of 2013, is 3,392,000, some 465,000 down on the autumn 2011 workless homes count. In the last months of 2011 there were 284,000 families where no-one had ever had a job. That total was down to 226,000 at the end of last year, a drop of more than a fifth. Since the autumn of 2010, the number of children living in families where no-one has a job has dropped from 1,858,000 to 1,568,000, a fall of 290,000 or more than 15 per cent. The improvement in worklessness figures comes as the private sector of the economy continues to demonstrate its ability to create jobs at a rapid rate. The latest unemployment rate level is 7.2 per cent, down from eight per cent when the Coalition came into office in 2010. But there is growing evidence that welfare reforms which discourage benefit dependency are having an effect. Last year the country's most respected economic think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the Duncan Smith reforms, which include tax credit restrictions, a squeeze on annual benefit increases, and the 'bedroom tax' reduction in . Housing Benefit for those in bigger homes, 'will strengthen peoples' incentives to work.' However Mr Duncan Smith's biggest test, the Universal Credit reform which will replace a range of state handouts with a new benefit designed to discourage dependency, has yet to be introduced across the country.","New figures show rapid drop in benefit-dependent families .

"It is a job no man would envy. An unlucky biologist has been filmed trying to cut open a whale carcass - which exploded all over him. The sperm whale was one of two which died this week after being beached in the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic, captured on camera by the Faroese Broadcasting Corporation. Scroll down for video . Biologist Bjarni Mikkelsen tried to cut open a sperm whale carcass which exploded in his face in November 2013 . Gruesome: By the time the worker on the Faroe Islands turned round to escape, it was too late . The creatures died after becoming trapped in a narrow channel, and residents of the 50,000-strong Danish community wanted to use the skeleton of one for a museum. So it fell to unlucky Bjarni Mikkelsen, a marine biologist at the National Museum of the Faroe Islands, to cut open the carcass yesterday. He had never cut open a whale before so he approached the pungent 45ft corpse gingerly. As soon as he began working, the gas trapped inside exploded, spewing tons of organs and guts into the air. The main part of the huge blast just missed him. He told MailOnline: 'The animal was more than two days old when we took it so we knew there would be some pressure on the inside, but nothing like what happened. Easy does it: Marine biologist Bjarni Mikkelsen approaches the 45ft whale with an extra-long sharp knife . There she blows: Without warning a trapped pocket of gas in the carcass bursts, ripping the corpse open . Within a fraction of a second the whale's insides burst out from the carcass, showering the biologist . Organs: Mr Mikkelsen stands apparently stunned as the whale's insides fly into the air in front of him . Shock: The whale's insides were flung for several yards across the beach in the Faroe Islands, North Atlantic . As the split-second explosion subsides the biologist begins to react and starts running away from the scene . Not a whale of a time: The unfortunate worker spins on his heels as the worst of the explosion finishes . Tough work: Thankfully Bjarni Mikkelsen wore red overalls. The whale was one of two which became trapped . Tragic: The carcass still emitting gas. The whale had become trapped and was too heavy for locals to help . Gruseome history: The blast happened on the Danish Faroe Islands, which have a long history of whaling which has been called barbaric by animal rights activists. This whale's skeleton will be used in a museum . When an animal dies, bacteria inside the carcass produce methane as part of the decomposition process. If this is not let out of the body gradually it builds up, exploding at the first opportunity. Whales are the most extreme because their huge size makes the consequences of a gas build-up so much greater. Living toads in Hamburg, Germany, started spontaneously combusting in 2005. It was thought crows were picking out their livers, leaving a hole, so when the toads puffed themselves up as a defence mechanism, their whole bodies burst. And Royal funeral attendants hurriedly drilled a hole in the coffin of the overweight English king George IV to let out gases - after an apparent botched embalming job. 'We couldn't imagine it would happen like that so it was a little bit more of a surprise. 'It wasn't a shock. We had expected something. In the situation I was more worried about something worse happening or anyone getting hurt. 'We were cutting along the dorsal part of the animal so when it exploded it did so in a very controlled way. 'It was very loud, I suppose. It's something everyone here is talking about.' Footage of the incident, which happened at 2pm yesterday, has already been seen on YouTube more than 300,000 times. The islands are 200 miles north of Scotland but have been under the banner of Denmark for 200 years, after previously being ruled by Norway. People on the Faroe Islands have been hunting pilot whales for centuries, but the practice has been condemned as cruel and unnecessary by animal rights groups. Despite the gory incident, the locals are still determined to put the skeleton in their museum as a reminder of their culture, and they are already busy cutting up the remains of the carcass. The whale's flesh will be thrown away. Remote: A map showing the location of the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic . Lying 200 miles north of Scotland, the Faroe Islands have 50,000 people but 700 miles of coastline and some of the highest sea cliffs in the world. Sperm whales dive deeper than any other great whale and swim far north .","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: 45ft whale beached in the Faroe Islands .

"After two terrorist attacks in Canada in a week left two Canadian soldiers dead, ISIS has stepped up its rhetoric calling for even more radicals to carry out mass murder and mayhem in the country. An even more horrifying fact is that an estimated 130 Muslim youths in Canada have been seduced and radicalized by ISIS and have even left Canada behind to join forces with them. The first attack happened Monday night -  a hit-and-run by suspected jihadist Martin Rouleau. Jihadist tweets: ISIS supporters have taken to Twitter to call upon more lone wolf terrorist attacks in Canada . The gunman: Alleged jihadist Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was shot during an attack against Canadians on October 20 and supporters of ISIS have been glamorizing him online ever since . The second strike was carried out by a gunman on Wendesday on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. One of the shooters, Canadian national Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was shot dead, reportsInsite Blog. Ever since Canada announced their involvement in the coalition against ISIS, jihadist supporters have taken to Twitter to call for 'justice' in the hopes to shake the country’s nerves by instilling fear and terror. One such Twitter account is that of Abu Khalid Al-Kanadi who has tweeted several calls for attack and commented on Rouleu's attack on October 21, 2014. 'Muslims in Canada, follow the footsteps of our brave brother Martin Rouleau who took revenge for Canadian military aggression in our lands,' he wrote. One day later his account was suspended. Insite Blog reports that a second jihadist Twitter account posted on October 21 and said that Canada is 'starting to pay the price of intervention' of the war against ISIS and followed up with a second tweet urging more attacks. 'A Canadian Revert killed a Canadian Soldier then he earned Shahada at the hands of the kuffar All This reward.. without evn leaving Canada.' Gaining support: Jihadists are hoping that by posting their opinions on Twitter more youths will join ISIS . On the same user's Ask.fm account a different anonymous user commented on the fact that Rouleau attacked soldiers and not civilians. 'Rouleau was NOT cowardly...he attacked soldiers, not civilians.' The writer of the post responded, 'yep..very true.' Insite Blog adds that on the next day, the same jihadist commented on the shootings by saying, 'Canadian Soldiers told to leave their uniforms at home when out in public. Now they are like their allies the Iraqi Army.' A separate allegedly Canadian jihadist took to Twitter to post an article about Rouleau's shooting and wrote it 'was only a matter of time' ending with '#IS.' For jihadists on Twitter, the attacks are not against fellow Canadian citizens, rather they believe they are against soldiers fighting the ISIS movement. 'u kill innocent Muslims in Syr, Irq and so on in the na,e of dfnding agnst terrorism and u lie to the masses, dnt be surprised.' Spreading propaganda: Charismatic online personalities are calling upon youth to join forces with ISIS . The account of a fighter believed to be in Syria added, 'After Canada decided to Bomb and murder Muslims, Supposedly just few bullets shook all of #Canada. Expected wasnt it? #Ottawashooting.' The Twitter account of a Dutch jihadist militant in Syria stated something along the same lines with, 'Bomb innocent people in Syria/Iraq and you expect roses and hus from Muslims back home? It's called action/reaction. Go figure.' Another jihadist on Twitter referenced Canada's shock after the attacks and claims they should have 'expected' the retaliation. 'It's always stunning when a country that has brought violence and military force to numerous countries acts shocked and bewildered. when someone brings a tiny faction of that violence back to that country. it's not the slightest bit surprising or difficulty to understand why people who identify with those on the other end of the Canadian bombs. and bullets would decide to attack the military responsible for that violence.' The wave of Canadians joining ISIS has fueled citizens, many of them Muslim, to fight against the radicalization of youth in the country. Shooting: Michael Zehaf-Bibeau shot dead a soldier guarding the national war memorial before storming into the parliament on Wednesday and  was later shot dead inside the parliament after firing multiple shots . One such person is Christianne Boudreau, whose son Damian Clairmont died fighting near the Syrian city of Aleppo for jihadist causes. 'My knees are shaking so please forgive me. I’m a mother, not a public speaker,' said Boudreau at the OWN IT 2014 conference in Calgary in early October. The OWN IT conference calls upon Muslim families to come together and fight the radicalization of Muslim youth. The Star reports that according to the Canadian government there are about 130 jihadist fighters who've left the country to fight but that the number is growing. Unfortunately, the Muslim community estimates that the number is already much higher. With the popularization of Twitter and online forums as tools to express beliefs worldwide, radical youths are able to lure in other supporters from around the globe. ISIS uses Twitter to spread propaganda and call for lone wolf attacks. These attackers are later revered as demigods and used as bait to call other into action. The Star reports that having declared the Western world full of hypocrites, radicalized youth see themselves as the chosen ones, turning to online radical imams and charismatic leaders. Community leaders have coined this jihadist online support movement the 'Sheikh Google' phenomenon.","Suspected terrorist attacks in Canada have sparked commentary from the online jihadist community on Twitter who are calling upon others to strike .

"Many young adults have a horrible feeling that, come middle age, they will develop the sartorial habits and odd tics of their parents. And they are right – except it happens even earlier than they expect. In fact, most find themselves turning into their own mother or father at the tender age of 32. And the reason?

A survey by website Netmums listed 50 . ‘giveaway behaviours’ that show you are turning into your own parent, . from preferring estate cars over hatchbacks to realising the bins go out . more often than you do.

"A schoolboy tearfully begged doctors to help him hours before he died from meningitis, a conduct hearing has been told. Ten-year-old William Cressey pleaded with them: ‘Please help me. Why won’t you help me? If you don’t help me, I am going to die. Please help me, I don’t want to die.’ William was prescribed Calpol and sent home from hospital because doctors thought he was suffering from a migraine, his mother said. William Cressey, aged ten, begged doctors at Darlington Memorial Hospital for help before he died of meningitis . Hours later Cheryl Cressey took him . back to the ward but he suffered a fit and died later that day. Mrs . Cressey said she repeatedly alerted doctors and nurses to her son’s . deteriorating condition, but was dismissed as a ‘neurotic mum’. Christopher Kirby, one of the nurses . in charge of looking after him, is appearing before the Nursing and . Midwifery Council in central London. He admits failing to carry out proper . observations on William and record keeping errors. But he denies . walking away when a colleague asked him for help with the boy. Cheryl Cressey, left, had to take William home after asking for help from staff including Christopher Kirby, right . William, from Croft, County Durham, . was admitted to Darlington Memorial Hospital on February 28, 2005 but by . 9am the following day the decision was made by the doctors to send him . home. Mrs Cressey told the hearing: . ‘William’s eyes were seriously protruding and he was having difficulty . in closing his lids over his eyes. ‘I told a nurse that his eyes were really causing him suffering and she went to senior male nurse Christopher Kirby.’ Darlington Memorial Hospital, in County Durham, where both William Cressey and Bernice Zair died . Mrs Cressey said the nurse explained the situation to Mr Kirby. Bernice Zair, 89, was allegedly given a mattress on the floor to sleep on at Darlington Memorial Hospital . ‘His reply was, “Well you know what . to do about that don’t you?”, she replied, “no”, and he said, “Just . don’t touch it”, and then he walked away.’ Breaking down in tears, she added: . ‘William heard this and said: “That was not very kind, was it mum?” Tears rolled down his face.’ She said her son lay on the bed . writhing in agony and vomiting but doctors refused to accept that he had . meningitis because he did not have a rash. After being kept in overnight he was . sent home on March 1 with Calpol and another painkiller, ibuprofen, and a . cardboard tray to be sick in. His mother took him back to hospital . but by then he was beyond help and he suffered the fatal fit. He had . seen five doctors in three days who were unable to diagnose and treat . him. His mother, now in her early 50s, said she repeatedly told doctors . that she suspected meningitis but each time was ignored. Derek Zeitlin, for the Nursing and . Midwifery Council, told the hearing there was no suggestion that Mr . Kirby’s actions had caused William’s death. The hearing continues. A girl of five died from meningitis less than 48 hours after she was twice diagnosed with a bug and sent home by doctors, an inquest heard yesterday. Kelsey Smart, from Kingswood, south Gloucestershire, was initially taken to an out-of-hours emergency GP service after she started vomiting and developed a red rash across her stomach in February last year. Her mother, Hannah Smart, told the inquest that locum GP Dr Jens Rohrbeck, who saw Kelsey at Frendoc’s clinic at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, said she had picked up a virus and that she did not need to be seen by hospital doctors. Mrs Smart said that the next morning she took Kelsey to the Orchard Medical Centre in Kingswood, where the schoolgirl saw  Dr Sarah Grant. Mrs Smart said Dr Grant told her Kelsey had a bug and sent her home without any drugs. Later that day Kelsey had a fit. She was taken to Bristol Children’s Hospital and put on life support but doctors later pronounced her brain dead, Avon Coroner’s Court heard. Recording a narrative verdict, Avon Coroner Maria Voisin said: ‘Earlier intervention is better but what cannot be said is whether earlier treatment would have resulted in a different outcome for Kelsey.’","William Cressey, 10, died day after being sent home from Darlington Memorial Hospital with Calpol and a cardboard tray to be sick in .

"They may not play ‘fetch’ or chase butterflies, but fish are social and playful creatures too, scientists claim. They have filmed cichlid fish species ‘playing’ for the first time, recording the animals repeatedly hitting a thermometer that sprung back towards them. Experts have previously found that species such as wasps and reptiles are capable of play, unlike previously thought. Scroll down for video . Scientists have filmed cichlid fish species ‘playing’ for the first time. Here, one of the fish strikes a bottom-weighted thermometer that immediately righted itself. It was often struck repeatedly in bouts, demonstrating the fish was playing . Professor Gordon Burghardt, an animal behaviour expert at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, explained: ‘Play is repeated behaviour that is incompletely functional in the context or at the age in which it is performed and is initiated voluntarily when the animal or person is in a relaxed or low-stress setting.’ He and his colleagues – Professor Vladimir Dinets and James Murphy, of the Smithsonian National Zoological Park in Washington DC - are the first to to document play with objects in a cichlid fish species. The research illustrates how play is embedded in species' brains. Cats (illustrated) are known for their playful nature, but wasps and fish play too . They filmed three male fish individually over the course of two years and witnessed the animals repeatedly hitting a bottom-weighted thermometer that sprung back towards them after it was struck. The presence or absence of food, or other fish within the aquarium or visible in an adjacent aquarium, had no effect on their behaviour, they reported in the journal Ethology. Professor Burghardt said the fish were playing, because the thermometer-attacking behaviour satisfied his criteria for play. ‘The quick righting response seemed the primary stimulus factor that maintained the behaviour,’ he said. ‘We have observed octopus doing this with balls by pulling them underwater and watching them pop back up again. This reactive feature is common in toys used for children and companion animals.’ Professor Burghardt thinks that by observing how different animals play, scientists can learn more about why humans do it too. His research illustrates how play is embedded in species' biology, including in the brain. He believes play, like much of animals' psychology including emotions, motivations, perceptions and intellect, is part of their evolutionary history and not just random, meaningless behavior. ‘Play is an integral part of life and may make a life worth living,’ he added. Professor Gordon Burghardt defines play as a repeated activity that is essentially pointless, such as hunting that does not result in prey. Studies have shown that when rats play, they play fight by competing to hold the nap of the neck and nuzzle it instead if biting, as in a real fight, the APA reported. It's less obvious when insects are playing. Professor Elisabette Palagi, at the University of Pisa, claims that wasps play before they hibernate for winter. They do this by performing a ritual when one raises its head, beats its antennae and begs for food by putting its mouth closer to another one of the insects - without receiving food. Scientists are divided about whether playing leads to better social skills in animals. Some actions may have little function (like the wasps' ritual) whereas others, such as play fighting, prepares creatures for hostile attacks or to read each other's feelings.","'Play' was defined as 'repeated behaviour that is incompletely functional'

"Furious parents are threatening to bill a teachers’ union for lost pay and childcare as strikes in support of a member who has not taught for 14 years disrupt pupils’ education. Julie Davies is accused of holding thousands of parents to ransom by leading walkouts against attempts to stop her working for the National Union of Teachers. Mrs Davies, who is paid £45,900 a year as an English teacher despite having been a full-time NUT rep since 2000, was suspended after local heads accused her of ‘confrontation’ and encouraging ‘a climate of mistrust’. Workers: National Union of Teachers official Julie Davies, 58 in front of striking colleagues who will walk out again for two days this week over her suspension . The 58-year-old militant is bringing two secondary schools to a standstill over her determination to organise trade union activities at taxpayers’ expense. There have been growing calls for an overhaul of so-called facility time, which forces taxpayers to fund trade union organisers. Ministers said last night that taxpayers’ cash must not be used to fund union reps. Mrs Davies, who bizarrely calls herself a ‘teacher, union rep, psychokiller, obviously’ on Twitter, lives in a £500,000 home in North London and has earned at least £500,000 since 2000. Strikes were carried out last week at two secondary schools in the North London borough of Haringey – Fortismere and Highgate Wood – with two further walkouts planned tomorrow and Thursday. Description: On Twitter, Mrs Davies describes herself as a 'teacher, union rep, Psychokiller, obviously' The education of up to 3,000 children is being disrupted. On her campaign website, she threatens ‘extensive strike action’. But one parent said: ‘Many of us will lose pay because we will have to stay at home and look after the kids, while others will have to fork out for childcare. We will be billing the NUT.’ Day job: Mrs Davis was released full-time from teaching duties in 2000 for union activities, but headteachers have had her suspended for allegedly encouraging ‘a climate of mistrust’ A Fortismere parent who did not want to be named said: ‘I don’t understand what relevance this has to teachers at my son’s school. I don’t appreciate my child being at home for another two days. He’s missing a fair amount of education.’ Fortismere is urging the NUT to call off this week’s strikes. The mother added: ‘I think the school are trying the best they can.’ Gerard Kelly, chairman of governors at a Haringey secondary and a member of a commission that investigated education in the borough in 2012, said the strikes were ‘absolutely unjustifiable’. He added: ‘All the secondary heads and the majority of primary heads complained about her unconstructive attitude to working with them. ‘Why should the union expect heads to subsidise a post when the person in that post is doing their best to be uncooperative and has been for many years? They will have to back down.’ In tweets earlier this year, he said she had ‘probably been the biggest impediment’ to education in Haringey since the Nazi Hermann Goering, adding: ‘Approx 500 bombs were dropped on Haringey in the Blitz and I reckon 5 schs were badly affected. Do you think JD disrupted more or fewer?’ Mrs Davies has already lost a High Court case in which she claimed Haringey Council lacked the power to suspend her. She was employed as a full-time assistant teacher by Haringey in 1992, but was elected deputy divisional secretary of the NUT for Haringey in 1997 and released from her teaching duties three days a week for union work. Her request to be released full time was granted in 2000, with Davies being elected branch secretary every year since. Mrs Davies was released from teaching English at Northumberland Park community school in North London, pictured, to carry out ‘staff representation’ full time, while still picking up her annual pay . Battle: Julie Davies has a website setting out why she and others are striking and why she believes she was victimised . In July this year, the council suspended her over claims that she breached its code of conduct. Allegations against her include claims in two letters from local primary and secondary head teachers. Both said they would not contribute to a council fund used to pay Mrs Davies’ wages. The secondary heads said: ‘Ms Davies’ preferred approach and working style is one of confrontation and obfuscation. She seeks to encourage a climate of mistrust... rather than seeking to develop effective communication channels or relationships based on trust and openness.’ Chris McGovern, an ex-headmaster and trade unionist, said: ‘Unions should support the right of children to be educated – not the right of this person to be paid for not doing their job.’ The Department for Education said: ‘Teachers are paid to work in the classroom. Taxpayers’ money should not be funding trade union representatives who spend little or no time teaching.’ Up to 800 teachers spend all or part of their working week on union work – costing taxpayers £15million a year. Some are paid teaching salaries of £70,000 funded by local authorities and schools, but never set foot in a classroom. Reps are usually paid from a council fund that schools contribute to. The aim is to free up a teacher for union duties without over-burdening any one school. Under the system, union officials can take ‘reasonable’ paid time off for union work, called facility time, such as representing members in employment disputes. But there are wide differences around the country in how the term ‘reasonable’ is interpreted. A TaxPayers’ Alliance survey of public funding for all unions in 2012 found Birmingham, which has 1.1million residents, spent £458,000 for ten full-time education reps, while Kent, with a population of 1.5million, spent just £144,000. Guidance from former Education Secretary Michael Gove was meant to ensure union reps did more teaching and let schools rule how long they could have off.","Julie Davies will lead two days of strikes at two schools over her suspension .

"Two jet black eyes peer out menacingly out from a blanket of green. Gliding effortlessly through a carpet of algae, this American alligator barely skims the surface - until it lifts its head and seems to break into a smile. The feared creature shows rows of small pointed teeth as its jaws gape wide in a relaxed yawn. Now you see me: An alligator pokes its head out of algae-covered water at a pool in Florida . Spotted by marine wildlife photographer Mark Conlin, 54, the reptile made its sneaky appearance in a small pool connected to the Wacissa River in Jefferson County, Florida. Returning to the same spot every day for two weeks, the Colorado-born photographer was told by locals that a big gator could be found lurking in the water. 'For the first couple of days I never saw it, and assumed I was in the wrong spot as there are a bunch of small side pools off the main river,' he said.

Despite leaving a small trail, the duckweed in the pool is so thick it fills in the space behind the reptile immediately. Hidden menace: The thick algae in the pool provided the alligator with the perfect camouflage . Back in the main river, where pines and cypress trees line both sides, the duckweed is barely visible, washed away by the force of the current. Yet in the summer, the algae in this hideaway gathers in abundance, covering both water and wildlife - with only a solitary reptile breaking the green.

"Eurozone unemployment hit an all-time high of almost 19 million in November, new figures have revealed. The figures were revealed as the EU warned record unemployment and fraying social welfare systems in southern Europe risk creating a new divide in the continent. Official data showed eurozone unemployment rose to 11.8 percent in November, the highest since the euro currency was founded in 1999. The rate was up from 11.7 percent in October and 10.6 percent a year earlier. The figures come a day after the head of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, provoked scorn by claiming the euro was out of the danger zone, telling a conference: 'I . think we can say that the existential threat against the euro has . essentially been overcome. ‘In 2013, the question won’t be if the euro will or will not implode.’ Jobless: Queues outside the Job Centre in London. but these are scenes common across member countries of the eurozone . In the wider 27-nation EU, the world's largest economic block with 500 million people, unemployment broke the 26 million mark for the first time. 'Last year has been another very bad year for Europe in terms of unemployment and the deteriorating social situation,' said Laszlo Andor, the EU's Employment Commissioner. 'Moreover, it is unlikely that Europe will see much socio-economic improvement in 2013,' he said. A closer look at the figures shows the rise in unemployment was greatest among those countries - mostly in southern Europe - where market concerns over excessive public debt have pushed governments to make the toughest savings. States have raised taxes and slashed spending - including by cutting wages and pensions, measures that hit the labor force in the pocket and reduce demand in the economy. Jobs crisis: Eurozone unemployment rates November 2012, seasonally adjusted . The single biggest increase in unemployment over the past year took place in Greece, where joblessness soared to 26 per cent in September, up 7.1 percentage points over September 2011's 18.9 per cent. But the highest overall rate in the EU was in Spain, where 26.6 per cent of the workforce was jobless in November, up 3.6 percentage points over last year. By contrast, Austria posted the lowest unemployment rate in the EU, at 4.5 per cent. The rate in Luxembourg was 5.1 per cent, and the rate in Germany was 5.4 per cent. And increasingly, southern nations are chipping away at their social safety system to make do. Burning issue: A policeman is seen in flames as he tries to escape after a petrol bomb was thrown at him during riots over austerity measures in front of the parliament in Athens, Greece. The single biggest increase in unemployment over the past year took place in Greece, where joblessness soared to 26 per cent . 'Most national welfare systems have lost much of their ability to protect household incomes against the effects of the crisis,' said Andor. The figures illustrate the daunting tasks confronting the European Union. While the threat of a collapse of the eurozone due to too much government debt may have receded, many national economies wallow in recession and joblessness continues to rise, creating poverty and fueling social discontent. 'A new divide is emerging between . countries that seem trapped in a downward spiral of falling output, fast . rising unemployment and eroding disposable incomes and those that have . so far shown good or at least some resilience,' a statement from Andor's . office said. Beyond . savings cuts, governments have also made reforms - particularly of labor . practices and education - to promote employment. But they take time, . both to enact and to feed through an economy. Fears: During the G8 Summit in May last year,  US President Barack Obama had an unscheduled meeting with just the Eurozone leaders. States have raised taxes and slashed spending - including by cutting wages and pensions, measures that hit the labor force in the pocket and reduce demand in the economy . Hot topic: Activists of the Occupy Frankfurt movement have set up a fire near the Euro sculpture in front of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany . As unemployment across the eurozone continues to rise, many analysts are concerned whether the political will to continue to cut budgets can be sustained. 'We expect the unemployment rate at the eurozone level to continue to rise from 11.8 per cent in the latest figures to 12.5 per cent by early 2014, as eurozone businesses and households remain wary, and governments continue to cut back,' said Tom Rogers of Ernst & Young Eurozone Forecast. One bright spot in Tuesday's EU statistical releases were new figures showing economic sentiment in the eurozone had improved in December. The so-called economic sentiment indicator rose by 1.3 points to 87 as confidence improved among consumers and almost all business sectors. Analysts said it was likely a result of improvements in financial markets, but warned that with unemployment still high, a recovery in the economy was months away.","Unemployment rose to 11.8 per cent in November, with 18.8m unemployed .

"Legendary: A new Yeti resort will offer tourists the chance to find the elusive creature . A new Yeti resort is to be opened in Russia to encourage tourists to find the elusive creature. The planned Yeti Park in Sheregesh, Siberia will include a hotel and a museum, and is intended to attract those keen to . be the first to prove the existence of the yeti. The . region's governor Aman Tuleyev has offered a £20,500 reward - one . million roubles - to anyone who can catch a yeti and prove its . existence.  'I'll sit down with him, chat and have a cup of tea,' he . promised. Igor Idimeshev, 48, deputy head of Sheregesh's local council in Siberia, and the man behind the new park said: 'We are building the Yeti Park now, and of course there will be a chance for people who come here to see creature. For me having Yetis here means something much more than the simple tourist attraction'. He added: 'We will have a dedicated plot of land for Yeti park, where anyone can see it. We will organise a museum, exhibiting all Yeti-related objects, like the trees they make into arches, and many other things. This location will be used for all future conferences and seminars devoted to the Yeti'. 'The Yeti theme is 'important for the region'. Last . year Russian academic Professor Valentin Sapunov claimed a population . of 200 yeti exist in  the Kemerovo, Khakassia and Altai regions of . Siberia. Mr Idimeshev insists he has seen the creature - dismissed by most scientists as legend - several times. He told the Siberian Times: 'I've seen this creature several times. Insistence: Igor Idimeshev is the man behind the park. He claims that the yeti is an 'extraterrestrial creature' that looks over things' on Earth . 'And when I saw the yeti's eyes my . only thought was that they are not from Earth - they are clearly of an . extraterrestrial nature. 'To me, the yeti is an extraterrestrial creature. I believe that it is like a controller to look over things here on Earth.' Mr Idimeshev added that the creature - known as Big Men by locals - could 'suddenly disappear and re-materialise' He added: 'Another extraordinary thing is that yeti's hair is luminous at night, and also that the Yeti can walk on water. 'Every man round here sees him when he hunts. It's all right to mention the fact of meeting - but we don't go into . the details of it, like where exactly it was, what he did do, or your . luck will be gone. Tourism: The park will be located in the Sheregesh ski resort in the Shora Mountain area of Keremovo in southern Siberia . 'The . feeling is one of fear. It is a fear that you cannot explain rationally. You feel yourself very scared and tense at the same time. 'One of the closest comparisons is . the feeling of looking into a wolf's eyes. If you've ever seen them - I . mean a wild wolf,  not a caged animal - you remember a feeling of them . being something very unusual, alien. 'Like with a wolf, you can see a yeti's eyes from a distance of some 100-150 metres. They are quite hypnotising. Proof: The Daily Mail backed an expedition in 1954 in search of evidence of the creature's existence . Mr Idimeshev admitted his mother had told him to keep the details of his encounters with the yeti to himself. He said: 'The only person I ever told everything in detail to was my mother - and she taught me to keep it to myself. ''People will simply think you've made it up', she told me.' Last year, three separate sightings of Yeti were reported in southern Siberia.","Region's governor offered a £20,500 reward to anyone who can catch a yeti .

"A family of sperm whales have shown their gentle side by allowing a group of divers to swim alongside them in the middle of the Caribbean Sea. Known as the world's largest predators, sperm whales can weigh up to 45 tonnes and measure up to 59ft in length. They can dive up to 3,280ft and have rows of razor-sharp teeth 7in long . But this group of whales dispelled the Moby Dick myth by letting the team of divers swim just yards away from them. Tails of the unexpected: Andy Morris, from the UK, is dwarfed by the sperm whale's tail as he swims alongside it three miles off the coast at Dominica, Caribbean . Among the divers was Brit Andy Morris, a 41-year-old systems analyst, from Stoke Poges, who got within arm's reach of the giant's tail. The photographs were captured three miles of the coast of Dominica by wildlife photographer and expedition leader Amos Nachoum, 63. He tracked the whales using a hydrophone - an underwater microphone that picks up the whale communications. The divers approached slowly, as sperm whales can be easily scared off and may dive to the ocean depths for up to 90 minutes. Sperm whales are the world's largest predators and they can eat as much as one ton of squid per day with their teeth which can measure up to 7in long . Divers were found it a 'great privilege'  to get so close to the family of sperm whales which were spotted just three miles off the coast of Dominica in the Caribbean . Mr Amos, from Israel, said: 'All animals have comfort zones and some of the sperm whale families have become habituated and friendly with us in the water. 'After all, whales are faster and stronger than any human swimmer. 'As long as the swimmer is gentle and soft in the water, whales usually will accept our presence with them. That is a great privilege.' Females and calves stay in Dominica all year round but the male arrives only for mating between January to March. Sperm whales, which are known to feed on giant squid, were almost hunted to extinction in the late 1960s but have since made a comeback. Divers saw a baby sperm whale swimming with her mother at Dominica in the Caribbean. Males are only seen with females in mating season from January to March .","Andy Morris, 41, swam just yards away from the sperm whales three miles off the cost of Dominica in the Caribbean .

"No need to remember: The revolutionary pill contains a chip that could end the need for passwords and paper forms of ID . For forgetful types, it promises to be a new wonder pill. But far from boosting the memory, the tiny swallowable capsules contain a minute chip that transmits an individual’s personal details. Electronic devices will be able to read the unique signal, ending the need for passwords and paper forms of ID, such as passports - and freeing users from such mundane tasks as recalling countless codes and security answers. Already approved by the both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European regulators, the ingestible sensor is powered by a battery using the acid in the wearer’s stomach. Each pill is designed to move through the body at the normal process of digestion, and according to engineers working on the device, it can be taken every day for up to a month. Based on a technology developed by California-based Proteus Digital Health, it contains a computer chip and a switch, which is activated when it comes in contact with acid in the user’s body. It then sends a tiny signal that can be read by mobile devices and allows them to verify the identity of an individual. The controversial pill is being championed by Motorola executive, Regina Dugan, once dubbed ‘America’s smartest engineer’. ‘Essentially, your entire body becomes your authentication token,’ she said. She was the first female director of the US government’s spy technology agency Darpa (Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency) before joining Google’s Motorola Mobility division last year. Speaking at a conference last month, she said: ‘Authentication is irritating. In fact it’s so irritating only about half the people do it. ‘Despite the fact there is a lot of information about you on your smartphone, which makes you far more prone to identity theft. ‘After 40 years of advances in computation, we’re still authenticating the same way we did years ago - passwords. In fact it’s worse, the average users does it 39 times a day and it takes them 2.3 seconds every time they do it. Controversial: The new technology has been created by Proteus Digital Health who are planning to create electronic tattoos that can hold personal data . ‘Power users will do it up to 100 times a day. So what are we doing about it? Well [Motorola] is thinking of a whole variety of options for how to do better at authentication such as near-term things including tokens or fobs that have NFC or bluetooth. ‘But you can also think about a means of authentication you can wear on your skin every day, say an electronic tattoo or a vitamin pill.’ The company is also exploring the use electronic tattoos that contain personal verification data.","Electronic devices can read a unique signal coming from a chip in the pill .

"Britney Spears has opened up about the 90-minute yoga sessions and thrice-weekly cardio workouts that prepared her for her two-year Piece Of Me residency at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. Her comments come after she was accused of faking her toned six-pack with contouring make-up when photos from final dress rehearsals were released last month. The 32-year-old mother-of-two told Shape that her toned body is actually hard-won, especially those defined stomach muscles. Hard work: Britney Spears, who was accused of wearing contouring make-up on her stomach during her Vegas shows, has credited her body to 90-minute yoga sessions and thrice-weekly cardio workouts . 'I'm doing 90 minutes of yoga twice a . week in addition to a lot of cardio - hour-long sessions three times a . week with my trainer, Tony Martinez,' she said. This is not the first time that Britney has credited yoga with changing her body for the better. In June last year, her Los Angeles-based yoga teacher Elizabeth I shared some of the poses that have proved especially beneficial for the singer, such as the Bow, the Boat and the Camel. 'Sometimes we focus on the core or relaxation, but other times I just kick her butt!' 'Sometimes we focus on the core or relaxation, but other times I just kick her butt!' she told Shape, explaining that these moves help strengthen the core and sculpt the shoulders. Britney was first accused of wearing body contouring make-up on her stomach area when images from her final dress rehearsals hit the internet just after Christmas. And when the singer posted a snap on Instagram from her first show on December 28th, fans were quick to raise the issue in the comments. 'I see the spray tan marks from the abs,' said one, while another commented, 'Ur Abs are so fake!

Britney performed over four nights after Christmas and is now taking a month-long break. She will return to the stage for a month of shows beginning at the end of January. The star will perform 24 of her hits each night and has made sure to include many old favorites for her fans.","Britney was accused of .

"We may think of binge drinking as a distinctly modern phenomenon, but these extraordinary mugshots remind us that police have been attempting to tackle alcohol abuse for decades. The images from the early 1900s show a succession of women who were banned from their local pubs in Birmingham after being arrested and dubbed 'habitual drunkards'. The problem drinkers - some of whom look distinctly sinister although others have a much more respectable air - were placed on the city's 'Black List', barring them getting served in pubs. Sinister: One-eyed Kate Kibble is one of the 37 women banned from Birmingham's pubs in 1902 . Miscreant: Alice Tatlow, another woman whose mugshot was published to warn publicans about her, had the Prince of Wales's feathers tattooed on her right foot . Middle-aged: But Mary Bayliss is one of the many respectable-looking women barred from drinking in Birmingham . Officials circulated a list of 82 . drunkards - including 37 women - around Birmingham's pubs, warning . landlords to keep an eye out for them. Each notice bore a mugshot of the criminal, as well as a description of their 'stout builds' and 'oval faces'. The historical discovery was unearthed by family-tree website ancestry.co.uk. A spokesman said: 'In order to . enforce the 1902 Sale of Liquor to Habitual Drunkard’s Licensing Act, . the Watch Committee of the City of Birmingham provided licensed liquor . sellers and clubs with photos and descriptions of people deemed . ""habitual drunkards"", who were not to be sold liquor. Drunk: Many of those on the city's 'Blacklist', like Susannah Booton, had been arrested for public drunkenness . Young: Most of the women on the list were aged between 30 and 40; this is Sarah Henson . 'Habitual drinkers': Elizabeth Thompson is pictured after her arrest for being drunk in public . 'The 82 persons in the book were convicted of drunkenness between 1903 and 1906, typically at the Birmingham City Police Court.' Many of the women featured on the . list bore physical deformities and tattoos, which would have marked them . out from respectable Edwardian society. However, most of them managed to hold down jobs, working as charwomen, wood-choppers, polishers or grease merchants. Ferocious: Sarah Teresa Evans and Ellen Heaton are yet more fierce-looking women with a drinking problem . Criminal: Annie Hodgkins, alias 'Hodgkiss', was charged with being drunk and disorderly . Jobless: But unlike Eliza Fallon, many of the women were gainfully employed as cleaners or similar . Poster: Documents with their pictures and physical descriptions were circulated by police . List: The astonishing historical documents have recently been unearthed by a family-tree website . One was a street performer who played the tin whistle for money outside pubs, and several made a living as prostitutes. Most of the women apparently sometimes went under aliases, suggesting they were habitual criminals. While drunkenness is today associated . primarily with the young, only two of the women were under 25, with five . of them over the age of 50. Trouble: Despite her 46 years, Mary Bayliss was clearly not as mature as could be hoped . Careers: Sarah Henson combined her job as a dressmaker with an extra source of income as a prostitute . Suspicious: Elizabeth Thompson held three additional aliases, pointing to a criminal background . Scarred: Susannah Booton is one of many women to bear facial disfigurements . Disabled: Sarah Evans was suffering from a severe disfigurement which made her nose fall in . Law: The mugshots are a result of a 1902 law aiming to crack down on public drunkenness .","Birmingham officials circulated list of 83 'habitual drunkards' around pubs .

"The Tories will revive their £1million inheritance tax pledge at the next election. David Cameron said yesterday the threshold should rise to ensure only the rich pay death duties. Without action, the number of families paying the 40 per cent levy will double to one in ten over the next five years. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron said he wanted to increase the amount of money people can leave loved ones without being hit by inheritance tax . Mr Cameron told a PM Direct event at the Meridian Community Centre in Peacehaven, Sussex that inheritance tax should only be paid by the rich . The Tories have been buoyed in the polls after unveiling a major shake-up of pensions . People in the audience at the event used iPads and mobile phones to take pictures of the PM . On Saturday, the Mail urged the Prime . Minister to act, arguing in a leader that disillusioned Conservatives . could back the party again if the thresholds on inheritance tax and . stamp duty went up. Yesterday Mr Cameron said the issue . was ‘something we’ll have to address in our manifesto’. ‘I believe in . people being able to pass money through the generations and pass things . on to their children,’ he said. ‘You build a stronger society. Inheritance tax should only really be paid by the rich – it shouldn’t be . paid by people who’ve worked hard and saved and who bought a family . house.’ Mr Cameron’s intervention is part of a deliberate pitch to ‘grey voters’ who have been hit by low interest rates. In last week’s Budget, George Osborne . targeted a series of measures at the over-60s, including ‘pensioner . bonds’ offering market-leading rates, increased ISA savings limits and . opt-outs from pension annuities. The Prime Minister suggested the . Tories could revive their ‘brilliant’ pledge from the last election to . raise the inheritance tax threshold to £1million when challenged over . the broken promise by a prominent Tory councillor. During a question-and-answer session . with Saga members in Peacehaven, East Sussex, he said the policy had . been impossible to deliver because the Lib Dems were ‘very opposed’ to . it in coalition negotiations. But he acknowledged that rising house . prices had put it back on the agenda. Mr Cameron stressed that Mr . Osborne’s proposal for a higher threshold had forced the then Labour . government to effectively double the existing allowance for married . couples. Mr Cameron also hinted that he would protect benefits for wealthy from cuts in the next Tory manifesto . The move is also widely credited with . killing off Gordon Brown’s plan to call a snap poll – ‘the election that . never was’ of 2007. Mr Cameron said: ‘One of the reasons George Osborne . made that pledge was this point about property. ‘When the limit was £300,000, quite a . lot of hard-working families, who worked hard and saved and put money . into their house, were being caught by inheritance tax. Tax rates by the numbers . ‘The ambition is still there – I would . like to go further ... it’s something we’ll have to address in our . manifesto.’ Mr Cameron appeared to be unsure of the existing rules – . suggesting couples have a joint threshold of about £750,000. In fact the . figure is £650,000, twice the £325,000 for a single person. Tory sources yesterday said precise . details of the party’s new stance would not be revealed until closer to . the election. Experts also pointed out that the Treasury has frozen the . threshold until 2017/8 to help pay for the introduction of the new cap . on the cost of social care. But Mr Cameron’s statement of intent will cheer many traditional Conservatives. Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘It is . very encouraging. The Prime Minister is starting to show us what a . proper Conservative government would look like. ‘This is becoming a big issue again . because rising house prices mean that a lot of people who are not rich . are being caught up by a tax that was meant for the very wealthy. ‘It is a natural urge to want to leave . something for your children and it is wrong that people of average . means who have worked hard all their lives are facing these punitive tax . rates.’ Former Tory Cabinet minister John . Redwood gave a more cautious welcome to the announcement, warning that . other tax cuts, such as raising the 40p threshold or reducing capital . gains tax, might take priority. He said: ‘All tax cuts are good news, but there will be plenty of competition for which will be the best tax cuts.’ Tom Jones, deputy chairman of Lewes . District Council, who challenged Mr Cameron over the issue yesterday, . said a person’s main home should be excluded from inheritance tax . altogether. Mr Jones, son-in-law of Dame Vera . Lynn, said: ‘I understand why we have not been able to keep our promise . on this but it is disappointing. ‘House prices are rising year on year, . if not month on month, and people who want to leave something for their . children or grandchildren are being caught up by this. It is . iniquitous.’ The Office for Budget Responsibility . warned last week the proportion of estates hit by death duties was set . to double from almost one in 20 to nearly one in ten during the next . five years. The independent forecaster said . revenue from inheritance tax will soar by an average of almost 11 per . cent a year as ever more families are dragged into it. Mr Cameron also . hinted yesterday that he will repeat his manifesto pledge to protect . pensioner benefits such as the winter fuel allowance and free TV licence . at the next election. The Labour lead over the Conservatives has narrowed dramatically in recent days, and is down to just one point in three different polls, including this one from YouGov for the Sunday Times . He said a final decision had yet to be . taken, but he added that scrapping it would ‘save a tiny amount of . money and introduce another complexity into the system’. The Prime Minister also insisted that . the new £75,000 cap on the costs of social care would prevent people . having to sell their homes to pay for end-of-life care.","Prime Minister expresses regret that Lib Dems killed off idea in 2010 .

"The black dot on his nose and his white-socked paws do not single out Frankie as a particularly remarkable cat. So it must be his charm that has led this moggy into the centre of a bitter tug-of-love which ended in a courtroom drama and left one family £20,000 worse off. The extraordinary row, which has set two lifetime animal lovers against each other, began last year when Rosalind Mahoney handed over Frankie to June Allan on what she thought was a temporary basis. Frankie: New owner June Allan called the nine-year-old cat 'my best friend' But Mrs Allan, 83, has refused to hand the cat back and, in a controversial ruling, the judge found in her favour – leaving the pet’s original owners devastated. The questions over custody of the cat began in June last year when Mrs Mahoney asked her vet for help to find Frankie a friendly family to live with while builders renovated their house. Mrs Mahoney and her husband Michael, a director of advertising agency Havas Worldwide, were finally ready to transform their property close to Richmond Park, South-West London, into their dream home. This involved gutting the house. The Mahoneys and their two children Milo and Rosie had to move to a rented flat nearby and their landlord had said that nine-year-old Frankie was not welcome. Mrs Mahoney says she made it clear from the outset she was only looking for someone to foster her pet. But she was forced to resort to the courts after attempts by mediators to persuade Mrs Allan to give Frankie back – including a visit by the police in December last year – failed. However, elderly Mrs Allan, of Fulham, West London, who has taken in more than 30 cats over a lifetime of animal welfare, maintains she would never have accepted Frankie on a temporary basis. She says that for her, a cat is for life. The confusion led to court and a hearing to decide custody of Frankie was held at West London County Court on December 13. District Judge Ryan dismissed Mrs Mahoney’s civil claim ‘for the return of her personal chattel (cat named Frankie)’ but did not explain his reasons. Upset: Rosalind Mahoney, seen left with son Milo and daughter Rosie, insists she made it clear from the outset she only wanted somebody to foster her pet, but June Allan, right is adamant she is Frankie's rightful owner . Mrs Mahoney was ordered to pay Mrs Allan’s legal costs and her own, which together total £20,000. She has been ordered to pay £10,500 by January 10.

I never would have agreed to “foster” anyone’s cat. ‘I could not believe it when she sent the policemen after me.’ Mrs Allan, who has chronic asthma and arthritis, added: ‘He is very happy here. He follows me around everywhere I go and he puts his paws around my neck when we have a cuddle. ‘He is a great companion. He gives me a reason to get up and go to the shops. He is my best friend. ‘And at the end of the day the judge decided that Frankie is mine.’ As for Frankie, he simply divides his time between sitting on top of the fridge, rolling around in front of the electric fire and sitting on Mrs Allan’s lap when she watches TV.","Rosalind Mahoney handed Frankie over to June Allan on what she thought was a temporary basis while her house was being renovated .

"The divorced mother-of-two who famously lost custody of her children because she had an abortion has now been ordered to return thousands in child support. Lisa Mehos, 38, was ordered by a judge to return $50,000 to Houston banker Manuel Mehos - her ex-husband. He was also relieved of all obligations to pay further child support to the tune of $5,000 a month. The decision comes after she admitted to having sex with a friend one year after her five year marriage to Mehos, 59, came to an end in 2011 - the fling resulted in her being pregnant and having an abortion. Her husband used the abortion against her in court to increase his custody prospects. Shocked: Lisa Mehos is in disbelief she has to pay back $50,000 in child support and will no longer receive payments from ex-husband Manuel Mehos . Lisa Mehos was 'shocked' at the latest ruling and said she may lose her Upper West Side apartment, the New York Daily News reported. A final decision in custody over the couple's children is imminent, Manuel Mehos currently has temporary custody. Thursday's decision is the latest in a series of court hearings, the mother-of-two says have left her feeling 'raped and beaten.' Speaking to the New York Post, she said: 'I’m divorced. I’m not Mother Teresa! I feel like I’ve been beaten up and raped. 'I had sex with someone I knew for 20 years, and I’m somehow this terrible, bad parent!' Lisa lost temporary custody of her daughter Macy, six, and son John, four, in August. She now only sees her children on Mondays and alternate weekends. 'It just breaks my heart. They're so confused,' she said. Devastated: Lisa Mehos fears she may lose custody of her two children because her ex is using her abortion - which she had nearly a year after their divorce - as evidence against her in court . Mr Mehos, 59, and his 'relentless' attorney Eleanor Alter even went so far as to suggest that Mrs Mehos' abortion undermined her claim of being a Catholic, which in turn speaks to her overall credibility. After subpoenaing Mrs Mehos' medical records to show that she indeed had an abortion, Ms Alter used the procedure to suggest she was a hypocrite for asking to have custody of her two children over Easter. The lawyer - who referred to the abortion in court as 'late', even though it was done during the first trimester - also argued that the procedure undermined Mrs Mehos' testimony that she had never had other men over to her house. Mrs Mehos' lawyers asserted, however, that she 'never testified that she didn’t go . out on a date with another man, or she didn’t go to another man’s . apartment.' They added that on the rare occasions . when she did leave the house, she would leave her two children, then two . and four, in the care of her mother. Judge . Sattler openly sided with Mr Mehos, saying in court that the abortion . is 'relevant', a ruling that left Mrs Mehos 'completely shocked'. Both slinging mud: Manuel Mehos, 59 (left) and his 'relentless' attorney Eleanor Alter have claimed that Mrs Mehos' abortion undermines her claim of being a Catholic - she claims he paid for sex in massage parlors and beat her . Even more shocking to her was the 'double . standard' used in the trial; while the judge ruled her abortion as relevant to the case, Mr . Mehos' sexual behavior - ie the fact that he had paid for sex at massage . parlors - was ruled irrelevant. Attorney Emily Jane Goodman, a recent addition to Mrs Mehos' legal . team, had asked that Judge Sattler recuse herself because she had shown . 'repeatedly' that 'the court has made up its mind about the case,' and . that Mrs Mehos can expect to lose, but the judge has remained. 'The idea of using an abortion against a woman in a custody case sets women's rights back' She has also pointed out the ethical issues in allowing the abortion as evidence, stating: 'The very idea . of. . .using against a woman in a custody case the fact . that she may have had an abortion sets women's rights and the rights of . choice back in a way that I can’t imagine this Court would want to be . associated.' It's not the first time the couple have made headlines for a court appearance. Mr Mehos was arrested last year and accused of battering his wife, charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence after he claimed her black eye was from a Botox injection, not physical violence - a claim Mrs Mehos called 'ridiculous'.","Lisa Mehos, 38, has been ordered to return 10 months worth of child support to ex-husband Manuel Mehos .
Manuel Mahos has also been relieved of obligations to pay $5,000 a month in child support in the future .
The ex-husband currently has temporary custody of their children with a final ruling expected soon ."
"Putin, pictured earlier this week in Moscow, is believed to have visited The Hague to see Maria and was spotted in a local supermarket . Her father has been blamed by many for the death of 193 Dutch citizens. So for Maria Putin, who lives in a smart suburb of The Hague, relations with her neighbours must be more than a little strained right now. The 28-year-old is reported to have resided in the Netherlands for several years with Dutch partner Jorrit Faassen, 34, an executive for a Russian consultancy firm. He owns a two-storey penthouse apartment at the top of a luxury high-security block in Voorschoten, next to an idyllic canal. Yesterday, anti-Putin activists from around the world were posting the address on Twitter and urging Dutch people to set up a protest outside. Scroll down for video . One wrote: ‘Dear Dutch ppl! If you want to visit Putin’s daughter, [this is the] address.’ Another posted: ‘Dutch people can express their feelings about #MH17. Ask for Maria Putin (Faassen).’ Among the Dutch victims were nine residents of The Hague, including a family of four, a local artist and a newly-married couple on their honeymoon. There was also 17-year-old schoolgirl Elsemiek de Borst, whose heartbroken father Hans de Borst has spoken out about Putin’s involvement. He said: ‘Maria Putin may have nothing to do with this. ‘However, her father is very powerful and I think he had the power to send some Russian military forces to this crash site to guard the victims over the last few days. Despite this, he decided not to. ‘Mr Putin and other parties in this, I have reason to believe that one of them is the murderer of my child. ‘Maybe indirectly, maybe it was not the intention. But the separatists were able to obtain these weapons and that was the outcome.’ Putin is believed to have visited The Hague (pictured) to see Maria and was spotted in a local supermarket . The mayor of . the city of Hilversum, Pieter Broertjes, yesterday called for Ms Putin . to be deported from the country in a radio interview. He . later apologised for his comments, saying the demands were 'not wise' but 'stemmed from a feeling of helplessness that many will recognise'. Maria . is understood to divide her time between Russia and the Netherlands, . with the couple remaining very much within Putin’s inner circle. She . appears to keep her distance from her neighbours and her father and his . staff are said to keep a close protective watch over her. Putin . is said to be so paranoid about her safety that he has not allowed her . to be photographed as an adult in the Russian media and sent her to . university under a different name. Her new enemies on social media will do little to ease Putin’s fears for her safety. Last night, there was no answer at the buzzer of her apartment and her neighbours were reluctant to talk about her. ‘I’m sorry, I can’t help you,’ said one of the few to answer. ‘I don’t know who lives there and I don’t want to comment.’ Local residents have in the past claimed to have seen her father in the local supermarket, while one said they saw a blacked-out limousine in the underground car park. One ominously told a local reporter: ‘The family have something dangerous about them.’ Another said: ‘There are some things that it is better not to know.’ Maria is reported to have married Fassen in the summer of 2009, although there is no official record. He was a real estate specialist with Russian gas firm Gazprom before being appointed vice-president of Stroytransgaz, also Russian, in 2008, at the age of 28. Dutch mourners lined the streets yesterday as some of the victim's bodies were brought home . According to land registry documents, a year later he began buying up property in Voorschoten. He bought the main apartment for a bargain price of £292,000 and now owns two other apartments in the same building. The apartments are now worth an estimated £545,000 each. The district where they live is aptly named the Krimwijk, meaning ‘Crimea district’. His connection to the Putin family is thought to have served him well when his BMW was rammed by a Mercedes owned by Russian banker Matvei Oerin in 2010. Seven of Oerin’s bodyguards pulled Faassen out of his car and beat him up, but the banker was later prosecuted, jailed and stripped of the licenses for four of his five banks. Faassen left Stroytransgazin 2010, his last known job was as Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of ACO MEF-Audit, a consultancy firm. The apartment is a short drive away from The Hague’s City Hall, where grieving families and friends of the dead have been signing a book of condolences.","Russian leader's daughter, Maria, lives in The Hague with her Dutch partner .

"Traditionally, as the temperatures drop the heating bill rises - as do relationship tensions. Now finally the age-old argument between men and women over having the heating on is set to be solved. Research has revealed the perfect temperature to keep everyone happy is 22 degrees Celsius. Scroll down for video . Studies have found that the female sex actually feels changes in temperature and the seasonal chill more . It may seem a little excessive to men who prefer a cooler house temperature, but they would be wise to consider women are up to nine times more likely to suffer from cold hands and feet than them. In fact in recent years studies have found that the female sex actually feels changes in temperature and the seasonal chill more than their male counterparts, but stubborn men may be none the wiser. Now the true extent of our tug of war is revealed. New research shows more than half of us (55 per cent) admit to arguing over the temperature at home, with the level of the thermostat believed to be one of the biggest sources of domestic tiffs. Calculated from a mean average of the ideal temperature from a sample of both men and women, the findings show that 22 degrees is indeed the optimum temperature to keep both sexes happy. When it comes to staying snug at home, it seems there is little room for compromise, with 35 per cent of Britons stating that they never agree with their spouse or partner when it comes to having the heating on. A mean average shows 22 degrees is indeed the optimum temperature to keep both sexes happy . A spokesperson for smart heating company climote said: 'We hear time and again that spouses argue about the temperature, more often than not that women want it warm and men want it colder. 'Technology like climote enables users to have real flexibility over the temperature of the house, but if all else fails then an even 22 degrees ought to do the trick!' As the heating seems to be a bone of contention for most, climote has set out to find the perfect solution as the winter approaches with smart heating technology. This enables users to control their heating temperature via an app, online dashboard or SMS making turning the heating up that bit easier.","55 per cent of us admit to arguing over the temperature at home .

"It's a scene that no-one could have imagined when a Malaysian Airlines jet disappeared more than seven weeks ago - a farewell photo by the men and women who have searched in vain from the sky for the missing plane. They posed with their aircraft in Perth to mark the official end to the huge international air search for MH370, which lost contact on March 8 with 239 passengers and crew. A scaled down operation, including a few vessels on standby and an underwater search for the Boeing 777, will still continue for an indefinite amount of time. All together: Multinational air-crew and aircraft were involved in operation Southern Indian Ocean . So far not a single piece of debris, stretch of oil, or a clue of any kind has been found to pinpoint the location of the plane. There have been 'pings' that might have come from the aircraft's two black boxes and experts have made their calculations from satellite data, but if the jet is at the bottom of the ocean its whereabouts have remained a mystery. Eight nations have taken part in the search, either physically or using technical know-how but despite a number of hopeful sightings, the personnel who posed for Tuesday's photo have ended their relentless operation with nothing to show for it. They have scoured more than two million square miles from the air since the search moved to the Indian Ocean and officials now concede that the area will have to be expanded - but this time entirely underwater. No results: Not a single piece of debris, stretch of oil, or a clue of any kind has been found to pinpoint the location of the Boeing 777 . Finished: Japanese officials and members of Japanese and Australian aircrews, who participated in the search for missing Malaysia Airlines plane MH370, pose for a photo on the tarmac at the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Base Pearce, located north of Perth . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conceded that if anything was left floating after the aircraft had, as experts believe, come down in the ocean, it would by now have become waterlogged and sunk. Just when a new underwater search will begin has not been decided, with authorities saying the transition from surface to underwater would begin 'over the coming weeks.' Never in the history of aviation has such a vast search been conducted, with eight nations - Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Malaysia, the US, Japan, South Korea and China - involved in the hunt, flying more than 300 sorties across an enormous expanse of unforgiving southern ocean. Now the search planes have been stood down, a spokesman for the Australian-led Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre saying: 'Most of the aircraft will have left by the end of today.' Farewell photo: Vice Chief of the Australian Defence Force, Air Marshal Mark Binskin, centre, stands on the tarmac during the ceremony on April 29 to mark the end of the air search for MH370 . International effort: Eight nations have taken part in the search, either physically or using technical know-how . But an Australian P3 Orion will remain on standby in Perth. As well as aircraft, as many as 14 ships from Australia, China and Britain were involved in the search for debris or listening for black box signals. Most of those vessels were today also pulling out. 'Some need to head back to port and refuel and give the crew a rest, while others will go back to doing what they were doing for their respective nations before they joined in the search,' the agency's spokesman said. 'In essence the surface search has been scaled back. 'We will keep a few vessels out there and others on standby, but the large-scale air and sea search has ended.' The conclusion of the surface hunt will be a distressing landmark for relatives of the mostly-Chinese passengers who were on the aircraft. Waiting for news in a hotel in Beijing, they have repeated daily that they want closure - to know what has happened to their loved ones. Huge mission: Teams have scoured more than two million square miles from the air since the search moved to the Indian Ocean . Grounded: The personnel who posed for the photo have ended their relentless operation with nothing to show for it . They tried: Air crew members from China, Malaysia and Japan wait for the official photo to be taken at the RAAF Pearce Base, near Perth . With no result, they now have only an underwater search - with no clues to pinpoint the correct area - to rely on. But first, they have to hear when that search will even begin. The news of the scaled back search comes as the Chinese families of passengers and crew were played a recording of the finale exchange between the airplane's crew and ground control for the first time. The families listened to the audio from the plane's cockpit during a public conference in Beijing on Tuesday, more than 50 days after the plane disappeared. In the audio, a radar controller from the airport in Kuala Lumpur says: 'Malaysia three seven zero contact Ho Chi Min 120.9, good night.' A male voice, believed to be a male crew member, replies: 'Good night Malaysian three seven zero.' Officials explained that MH370 crew members did not respond to further requests to contact ground control. Grateful: The Vice Chief of the Australian Defence Force thanks members of the international and Australian air crews for their efforts . It's over: The air crews ended their search on April 29, more than seven weeks after the Malaysian Airlines jet disappeared . Searching: Australian leading Seaman Aircrewman Joel Young is pictured here manning the doorway of a S-B70-2 Seahawk helicopter during the search on April 21. He is just one of the hundreds of people who helped on the mission . Yesterday an Australian company said it had located the wreckage of a commercial airliner lying on the ocean floor in the Bay of Bengal - an area located in the northern tip of the original search area, but thousands of miles from where authorities are currently focused. Tech firm GeoResonance claims its sensor technology has found the wreckage of a plane in the Bay of Bengal, 118 miles south of Bangladesh. The company said images taken of the same spot five days earlier showed it had appeared between the 5th and 10th of March 2014. The plane disappeared on March 8. However, these claims have now been dismissed by search coordinators. The Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC), which is managing the multinational search for the missing plane, said it continued to believe that the plane came down in the southern Indian Ocean off Australia . And it explained that the location in the GeoResonance report was not within the search arc that it has created from satellite information and other data to determine the missing aircraft's location. 'The joint international team is satisfied that the final resting place of the missing aircraft is in the southerly portion of the search arc,' it said, The Telegraph reports.","Aircrews who participated in the search for MH370 have called an official end to their large-scale operation .

"Amazing footage of a migrating humpback whale caught on a GoPro camera off the coast of Sydney has emerged. Tourist Michael Theis captured the moments the chilled out creature peered out of the water to say hello to the wildlife lovers while he was on a tour with Whale Watching Sydney. The excited boatload of people had their cameras at the ready as the amazing creature spent half an hour with the tour on Monday afternoon. The incredible footage was caught by tourist Michael Theis on a Whale Watching Sydney tour on Monday . The boat was about nine miles off shore when the friendly whale spent half an hour floating in the sun catching up on some rays after days of unseasonable weather, it was the wettest August in 16 years. Richard Ford, manager of Whale Watching Sydney told Daily Mail Australia: 'We do daily tours and from this time of year till December we normally see quite a lot of whales because they are migrating south back towards the Antarctic. 'We go out of the harbour and off the coast twice a day and it is quite usual for them to be that inquisitive. The migrating humpback whale caught on a GoPro camera off the coast of Sydney . This was the moment the friendly whale came out to play with the onlookers off the coast of Sydney . 'They go north to breed and give birth and on the way back they are much more relaxed.

'It gave our passengers a special afternoon and you can hear that in the footage, they were amazed.' 'We still have whales off the coast of Sydney for another three months until early December with mothers and their newborn calves making an appearance in the next four weeks or so. 'It's been a record year with about 20,000 whales on this migration from the Antarctic and about 2000 calves born as they increase their numbers by about 10 per cent each year' he added.","The relaxed migrating whale was heading south back towards to the Antarctic for feeding after mating season at the Great Barrier reef .

"A grieving mother has called for cot bumpers to be banned from British shops after her baby son died after becoming entangled in one. Lisa Gee, 26, said she found her baby Preston dead with the ties caught around his neck when she went into his room in Loughborough, Leicestershire. The mother-of-two and her partner Cuchulain Brian, 23, believe it was the bumper she bought on eBay that strangled her young son. Bumper tragedy: Lisa Gee, 26, and her partner Cuchulain Brian, 23, found their son dead in this cot with the cot bumper tie tangled up around his neck . It had been tied securely to the cot in three places - but one of the knots had come undone. The couple have launched an online petition in an effort to get the law changed and avoid a repeat of the tragedy. Cot bumpers have been banned in Chicago and Maryland, in the US, after they were linked to the deaths of 27 children across the US over a 20-year period up until 2005. In Britain, there is no formal advice on whether they should be used or not - despite differences in medical opinion. Charities said parents should keep cots clutter-free to reduce the risk of cot death and warned against using bumpers for babies under one-year old. The Lullaby Trust, the safer sleep baby charity, said they do not recommend using them at all as they are not necessary. Cuchulain said: 'When I went . into the nursery and saw Preston laying their lifeless with the material . from the cot bumper round his neck, my heart just dropped. Tragedy: Preston Brian, aged nine months, was found dead in his cot on September 11 by his distraught parents . 'I didn't know what to do. It was like my world had come crashing down before me.' Lisa said: 'Cuc called me into the nursery but I knew something was wrong from the tone in his voice. Family grief: Preston's mother said his two siblings have struggled to cope with losing their young brother . 'When . I walked in, I looked over to the cot and saw Preston just lying there, . motionless, entangled in the bumper I just turned to Cuc and broke down . in his arms. 'Preston was the happiest, bubbliest little baby that you could ever meet and he was no trouble at all. 'He would often go all night without making a peep so we had no reason to believe anything was wrong.' An inquest is expected to be held into Preston's death on September 11 by the Loughborough coroner. The results of a post-mortem examination carried out to establish the cause of death are not yet known. Lisa said the cot bumper came with a . small age warning that was written on the wash label, which she said was . not clearly visible to her. 'The . warning for the plastic packaging was markedly more visible than the . age suitability information on the product,' she added. 'I . think there is a need for much clearer safety guidelines on all baby . products as people like me, just use such products because its the done . thing. 'Risk': The parents of Preston Brian have called for all cot bumpers to be banned in Britain after their son died after getting his neck caught. Bumpers are tied to the railings to stop babies banging their head or getting their limbs caught in the railings (file photo - this is not the bumper involved) Grief: Lisa and her partner Cuchulain have launched a campaign to get cot bumpers banned in Britain . 'All my friends used . cot bumpers until recently with their children, my mum used them with me . and my other siblings, there was no question about using a cot bumper. Lisa added that her other two children have struggled to understand the death of their younger brother. Bumpers are fabric linings fitted to the edge of cots to stop babies from banging their heads or getting their limbs caught in the bars. They are often attached to the bars using Velcro or are tied to them. Parents have been urged not to use them for safety reasons to reduce the risk of cot death. However, there is no official advice in Britain against using them. The American Academy of Paediatrics said in 2011 that children can be killed by cot bumpers - and urged parents to remove them. ‘We weighed the pros and cons and the evidence, and felt that the safest thing would be to keep bumpers out of the crib altogether,’ said Dr Fern Hauck, a spokesman for the Academy and professor of family medicine at the University of Virginia. 'My other children Tamari . and Dylan have taken the loss of Preston really badly,' she said. 'Preston and . Tamari were very similar ages and they loved playing together and she . really misses him and asks where he is all the time. 'Dylan, . being older, I think understands a lot more what has happened and he . knows that his little brother isn't coming back and it's really affected . him emotionally. 'He's been receiving counselling to try and help him come to terms with everything.' Lisa has also set up a Facebook page called Justice for Preston - but she was distraught when she received abuse about the death of her child. People wrote that cot bumpers should not be used for children aged under one. 'These comments are . so hurtful and the point we as a family are trying to make is that these . age restrictions aren't clear enough on the products out there,' she added. 'Presumably, . like me, many other parents use these products to protect their . children. Naturally, if you buy something for that purpose, you don't . question the fact that it may actually be putting your children at . harm.' Lisa's mother and Preston's grandmother Samantha Gee, 43, said that when she brought her children up a cot bumper was an essential item. 'Just like I bought a sun umbrella for the buggy, or a bottle steriliser . to protect my children from germs - a cot bumper was one of the . essential items I bought to keep my children safe. 'What . we have learnt the hard way is that cot bumpers aren't safe, but people . need advising not to use these potentially very dangerous cot bumpers.' Rosie Dodds, a senior policy adviser with the NCT charity who assist new parents, said that cot bumpers should not be used for babies who are aged under one year. She said: 'It is recommended that the inside of a baby’s cot should be as clutter-free as possible. 'Pillows, duvets and cot bumpers aren’t safe for babies younger than one year due to the risk of suffocation. 'Duvets and bumpers can also make the baby too hot and bumpers can be used to climb on when babies become more mobile.' Jenny Ward, Head of Support and Development of The Lullaby Trust, the safer baby sleep charity, said: 'There is no evidence associated with cot bumpers and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) but they do pose an accident risk. 'We don’t recommend them or believe they are necessary. Our safer sleep advice, to reduce the risk of SIDS, recommends that a baby should sleep in a cot or moses basket with no extra bedding or soft toys. 'The death of a child is tragic and we extend our deepest sympathies to the family of Preston Brian. 'We offer a bereavement support service to any family affected by the death of a baby or toddler. Families can call 0808 802 6868.'","Preston Brian was found dead with the ties around his neck .

"From delicate swirls of raised flesh to intricate dotted patterns, the scars that decorate the bodies of Ethiopia's Bodi, Mursi and Surma tribes are more than just the sign of an old injury. For these aren't just any scars: They're an elaborate part of local culture and signify everything from beauty to adulthood or even, in some cases, are simply a mark of belonging. But Ethiopian tribes aren't the only ones to embrace scarification. In Uganda, the Karamojong are famous for their elaborate scar patterns, while across Ethiopia's border with Sudan, Nuer men bear scarred foreheads and consider getting them a key part of the transition from boy to man. Scroll down for video . Adornment: Along with intricate scar patterns, many Surma women also embrace piercings and traditional lip plates (right) Markings: A Mursi man shows off the scar patterns on his chest. Mursi people regard scars as a sign of beauty and strength . Neighbours: Both the Menit (both images) and Surma tribes bear facial scarifications but despite living only a few miles apart, regularly oppose each other . Beauty: . A woman from the Menit tribe who live close to the Surma in the Omo . Valley. Both are currently under threat of being displaced by . encroaching plantations . Now the stunning scar markings of Ethiopia and Sudan are the subject of an incredible set of photographs by French snapper, Eric Lafforgue, who travelled through the country observing cutting ceremonies and meeting the locals. During a visit to the Surma tribe, who live in the country's remote Omo Valley, he witnessed a scarification ceremony, which involved creating the patterns using thorns and a razor. 'The12-year-old girl who was being cut didn't say a word during the 10-minute ceremony and refused to show any pain,' he revealed. 'Her mother used a thorn to pull the skin out and a razor blade to cut the skin. 'At the end, I asked her whether having her skin cut had been tough and she replied that she was close to collapse. It was incredible as she didn't show any sign of pain on her face during the ceremony as that would have been seen as shameful for the family.' What's more, he explained, despite the pain, the girl herself initiated the ceremony as Surma girls aren't obliged to take part. 'Scars are a sign of beauty within the tribe,' he added. 'Children who go to school or convert to Christianity don't do it but the others see the ability to cope with pain as a sign that they will be able to cope with childbirth in future.' Varied: While some tribes such as the Dassanech, also from the Omo River Valley, focus on the shoulders, the Surma and others also include the face and head (right) Ceremony: A Surma scarification ritual using thorns and a razor is carried out on a 12-year-old girl who volunteered to be scarred . Painful: Although the process isn't without pain, Lafforgue says the girl kept a straight face throughout in order not to shame her family . End result: After the initial cut, scars have organic sap or ash rubbed into them in order to make them heal as raised bumps . Intricate: Scar patterns aren't reserved solely for Surma women - men, as pictured right, also have intricate patterns made from dotted scars . Other tribes who live in the Omo Valley, among them the Bodi, also embrace scarification and often use sap or ash to make the resulting wounds more prominent when they heal. But it seems that not everyone is impressed. 'People wearing scarifications are seen as ""primitives"" by many urban Ethiopians and suffer from this,' Lafforgue explains. 'Those who have had them but have been to school as well often try to hide them.' Others, such as the Mursi tribe, consider scars a sign of beauty and strength, although as Lafforgue relates, thanks to an influx of workers from other parts of Ethiopia, scarification is becoming an increasingly risky business. 'Using shared blades is a huge problem in the south Omo region,' explains Lafforgue. 'Hepatitis is starting to become a problem as workers from other parts of Ethiopia arrive to work on the new giant [government-sponsored] plantations. AIDS is also becoming a threat.' Bodi: Ana, pictured on the left, now hides her elaborate scar markings after being ridiculed for having them at school. Others such as this woman (right) embrace them . Tradition: Other tribes to embrace scarification include the Afar people, who live in Northern Ethiopia and are famous for using butter in their hair . Popular: Facial tattoos are particularly common among the Afar, especially for women, and can include both dot and line patterns . Tradition: Although this Mursi man (left) and Karrayyu woman live in different parts of Ethiopia, both have embraced their respective tribe's scarification rituals . Despite the risks, scarification continues to play a huge role in tribal life, not least across the border in South Sudan where scars are a distinctive feature of life for the Nuer people. South Sudan's second largest ethnic group after the Dinka, the majority of adult Nuer men have 'gaar' markings - six lines carved on either side of their foreheads - as a sign of maturity. Other Nuer, particularly the Bul Nuer of the Nile Valley, create a dotted version of gaar and women sometimes have them too. The neighbouring Toposa tribe, which lives in both Ethiopia and South Sudan has also embraced scarification but combine facial dot patterns with elaborate body etchings as well. Although the Toposa etchings remain popular with younger generations, the Nuer's gaar markings are becoming increasingly rare as conflict between them and other South Sudanese tribes becomes more frequent. 'This tradition isn't done as much anymore,' explains Lafforgue. 'Partly, it's because of better education and the increasing number of people who have turned to Christianity but also because it is a too visible sign of tribal belonging in an area that has suffered many disputes.' Distinctive: Many Nuer men are eschewing 'gaar' lines such as these because they are a clear indication of belonging to the tribe - dangerous when conflict looms . Elaborate: The markings adopted by the Toposa tribe of South Sudan are among the most intricate and involve serried rows of dotted lines . Delicate: The dotted patterns that encircle the eyes of Toposa men and women are just as beautiful as their elaborate body markings .","Tribes who scarify include Ethiopia's Bodi and Surma tribes, South Sudan's Nuer and Uganda's Karamojong .
Surma girls choose to go through the process voluntarily and must not show pain during the 10-minute ritual .
Gaar scars are a sign of maturity for Nuer men but fewer are doing it thanks to inter-tribal conflict ."
"The pilot of one of the Wisconsin planes that collided at 12,000 feet - almost killing a group of skydivers - has recounted his death-defying leap from the burning Cessna and shared the selfie he took of his bloody face after he landed. Matt Fandler was at the controls of one of two single-engine planes that were flying over Superior, Wisconsin, last Saturday with a group of experienced skydivers who were making their last jump of the day. But what was supposed to be a moment of perfectly-timed . air acrobatics and exhilarating free-falls turned into a terrifying . jump-for-your-life situation when Fandler's Cessna suddenly sandwiched on top . of the other. Speaking about the moment he said: 'And all of a sudden I hear this loud bang. I didn't see . anything...I just heard a bang and the windshield immediately . shattered.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Bloody: After Fandler landed safely on the ground, he took a 'selfie' to document his injuries, his face covered in blood from where the windshield shattered in his face after the planes collided . Survivor: Matt Fandler was at the controls of one of two single-engine planes that were flying over Superior, Wisconsin, and tells Matt Lauer for NBC's Dateline about his death-defying leap . Special program: The still from the helmet cam shows Matt Fandler's plane, bottom, on fire shortly after impact. He talks to Dateline about his experience . The crash tore off the wing of the plane and the gas tank blew up underneath and caught fire, causing the plane to go into an 'uncontrolled descent'. 'I was staring straight ahead. And the first thing I remember thinking . is that I need to regain control of this airplane,' the 23-year-old told Matt Lauer . in an exclusive Dateline interview airing tonight at 8pm. 'And I . immediately pulled the yoke back to my chest and pulled it back as far . as I possibly could. And there was no reaction from the airplane. 'I began to pick up more and more airspeed. And I realize that I have no . control of this aircraft. And probably thought it was in my best . interest to not be in this aircraft.' Fortunately he was wearing a parachute and though he had only done two tandem jumps before, he had to recall everything he learned as he jumped head first from the gap where the wing used to be. He got himself into the proper arched position for a free fall and . withstood the temptation to open the chute immediately, waiting until he . was at the recommended 4,000 to 5,000 feet, NBC reports. He landed hard somewhere near the runway and somersaulted to a stop. When he realized he was OK he decided to take a picture of himself to document his injuries. Had he not, then the 23-year-old would not have believed he had done what he did, he reveals on the Dateline special. Impact: The skydivers were perched on the edge of the plane ready to jump as the other one hit, causing a massive fire bomb . Impact: This is the moment the two planes hit, sending divers who were preparing to jump flying out of the aircraft and causing the wing of the other to come off . Incredible: Five of the skydivers involved in the Wisconsin plane crash can be seen freefalling and the plane Matt Fandler was flying on flames and hurtling to the ground . The photo shows his face covered in blood from the shards of . glass that flew at him when the Cessna's windshield shattered on impact. He also had serious cuts on his hands not seen in the picture that took 25 stitches to repair. 'I didn't have a mirror or anything, so I asked the police officer if he . wanted to take a photo of me,' he told NBC's Dateline. 'He gave me a really weird look, so I decided to take it myself.' When he saw the other pilot safely land his plane and then each skydiver parachute to the ground unhurt, he called it a miracle. And just like the others said the whole terrifying experience has not put them off skydiving, Fandler says he also plans to get back into the air, with the goal of one day flying bigger and faster planes. 'I really feel confident in my ability to be safe as a pilot. And I know what I can control. And I know what I cannot control,' he said. Wisconsin skydivers: When asked by Matt Lauer if they would get back into a plane again after their miraculous escape, all nine put up their hands with one women admitting she is more afraid of spiders . Amy Olson, left, remembers the pilot screaming at them to 'Go!', ordering them to jump. 'That's probably the worst, was hearing him scream,' she said through tears. 'It's pretty raw.' Brave: This skydiver describes how me made his way over to the plane that was on fire (while free falling) to see if the pilot was OK . Calm under pressure: Blake the pilot describes flying his plane after the collision and landing it safely which, they joked, was one of his better landings . One of the skydivers Barry Sinnex told Matt Lauer on the Today show this week that he tried to chase Fandler's plane that was on fire as he was free-falling to see if the pilot was OK. When he saw him jump from the plane, he chased him to make sure he could open his chute. 'Everybody else had parachutes on, so they were kind of on their own, so I chased the plane. I think Dan did too, he came down with me,' he said. 'We chased the airplane to see if the pilot got out. Once I saw the pilot bail out, I made sure he was going to open the parachute because he was a student.' Patricia Roy said: 'I thought it was a joke at first. Obviously not a very funny or appropriate one. But it was all so surreal. 'I thought oh my God they're getting closer. I expected the other plane to move away.' Daniel Chandler, who became wedged in between the two planes and almost collided with the propeller said: 'It was unpleasant. I had no time to react....The sound . behind me, I'll never forget. 'And that's all I could do was try and stay . forward and try not to move because I knew I was going to live where I . was, or thought I could.' Amy Olsen could not contain her . emotions while recounting the collision. Through tears she said she . remembers the pilot screaming at them 'Go!', ordering them to jump. 'That's probably the worst, was hearing him scream. It's pretty raw.' Blake Weldan, who managed to fly one of the planes to safety and land perfectly at Richard I. Bong Airport in Douglas County, joked that it was one of his better landings and said he has no idea how the crash occurred. 'Everything was as it should have been,' he said. 'We were just kind of lucky that we were at the point where we were out of the airplane,' said 64-year-old flight instructor Mike Robinson, who was in the lead plane. 'If we'd been back in the rear of the airplane when they collided it might have been a little bit different.' Once out of the plane, the skydivers had to carefully maneuver their chutes to stay out of the path of raining debris. 'We're . in free fall, so we're falling about 120 miles miles an hour vertically . down,' Mr Robinson said. 'But then we open our parachutes, and now all . of a sudden they're falling faster than we are...Fortunately, everybody . kept it together so they just avoided (the debris).' Split apart: Both wings of the lead plane became detached and Robinson said he watched it crash to the ground in three pieces . Falling pieces: Several people in the Superior area reported seeing the plane falling to the ground but no one was injured by the debris . Miraculously, no one on the ground was injured by the falling wreckage - but plenty saw them crash to the ground. Mike Plaunt lives in the area and often hears and sees the skydivers, but he noticed something was off about yesterday's jump. 'I . went outside and looked and could see parachuters and a drop plane, and . then there was something spiraling down. I couldn't identify what it . was..it had a trail of smoke and I had never seen that before,' he said. Happy to be alive: Two people hug after all 11 aboard the two planes landed safely . Quick thinking: The pilot of the tracking plane was able to land it safely, but the lead plane was not so lucky. It crashed to the ground in several piece. The pilot of that airplane escaped by parachute as well . While . Mr Robinson still doesn't know why exactly the two planes collided, he . believes the lead plane may have created unstable air for the tracking . plane. The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the crash today. It's . still uncertain what will happen to the skydiving company, since they . only owned the two planes. But it is the end of their season anyway. Mr . Robinson says the crash yesterday happened during the fourth jump of . his day, and that he's done over 900 jumps in his lifetime. 'I'll remember this one more than most,' he said.","Matt Fandler spoke to Matt Lauer for Dateline about the moment he lost control of the plane .

"Paedophile Jeffrey Epstein hosted Stephen Hawking on the private Caribbean island where Prince Andrew is alleged to have slept with an underage ‘sex slave’. The celebrated physicist attended a conference on the Caribbean island of St Thomas as part of an event sponsored by shamed Epstein, who describes himself on his blog as a ‘science philanthropist’. Professor Hawkingwas reportedly one of a number of eminent scientists invited to the event, which included trips to the sex offender's private island retreat nearby. Scroll down for video . Stephen Hawking (pictured) attended a conference on the Caribbean island of St Thomas as part of an event sponsored by shamed Jeffrey Epstein . He was reportedly one of a number of eminent scientists invited to the event, which was backed by Jeffrey Epstein (pictured left). Prince Andrew is pictured right in 2001 with Virginia Roberts . A picture of Professor Hawking, purportedly taken during the conference, is featured on the ‘Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation’ blog in a posting topped with the dateline March 21, 2012. But it is not yet clear when the conference - called 'The Energy of Empty Space That Isn't Zero' - took place or how long it lasted. The blog states that guests ‘could meet, discuss, relax on the beach, and take a trip to the nearby private island retreat of the science philanthropist Jeffrey Epstein, who funded the event.’ Professor Hawking's representatives have yet to respond to requests for a comment. Epstein’s Caribbean island of Little St James lies a short distance from St Thomas – part of the US Virgin Islands. It is the same place where Virginia Roberts claims her third and final sexual encounter with Prince Andrew took place. She claims she was 17 when the offences took place. Andrew has faced mounting controversy after he was named in US civil court documents as having sex with Miss Roberts on three separate occasions – claims vehemently denied by the Duke. General views of Jeffrey Epstein's private Caribbean island, Little St James, part of the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Miss Roberts claims her third and final sexual encounter with the Duke took place . In the US court papers, she alleges that between 1999 and 2002 she 'was forced to have sexual relations with this prince' in London, New York and on the private Caribbean island owned by Epstein. Under the law of Florida, where the papers were filed, a minor is defined as a person under 18 years of age. The accusation is contained in a motion filed last month in a Florida court by Ms Roberts who wants to join an existing lawsuit, launched by two other alleged Epstein victims, against federal prosecutors' handling of the financier's case. Epstein was jailed for 18 months in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution but lawyers for the women claim a secret plea deal he struck with prosecutors granting him, and any potential co-conspirators, immunity from further prosecution violated their clients' rights. In a strongly-worded statement Buckingham Palace has said: ‘It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. ‘The allegations made are false and without any foundation.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Sex offender hosted Stephen Hawking on his private Caribbean island .

"A megachurch has settled a civil . lawsuit brought by a mother whose then-13-year-old daughter was raped . last year in a ministry stairwell by an ex-janitor, it emerged today. The Tulsa church spokesman Justin Johnson says . details of the settlement between Victory Christian Center and the . mother are confidential and declined to comment further on behalf . of the 17,000-member organization. The ex-janitor Chris Denman, now 21, pleaded guilty to  all charges related to the rape and was sentenced to 55 years in prison last year. Sordid: The rape took place at the Victory Christian Center megachurch in Oklahoma by an ex-janitor who later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 55 years in prison . Chris Denman, 20, was sentenced to 55 years in prison for raping a 13-year-old girl at the megachurch. Three other victims under the age of 18 later came forward with allegations against him . He was charged with first-degree rape, . forcible oral sodomy, lewd molestation, making a lewd proposal to a . child and two counts of using a computer to facilitate a sex crime. Five Victory employees - including John and Charica Daugherty, the . son and daughter-in-law of ministry co-founder and head pastor Sharon . Daugherty - were charged because they waited two weeks before reporting . the girl's rape to authorities. John and Charica Daugherty were charged with failure to report a crime and were given five-year deferred sentences with no jail time. Implicated: John and Charica Daugherty (third and fourth from the right) were ordered to visit at least 20 organizations that work with children to talk with employees about properly reporting abuse . The judge expressed his feelings that the matter had not been handled properly by the church, which oversees 17,000 members in Tulsa. 'I want the hammer over your heads, Mr and Mrs Daugherty, for a longer period of time. I want to make sure things are done right.' John is the son of senior pastor Sharon Daughterty, who runs the popular radio broadcast 'Victory in Jesus', which can be heard in over 200 countries. Three other co-workers for Victory were sentenced along with the Daughertys. Paul Willemstein and Anna George were sentenced to thirty days in jail, while Harold Sullivan faces a one-year suspended sentence. Controversial: Victory Christian Center has seen several allegations alleging sexual misconduct emerge from their over 17,000 person congregation over the last year . Head: Sharon Daugherty is an influential member of the Oklahoma Christian community who has authored several books and runs a radio program that broadcasts in over 200 countries . The megachurch has been under intense scrutiny following the rape, with even more cases of under-reporting emerging. KJRH has learned that as of September there were four girls under the age of 18 who had reported sexual allegations against Denman. In October, another ex-janitor, Israel Shalom Castillo, 24, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for making a lewd proposal to a child. Castillo's crime involved a separate victim but was reported to authorities at about the same time as Denman's crime.","Ex-janitor of the church Chris Denman pleaded guilty to all rape charges .

"A devastated family today spoke out about losing a wife and mother shortly after she gave birth to a baby boy. Joanne Jones, 35, delivered Riley Jeff Jo Jones four weeks before his due date. The mother-of-three cradled her premature newborn just once before she was taken to theatre to have routine surgery to remove her placenta. Tragically, she died just hours later. Joanne (pictured, right, with daughter Connie) had just 20 minutes with her new son before she was sent for routine surgery to remove her placenta. She died just hours later, leaving her family behind . Earlier this month, Mrs Jones kissed goodbye to her husband, Anthony - after passing on news of the healthy new arrival to their two delighted daughters on the phone - and underwent the operation. But 40 minutes into the procedure doctors at the University Hospital of North Tees, in Stockton, returned to the room where Anthony, 33, was with 5lb 4oz baby Riley, and revealed that Mrs Jones had suffered a cardiac arrest. Despite doctors finding a pulse and managing to stabilise her condition for several hours, Mrs Jones suffered a heart attack nine hours later. Today Mrs Jones' heartbroken family paid tribute to the 'best mam in the world' and told how they will one day tell baby Riley all about her. Baby Riley (pictured) was born prematurely at 4:50pm on August 13. His father, Anthony, said: 'She would have idolised Riley, she fought to get that baby out safe. She would have wanted him to live instead of her, I'm just glad that she got to see him' Husband Anthony (pictured holding baby son Riley and next to daughters Connie [left] and Millie[centre]) said: 'Joanne was the backbone of our family and it sounds cliched, but she really was the best mam in the world' Mr Jones, a self-employed plasterer from Hartlepool, said: 'I don't think it will ever sink in. 'I'm just so glad Joanne got to hold Riley after he was born even if it was just for a short time, she had him on her chest. 'I got pictures of him like that but none of her holding him because I didn't think she wouldn't be coming back. She saw me with him as well, she did that for us.' He added: 'Joanne was the backbone of our family and it sounds cliched, but she really was the best mam in the world.' Mrs Jones' mother Dianne Baker, 56; father Jeff Baker, also 56, and sister Naomi Baker, 27, a shop assistant, each said how proud they were to have her as a daughter and sister. Joanne is pictured shortly after her waters broke on a family trip to Butlins in Taunton. Doctors at the hospital decided to keep Riley in the womb and prescribe Joanne antibiotics for any potential infection . Mrs Baker said: 'She really wanted to give us our grandson because we've never had a boy in the family. 'She would have idolised Riley, she fought to get that baby out safe. She would have wanted him to live instead of her, I'm just glad that she got to see him.' Mrs Jones, a teaching assistant and nursery teacher, suffered complications during her pregnancy. She discovered she was pregnant at New Year after planning the baby and coming off medication she was on for rheumatoid arthritis, a condition she had suffered from since the age of 21. During a routine 20-week scan, doctors told the couple that Joanne's placenta was 'low-lying', which meant she may have had to have a Caesarian birth unless it moved to a safer position. Joanne (pictured with husband Anthony, daughter Connie, left, and Millie, right) was 'such a special wife, mam, daughter and sister' However, the placenta eventually rose back to a safer position. On July 22, the family took a trip to Butlins, Minehead, to celebrate the eighth birthday of their youngest daughter Millie Jones. But on the second day, Joanne's waters broke - two months before her due date - and she was taken to a hospital in Taunton where doctors decided to keep Riley in the womb and prescribe her antibiotics for any potential infection. Joanne, a former Manor school pupil, was then transferred by ambulance to the University Hospital of North Tees where medics discharged her on July 29 and ordered her to return every few days for routine checks. On August 9, Joanne complained of a pain in her side, but hospital doctors could not find anything wrong. Three days later, on Monday last week, Joanne started bleeding and Anthony rushed her back through to North Tees hospital where doctors decided to induce her for a natural birth. Baby Riley came into the world at 4.50pm the next day, on Tuesday, August 13, and at 2am the following day Joanne died. Connie, pictured brother Riley, said: 'We'll tell Riley all about our mam when he's older. She was very generous and she would always help people. We had brilliant games of pool and me and my mam were the 'blonde bimbos' and Millie and dad were the 'dark destroyers'. She was a brilliant mam' Mr and Mrs Jones' daughters Connie Letts-Jones, 11, and Millie - who attended the school where their mum worked - wanted to speak about her. Connie, who is due to start English Martyrs School in September, said: 'We'll tell Riley all about our mam when he's older. She was very generous and she would always help people. 'We had brilliant games of pool and me and my mam were the 'blonde bimbos' and Millie and dad were the 'dark destroyers. She was a brilliant mam.' Millie added: 'When we had homework she would always help us. She wasn't scared of anything, but she wouldn't like leaving everyone.' Mr Jones, who married Leeds University textiles design graduate Joanne at St Patrick's Church, in Owton Manor Lane, nine years ago, said: 'It'll be a while before I go back to work. Luckily Joanne's got me well trained so I can look after us. 'Joanne, we were so privileged to have such a special wife, mam, daughter and sister. Sleep with the angels.' Riley's third name was changed from Anthony to Jo to be like his mum, who also leaves behind mother and father-in-law Kevin Jones, 59, and Denise Jones, 56.","Joanne Jones held newborn baby boy Riley just once before she was taken to theatre to have routine surgery to remove her placenta .

But within seconds his mistake was posted on dozens of Italian media websites and YouTube and had gained millions of worldwide hits as it went viral.

"Boris Johnson today urged Conservative activists to ignore the doubters and take the fight to UKIP and Labour with eight months until the election. In a barn-storming, joke-laden speech, the London Mayor wielded a brick to promote housebuilding, mocked David Cameron's embarrassment for claiming the Queen 'purred' and ridiculed Ed Miliband's 'conveyor belt tongue'. But he saved his most bombastic and outspoken attack for UKIP, vowing to 'eat the kippers for breakfast', just hours after his former deputy mayor Richard Barnes announced he was defecting to Nigel Farage's party. Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson wielded a brick during his barnstorming speech to call for more househbuilding . Prime Minister David Cameron was in the audience laughing throughout the speech . The Tory party conference in Birmingham has been dominated by talk of defections to UKIP, following the moves by Tory MPs Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless. But Mr Johnson vowed to 'eat the 'Kippers for breakfast' as he sought to unite Tories behind the battle with Labour. In a move timed to embarrass the London Mayor, ex-right-hand man Richard Barnes announced that he was joining Ukip just hours before Mr Johnson's speech to the party conference in Birmingham. Mr Barnes, who served as deputy mayor between 2008 and 2012, accused mainstream parties of failing to 'speak the language of normal people'. But Mr Johnson hit back at 'quitters and splitters' and told activists that victory in next year's general election was 'within our grasp' as long as the party remained united. Mr Johnson mocked UKIP supporters, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg throughout his speech to a packed hall . It is the last time Mr Johnson will address the Tory conference before the general election, when he hopes to return to the Commons as an MP .

'Because I genuinely think that this is a fantastic time to be a Conservative and that just in the last few months we have seen the beginning of the end of the tapioca-like consensus that Ed Miliband could somehow osmotically infiltrate or inveigle himself into power by pandering to his core vote and relying on the gross unfairness of the electoral system. 'The light is dawning, scales falling. Across the country the chattering classes are waking up to the reality that victory is within our grasp in the next eight months.' Only the Tories could deliver reform to the UK's relationship with the European Union and an in/out referendum on membership, he said. And he mocked Ed Miliband for failing to mention the deficit in his Labour conference speech. ‘My friends, it can only be called a Freudian slip. His subconscious rebelled,' said Johnson. ‘The baggage handlers in his memory went on strike – as they would under a Labour government – and refused to load the word deficit on to the conveyor belt of his tongue. ‘Because on this central question of politics he knows that it is we Conservatives who are taking this country forward. ‘And Labour would take us back to the Brown-Miliband-Balls regime that gave us the worst recession for 100 years.’= . Comparing the successful fight against Scottish independence with the imminent by-election battles to retain the seats given up by defecting MPs Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, he said: 'That's our new fisheries policy, folks. 'First chuck Salmond overboard and then eat the 'Kippers for breakfast. 'We will fight them on the beaches of Clacton and of Rochester and Strood as well.' He went on: 'There’s only leader in Europe which can deliver reform. One man who has the experience and respect in Europe to make the case and then take that case to the people of the country in an in-out referendum. 'That man is not Salmond or Clegg or Miliband. That man is David Cameron.’ Mr Johnson urged Tories to ignore the doubters and make the case for a majority government in 2015 . Sitting in the audience for Boris Johnson's speech today, David Cameron appeared to be mobbed by Tories wanting a selfie . Activists appeared from all directions wanting a photograph with the Prime Minister in the Symphony Hall . Tameena Hussain (left) was among those wanting to get snap on their phone with the Tory leader . Mr Cameron was all smiles as he prepared to listen to the London Mayor's barnstorming speech . Samantha Cameron arrived in Birmingham tonight, ahead of husband David's speech to the Tory conference . He issued a direct plea to Conservatives to be more outspoken in their defence of the party's work and achievements. 'For 200 years our party has been a party which believes in social justice. We believe that the best answer to inequality is opportunity. ‘We believe in encouraging success not punishing. We believe in wealth creation not levelling down. 'That’s why all our polices are aimed at getting people into work.' He went on: 'Let us unite now, let’s get together. Get the whole Conservative family together. Take the fight to the unrepentant, unreconstructed semi-Marxist Eds Miliband and Balls. Lets be proud of our part and what we have done. ‘And when people doubt us and doubt our good intentions, explain again and again our fundamental Conservative instincts that we live by. ‘Let’s leave Ed Balls to his football practice, let’s leave Ed Miliband to mast the art of the bacon sandwich. ‘Let’s leave the Clegger, Nick Clegg, to get on with whatever it is that he does. ‘Let us, let us the Conservative, get on with our work of the harnessing talents of the people of this country. See you at the barricades!’ His jokey speech was well-received by Tories in the conference hall, including David Cameron. But it stood in stark contrast to the heavyweight speech delivered immediately beforehand by Home Secretary Theresa May, who is widely seen as a future rival for the party leadership. Matthew Engel, veteran political commentator at the Financial Times, said the contrast was ‘like bringing on Tommy Cooper after the prophet Elijah’. The Conservatives have produced a range of memorabilia for their conference in Birmingham (top), including mugs and travelcard holders carrying Conservative slogans (middle row) and crisps beer mats and lager bottles mocking the Labour party . The brick Mr Johnson had with him came from  Ibstock Brick Ltd in Newcastle-under-Lyme which he visited yesterday. He said the company was ‘hiring people and firing bricks’ to help ‘build the homes that people need, and to help them on to the property ladder’. With 400,000 new homes needed in London, huge resources and building materials will be required, he said. ‘We will need 1billion... This brick will not be alone when it comes to London.‘I want those homes to be marketed first and sold to people from this country and not sold to oligarchs from the planet Zog. I am not Zoggist. Most of my ancestors come from Zog.’","London Mayor addresses packed Symphony Hall in Birmingham .

"A couple who held hands as they jumped off George Washington Bridge together may have killed the woman's uncle before their joint suicide plunge. Gary Crockett, 41, and Nickie Circelli, 40, both of Suffern, New York, died after jumping into the Hudson River about 11:20 a.m. on Monday. And now their deaths have been linked to that of Circelli's uncle in Suffern, according to a source. Gary Crockett, 41, and Nickie Circelli, 40, both of Suffern, N.Y.,  died after jumping into the Hudson River span about 11:20 a.m. on Monday . The couple were reportedly living in Suffern with Circelli's elderly uncle, who was found dead inside the home on Monday afternoon. His body was discovered along with a note implicating Crockett and Circelli in his murder. Police believe the uncle discovered that the pair had stolen money from another relative and had threatened to turn them in. Their death has been linked to that of Nickie Circelli's (pictured) uncle in Suffern on Monday . He had a broken vertebra in his neck. A neighbor told the New York Daily News that she heard a loud 'boom' from Circelli’s relative’s flat on Monday night. Josefina Rodriguez, 42, lives in an apartment above Circelli’s uncle said:  'In the morning I didn’t hear him cough,' she added, referring to the victim. 'He always coughed. And every day I heard his truck. When I didn’t hear his truck, I thought something must be wrong.' She said Circelli’s uncle was found dead on Monday afternoon by his business partner - they owned a catering business. Investigators found a letter in which the couple apologized for their actions, a source told the New York Daily News. The couple did not have identification on them when they were pulled from the water so the letter was a crucial piece of evidence that enabled investigators to identify them. A woman who said she had been a friend of the couple, Heather Becraft of Sloatsburg, N.Y.,  said Circelli had children who live in another part of New York State with their father. She said they 'were very much in love' but had been having problems that she did not disclose, reported North Jersey.com. Another friend, who asked not to be identified, told the website that the couple struggled with drug addiction. The deputy mayor of Suffern, Jo Meegan-Corrigan, said on Tuesday night that a man’s body was found at the home where the couple lived on Washington Avenue. She declined to provide more details, saying she 'would like to give the family time to gather themselves.' Port Authority spokesman Joseph Pentangelo said workers on the lower level of the bridge saw an object go by them at about 11:20 a.m. When they looked down, they saw the man and the woman in the water .

"Residents of a Belarus town on the border with Poland made the macabre discovery that thousands of Jewish gravestones have been used to construct buildings, roads – and even garden paving. The headstones have been turning up in locations all over Brest over the past six years, with around 1,500 discovered so far. Hundreds were discovered in May during the construction of a supermarket, with headstones unearthed by diggers. Residents of a Belarus town on the border with Poland made the macabre discovery of thousands of Jewish gravestones that have been used to construct buildings, roads, even garden paving . Hundreds of headstones were discovered in May during the construction of a supermarket, when they were by unearthed by diggers . Debra Brunner, co-director of The Together Plan, a UK-based charity that promotes the development of skills and education in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, has been helping with efforts to have the headstones protected and turned into a memorial. She has visited the supermarket site herself and described the experience as ‘bizarre’. She told MailOnline: ‘I’ve never seen anything like it. It was bizarre. They were everywhere. The builders were very kind, though, and concerned and wanted to know what they should do with them.’ The headstones have been turning up in locations all over Brest for the past six years, with around 1,500 discovered so far . The headstones were part of a huge Jewish cemetery that dated back to around 1832 . Ms Brunner said that the story behind the headstones is a heartbreaking one – but hopes that awareness of it will help bring the Jewish community empowerment and closure. She said that the headstones were part of a huge Jewish cemetery that dated back to around 1832 – but a definite date is hard to pin-point because records were destroyed in the Holocaust. ‘Every Jew in Brest – bar 19 – was killed by the Nazis,’ she said. ‘That’s 30,000 Jews killed. The whole community was annihilated.’ The gravestones proved to be very useful building materials for the townsfolk – but most had no idea what they were . Residents began taking the headstones to a local priest - who told them they were religious artifacts and should be protected . Things didn’t improve much in the post-war Soviet era. ‘The Jews weren’t allowed to practice their religion,’ Ms Brunner said. ‘The Soviets desecrated the whole cemetery and removed every single gravestone.’ These gravestones proved to be very useful building materials for the townsfolk. People used them as foundations in their houses, as grindstones and they bolstered roads – but most had no idea what they were. However, in recent years, some with suspicions that they were using religious artifacts took them to a local priest for his opinion. He knew immediately that he was looking at sacred objects and urged residents to save them. Ms Brunner said: ‘More and more people recognised them – and soon there was a tidal wave of headstones.’ At the moment the headstones are piled up in the arches of the Brest Fortress, but The Together Plan is hoping to attract the support of the U.S Commission For Jewish Heritage Abroad, so that funding can be raised to build a memorial using the headstones at the site of the original cemetery, which lies on scrubland next to a running track. Ms Brunner said: ‘If the Jews get their memorial it will empower them - out of death will come new life.’","Jewish headstones have been turning up all over the city of Brest .

"In 1491, German cartographer Henricus Martellus created a map of the world that would help Christopher Columbus navigate the Atlantic. Today, the map holds secrets about what Europeans in the 15th Century knew about geography. But unfortunately much of its historic text has faded. But now a team of researchers in the US is using a technique called multispectral imaging to uncover the hidden information that Columbus had at his fingertips. In 1491, cartographer Henricus Martellus created a map of the world that would help Christopher Columbus navigate the Atlantic. Today, it holds secrets into what 15th Century Europeans knew about geography . The Martellus map depicts the Earth's surface from the Atlantic in the west to Japan in the east and is surrounded with descriptions in Latin of various regions and civilisations. For instance, a text box over northern Asia describes the 'Balor' people who 'live without wine or wheat and get their nutrients from deer meat'. But much of the other text is illegible. Scientists working as part of the Lazarus Project are now using a technique which involves capturing multiple images of the map at specific frequencies of light, including ultraviolet and infrared. The images are digitally combined and processed in a way that uncovers information  otherwise hidden to the naked eye.

Scientists are now using a technique which involves capturing multiple images of the map at specific frequencies of light, including ultraviolet and infrared. The images are digitally combined and processed in a way that uncovers information otherwise hidden to the naked eye . 'The Martellus map is an incredibly strong candidate for this kind of technology,' said Chet Van Duzer, a map historian and the team leader for the project. 'You just know it's going to pop.' The Martellus Map was created in 1491 by German cartographer Henricus Martellus. It's said that Columbus used this map or one like it to persuade Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile to support him in the early 1490s. The map was made by a German cartographer living in Florence and reflects the latest theories about the form of the world and the most accurate ways of portraying it on a flat surface. It seemed to prove that, as Columbus argued, there wasn't a great distance between Europe and China by sea. The map is also the first to record the rounding of the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa by the Portuguese in 1488. This proved that there wasn't a land link to Asia in the south - and that Europeans could reach the riches of the East Indies by sea without having to go through Muslim-held lands. According to a report by Greg Miller in Wired, the team scanned the map last month and expect to start extracting text in the next few months. As well as Professor Van Duzer, the project involved Roger Easton, a professor of Imaging Science at Rochester Institute of Technology, Dr Gregory Heyworth, an associate professor of English at the University of Mississippi and Ken . Boydston, chief executive of Megavision. As well as uncovering hidden details about civilisations depicted in the map, multispectral imaging could shed light on the history of map building. For instance, the Martellus map has similarities to Martin Waldseemüller's world map of 1507 – the first map to apply the name 'America' to the New World. In 2012, Professor Van Duzer had infrared and ultraviolet images taken of the Martellus map, which revealed enough of the hidden text to show that the map was a key source for Waldseemüller's 1507 map. 'One of the most exciting images I've ever seen of a map is an ultraviolet image of the Martellus map taken in the early '60s,' Professor Van Duzer told Wired. 'If you look at eastern Asia with natural light, if you look closely, you get a hint that there's text there, but if you look in ultraviolet light suddenly you see that there's text everywhere.' He added that extracting legible text from all those images will take a lot of imaging processing and analysis. The project is expected to be complete sometime next year.

"New footage of a terrifying skydiving accident caused when two planes collided in mid-air shows the frantic split seconds as the jumpers scramble out of the plummeting wreckage. The video is a jumper's eye-view from deep inside the Cessna aircraft during the dramatic crash 12,000ft above Superior, Wisconsin, last month. It captures the screams of panic as the skydivers realise their aircraft is about to slam into the plane below them. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . On a wing and a prayer: An explosion engulfs one of the skydivers as he clings to a wing . As three thrill-seekers . edge out of the Cessna's wing, the fuselage of the other aircraft rears . into view on the video taken from a helmet-mounted camera on one of the . last in the queue to dive. It . shows those on the wing hurled on to the roof of the lower plane and . momentarily pinned between the aircraft. One skydiver clings onto a bar . holding while he is spun upside down. The skydivers are flung around like rag dolls by the violent impact which ripped one wing off and caused a fireball to erupt. Queuing: The skydiver waits in line to jump from the plane 12,000ft above the ground . Too close for comfort: The tracking plane below edges closer as the skydivers prepare to jump: . Drama: As three skydivers edge out of the plane, the other aircraft rears into view . Fear: The jumpers scream as they realise they are on a collision course . Collision: The two planes slam into each other, throwing several of the skydivers clear of the wreckage . Squashed: Several of the skydivers find themselves pressed between both planes . Impact: The skydivers are violently shaken as the planes collide . Those on the wing manage to jump clear . of the burning wreckage, but the video shows several skydivers frantic . efforts to scramble to the door and leap clear. While the plane spirals out of control, the disorientated jumpers find their way to the opening of the mangled aircraft. All nine skydivers miraculously survived their brush with death. Matt Fandler, who piloted the plane which exploded in a fireball was able to bailout and pull his emergency parachute. Blake Weldan, the pilot of the other aircraft, managed to fly his badly damaged plane back to the airport in one piece. Terror: The wings of the planes smash together as the skydivers desperately cling on . Terror: One of the jumpers grabs hold of part of the wing as the plane spins violently out of control . Fireball: The stunned skydiver is still clutching the wing of the damaged plane as an explosion erupts . Disorientated: The new video shows one of the skydivers being flung around as he tries waits to clear debris before releasing . Shock: A skydiver is flung head over heels as he holds on to the wing of the plane which is plummeting out of the air . Relief: Finally, the skydiver who was trapped at the back of the plane is able to leap from the open door and to safety . Matt Fandler was at the controls of one of two single-engine planes that were flying over Superior, Wisconsin, with a group of experienced skydivers who were making their last jump of the day, during an interview last month. But what was supposed to be a moment of perfectly-timed . air acrobatics and exhilarating free-falls turned into a terrifying . jump-for-your-life situation when Fandler's Cessna suddenly sandwiched on top . of the other. Explosion: Skydivers watched on powerlessly as one of the two planes disintegrated after impact . Impact: This is the moment the two planes hit, sending divers who were preparing to jump flying out of the aircraft and causing the wing of the other to come off . Incredible: Five of the skydivers involved in the Wisconsin plane crash can be seen freefalling and the plane Matt Fandler was flying on flames and hurtling to the ground . Split apart: Both wings of the lead plane became detached and Robinson said he watched it crash to the ground in three pieces . Falling pieces: Several people in the Superior area reported seeing the plane falling to the ground but no one was injured by the debris . Quick thinking: The pilot of the tracking plane was able to land it safely, but the lead plane was not so lucky. It crashed to the ground in several piece. The pilot of that airplane escaped by parachute as well . Speaking about the moment he said: 'And all of a sudden I hear this loud bang. I didn't see . anything...I just heard a bang and the windshield immediately . shattered.' The crash tore off the wing of the . plane and the gas tank blew up underneath and caught fire, causing the . plane to go into an 'uncontrolled descent'. 'I was staring straight ahead. And the first thing I remember thinking . is that I need to regain control of this airplane,' the 23-year-old told Matt Lauer . in an exclusive Dateline interview airing tonight at 8pm. 'And I . immediately pulled the yoke back to my chest and pulled it back as far . as I possibly could. And there was no reaction from the airplane. 'I began to pick up more and more airspeed. And I realize that I have no . control of this aircraft. And probably thought it was in my best . interest to not be in this aircraft.' Bloody: After Fandler landed safely on the ground, he took a 'selfie' to document his injuries, his face covered in blood from where the windshield shattered in his face after the planes collided . Survivor: Matt Fandler was at the controls of one of two single-engine planes that were flying over Superior, Wisconsin, and tells Matt Lauer for NBC's Dateline about his death-defying leap . Fortunately he was wearing a . parachute and though he had only done two tandem jumps before, he had to . recall everything he learned as he jumped head first from the gap where . the wing used to be. He got himself into the proper arched position for a free fall and . withstood the temptation to open the chute immediately, waiting until he . was at the recommended 4,000 to 5,000 feet, NBC reports. He landed hard somewhere near the runway and somersaulted to a stop. When . he realized he was OK he decided to take a picture of himself to . document his injuries. Had he not, then the 23-year-old would not have . believed he had done what he did, he reveals on the Dateline special. The photo shows his face covered in blood from the shards of . glass that flew at him when the Cessna's windshield shattered on impact. He also had serious cuts on his hands not seen in the picture that took 25 stitches to repair. Wisconsin skydivers: When asked by Matt Lauer if they would get back into a plane again after their miraculous escape, all nine put up their hands with one women admitting she is more afraid of spiders . Amy Olson, left, remembers the pilot screaming at them to 'Go!', ordering them to jump. 'That's probably the worst, was hearing him scream,' she said through tears. 'It's pretty raw.' When he saw the other pilot safely land his plane and then each skydiver parachute to the ground unhurt, he called it a miracle. One of the skydivers Barry Sinnex . told Matt Lauer on the Today show this week that he tried to chase . Fandler's plane that was on fire as he was free-falling to see if the . pilot was OK. When he saw him jump from the plane, he chased him to make sure he could open his chute. 'Everybody . else had parachutes on, so they were kind of on their own, so I chased . the plane. I think Dan did too, he came down with me,' he said. 'We . chased the airplane to see if the pilot got out. Once I saw the pilot . bail out, I made sure he was going to open the parachute because he was a . student.' Daniel Chandler, who became wedged in between the two planes and almost collided with the propeller said: 'It was unpleasant. I had no time to react....The sound . behind me, I'll never forget. 'And that's all I could do was try and stay . forward and try not to move because I knew I was going to live where I . was, or thought I could.' Blake Weldan, who managed to fly one of the planes to safety and land perfectly at Richard I. Bong Airport in Douglas County, joked that it was one of his better landings and said he has no idea how the crash occurred. 'Everything was as it should have been,' he said. 'We were just kind of lucky that we were at the point where we were out of the airplane,' said 64-year-old flight instructor Mike Robinson, who was in the lead plane. 'If we'd been back in the rear of the airplane when they collided it might have been a little bit different.' Once out of the plane, the skydivers had to carefully maneuver their chutes to stay out of the path of raining debris. 'We're . in free fall, so we're falling about 120 miles miles an hour vertically . down,' Mr Robinson said. 'But then we open our parachutes, and now all . of a sudden they're falling faster than we are...Fortunately, everybody . kept it together so they just avoided (the debris).' Miraculously, no one on the ground was injured by the falling wreckage - but plenty saw them crash to the ground. The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the crash. It's . still uncertain what will happen to the skydiving company, since they . only owned the two planes. But it is the end of their season anyway. Mr . Robinson says the crash yesterday happened during the fourth jump of . his day, and that he's done over 900 jumps in his lifetime. 'I'll remember this one more than most,' he said.","Footage emerged from inside the plane as skydivers leap for their lives .

"Colonel Gaddafi’s wife and three of his children have fled to Algeria after a dramatic escape across the desert to avoid rebel forces. Safiya Gaddafi, her sons Mohammed and Hannibal and daughter Ayesha were smuggled out in a cloak-and-dagger operation, arriving yesterday morning. Algerian authorities refused to reveal if the dictator was with his family, sparking furious accusations that they had allowed the ‘Mad Dog’ of Libya to escape justice. Parted by the war? Colonel Gaddafi and his wife Safiya, who has fled across the border to neighbouring Algeria . However the Italian news agency ANSA said that Gaddafi and his sons Saadi and Saif al-Islam were in the town of Bani Walid south of Tripoli. It cited ‘authoritative Libyan diplomatic sources’ which also confirmed the Algerian development. The foreign ministry in Algiers previously denied reports that a motorcade of six armoured Mercedes cars had entered the country. It is now believed those vehicles contained Gaddafi’s wife with Mohammed, 41, Hannibal, 35, Ayesha, 34, plus their partners and children. They left Tripoli on Sunday afternoon and would have had to dodge rebel patrols to reach the safety of the Algerian border at least 300 miles away. They finally arrived – according to Algerian authorities – at 8.45am yesterday. Fleeing: Reports this evening say that Aisha Gaddafi and Hannibal Gaddafi, as well as other members of the dictator's family, have crossed the border to Algeria . Gaddafi’s youngest son, Khamis, 28, . was not amongst the escapees, and there were reports yesterday he may . have been killed in a Nato air attack. Rebel . leaders in Tripoli immediately accused the Algerians of supporting the . ousted regime and said sheltering the Gaddafi family was an ‘act of . aggression’ against the new Libyan government. The . rebel-led National Transitional Council (NTC) said it would try to . extradite any Gaddafi relatives from its North African neighbour. Algerian . Foreign Minister Amar Belan said in a statement that his country had . adhered to a policy of ‘strict neutrality’ throughout the Libya crisis . and respects ‘the decision of every person under its sovereignty’. Where is he? The departure of his family has led to questions that the ousted tyrant may have also fled to Algeria . He added that Algeria has no intention to ‘interfere in any manner whatsoever in the internal affairs’ of Libya. The NTC’s military spokesman Ahmed Bani said he  was unsurprised to hear Algeria had welcomed Gaddafi relatives. Rebels . have previously accused Algiers of providing the dictator with . thousands of mercenaries in his battle to halt the revolution. Reports from the front line suggested Khamis Gaddafi was dead. Sky . News reported that a man claiming to be Khamis’s bodyguard said he was . in a Toyota Land Cruiser which was hit by a missile fired from a Nato . Apache helicopter. Separately, . a rebel official said the rebels had ‘almost confirmed’ Khamis’s death . in fighting on August 27 near Tarhuna, 50 miles southeast of Tripoli. Khamis, a Russian-trained military officer, commanded an elite battalion dedicated to protecting his father. Earlier . reports that rebels had captured three of Gaddafi’s sons proved to be . false. His heir apparent Saif al-Islam was among those said to have been . captured, only to emerge on state television on the streets of Tripoli. Rebels . say they want to take Colonel Gaddafi alive so he can face a trial in . Libya. The International Criminal Court has said it also wants him to . face justice there for war crimes.","Algerian foreign ministry confirm family have arrived .

"Security experts have warned Android smartphone owners to update their software and be wary of clicking untrusted links - as they could reset your phone back to its factory setting without warning. Researchers found that malicious hackers can create web-links that can wipe your phone - meaning all your files, personal details, images and music would be wiped, just by getting you to click on a web-link. The exploit has been tested on Samsung phones, but could potentially be work on handsets from companies such as HTC. The bug exploits a feature in many phones . from Samsung where clicking on a link can automatically dial a . number into your dial-pad and click 'Call'. The Galaxy S2 is likely to still be at risk from the 'link-jacking', which could reset a phone by following a URL - which can automatically dial 'magic codes' from your phonebook . While this is a handy feature in some cases - for instance, calling a restaurant directly from a web-page - it opens the door for malicious uses. Many manufacturers add hidden commands to your phonebook - for instance, dialling *#*#4636#*#* will automatically show you your phone's secret setting menus. But some manufacturers, including Samsung, add additional codes - and one of them automatically resets your phone, without any way of interrupting the process. The exploit was first announced by Ravi Borgaonkar, from the Technische Universitat in . Berlin. He said web links could be embedded in text messages, clicked on in a web browser, or scanned using a QR 'barcode' tag. When Borgaonkar announced his finding yesterday, he said there was nothing a Samsung owner can do to stop it. Android is rapidly becoming one of the most established operating systems in the world. This month - just before the iPhone launch on September 12th - Andy Rubin, the Google executive who founded Android, announced that 500 million Android devices had been activated across the world. The pace of adoption is rapidly speeding up - from around 500,000 activations a day a year ago, to 900 daily activations in June, to more than 1.3million activations a day by September. So far, there have been few serious security breeches for Android and Apple devices, in terms of causing a financial cost to the end-user. But as our phones become more widespread and become a bigger part of our daily lives - for instance, when used as a wallet to make payments - it is likely hackers and criminals will find new ways to target devices. However, the exploit only appears to work on some models, and Samsung has released a security update to block the problem. Samsung said there is a fix out for the flagship Galaxy S3 has already been issued, but has not referred to other models yet, such as its bestselling Galaxy S2. The spokesman said: 'We would like to assure our customers that the recent security issue concerning the GALAXY S III has already been resolved through a software update. 'We recommend all GALAXY S III customers to download the latest software update, which can be done quickly and easily via the Over-The-Air (OTA) service.' Users can find updates by clicking on Settings | About Phone | Software updates. Some users also report the problem can occur on HTC handsets, but this is still under investigation. Developers for Android said they had also adapted the operating system to prevent the exploit.

"A high school substitute teacher has been fired after police say he took pictures of his students without their knowledge and posted them to a perverted website. Authorities in Georgia say the former teacher at East Coweta High secretly snapped several photos of his underage female students before posting them to Reddit's Creepshot webpage for others to view and share. Despite some of the photos appearing non suggestive, with at least one girl plainly sitting in her classroom chair, parents found their added captions disturbing, especially when describing teenaged girls. Scroll down for video . Creeper: A substitute teacher at this high school has been fired after allegedly taking pictures of his female students without their knowledge and posting them online . It was a photo of one girl labelled by the teacher as 'Hot Senior Girl in One of My Classes,' according to Jezebel, that was recognized by a Reddit reader who lashed out promising to report him to authorities. 'I know that girl, and I know which teacher you are. I hope you're looking forward to getting fired, you creepy a--hole,' the Reddit user commented. School officials have since contacted the Coweta County Sheriff's office prompting an investigation of the teacher who has not been identified. The Sheriff's office tells Fox5 that the teacher has since been fired from the school system which claims to have conducted a background check on the man prior to his hiring that returned clean. Rule change: Immediately following news of the teacher's behaviour Creepshots posted a rule change banning photos of those under the age of 18 as well as in or near a school . Criminal charges have not been filed. 'FYI this is my daughter. This teacher is caught and being handled accordingly,' a Reddit user later commented on the girl's photo that has since been removed. 'YES HE WAS A TEACHER!!!! She was not his only victim. I beg you to do everything you can to stop this from happening to innocent girls!!! Whoever turned him in, THANK YOU!!! Even though there ""are no laws broken"" so far by this, hopefully your actions have at least put him on the radar of the local authorities!' they wrote. - Riddit moderator on their Creepshot website . Creepshot, which offers thousands of user-submitted pictures of women unknowingly photographed in public, often with the focus on their breasts or backsides, until recently had limited rules on its content. On Thursday a new rule was posted on the forum banning photos taken 'on/in/around school settings or of ""school girls"" unless you can confirm that they are not minors.' 'There is nothing illegal about this subreddit, whatsoever,' a moderator wrote with the posted rule change. 'Creepy, sinister, skin-crawling and generally downright distasteful... yes. But nothing illegal.' On their upskirt forum, that publishes nude shots of women, rule changes mutually rippled over in a post by a moderator declaring voyeur shots now banned. 'Only posed upskirt shorts will be allowed!' the moderator wrote. The post caused immediate upset with one user writing that they'd be now unsubscribing. 'It's unfortunate to lose those that choose to leave. But morally, ethically, and in some cases, legally, content slips in that will have this subreddit removed all together. Removing some of the questionable content is what I'll do. If I lose subscribers because of it, so be it,' the moderator commented back. Watch the video here: .

"The son of Lord Lucan has, for the first time, spoken about the horrific aftermath of his nanny's murder as police led him and his young sisters from a scene of 'terrible carnage'. George Bingham, who was just seven years old when his nanny Sandra Rivett was bludgeoned to death, described how officers guided the three children through the house in total darkness to shield them from seeing the blood-soaked walls. In an interview, Bingham - now aged 45 - has recalled how, on the night of the brutal attack on November 7, 1974, he was woken from a deep sleep by a policeman standing over his bed and then taken out of the house in London. Haunted by his past: Lord Lucan's son George, . pictured a few years ago, left, and with his father before his . disappearance in 1974, has spoken for the first time about what he . thinks may have happened to him . Sandra Rivett, nanny to Lord Lucan's children, was found dead in Belgravia, London, in November 1974 . The youngsters had no idea that their nanny Sandra was dead and their mother had been seriously injured. Their father, Lord Lucan, had disappeared from the scene, presumed guilty of the attacks. Bingham and his sisters were cared for by relatives in the wake of the murder as the full scale of the horror emerged. In an interview with the Sunday MIrror, Bingham described how the memories of that night were still 'crystal clear' in his mind but that he rarely revisited it in his head. The 29-year-old nanny had been looking . after George, his older sister Frances, then aged 10, and four-year-old . Camilla - the youngest of the siblings - for six months . He recalls how the evening had begun as it always did - with Sandra tucking him up in bed with a cup of cocoa and blowing him a kiss, saying goodnight with her 'usual smile' before turning out the lights. This was his last memory of his . beloved nanny. Within an hour she had been bludgeoned to death, his . mother Veronica seriously injured and his father had vanished. Vanished: Police believed Lord Lucan, left, killed Sandra Rivett, right, after mistaking her for his wife Veronica . Mystery: Lord Lucan, is believed to have killed the family nanny, and attacked his then-wife, Veronica, pictured . Bingham had been in a deep sleep and . had heard nothing of the incident. The first he knew something was wrong . was when he was woken by a policeman standing by his bed, telling him . to get dressed and leave the house. Officers turned off all the lights in . the house before guiding the children out, in a bid to hide the horror . of the blood-splattered crime scene from them. He told the Sunday Mirror: 'The . officers turned off the lights in the hallway where there was blood on . the walls and some terrible scenes of carnage. 'There was so much blood and they didn’t want us to see it.' Detective believed Lucan killed Sandra by mistake in the dark, that his intended target had been his estranged wife. The couple were in the middle of acrimonious divorce proceedings. They also believed that he attacked Veronica when she disturbed her husband, before he fled the scene. Revealed: Lord Lucan's son George Bingham tells his story in today's Daily Mirror . Bingham added: 'I remember the police officers being very tense but trying to be very friendly. 'There were several policemen, and a . ­couple of plain-clothes officers. My ­sisters and I were gathered up . and driven by a police car to my ­grandmother’s around the corner in St . John’s Wood, where we stayed most of the night. I got plonked on the . sofa and just went to sleep. 'We weren’t told exactly what had . happened but we were finger-printed at some stage. Even us, despite the . fact we were children.' They were reunited with their mother a week after the attack and the family went to stay with relatives. However, it was to be a whole nine . months after the incident that the children were finally told that their . father and nanny would not be coming home. The police named Lucan as the prime . suspect, but were unable to locate him, instead only finding a . blood-stained car he was seen driving, abandoned at Newhaven, east . Sussex. A coroner, in the absence of the prime suspect, declared in 1975 that Lucan had indeed killed the pretty nanny. But . Lucan's son said he was certain that his father was not the 'prime . mover' in the situation. He added that he hoped he was partly culpable . because it would make his abscondment easier to cope with. Bingham . believes that his father would not have absconded, leaving his children . (which included sisters Camilla and Frances) behind without real . reason. And that's why he hopes his father did have some part to play in that tragic night's events. The graphic nature of the killing and in particular the amount of blood that was found at the scene, leads Bingham to suspect that one or more parties were involved in the murder, yet he does not entirely discount his father being one of them. He does, however, disagree with the version of events according to his mother, with whom he no longer has contact with, believing that the state of her relationship with Lucan at the time clouded her details of fact. Lucan left two letters behind addressed to his brother in law William Shand Kydd, written on the night of the murder. In these letters the tone is clear that he was not to return, giving details of his banking details and estate. Lady Veronica Lucan, left, pictured in London 1994 and right, at the coroner's inquest in 1975 . The second letter, in particular, is most interesting. In it, he refers to a 'fight' he broke up at the property, and that a man left following the assaults. However, . speaking with a worry for the welfare for his children, Lucan appears . adamant that 'V' (Veronica) would make things difficult for him, and . that he couldn't face being charged with attempted murder. Bingham . hopes his no-hold-barred account of that horror night can put to bed . many rumours that came out at the time, and are still prevalent today. Some say Lucan mistakenly killed Rivett instead of his wife, as the lighting was poor in the house at the time. Others say he hired a hitman to do his dirty work, and then escaped to Kenya with the help of some of his high-powered friends. An assistant of zoo owner John Aspinall revealed this year that she booked flights for Lucan's children in 1979 and 1980 to visit a reserve in Kenya - but in reality it was for Lucan to see how his children had grown up. The children lived with their mother until 1982 until all custody was transferred to their aunt and uncle, Lucan's sister Christina and her husband William Shand Kydd, the recipient of Lucan's letters.","George Bingham describes being woken by a police officer standing over his bed telling him to get dressed and leave the house .

"A mother in Texas has made history by giving birth to two sets of identical twins in one day. Tressa Montalvo, 36, defied the odds of one in 70 million to have her four sons, who were born on Valentine's Day, and were originally believed to be quadruplets. She and her husband Manuel, 43, had decided to have another child in order to give their son Memphis a little brother or sister. Scroll down for video . Quadruple surprise: The four babies were originally thought to be quadruplets - before doctors discovered they were actually two sets of identical twins . One in 70 million: Ace Montalvo, one of the four brothers . Little miracle: Tiny Cash Montalvo was born on Valentine's Day with his three brothers against all odds . Blaine Montalvo rests like an angel at the hospital in the NICU . Mother's delight: Tressa Montalvo places her hand on her newborn son, Blaine . But couple got more than they bargained for - and their son now has four baby brothers. While extremely rare, delivering two sets of identical twins isn’t unheard of. In April, 2011, Miranda and Josh Crawford of Charlotte, North Carolina, gave birth to identical twin girls and identical twin boys after undergoing IVF. In 2002, Christina Tetrick of Wichita, Kansas, was pregnant with two sets of identical twin boys. The odds of having non-identical twins are one in 80; with identical twins this rises to one in every 240 cases. With identical twins, a single egg splits just before it implants in the uterus, Basky Thilaganathan, a spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynacecologists told MailOnline. He said: 'In the case of this couple however, two eggs were fertilised by the sperm and then BOTH decided to split before they were implanted, the odds of which are roughly around one in 70 million.' In terms of the risks, because identical twins can share an amniotic sac and a placenta, they are at risk of becoming tangled in each others’ umbilical cords and suffer twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome — a rare placental disease that results in one twin getting less blood than the other. The quadruplets Ace, Blaine, Cash and . Dylan were delivered at 31 weeks by Caesarean section at the The . Woman's Hospital of Texas. 'We tried to stick to the A-B-C-D theme when naming them,' said Mrs Montalvo. Ace and Blaine were born at 8:51am, weighing 3lb 10oz and 3lb 15oz; Cash and Dylan were just one minute . behind, weighing 2lbs 15oz and 3lb 6oz. Mrs Montalvo and her husband thought they were having twins until their doctor detected a third heartbeat. They were then referred to specialist, Dr Brian Kirshon, who found a fourth heartbeat. 'We couldn’t have been more surprised when Dr. Kirshon told us we were having four babies and that they were two sets of twins,' Mr Montalvo said. 'We were trying for one little brother or sister for our two-and-a-half year old son, Memphis. 'We didn’t expect it, we were trying for just one and we were blessed with four.' Around two per cent of all pregnancies result in one set of identical twins, when a fertilised egg splits into two embryos. The Woman's Hospital of Texas said . the odds of delivering two sets of naturally identical twins is . somewhere in the range of one in 70 million. But the Montalvos’ pregnancy was completely natural. 'No fertility drugs were used. We planned the pregnancy — I guess we just succeeded a little too much,' Mr Montalvo said.

Not done yet: Tress Montalvao and husband Manuel, seen here with oldest son Memphis still hope to have a daughter . Precious: The quadruplets were born at The Woman's Hospital of Texas . He added that the process has nothing . to do with IVF; multiple births from that tend to occur due to more . than one egg being artificially inseminated, rather than an egg . splitting. This is why most IVF twins are non-identical. Because . the two sets of babies came from two eggs, they would not be classed as . quadruplets, which generally come from four separate eggs, he added.

"One of the members of the Waco cult has claimed that the group was not ‘brainwashed’ even though its leader took 19 wives and slept with girls as young as 12. Clive Doyle said that he did not want people to think that anyone had been ‘deceived’ or was being held against their will at the camp. He wanted people to ‘open their eyes’ and called for a ‘different perspective’ on the group’s leader David Koresh. Doyle’s claims are an attempt to rewrite the history of the 51-day siege in 1993 which ended when an army of government agents stormed the headquarters of the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas. Loyal: Clive Doyle (right), who traveled with Branch Davidian founder David Koresh (left) to Australia to recruit members in 1986, has written a book claiming cult members weren't held against their will at the camp . Inside the Branch Davidian camp: Group leader David Koresh (left) slept with girls as young as 12 in the camp in which Clive and Sherry Doyle (right) lived . In the ensuing shootout and fire, 76 people including 23 children were killed as the world’s media looked on in horror. Details about the bizarre activities at the Branch Davidian camp have since emerged in memoirs and accounts from former cult members who have described it shocking detail, The New Yorker reported. Koresh literally saw himself as the son of God and lured in disaffected Seventh-Day Adventists to his bizarre regime in which he preached for 15 hours a day and forced them to get up at 5.30am for boot camp like drills with no water. The most sinister part was the alleged abuse of underage girls, including his niece, and how he used to beat up babies until they were bloody. Girls and boys were also beaten for minor offenses like spilling milk and were told to refer to their parents as ‘dogs’. Koresh believed that he had total control over all women on Earth and took 19 wives, fathering at least 13 children with them. Alive to tell the tale: Clive Doyle, a Branch Davidian and survivor of the 1993 standoff, shows on a scale model, in April 2013, where he escaped the fire that eventually destroyed the compound . According to Australian-born Doyle, however, the inner workings of the cult were deeply misunderstood. In . his memoir: ‘A Journey to Waco: Autobiography of a Branch Davidian’, . Doyle writes that now is the time to look again at a group which was . just very different from the rest of the world. He . writes: ‘If people read this account, they will at least gain a . different perspective on who David Koresh was, where he was coming from, . who we were, and why we believe the way we do. ‘Most people think ‘cult’ about us and think we are people who were brainwashed and deceived. ‘They think our church members don’t know what they’re doing or where they’re going. Hopefully, my story can open their eyes.’ Koresh . had taken over the leadership of the Mount Carmel Center in the late . 1980s but it was not until 1993 that things came apart. Burned-out: The Branch Davidian compound was destroyed during an FBI assault to end the 51-day standoff with cult leader David Koresh and his followers in 1993 . Full-frontal attack: The FBI stormed the compound with 12 tanks, four combat vehicles and 1,890 people in a show of force to persuade Koresh to surrender . The end came when 80 armed agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms raided the Mount Carmel community to try and arrest him for supposedly violating federal firearms laws. It was a disaster from the start as the cult had been tipped off and were heavily armed. A shootout began which forced the ATF to retreat and start the siege. Meanwhile the FBI brought together what is thought to have been the largest military force ever assembled to deal with a civilian target, including 12 tanks, four combat vehicles and a total of 1,890 people in a show of force to persuade Koresh to surrender. He refused and the negotiations went on for weeks with the property surrounded until the FBI decided it had waited long enough and went in. As the bullets rained down Koresh is supposed to have told his followers: ‘Martyr yourselves. Go out, freak out, shoot...openly fire and get shot, but kill many before you die.' Anniversary memorial: Branch Davidian survivor Clive Doyle (pictured left and right) participates in a memorial service and visits the graves, in 2003, of the members killed in a fiery government raid in 1993 . 10th anniversary tour: In 2003, Australian-born Branch Davidian member Clive Doyle (front) showed friends and relatives of those killed in the 1993 government raid on the Branch Davidian sect, the gravesites where they were buried . 'A Journey to Waco': Clive Doyle has attempted to rewrite the history of the controversial Texas cult, Branch Davidians, in his new book . Doyle writes that during the chaos he heard Koresh say: ‘I want you all to go back to your rooms and stay calm. ‘I could hear David’s steps going down the hall toward the front door...Then all of a sudden I heard David say: ‘Hey, wait a minute! There are women and children in here!’ ‘Then all hell broke loose - just a barrage of shots from outside coming in. It sounded like a bloodbath.’ During the siege Koresh also made a chilling video message in which he vowed to come out fighting if the FBI came near him. He told the camera: ‘You come pointing guns in the direction of my wives and my kids, damn it. I’m going to meet you at the door every time.’ Wearing a pair of aviator sunglasses and surrounded by dozens of toddlers and babies he also said ‘no-one is going to start...pushing my family around’. After the massacre, in which Koresh was among the victims, President Clinton commissioned a report by the Treasury, which oversees the ATF. It found that the agency had made grave errors in the planning and execution of the raid. Stephen Higgins, the director of the ATF, was fired and five other officials were suspended.","Clive Doyle has revealed new detail about cult leader David Koresh in his book 'A Journey to Waco: Autobiography of a Branch Davidian'

"Germany's economy slipped into reverse in the last quarter of 2011, despite showing strong overall growth of 3 per cent for the year. The country's Federal Statistics Office said the economy was likely to contract by 0.25 per cent in the fourth quarter, although that figure will not be confirmed until next month. Joerg Kraemer, chief economist for Commerzbank, said he expected the economy to shrink in the first quarter of 2012 as well - technically putting Germany in a recession. Shrinking: A worker at a solar company in Bitterfeld-Wolfen, Germany. The German economy contracted by 0.25% in the final quarter of 2011 . The most recent economic indicators suggest 2012 will be a tough year, both for Germany and the rest of Europe. Ferdinand Fichtner, head of the DIW economic institute, said: 'While the German economy grew very strongly in the last two years, this year's growth will be much lower, especially because of the crisis in the eurozone.' Germany's annual growth rate was achieved in spite of the financial crisis besetting Europe, which has other economies including Greece, Spain and Italy struggling with huge debts and slumping output. The country's 2011 growth puts it in a small group of strongly performing eurozone countries, including Finland, Austria, Slovakia and Luxembourg. Export driven: Shipping containers in Duisburg harbour, Germany. The economy grew 3 per cent in 2011 overall, but 2012 is expected to be much tougher . France will see more moderate growth of around 1.7 per cent for the year, according to the International Monetary Fund, while output stagnates amid high unemployment in Spain and Italy. Britain's economy went from a 0.5 per cent contraction in the final quarter of 2010, to 0.5 per cent growth in the third quarter of 2011, suggesting the economy will have grown slightly. Greece and Portugal, bailed out to avoid default, are both in deep recession. Germany is expected to outperform the U.S., which announces its 2011 GDP data on January 27 and is expected to have grown by 1.6 per cent for the year. Testing times: Chancellor Angela Merkel has met with other European leaders this week to discuss the eurozone crisis . But that figure remains far short of emerging economies like China - at an estimated 9.5 per cent - or India, with 7.8 per cent. Its performance means Germany's deficit is down to only 1 per cent of GDP - well below the 3 per cent limit enshrined in the eurozone's rules. In 2010, the German economy grew by 3.7 per cent after a painful contraction of 5.1 per cent in 2009. Simon Junker, an expert with the DIW institute, warned expectations for the economy in 2012 were dampened by the eurozone crisis and both exports and imports would slow down. 'Germany's strongly export-driven economy will not be able to elude the slowdown of the global economy,' he said. 'Especially German exports will suffer from the eurozone crisis.' But the DIW said there was reason to be optimistic if eurozone governments 'manage to quickly and believably contain the crisis'.","German economy shrank by 0.25% in final quarter of 2011 .

"A former CIA officer has been convicted of leaking classified details of a U.S. operation to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions to a New York Times reporter. Jeffrey Sterling, 47, from O'Fallon, Missouri, was found guilty of all nine counts he faced in federal court in Virginia on Monday. The decision came just hours after the jury, which had been deliberating for three days, told the judge they could not reach a unanimous verdict - but the judge urged them to keep talking. Throughout the two-week trial they had been trying to determine who had told journalist James Risen about the secret mission, which he wrote about in his 2006 book State of War. Who was his source? New York Times reporter James Risen, pictured, wrote about a secret operation in 2006, and on Monday, former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling was found guilty of leaking the information to him . Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had testified the mission was one of the government's most closely held secrets and one of its best chances to thwart Iran's nuclear-weapons ambitions. Prosecutors had fought to force Risen to divulge his sources for years, but they decided not to call him to testify once it became clear he would not reveal his sources even if jailed for contempt of court. Prosecutors acknowledged a lack of direct evidence against Sterling but said the circumstantial evidence against him was overwhelming. They claim he divulged the secrets because he was bitter about his treatment at the agency. But defense lawyers argued that the evidence showed that Capitol Hill staffers who had been briefed on the classified operation were more likely the source of the leak. Shock: Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, pictured last year, testified the mission was one of the government's most closely held secrets and one of its best chances to thwart Iran's nuclear-weapons . The plan involved using a CIA asset nicknamed Merlin, who had been a Russian nuclear engineer, to foist deliberately flawed nuclear-weapons blueprints on the Iranians, hoping they would spend years trying to develop parts that had no hope of ever working. Questions: Sterling described the mission as hopelessly botched in his 2006 book, pictured . In State of War, Sterling described the mission as hopelessly botched, and possibly backfiring by giving the Iranians blueprints that could be useful to them if they sorted out the good information from the errors. In his closing arguments, prosecutor Eric Olshan said the chapter of Risen's book seemed to be clearly written from Sterling's perspective as Merlin's case handler and cast him in a flattering light. The book describes the handler's misgivings about the operation while others at the CIA push the plan through despite its risks. Furthermore, Sterling, who was fired from the CIA in 2002, believed he had been mistreated and was angry that the agency refused to settle his racial discrimination complaint, Olshan said. Risen had written about that complaint, and he was known to have a relationship with Sterling. The two exchanged dozens of phone calls and emails, Olshan said. But defense lawyers said the government had no evidence that Risen and Sterling talked about anything classified in those phone calls and emails. The government failed to obtain Risen's records to see who else he may have contacted. Defense attorney Barry Pollack said Risen first got wind of the operation in early 2003, within weeks of Sterling reporting his misgivings to staffers at a Senate intelligence committee - a channel that Sterling was legally allowed to pursue. Pollack said it makes more sense that a Hill staffer leaked to Risen. Sterling now faces years in prison. U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema allowed Sterling to remain free on bond until his sentencing on April 24.","Jeffrey Sterling, 47, was found guilty of all nine counts he faced in federal court in Virginia on Monday after three days of deliberations .

"Every schoolboy knows the story of how the dinosaurs were wiped out by a giant asteroid 65million years ago. But an intriguing theory has arisen suggesting that the dinosaurs may have an asteroid to thank for their existence - with an asteroid possibly sweeping away all contenders 201million years ago, allowing the terrible lizards to rise to the top of the food chain. Paleontologist Paul Olsen and geologist Dennis Kent of Columbia University have been exploring this theory and looking for evidence that an asteroid did strike the Earth, causing the Triassic-Jurassic extinction. Round 2: An artist's impression of how the six-mile wide asteroid might have looked as it ploughed into our world, decimating life on the surface . Over the past 450 million years, life on earth has undergone at least five great extinctions, when biological activity nosedived and dominant groups of creatures disappeared. The final one - so far - was 65 million years ago, when it appears that a giant meteorite brought fires, shock waves and tsunamis, then drastically altered the climate, which killed off the dinosaurs and set the stage for mammals - and eventually us - to evolve. A team from Columbia explore the coasts of Britain to see if the sediment holds clues to the past . Many scientists are now starting to think we are on the edge of a sixth extinction - his one driven by human destruction of other species and their habitats, and our quickening releases of carbon dioxide into the air, which threatens to bring another round of rapid climate change. The causes of the fourth extinction - the one that paved the way for the dinosaurs - are a mystery. Olsen and Kent have been gathering clues from sites including ancient lava flows in Morocco, wave-washed sea cliffs along the coast of Wales, and in rocks deep beneath the modern landscapes of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The Triassic-Jurassic extinction wiped out half the species on earth: eel-like fish called conodonts; mammal-like swamp-dwelling therapsids; early crocodilians; monkey-faced tree-dwelling lizards; many broad-leaved plants; and others. Dinosaurs were until then a relatively minor group, but hung on and subsequently evolved rapidly in size and diversity. Until recently, the exact timing remained murky, but by 2002 evidence from fossils and other sources showed it was extremely sudden - spanning just a few thousand years or maybe less, at 201.4 million years ago. As for the causes, among other things, scientists have contemplated gradual shifts in climate and sea levels that reached a deadly tipping point. However, bets today have shifted to massive volcanic eruptions that alternately cooled and heated the atmosphere with soot and carbon dioxide – much like human pollutants today. Mass extinction: A mega asteroid is the most likely cause of the major extinction event 65million years ago - and perhaps the previous one . Recently, Olsen and Kent have introduced another possibility: a meteorite like the one that killed the dinosaurs. But evidence for all the ideas remains incomplete. 'The only thing we can say for certain about the Triassic-Jurassic extinction is that it happened,' said Olsen. 'It could have happened over 10,000 years, or it could have happened in a day.' In 2002, Olsen and Kent coauthored a paper in the journal Science showing that large dinosaurs showed up in what is now New Jersey just 10,000 years after the Triassic extinction. Moreover, they showed that rocks from that time contain a spike of iridium – an element rare in earth’s crust, but abundant in meteorites. Soon, other researchers found seemingly related evidence near the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, including roughly matching iridium layers in Morocco and Nova Scotia, and quartz in Italy apparently shattered by some gigantic impact. But the case was inconclusive; for one thing, there was no known meteorite crater from that time big enough to have spread such an iridium layer, nor caused global damage. Meanwhile, Kent, Olsen and others began to build the case for volcanism. Roughly concurrent with the extinction, the single giant continent of Pangaea, then comprising most of earth’s landmass, began splitting up. One rift evolved into the Atlantic Ocean, as new continents moved apart; this was accompanied by repeated massive outpourings of lava over hundreds of thousands of years, forming the Central Atlantic magmatic province  - igneous rocks that underlie today’s coasts of eastern North America and parts of Brazil and west Africa. Sulphur particles from eruptions would have darkened skies for years, chilling the planet. Such particles settle quickly, but another major component of volcanic eruptions is carbon dioxide, which stays in the air for centuries, warming it up. Thus, alternate chills and heat waves would have prevailed. Kent and Olsen have gathered perhaps the clearest evidence of such a scenario so far. Last year, in another Science paper, they showed that lava flooded what is now the U.S. northeast several times in spurts separated by about 200,000 years each. Using deep drill cores penetrating below today’s heavily settled landscape, they have analyzed those lava sheets,  along with intervening layers of ancient soils built up during pauses in the volcanism. The soils, they found, contain spikes of carbon dioxide five to ten times the levels of today - enough to kill off much plant and animal life with excess heat, and acidify the oceans with chemical reactions. 'The flipping back and forth between extremes of hot and cold, quite possibly would be worse than either one alone,' said Olsen. The earliest lavas in the U.S. northeast seem to come about 10,000 years after the sharp extinction boundary, so it is hard to show a connection there; but lavas in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco that Olsen has sampled seem to coincide directly with it. Round 1: An underwater volcano erupts near Tonga in 2009 - perhaps a reminder of an extinction more than 65million years ago . This year, the scientists drilled more cores in New Jersey in an attempt to refine their data. In 2010, the meteorite idea popped up again, when a separate research group re-dated a badly eroded meteorite crater near Rochechouart, western France, previously thought to be 214 million years old. Instead, they found it is 201.4 million years old - exactly matching the T-J boundary. The crater is only a sixth the size of Mexico’s Chicxulub crater, which is correlated with the dinosaurs’ demise, and probably not big enough to cause global catastrophe - but enough to intrigue Olsen and Kent. They have been drawn also by accounts of recently identified sedimentary rocks along sea cliffs in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from the same time. One layer seems to have been formed or altered by some giant tsunami or earthquake - a possible product of the impact. 'We still favor volcanism, but a role for a meteorite in softening up ecosystems for the onslaught that followed is not impossible,' said Olsen. 'At this point, we have a big hole; evidence of shaking; an iridium layer; and a disappearance,. All around the same time. But we don’t know if it was at exactly the same time.' As Kent recently told Nature reporter Roff Smith: 'The only way we are ever going to be able to unravel this mystery is to work out a timeline, as precise as we can make it, of all the various events around the world that led up to it.' In 2011, Kent and Olsen headed to the United Kingdom to investigate how the rocks there relate to the extinction- specifically, whether they contain an iridium spike indicating a meteorite strike.Olsen has also visited the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, where giant sheets of volcanic basalt and other rocks dating to this time lie exposed. In 2012, they also returned to a site that is a staple for college geology-class field trips: a rock layer in Exeter, Pa., that is one of the few places where the sharp but often deeply buried Triassic-Jurassic boundary is clearly visible to the naked eye and easily accessible. The layer sits exposed in a bluff near a housing development. They hope to drill this site as well. Whatever the exact mechanisms of the extinction, the researchers see parallels with today. Rapid changes to the atmosphere, including massive carbon dioxide releases, obviously took a toll – possibly on time scales similar to our own current boom in carbon-dioxide production and the resulting warming of the world. 'There probably are very significant lessons to be learned about processes in the doubling of CO2,' said Olsen. 'We have to get, however, the pattern, and the basic chronology and the basic history right first, before we try to learn great lessons about what lies ahead for us in the future.'",Mass extinction event 201million years ago may have been caused by a massive asteroid which landed in France .

"Dominique Strauss-Kahn was an ‘effective and decisive’ pimp who regularly hired prostitutes to ‘satisfy his sexual needs’, French judges believe. The damning claims were made following an investigation in the so-called Carlton Affair, in which the former International Monetary Fund chief faces prison. Details of the case against the 64-year-old were leaked to Le Figaro newspaper, following his indictment for ‘aggravating pimping’. In court: Former International Monetary Fund head Dominique Strauss-Kahn tried to get pimping charges against him dropped . During a failed attempt to have the charges dropped on December 19th in Douai, northern France, the court heard that Strauss-Kahn was at the centre of a well organised prostitution racket based out of the Carlton Hotel, in the nearby city of Lille. It included a so called ‘garconniere’ – a ‘bachelor pad’ in Paris which the married Strauss-Kahn would use to entertain his paid-for lovers. Orgies are also said to have been held at luxury hotels all over the world, including in Washington DC, close to the IMF headquarters. ‘The judges felt that serious corroborating evidence make likely the effective and decisive participation of Dominique Strauss Kahn in acts of pimping,’ says Le Figaro. The judges also consider that the pimping racket was primarily set up for Strauss Kahn in order to ‘satisfy his sexual needs’. Separated: Dominique Strauss-Kahn was married to his wife Anne Sinclair, pictured outside Manhattan criminal court in 2011, at the time of the alleged offences . This is despite the fact that, at the time, he was allegedly happily married to the multi-millionaire art heiress and former TV presenter, Anne Sinclair, also 64. Miss Sinclair regularly insisted that Strauss-Kahn was innocent of any wrong doing, but the couple have since separated. Settlement: The former IMF chief paid Nafissatou Diallo, who accused him of sexual assault, £950,000 . Strauss Kahn admits attending so-called ‘sex parties’, but insists he had no idea that any of the women were call girls. A statement handed to the court by Strauss-Kahn’s lawyers said a charge of aggravated pimping was ‘unhealthy, sensationalist and not without a political agenda.’ But Guillaume Maigret, general secretary of the court, ordered that the case against Strauss-Kahn ‘should proceed’. It comes after Strauss-Kahn made a £950,000 pay-off to the New York hotel cleaner who accused him of trying to rape her. The disgraced economist and Nafissatou Diallo reached the agreement to end all legal action for sexual assault against him in America. Strauus-Kahn - once tipped as a future Socialist president of France - was arrested in May 2011 for trying to rape the 30-year-old at a Sofitel in Manhatten. He claimed Ms Diallo had consented to sex but, after criminal charges were dropped, she prepared a civil case for a ‘violent and sadistic attack’ that ‘robbed her of her dignity as a woman’. Strauss-Kahn was also accuse of sexually abusing a young French writer in Paris, but those allegations were dropped because they took place too long ago. Strauss-Kahn recently made a discreet return to public life, giving a speech on the global finances in China and advising the Greek government on their massive debts. His trial for pimping, for which he faces a prison sentence, will take place at a date to be fixed.","Dominique Strauss-Kahn attempted to get 'pimping charges' dropped .

"The U.S and Canada may have witnessed a curtain-raiser for the spectacular Eta Aquarid meteor shower. What looked like a fireball was caught on camera racing across the sky in broad daylight across western New York and Ontario, Canada, just a day before the Eta Aquarid event takes place. Two car dashboard-mounted cameras filmed the object, with the footage subsequently uploaded to YouTube. Light fantastic: A police dash-cam captured what appears to be a fireball streaking across the sky above Canada . Now you see it, now you don't: The object was gone in a split second, but witnesses said its brightness rivalled that of the sun . A very bright light appears against the blue sky, then quickly vanishes. Some people reported hearing an explosion as the ball of light streaked away from them. The American Meteor Society is urging members of the public to submit reports of the fireball to it. Spectacular: The Eta Aquarids, seen here over Florida Keys in 2013, takes place when the earth dissects the debris trail of Halley's Comet . Goodness gracious: The great ball of fire's trajectory, according to the American Meteor Society . Here we sort through the space rubble and explain the different sorts of rock floating around in the solar system. ASTEROIDThese are fragments from the formation of the solar system 4.6billion years ago and can range in size from half a mile to hundreds of miles wide. They generally lurk between Mars and Jupiter. COMETThese too are also leftovers from the . formation of the solar system and are made up of ice, rock, dust and frozen . gases, with the core being up to 40 miles in diameter. They can leave a . spectacular trail that's hundreds of millions of miles long as they orbit the sun. METEOROIDThese are the result of asteroid collisions or comets breaking up. METEORSThese are meteoroids that burn up as they enter the Earth's atmosphere. METEORITESMeteors that survive the fiery entry to earth and hit the ground. It said that judging from initial reports, the object had a brightness rivalling that of the sun. The Eta Aquarid meteor shower is created as the Earth passes through the debris trail of Halley’s Comet, according to Nasa, and this year it peaks between May 5 and 6. About 30 meteors will be visible an hour in the northern hemisphere and around 60 per hour in the southern hemisphere. Nasa explained that the objects in the debris trail are moving at around 148,000mph. To view the Eta Aquarids, Nasa suggests finding an area well away from city or street lights, prepared with a sleeping bag, blanket or chair. ‘Lie flat on your back with your feet facing east and look up, taking in as much of the sky as possible,’ the space agency advises. ‘After about 30 minutes in the dark, your eyes will adapt and you will begin to see meteors. Be patient - the show will last until dawn, so you have plenty of time to catch a glimpse.’ Slooh astronomer Bob Berman said: ‘What makes this shower somewhat special is that the meteors stem from the most famous comet in all of history, Comet Halley. ‘As Halley goes around the sun in its 76-year orbit, pieces of it, little chunks of ice, slough off the comet and we intersect that every year around this time, in early May.’","An apparent fireball was seen racing across the sky in broad daylight .

"Chilling interview: Steven Hayes told how he 'snapped' when he raped and killed Dr William Pettit's family in 2007 . A man convicted in the brutal home invasion killings of a Connecticut woman and her two daughters in 2007 said no one was supposed to get hurt and he ""just snapped"" before he and an accomplice set fire to the house. ""To this day I don't know why it happened, I just wanted money. That's all I was looking for,"" Steven Hayes said in an hour-long jailhouse interview with the New Haven Register, which published his comments in Sunday's editions . Hayes, 50, and Joshua Komisarjevsky, 33, were convicted of capital felony, murder, sexual assault and other crimes and sentenced to death for the July 2007 killings of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, at their home in suburban Cheshire. The two men, both convicted burglars, spotted Hawke-Petit and Michaela at a local grocery store, followed them and later broke into their home. Komisarjevsky beat Dr. William Petit, the only survivor, with a baseball bat, and Hayes later went with Hawke-Petit to a bank and forced her to withdraw $15,000 under the threat of harming her family. Hayes said when he walked back into the house with Hawke-Petit, 'at . that point, we were just going to leave. Nobody was going to get hurt — . at least not by me.' 'But that’s when Josh told me about him and the girl,' Hayes . said, referring to Komisarjevsky sexually assaulting Michaela while . Hayes was out of the house. Authorities said Hayley and Michaela were tied to their beds. Komisarjevsky sexually assaulted Michaela, and Hayes strangled and sexually assaulted Hawke-Petit. The two girls were burned alive after Komisarjevsky and Hayes set the house on fire and fled before crashing into police cruisers and being arrested. Scroll down for video . Victims:  Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11all died in the brutal crime. Dr William Petit, right, survived . Scene of the tragedy: The burned out Petit home where the girls and their mother died . Hayes said he and Komisarjevsky were going to leave after he returned from the bank with Hawke-Petit. But then, he said, Komisarjevsky told him that he sexually assaulted Michaela. ""I started to lose it,"" Hayes said. ""Then I looked out the window and saw an unmarked police car. And I just snapped."" He said what happened next, including his assaulting Hawke-Petit, ""wasn't who I am."" ""I wasn't thinking right; I don't know what I was thinking. It was so unlike me. I'd never done anything like that,"" he said. Both Hayes and Komisarjevsky have blamed each other for escalating the crime. In his first interview since being convicted in 2011, Komisarjevsky told The Associated Press last year that he tries not to think about the crime and suffers no nightmares about it. He declined to talk directly about the crime, citing advice from his lawyers. 'It took a year before I could even remember what happened in those last . few minutes,' Hayes said to the New Haven Register. 'I was told it was rage and stress or . something. I just know that for a couple of minutes I became somebody . else.' 'I’ll never forgive myself for that.' Remarried: Dr Petit with his new wife Christine . At the Northern Correctional Institution in Somers, Hayes told the Register he can't stop thinking about the Cheshire murders. He also said he no longer thinks about killing himself. ""I realize now I've got to live with this pain,"" he said. ""It's something I'm supposed to live with."" William Petit didn't respond to a request for comment. When asked by the New Haven Register what he would tell Petit if they were face-to-face, Hayes . said, 'I don’t know if there’s anything I could say. I definitely feel . sorry but that doesn’t change things. I’d try to answer his questions.' Hawke-Petit's sister, Cindy Hawke-Renn, called Hayes' comments ""too little, too late."" ""How do you plan such behavior and allow people to die at your hands and burn alive, especially when you have children of your own? Snapped? Doesn't sound like an excuse to me,"" she told the newspaper. Horrifying: The charred bedroom of Hayley Petit, who was tied to her bed before petrol was poured over her . Telling the newspaper that it was Komisarjevsky who lit the match, Hayes admits though, that he doesn't blame anyone but himself for the events that transpired that day. Killers: Joshua Komisarjevsky sentenced to death in 2011 for brutal murders of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 . He added that his decision making had been affected by his relapse into drugs - after having been clean for over four years. However, despite claiming not to have been on drugs the evening of that attack, Hayes did say that he made a lot of incoherent decisions. Hayes attempted to claim that throughout the Petit family's ordeal, except for a 'couple of minutes', Komisarjevsky and he were, 'nice to everyone. I was trying to keep people calm. I get them water, I let them go to the bathroom.' Convicted of multiple murder counts, kidnapping, assault and third-degree burglary in 2010, A Superior Court jury sentenced Hayes to death. Before the trial, Hayes attempted suicide by overdosing on prescription medication - and told the New Haven Register he wishes he was successful. 'I don’t deserve to live,' he said. 'I don’t want to live.' 'I realize now I’ve got to live with this pain. It’s something I’m supposed to live with.'

"Of all the contenders to replace Pope Benedict XVI, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires was little mentioned. The 76-year-old reportedly received the second most votes after Joseph Ratzinger, the last pope, in the 2005 papal election. And as a representative of South America's Catholics - who make up an estimated 40 per cent of the 1.2 billion strong church, he was widely supported on a massive scale. Elected: Pope Francis waves to the crowd from the central balcony of St Peter's Basilica at the Vatican . He became Pope Francis after a surprisingly quick conclave winning 77 votes, or two-thirds of the 115 cardinals' votes, on the fifth ballot. His decision to pick the name Francis evokes key Christian tenets such as simplicity and humility. And they are fitting for a man who, spending nearly his entire career in Argentina, is known for catching the bus and eschewing the luxuries of high office. His personal style is said to be the antithesis of Vatican splendour. In this undated picture Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, Archbishop of Buenos Aires, second from left in back row, poses for a picture with his famil . Pope Francis has been described by commentators as a voice of conscience and a reconciler. Classed by some as a moderniser of a strict South American church, he is still conservative and an opponent of such ideas as gay marriage. This early 1950s picture released by journalist Sergio Rubin shows Jorge Mario Bergoglio posing with unidentified schoolmates of a preparatory school in Buenos Aires . Pope Francis was born into a middle-class family of seven in 1936, his father a . railway worker and his mother a housewife. He became a priest at 32, nearly a decade after losing a lung due to respiratory illness and quitting his chemistry studies. Despite his late start, he was leading the local Jesuit community within four years, holding the post from 1973 to 1979. Bergoglio's vocational success coincided with the bloody 1976-1983 military dictatorship, during which up to 30,000 suspected leftists were kidnapped and killed - which prompted sharp questions about his role. The most well-known episode relates to the abduction of two Jesuits whom the military government secretly jailed for their work in poor neighbourhoods. According to 'The Silence,' a book written by journalist Horacio Verbitsky, Bergoglio withdrew his order's protection of the two men after they refused to quit visiting the slums, which ultimately paved the way for their capture. Verbitsky's book is based on statements by Orlando Yorio, one of the kidnapped Jesuits, before he died of natural causes in 2000. Both of the abducted clergymen survived five months of imprisonment. 'History condemns him. It shows him to be opposed to all innovation in the Church and above all, during the dictatorship, it shows he was very cosy with the military,' Fortunato Mallimacci, the former dean of social sciences at the Universidad de Buenos Aires, once said. Historic moment: The parents of Pope Francis pose for their wedding portrait in Buenos Aires, Argentina . Humble: Pope Francis was one of 44 new cardinals elevated by Pope John Paul II in 2001 . Those who defend Bergoglio say there . is no proof behind these claims and, on the contrary, they say the . priest helped many dissidents escape during the military junta's rule. But . in the Vatican, far removed from the dictatorship's grim legacy, this . quiet priest is expected to lead the Church with an iron grip and a . strong social conscience. The new Pope is an ardent fan of an Argentinian football team nicknamed the 'Saints.' Just in case their rivals were in any doubt, the club, San Lorenzo de Almagro, tweeted a photo of Pope Francis with the team's colours yesterday. The Buenos Aires club  - one of the country's top sides - owes its name to a Catholic priest who played a key role in helping the 104-year-old team find a place to play in its early days. Father Lorenzo Massa became so worried about the boys kicking a ball around in the streets he offered them the use of the churchyard after seeing one player almost knocked down by a tram. There was just one condition - that they must attend mass on Sundays. In honour of his contribution, the founding members of the club decided to name the team after the churchman. Almagro is the district in Buenos Aires where the team originated from. The club now plays in the Primera Division, the top league in Argentina. In 2010, he challenged the Argentine government when it backed a gay marriage bill. 'Let's . not be naive. This isn't a simple political fight, it's an attempt to . destroy God's plan,' he wrote in a letter days before the bill was . approved by Congress. Described . by his biographer as a balancing force, Bergoglio has monk-like habits, . is media shy and deeply concerned about the social inequalities rife in . his homeland and elsewhere in Latin America. 'His character is in every way that of a moderate. 'He is absolutely capable of undertaking the necessary renovation without any leaps into the unknown. He would be a balancing force,' said Francesca Ambrogetti, who co-authored a biography of Bergoglio after carrying out a series of interviews with him over three years. 'He shares the view that the Church should have a missionary role, that gets out to meet people, that is active.... a church that does not so much regulate the faith as promote and facilitate it,' she added. 'His lifestyle is sober and austere. That's the way he lives. 'He travels on the underground, the bus, when he goes to Rome he flies economy class.' He is described as a solemn man, deeply attached to centuries-old Roman Catholic traditions. Since rejecting a comfortable archbishop's residence, he has lived in a small apartment outside Buenos Aires where he spends his weekends in solitude. In his rare public appearances, Bergoglio spares no harsh words for politicians and Argentine society, and has had a tricky relationship with President Cristina Fernandez and her late husband and predecessor, Nestor Kirchner.

"A man held in solitary confinement for two years and forced to pull his own tooth because he was denied dental care has been awarded $22million for violation of his constitutional rights. Stephen Slevin, 58, from New Mexico, was given the payout after accusing Dona Ana County jail of essentially forgetting about him after he was arrested for driving while intoxicated, not giving him the healthcare he needed and treating him inhumanely. The settlement is one of the largest federal civil rights awards in history involving an inmate. Scroll down for video . Ordeal: Stephen Slevin, pictured near the time of his release, was held in solitary confinement for two years and forced to pull out his own tooth . Traumatic: Stephen Slevin, looked remarkably different in August, 2005,  at the time of his arrest for drunken driving . Outside the federal courthouse in Santa Fe today, Mr Slevin said it was never about the money for him but more about sending a message that prisoners should be treated more humanely. He still suffers from Post Traumatic . Stress Disorder stemming from what he says was physical and mental . mistreatment by corrections officials in Dona Ana County, in the . southern part of the state. He told KOB4.com: 'It was never about the money. We made a statement about what happened to me. 'Prison officials were walking by me . every day, watching me deteriorate. Day after day after day, . they did nothing, nothing at all, to get me any help.' The 58-year-old was arrested in . August 2005 and charged with driving while intoxicated and receiving a . stolen vehicle near Las Cruces. His lawyer said that, due to his history of mental illness, he was placed into solitary confinement. Civil rights attorney Matthew Coyte revealed it was here that his client started to deteriorate. He said: 'They threw him in solitary and . then ignored him. He disappeared into delirium, and his mental illness . was made worse by being isolated from human contact and a lack of . medical care.' Justice: Stephen Slevin, pictured in 2012, said it was never about the money for him but more about making a statement that it was not acceptable to treat prisoners in this way . While Mr Slevin was in solitary . confinement, his toenails grew so long they began to curl around his . feet, he developed bedsores, fungus and dental problems and lost a lot . of weight, according to the lawsuit. He was eventually released after 22 months as a pre-trial detainee and the charges against him were dismissed. Battle: Civil rights attorney Matt Coyte said that his client had shown great courage through his case against the Dona Ana county prison system . It was upon his release that he filed the lawsuit, claiming his rights of due process were violated since he was not given a hearing before being placed in solitary confinement. The county had recently offered to settle the case for $2million, according to CNN, despite previously denying there was a lack of medical care and that, as government employees, county officials deserved immunity from liability. Mr Coyte told KOB.com that he hopes Mr Slevin's court victory will send a message throughout the state. He said: 'I have never been with or seen a braver man who stood up to these guys for what they did to him. 'It affects everybody and it's not good for this country.

The cars, purchased for a combined $65,000, sold for $650,000. Each underwent approximately $200,000 in restoration. Pontiac Director John Delorean poses with the future classic Pontiac Firebird convertible in 1967 . Rawlings was able to buy the cars for a combined $65,000 . Called '#1' and '#2' the cars are the prototype models Pontiac engineers used as the base for the 1967 Firebird . Rawling's was tipped off about the Firebirds by a client who had just purchased a 'pretty rare Corvette.' 'I always have a habit of asking, ‘Do you have anything you want to . sell?’ He told me he heard a story about a guy a couple of towns over . who was supposed to have the [Firebirds],' he said. 'A lot of times it . turns out to be a ghost story — a ‘cool car’ turns out to be a four-door . Nova.' Though an incredible find the cars were still in need of quite a bit of love. Rawlings has discovered the cars that were the model for the highly influential 1967 Pontiac Firebird . Richard Rawlings and Aaron Kaufman were able to sell the cars for $650,000 after giving them a massive restoration . 'They were really beaten down and were rusted out, with their motors laying off to the side,' Rawling's said. 'The [owner] was never going to restore them, so we made him a pretty heft offer and the game was on. 'I wanted to sell them as they were,' he added. 'But somebody found out and word . spread quickly before the cars even got back to Texas [where the show . is based]. 'A guy wanted them fully restored to use as the centerpieces . of a Pontiac museum in North Dakota, and he wanted them done in 60 . days. A full restoration for a regular shop would take a year . or year-and-a-half, but we finished both cars in 60 days.' Rawlings believes this may be the biggest recent discovery in collectible cars. 'To me, this is one of the biggest muscle-car finds in the last 20 . years,' he said. 'These cars were thought to have been long gone.'","Called '#1' and '#2,' cars were base for the classic 1967 Pontiac Firebird .

"Arrested: Jesus Leonel Sanchez Meza was taken into custody on Thursday . One of the men suspected of murdering U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry has been arrested in Mexico. The agent's death kicked off a national scandal into Operation Fast and Furious, a government programme which allowed gun smugglers to keep their weapons. Jesus Leonel Sanchez Meza, who was arrested on Thursday in Sonora state, is one of the five men charged with killing Mr Terry in December 2010 during a shootout in Arizona near the Mexico border. One of the men is on trial in Arizona and the other three remain fugitives. Two guns found at the scene were . bought by a member of a gun-smuggling ring that was being monitored in . the Fast and Furious investigation. Critics . have attacked U.S. federal authorities for allowing informants to walk . away from Arizona gun shops with weapons, rather than immediately . arresting suspects. In Operation Fast and Furious and at least three earlier probes during the administration of George W. Bush, agents in Arizona employed a risky tactic called gun-walking - allowing low-level 'straw' buyers in gun-trafficking networks to leave with loads of weapons purchased at gun shops. The goal was to track the guns to major weapons traffickers and drug cartels in order to bring cases against kingpins who had long eluded prosecution under the former strategy of arresting low-level purchasers of guns who were suspected of buying them for others. Victim: Federal agent Brian Terry was killed in a border shoot-out in 2010 . Scene: Police guarding the area of Arizona where Mr Terry was killed . During . Operation Fast and Furious, many of the weapons were not tracked and . wound up at crime scenes in Mexico and the U.S., including the Terry . shooting. In July, U.S. authorities made a rare disclosure linked to the botched gun-smuggling . probe, revealing identities and requesting the public's help in . capturing the four fugitives accused over Mr Terry's death. The . release of the suspects' identities in an unsealed indictment came with . the offer of a $1million reward for information leading to their . capture. The FBI said . it was seeking information related to Jesus Rosario Favela-Astorga, 31, . Ivan Soto-Barraza, 34, Heraclio Osorio-Arellanes, 34, and a man . identified as Lionel Portillo-Meza, which Mexican police said was an . alias of the man arrested on Thursday in Puerto Penasco. Charges: Three suspects in the killing are still on the loose . Accusation: Attorney General Eric Holder has been repeatedly criticised by Republicans for his role in Operation Fast and Furious . Authorities had previously released the identity of the fifth suspect, Manuel Osorio-Arellanes of El Fuerte in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. He was shot during the gunfight and has been in custody since the night of the shooting. Osorio-Arellanes has pleaded not guilty in the case, telling investigators that he raised his weapon toward the agents during the shootout but didn't fire, the FBI said in records. All five men have been charged with murder. They also face charges of assaulting four federal agents. FBI agents declined to discuss which fugitive is suspected of firing the shot that killed Terry. They also would not comment on whether the weapon was linked to an Operation Fast and Furious purchase. The five men, plus another who faces lesser charges in the case, went to the U.S. from Mexico in order to rob marijuana smugglers, according to the indictment.","Jesus Leonel Sanchez Meza accused of involvement in murder of Brian Terry in December 2010 .

"The SNP are on course for a landslide general election victory in Scotland which will stop Ed Miliband becoming Prime Minister, pollsters have claimed. Labour are trailing the Scottish nationalists by 17 points – with support for the SNP remaining steady at 45 per cent, a new survey has revealed. In a further blow for Labour, Scots now prefer David Cameron as Prime Minister to Mr Miliband - despite only 15 per cent of voters north of the border backing the Tories. The SNP are on course for a landslide general election victory in Scotland in the general election this May . If northing changes by May 7, the SNP will take 21 seats off Labour and nine off the Liberal Democrats, leaving Mr Miliband short of a majority in the Commons. The SNP would be left with 47 seats to Labour's 10. The Lib Dems would lose all but two of their 11 Scots MPs and the Tories would keep their solitary Scottish MP. Election experts have warned that the collapse in Labour's vote in Scotland could even undermine Mr Miliband's chances of forming a Coalition government with either the SNP or Lib Dems. The poll of 1,011 Scots was carried out by research consultants Survation for the Daily Record newspaper. Polling guru Professor John Curtice said: 'Given the state of the GB polls, those losses could make the difference between Ed Miliband being in sight of a workable majority and being quite a way off.' He said, as things stands, Labour will finish 31 seats short of a working majority - with 290 Westminster seats. Labour under Ed Miliband (left) are trailing the Scottish nationalists, led by Nicola Sturgeon (right) by 17 points – with support for the SNP remaining steady at 45 per cent, a new survey has revealed . Scots now prefer David Cameron as Prime Minister to Mr Miliband - despite only 15 per cent of voters north of the border backing the Tories . Even a coaltion with the Lib Dems – who are expected to finish with just 24 seats - would leave a Labour/Lib Dem coalition seven seats short . But Labour's warning that voting SNP will hand the keys to Downing Street to David Cameron could backfire – after research showed Scots preferred the Tory leader as Prime Minister to Mr Miliband. Despite the unpopularity of the Tories, Scots would rather have Mr Cameron in the top job than Mr Miliband. Nineteen per cent think Miliband would make the best Prime Minister, compared to 23 per cent for Cameron, six per cent for UKIP's Nigel Farage and five per cent for Nick Clegg. David Cameron could be kept in power by the SNP's surge . Even among Labour supporters, only 46 per cent think Miliband would be the best PM. Labour has accused Mr Cameron of being 'secretly pleased' by the prospect of Scots opting for the SNP at the general election because it remains his 'best chance' of staying in power, according to shadow Scottish secretary Margaret Curran. The Labour politician has predicted that the Prime Minister will 'talk up' the nationalists and 'talk down' her party when he addresses the Scottish Conservative conference later this week. Recent polling suggests the SNP will almost completely wipe out Labour in Scotland in May's vote. Ms Curran admitted voters have told the party it has 'not been good enough' and must 'fight its corner better', but she insisted its message is 'beginning to resonate on doorsteps'. Labour has refused to be drawn on the prospect of a coalition or 'confidence and supply' arrangement with the SNP in the event of a hung parliament. The party has been keen to focus on the consequences of the loss of Labour support north of the border. Speaking ahead of the Tories' Scottish conference, Ms Curran said: 'The choice is absolutely clear. A choice between a Tory government that will carry on looking after their friends with Swiss bank accounts, or a Labour government that is going to clamp down on tax avoidance from day one. 'We now have a Tory Party with spending plans from the Great Depression and welfare policies from the Victorian workhouse. Scotland absolutely cannot go on like this. 'That is why David Cameron is going to get a very cold reception when he comes to Scotland in the next couple of days. 'Scotland does not want five more years of the Tories.' Ms Curran said an appearance by the Prime Minister at the conference would be 'an important moment in the campaign'. 'He'll actually try to talk down Labour and he'll try to talk up the SNP,' she said. 'We know that David Cameron is actually secretly pleased at the prospect of Scottish people voting SNP because he knows that is his best chance of staying in power. 'We know for sure that every vote for the SNP is a boost for David Cameron and makes it more likely that he will end up in Downing Street for another five years.' But addressing the issue of the SNP's potential gains in May, Mr Cameron reportedly said the idea with the nationalists linked up with Labour would be 'very worrying'. He told the BBC: 'In Scotland, a lot of people vote SNP, they will definitely ally with Labour, and I think it is very worrying that you could have a Labour government propped up by a party that actually want to abolish our country.'","SNP are on course for a landslide general election victory in Scotland .

Obamacare dominated the headlines earlier this year when the U.S. suffered a federal shutdown over the health reform plans. Another popular word that the poll claimed was overused in the press was T-Bone, a word used to describe a layout of a car accident.

"You might have seen incredible images of coral before, but you've never seen anything like this. PhD student Daniel Stoupin from the University of Queensland, Australia has spent months photographing and filming supposedly 'slow' marine animals like coral and sponges, and the results will blow you away. Using time-lapse photography, he shows how these seemingly stationary underwater marvels come to life under high magnification, highlighting remarkable details and behaviours that scientists around the world still don't fully understand. Scroll down for the full video . Stoupin took 150,000 shots with high-end cameras and lenses to create beautiful time-lapses of marine life . By . stitching the images together, Stoupin was able to show how corals and . sponges we think as stationary come to life over time in weird and . wonderful ways . Although they play a crucial role in Earth's biosphere, we know very little about this rather sedate marine life . It took over nine months for Stoupin to film the corals and sponges in marine aquarium tanks. While he didn't disclose the full price of the endeavour, Stoupin did say that it cost 'way more' than a few thousand dollars. 'I love marine life, especially invertebrates and I always . look for something new to observe, film, or photograph,' Stoupin tells MailOnline. 'When I . got my first chance to focus my macro lens on a coral I realised that I want to . know more about these magnificent creatures, their colours and their life. 'Once I started photographing corals more often, pursuing time lapses was . inevitable.' Despite filming the marine life in . enclosed tanks and having friends in the industry, Stoupin says he does . not endorse the activities of commercial coral collectors and hopes the . video allows people to appreciate the value of such life in the Great . Barrier Reef in Australia and elsewhere. 'My techniques are too complex to be performed under water,' says Stoupin, 'especially focus . stacking where any vibrations or swell would ruin the super-macro shot. 'Focus . stacking is the technique that gave the most spectacular results and allowed me . to capture incredible amount of detail. 'That's why I had to look for help among . people whose activities I do not endorse - aquarists and commercial coral . collectors. 'Marine aquarium industry is quite large here in Australia and a lot . of people create artificial reefs at home. 'So, all filming was done in tanks . and due to my position I did not buy a single coral or live rock, I did not keep a . tank at home or in anyway contribute to the industry. I tried to film freshly . collected animals before they are sold and shipped to other countries to be put . in private tanks.' Up close you can see some of the incredible details on various pieces of coral and sponges . Here a coral known as a fungia can be seen excavating itself from sand and silt, which piles on top of it over time . The Great Barrier Reef covers 1,429 miles and is so large it can be seen from outer space. Marine . creatures include 600 types of soft and hard corals, more than 100 . species of jellyfish, 3000 varieties of molluscs, 500 species of worms, . 1625 types of fish, 133 varieties of sharks and rays, and more than 30 . species of whales and dolphins. It extends south from the northern tip of Queensland in north-eastern Australia to just north of Bundaberg. The reef is an at risk World Heritage listed site that UNESCO believes could become an 'in danger' later this year. A lot of interesting aspects of coral and sponge biology can be seen in the gorgeous time-lapses. Some of the events happen over long periods of time, such as at night when some corals open up and extend their tentacles. 'A fun part to watch is seeing how brittle stars . clean sponges,' says Stoupin. 'Brittle stars are relatives of sea stars and sea urchins. 'They . have long flexible arms with which they can collect random stuff sediments that . fall on sponge surface. 'I did not know about such symbiosis until I saw it . it in my time lapses and then read it in a research paper after looking up for . information.' Stoupin's is all the more impressive as he had to juggle taking the shots with being a PhD student. The longest part he says was processing the images. 'Often I had to wait days to process a sequence to realize that I've . done mistakes and had to do it over. 'One frame could easily take more than 10 . minutes of processing time.' The groundbreaking video reveals some unknown aspects of the deep blue sea that we are yet to understand . Stoupin hopes the video will serve as a reminder as to how precious and wonderful reefs like the Great Barrier Reef are . Each frame of the video was a 'stack' consisting of three to 12 shots, with the in-focus areas merged to highlight aspects of the coral and sponges . With the video Stoupin says he hopes to show a unique perspective of the Great Barrier Reef and attract attention to the problems that it is facing. 'Australian government approved . industrialisation of the area that will have devastating consequences. 'Ignoring . these problems and creating artificial reefs at homes instead of protecting the . reef is, unfortunately, is very common. 'Watching the marine aquarium industry . from inside during the filming process made me extremely concerned about . priorities of those who often claim themselves to be reef lovers.'","A PhD student from the University of Queensland, Australia has put together an incredible video of coral life .

"Surrounded by barbed wire, sandbags and mud, these winding trenches are barely distinguishable from those occupied by soldiers fighting in the First World War a century ago. The two dugouts have been painstakingly recreated by a dedicated group of volunteers as part of a battlefield they built outside Chauconin-Neufmontiers, a town southeast of Paris. Yesterday, dozens of volunteers dressed in military uniform stormed the site in a reenactment of the First Battle of the Marne - which took place 100 years ago this weekend. The two dugouts have been painstakingly recreated by a dedicated group of volunteers in a field outside Chauconin-Neufmontiers, a town southeast of Paris . For the last four months the group, many of whom had parents who served in the war, have spent time preparing the battlefield, made up of one German and one French trench . The volunteers' designs for the battlefield were based on military plans that were recovered - which were carefully followed to ensure historical accuracy . The conflict marked the turning point in Germany's advance on Paris in 1914. For the last four months the group, many of whom had parents who served in the war, have spent time preparing the battlefield, made up of one German and one French trench. Their designs were based on military plans that were recovered - which were carefully followed to ensure historical accuracy, according to blog Histoire et Collection. They thought of every last detail - making sure the sandbags are punctured with bullet holes, and that the crosses in a nearby 'cemetery' have names marked on them. Recycled materials - including logs and bedsheets - were used to build the battlefield, which also includes an infirmary and cemetery. One resourceful volunteer also cut a tennis net, which serves as barbed wire. The volunteers - a number of whom were local farmers - even built a plane, the German Iron Cross painted in black on the tail, that is partially buried in the ground - as if it had been shot down in battle. Visitors and schoolchildren have been given the opportunity to visit the reconstruction for free every weekend in September. The volunteers said that they wanted members of the public to step back 100 years and put themselves in the shoes of soldiers caught up in bloody trench warfare.

"Last month, stars including Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton and Downton Abbey's Jessica Brown Findlay had personal naked images and videos splashed across the internet by an American hacker. But the very public embarrassment of these female celebrities has done nothing to curb the number of young people increasingly sharing nude selfies over text, email or the phone app Snapchat. A new survey shows that 38 per cent of 18-24 year olds have shared an inappropriate selfie. But parents are blissfully unaware of the current trend for x-rated snaps - in the same survey by My Voucher Codes, only 13 per cent of mothers and fathers across the UK believed their child would ever share a nude photo with friends or partners. A new survey shows that 38 per cent of 18-24 year olds have shared an inappropriate selfie (posed by model) The obvious reason for the lack of awareness among middle-aged men and women is that very few adults share naked pictures of themselves. In the same poll, only eight per cent of 45-54 year-olds admitted to taking a nude selfie, while the craze is even less prevalent in pensioners - only two per cent of those questioned who were aged 65 and over admitted to having a photo of themselves in the buff on their mobile phone. The most enlightened parents in the UK appeared to come from Northern Ireland, with 25 per cent of those questioned believing that their child would take a naked picture - they were almost spot on as 26 per cent of 18-24 year olds revealed they had done so. Scottish young adults were the least likely to take their clothes off for a photo, with only 12 percent admitting to it, while the figure was 38 per cent in England. Jennifer Lawrence (left) and Kate Upton (right) have both been recent victims of a hacker who uploaded naked images of them to the internet . These statistics show that parents are still unaware of their children's behaviour online, despite repeated attempts by children's charities over the last five years to warn mothers and fathers of the dangers of sexting. The NSPCC warns that the practice is illegal for anyone under the age of 16 and by sending the image a child is liable to be prosecuted for producing and distributing child abuse images. They also advise that young girls or boys sending naked pictures are opening themselves up to the chance of blackmail and bullying. Children's charity ChildLine warns that young people are taking huge risks by taking and sending the sexual images, and warned that some were being driven to the brink of suicide after the photos became widely shared. Young people are taking huge risks by taking and sending the sexual images, opening themselves up to bullying and blackmail from peers (posed by models) One teenager, 17-year-old James, told the charity: 'Sexting is pretty normal at my age. It seems like everyone's doing it.' James said he still engaged in sexting despite the dangers. 'I do worry about who is behind the phones of the people I sext with - obviously if you don't know the person in real life there's no guarantee they are who they say they are,' he added. ChildLine director, Peter Liver, said the rise of classroom sexting was linked, in part, to the widespread availability of porn online.","The Welsh are most likely in the UK to send nude photos to friends .

"Nasa's New Horizons spacecraft has captured stunning images of two of Pluto's moons on its approach to the dwarf planet. Nix and Hydra are visible in images taken from a distance of 115 million miles (186 million km), revealing the best-ever view of them. These are the first of a series of long-exposure images that will improve our understanding of the Plutonian system. Scientists in Colorado have revealed new images of the Pluto system. In the images (shown) the tiny moons Nix (highlighted in the orange diamond) and Hydra (yellow) can be seen orbiting. The bright and dark streak extending to the right of Pluto is an artifact of the camera electronics, resulting from overexposure . The moons are two of the five known to be orbiting Pluto - the others being Charon, Styx and Kerberos. In July this year New Horizons will become the first spacecraft ever to visit Pluto. It was launched on 19 January 2006 at a speed of 36,373 mph (58,536 km/h) - the fastest spacecraft ever to leave Earth orbit, 100 times faster than a jetliner . After passing the orbits of all the major planets from Earth to Neptune, New Horizons is now beginning its final leg of its 3 billion-mile (4.8 billion km) journey. On 14 July 2015 the flyby of Pluto will begin. Using a suite of instruments, the spacecraft will map the surface of Pluto and its moon Charon to a resolution of 25 miles (40km) - far better than anything possible before. This will reveal the surface features of Pluto - which may include ice. As it flies past, it will also look back at the two bodies against the sun, to look for telltale signs of an atmosphere. Despite the long journey, New Horizons will be travelling at such a speed that the flyby will last only around two hours - beginning at 11.49am GMT (06.49am EST) on 14 July and ending just after 2.15pm GMT (9.15am EST). After passing Pluto, New Horizons will flyby one or several Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), other bodies beyond the orbit of Pluto. The mission will officially end in 2026. Charon is by far the largest, just over half the size of Pluto, while the others are much, much smaller. Pluto measures about 1,470 miles (2,370km) across, whereas Nix and Hydra are each between 25 to 95 miles (40 to 150km) across - although their precise sizes won't be known until New Horizons gets closer. 'It's thrilling to watch the details of the Pluto system emerge as we close the distance to the spacecraft's July 14 encounter,' said New Horizons science team member Dr John Spencer, from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. 'This first good view of Nix and Hydra marks another major milestone, and a perfect way to celebrate the anniversary of Pluto's discovery.' These images were taken almost exactly 85 years after the discovery of Pluto by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh in 1930. In a tribute to the discoverer of the dwarf planet, and also the region at the edge of the solar system known as the Kuiper belt, some of his ashes are travelling on board the New Horizons spacecraft. 'Professor Tombaugh's discovery of Pluto was far ahead its time, heralding the discovery of the Kuiper Belt and a new class of planet,' said Dr Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator, also from the Southwest Research Institute. 'The New Horizons team salutes his historic accomplishment.' The moons can be seen here orbiting Pluto. Hydra (in yellow), Pluto's outermost known moon, orbits Pluto every 38 days at a distance of approximately 40,200 miles (64,700 km), while Nix (in orange) orbits every 25 days at a distance of 30,260 miles (48,700 km) In July this year New Horizons will become the first spacecraft ever to visit Plut (illustration shown). It was launched on 19 January 2006 at a speed of 36,373 mph (58,536 km/h) - the fastest spacecraft ever to leave Earth orbit, 100 times faster than a jetliner . Pluto is an extremely distant world, orbiting the sun more than 29 times farther than Earth. It is about two thirds the size of our moon. With a surface temperature estimated to be -229°C (-380°F), the environment at Pluto is far too cold to allow liquid water on its surface. Pluto's moons are also in the same frigid environment. The moon Charon is almost half the size of Pluto. The moon is so big that Pluto and Charon are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system. The distance between them is 12,200 miles (19,640 km). Charon's orbit around Pluto takes 6.4 Earth days. Charon neither rises nor sets, but hovers over the same spot on Pluto's surface. The same side of Charon always faces Pluto - this is called tidal locking. Compared with most of the planets and moons, the Pluto-Charon system is tipped on its side. The discovery of these two moons fairly late, though, in June 2005, has led some to worry that there may be other either smaller moons in orbit around Pluto, which could pose a problem for New Horizons as it flies past the dwarf planet on 14 July. These latest images were assembled into a seven-frame movie, revealing the spacecraft's first extended look at Hydra and its first-ever view of Nix. The images were made using the Lorri (Long Range Reconnaissance Imager) camera on New Horizons, but as they are so small and dark they were fairly hard to spot. Nix and Hydra were discovered by New Horizons team members in Hubble Space Telescope images taken in 2005. Hydra, Pluto's outermost known moon, orbits Pluto every 38 days at a distance of approximately 40,200 miles (64,700 km), while Nix orbits every 25 days at a distance of 30,260 miles (48,700 km). Pluto's two other small moons, Styx and Kerberos, are still smaller and too faint to be seen by New Horizons at its current range to Pluto; they will become visible in the months to come. And on 14 July at 11.49am GMT (6.49am EST), New Horizons will make its historic flyby of the Plutonian system - although owing to the large distances involved, we won't know for a few hours how successful the mission was as the signals make their way back to earth. This image, taken by Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope, shows five moons orbiting the distant, icy dwarf planet Pluto. Styx (initially designated P5), is the innermost of the moons found by Hubble over the past seven years. This image was taken with Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 on 7 July 2012 . New Horizons will pass within 6,200 miles (10,000km) of Pluto, revealing our best ever view of the dwarf planet and its surrounding system. In this illustration Pluto is on the left, and its large moon Charon - which is half the size of Pluto - is on the right .","Scientists in Colorado have revealed new images of the Pluto system .

"Siblings of the man murdered by Jodi Arias tearfully told a jury on Thursday how they are still haunted by his killing six years ago, recounting a litany of nightmares, stomach ulcers and depression brought on by the loss of their beloved family member. The family members gave their emotional impact statements to the Phoenix jury that is deciding whether the 34-year-old Arias should get the death penalty or a life sentence in the 2008 killing of Travis Alexander. He was shot and stabbed in his shower by Arias in what prosecutors described as a jealous rage after he wanted to break off their relationship and see other people. Arias says it was self-defense. Scroll Down for Video . Agony: Tanisha Sorenson broke down as she told the court today that losing her brother was like losing her best friend during her impact statement . In court today: Jodi Arias looks on during her sentencing phase retrial  at Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix. She has been found guilty of first degree murder in the death of former boyfriend Travis Alexander . Emotional: Steven Alexander, brother of murder victim Travis Alexander, reads a statement to the jury today . Jodi Arias consults with her defense team during her sentencing phase retrial on Thursday October 30 . Judge Sherry Stephens ruled that the courtroom must be cleared of everyone except for the victims and defendants' families for the victim impact statements . Steven Alexander described nightmares, ulcers and constant trauma from losing his brother, including locking the doors when he showers. He even said he suffers nightmares in which Jodi Arias slits his throat. Alexander's brother and sister each spoke for 15 minutes and gave prepared speeches. Tanisha Sorenson said that she and her family have been through agony in the days since her brother's death. She described the depression she slipped into and called him her 'best friend.' Tanisha called it a 'living hell' and revealed to the court she can still see her brother's decomposing body that she saw in court pics - especially the image of Alexander's dead body slumped over in the shower.' 'When I lay down at night, all I can think about is my brother's murder,' Steven Alexander said as other family members could be heard crying in the gallery. A jury last year convicted Arias of murder but deadlocked on whether she should be sentenced to life in prison or death. A new jury was seated to decide the punishment again. The defense is expected to begin its case later Thursday. Decision: Jodi Arias sits next to her attorney Jennifer Willmott (left) during the sentencing phase of her retrial at Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix on Tuesday . The family statements came after several days of prosecution testimony, primarily by the Mesa detective who investigated the case and interrogated Arias. Jurors also saw gruesome crime-scene photos and heard an X-rated phone call between Arias and the victim in the weeks before the killing. Much of the testimony and evidence was a repeat from the original trial, which attracted a global following as it was televised live. The retrial is not being broadcast live, however. The retrial opened a week ago with prosecutors telling jurors the Arizona murderer deserves the harshest sentence of them all. Calm: Jodi Arias, stands next to her attorney Jennifer Willmott (left) just before the jury enters the courtroom after a brief recess during the sentencing phase of her retrial on Tuesday . 'The only just punishment in this case is death,' Juan Martinez told the Maricopa County Superior Court. Arias had her hair cut to shoulder-length for her return to the courtroom and appeared to have it dyed darker. She has also been wearing a new pair of nude-framed glasses - perhaps because earlier this month, a Phoenix food bank auctioned off the glasses she wore at the original trial and raised close to $1,000 for charity. Last week defense lawyer Kirk Nurmi began opening statements, telling jurors it was up to them to write the final chapter to the story. The jury had been warned that it would see graphic evidence about the killing and relationship between Arias and victim Travis Alexander - but he said she should not be executed because she is mentally ill. Prosecutor Martinez proved his point by showing jurors a picture of Arias' victim, ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander, with his throat slit. 'This is how much she loved him,' Martinez told the jury, according to ABC. The victims' siblings were in court today along with Arias' parents and brother. Arias was convicted of murder last year but the first jury was deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty or life in prison. That required a new jury and trial to decide her punishment. Jodi Arias was found guilty of the murder of Travis Alexander in 2008 after slitting his throat so deeply she nearly decapitated him and shooting him in the forehead . A new jury that was picked over the past several weeks will listen as the former waitress tries to make another case that her life should be spared. Four hundred people were called as prospective jurors. Many of them were cut after they said they either made up their minds about the case or knew too much to be impartial. Some jurors cited their objection to the death penalty. They won't consider whether or not she's guilty - that's already been decided. The retrial is expected to last into December. Arias left the body of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander in his shower where friends found him days later at his suburban Phoenix home. Crime scene pictures from the first trial (pictured) revealed the brutal nature of the killing . Left for days: Alexander was left in this shower, for around five days before friends found his decaying body . Arias stabbed and slashed Alexander nearly 30 times, slit his throat so deeply she nearly decapitated him and shot him in the forehead. She left his body in his shower where friends found him about five days later at his suburban Phoenix home. She acknowledged she killed Alexander, but claimed it was self-defense after he attacked her. Prosecutors said it was premeditated murder carried out in a jealous rage after the victim wanted to end their affair and planned a trip to Mexico with another woman. Weeks after Arias was convicted, the jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on her punishment. Her attorneys have since sought, unsuccessfully, to dismiss the death penalty as an option.","Travis Alexander's brother and sister each gave 15-minute prepared statements to court .

"A transparent futuristic kayak, which makes it look like its rowers are floating on water, is being promoted as the ideal way to take your encounters with sea creatures to a new level. The space-age vessel is available now for any nature enthusiasts who wish to paddle and fully immerse themselves in the beautiful surroundings around them. Kayaks have been given an innovative transparent design by Seattle based company Clear Blue Hawaii. Unique design: The Molokini kayak produced by Clear  Blue Hawaii boasts a stylish and functional design . The kayaks come with varying policarbonate panels which are made entirely of a clear plastic giving the paddler a crystal clear view. It has been developed from the same policarbonate material which is used in fighter jet canopies and bulletproof glass. But you'll need deep pockets, the Molokini kayak costs £1,654.20 ($2,683.65). Tests for the unique and stylish looking kayak by developers Clear Blue Hawaii have included encounters with coral farms, nocturnal underwater sea life and pods of dolphins. Clear Blue Hawaii have promoted the two passenger policarbonate clear kayak as an ideal product for exploring oceanic areas with plentiful marine life and sea creatures. Open water: The kayak gives paddlers an opportunity to explore the open water like never before . Great views: Paddlers can enjoy views of up to 75 feet below the surface of the water in the kayaks . The kayak is completely clear and transparent  apart from the ergonomically designed seats and the stability system. In clear waters it is possible to see up to 75 feet below the surface of the water. Those depths of 75 feet plus were visible when successful tests were undertaken during the development stage of the kayak. Having the opportunity to gaze downwards into the ocean in the clear bottom sea kayak gives paddlers a fantastic opportunity to discover additional marine life and explore areas of the sea which might otherwise remain a mystery. Tests: During testing coral farms,  underwater sea life and pods of dolphins were viewed in the kayaks . The hull is visually stunning and the  timeless design of the accessories add a sophisticated feel while the curves give the kayak an attractive appearance. The Molokini kayak  is recommended for use in calm ocean conditions. The company has developed an improved tracking system which is an significant advantage during long distance paddling. The science which makes this innovative plastic possible is a Lexan product, a policarbonate, which holds out water. The innovative developers ignored some concerns from investors, who claimed the Molokini kayak was an affluent niche product, to create an exciting and visually stunning kayak which is certainly original. Other kayaks: Clear Blue Hawaii also develop a multitude of other kayaks and accessories .","Clear kayak gives paddlers a unique opportunity to view marine life .

"Worker ants change job as they age, a new study has found. Biologists tagged every worker in six colonies and used a computer to track their movements. A photograph was taken every half a second over a period of six weeks and from this the scientists found that the workers fell into three separate social groups. Scroll down for video . Swiss Scientists have discovered that ant society has a complex system that assigns jobs according to age . Researchers were also able to monitor how ants of varying ages interacted with each other within a colony . There are more than 10,000 different species of ant. Female ants work to maintain the colony but the male's role is solely to reproduce with with queen ant. After he has fulfilled his purpose, he dies. Some species of ant can carry more than 50 times their own body weight. The total weight of all ants on the planet is roughly equal to the weight of all humans currently alive. Ants have existed since the Cretaceous period, more than 130 million years ago. The ants that nursed the queen and the young tended to be young, slightly older ants were responsible for cleaning the colony and the third group of ants, usually the oldest, foraged for food outside the colony. The six-year project by scientists at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, accumulated the largest ever data of ant interactions. Professor Laurent Keller, the university’s Director of Ecology and Evolution, said: 'It was a very challenging task to tag all the ants. We pasted code bars on to each of them and a picture was taken every half a second. ‘The life expectancy of an ant is about one year and we knew the age of every single ant. ‘We found that around a third of the workers were nurses, which almost always stayed with the queen and eggs. Another third were cleaners and the rest were foragers, collecting food outside the colony. Tricky: Scientists admitted that tagging the ants with computerised barcodes was a laborious process . Tribal: Researchers discovered that ants only socialised within their job groups . ‘We also found that they tend to graduate from one group to another as they age, although the career changes were not clear-cut. We did find very old nurses and young foragers. ‘We also found that the ants interacted mostly with workers from the same group. They don’t try to interact with workers from another group. Even if the colony’s entrance and brood chamber were close together, the study showed that nurses and foragers stick to their own company and seldom mix. The team reared six colonies of carpenter ants and tagged each worker with a unique barcode. The colonies – comprising about 150 ants – lived in flat enclosures and were filmed by overhead cameras. A computer recognised the tags and recorded each individual’s position twice a second. It is not yet clear how they know when and how to adapt, but the study's findings suggest there is now evidence to show they communicate using hormones and their antenna. Honeybees go through similar transitions from young nurses to older foragers, but this study provides the clearest evidence yet that ants do the same. Professor Keller said: ‘Like bees, we have now shown that ants’ behaviour changes with age.’","Swiss experts have discovered complex hierarchy of jobs according to age .
They also discovered that ants only socialise within their career groups .
Previously such behaviour had only been observed in honey bees ."
"A heroic Utah step-father has rescued his five-year-old step-daughter from the clutches of a brazen kidnapper who had snatched her from her own bed in the middle of the night. The man awoke to find Troy Morley, 46, carrying his daughter across his front lawn at 4.30 this morning in quiet Sandy, Utah, police say. 'What are you doing, that’s my daughter, you’re not taking her!' the father screamed. Scroll down for video . Home safe and sound: The five-year-old victim of an attempted kidnapping rests safely with her mother after a home intruder snatched her out of her bed Friday morning . Troy Morley, 46, is seen here being led in the jail after he was released from the hospital Friday afternoon. He was bitten on the shoulder by a police dog before his arrest . Police say Morley had been wandering through the neighborhood trying to find open doors and windows to break into a home. He entered the house through an unlocked side door . Morley, who is 5-foot-11 and 250lbs, put the girl down without struggle. He fled and was eventually caught in another house after a police canine bit him on the shoulder. On Friday night, the 911 call made by the girl's mother was released by KSL.com. In the footage, the terrified woman can be heard telling the dispatcher: 'There was a man in my home and he took my five-year-old daughter. 'And I happened to wake up and he had my daughter outside, and my husband ran out there and got him. But he took my five-year-old daughter.' The family say that they've never seen Morley before and they have no idea what he planned to do with the little girl if he had escaped with her. Incident has evoked haunting echoes of when 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart was snatched out of her Salt Lake City bedroom in 2002. She was held captive for nine months by Mormon street preacher Brian David Mitchell before she was found and rescued. Mugshot: This February 2012 booking photo shows Troy M. Morley who  was arrested Friday, November 7, 2014, after he allegedly tried to snatch a five-year-old girl from her bed . The suspect in this case entered the home through an unlocked side door in the middle-class suburb south of Salt Lake City, Police Sergeant Dean Carriger said. The intruder was in the family's basement rummaging through their belongings  when he came upon the girl sleeping in her bedroom, Carriger said. The suspect took her out of bed and carried her upstairs. The father told police that he awoke to the sound of creaking stairs and the front door being unlocked and opened. Neighbors told the Deseret News that they heard the girl screaming 'No! No! No!' as Morley tried to carry her away. Troy Morley allegedly broke into this house in quiet Sandy, Utah, by slipping in through an unlocked window. Once inside, he found a 5-year-old girl, whom he tried to abduct, police say . After Morley fled, officers set up a perimeter, and with the help of police dogs, launched a search. The suspect went into a second home, where the residents heard him and called police. Police captured Morley, shirtless, outside that second home thanks to a police dog that bit the suspect in the upper shoulder, Carriger said. Police don't know yet why the suspect was in the house, whether he knew the girl was there when he broke in or if he had a planned to take her, Carriger said. Morley's last known address was in Roy, Utah, 45 miles north of Sandy. He has two two drunk driving arrests from 2009 and 2011 but no other significant Utah criminal history, the Deseret News reports. He has been through two divorces in the last four years - once in 2010 and the second was finalized just last month after he filed for divorce in June. Morley is still at the hospital receiving medical treatment for the dog bite but is expected to be arrested later Friday and booked on charges of child kidnapping and burglary. Carriger said the family is doing pretty well considering what happened. They have declined to speak to reporters. 'It obviously was a very scary, traumatic situation,' Carriger said. 'The sanctity of our home is huge and for somebody to enter that and grab your child, it's got to be one of the worst nightmares a parent could face. . . If those parents were not awakened to go out and investigate, he could have easily left undetected with the girl.'","Troy Morley slipped into the home in quiet Sandy, Utah, at 4.30am by climbing in an unlocked door, police say .

"This is the moment a thrill-seeking motorcyclist was given a stern talking-to by a mounted policeman after pulling a wheelie at 60mph in central London. Revving the engine of his Suzuki GSXR, the unnamed driver filmed himself speeding along the Sqaure Mile with a GoPro, attached to his helmet, before raising his front wheel with the speedometer in clear view. His antics were brought to an abrupt halt by two mounted policeman, one of whom insisted he record the telling-off as a warning to other motorists. The driver films himself performing a wheelie at 67mph on a central London road. Unbeknownst to him, two mounted police officers lie in wait ahead . On approach to the two uniformed officers, one can be heard telling the driver to turn off his motorcycle's roaring engine. 'Why do you think you've been stopped?' the officer asks, to which the unnamed motorcyclist replies in a foreign accent: 'Because my wheel went a bit up?' 'You're pulling a wheelie and recording it on that (pointing to the driver's helmet). 'You're in a 20mph speed limit.' Claiming he was travelling at 22mph maximum, the driver is then quietened by the officer, a motorcyclist himself. 'I don't think so. 'Don't give me any of your old flannel.

"Sir Bob Geldof swore twice at critics of his new Band Aid 30 single - dismissing their comments as 'complete b******s' on live TV. The Band Aid organiser, whose latest version of Do They Know It's Christmas? has already topped the iTunes singles chart, made the remark during an interview today. The 63-year-old was pulled off air after he ignored two warnings over his use of 'colourful' language when speaking out against his detractors. Scroll down for video . Lashed out: Speaking in an interview on Sky News with journalist Jayne Secker (left) this afternoon, Sir Bob Geldof (right) said those who criticised the charity single, which was released today, were talking 'b******s' Sir Bob spoke out after a Sky News reporter asked him for his views on claims that the song's star-studded lineup could raise money by paying their taxes 'in the right way'. Jayne Secker said: 'A lot of detractors are saying, look at a lot of those people in that room, a lot of wealthy people, if they all paid their taxes in the right way, we wouldn't need these kinds of fundraising singles.' When asked for his comments, Geldof said: 'I think they are all talking b******s'. Ms Secker then asked what his response was to comments made by journalist Ian Burrell, who called the song 'trite' and 'patronising' and said that it would raise 'comparative pittance' for charity. Debut: Single Do They Know It's Christmas? was played for the first time on the X Factor. Organiser Sir Bob Geldof introduced the track, before showing a video of the song's star-studded recording session (above) Charity: Sir Bob Geldof joined X Factor Host Dermot O'Leary for Sunday night's live results show. He urged viewers to buy the single, released today, which he organised in response to the ongoing Ebola crisis . Geldof responded: 'Complete load of b******s'. The interview was then cut off as Ms Secker had twice warned him about his 'colourful' language after his first outburst. It comes after he announced this morning that Do They Know It's Christmas? had raised more than £1million within minutes of its TV premiere last night. This morning, Geldof said that sales had 'gone manic' after the new version of Do They Know It's Christmas? was played for the first time on the X Factor. Stars including Bono, Chris Martin and One Direction were among the artists who gathered to record a reworked version of the hit charity single in response to the Ebola crisis. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Geldof said: 'It's gone manic. That's the digital age. 'We promoted the single on X Factor, Simon Cowell gave us five minutes of the show last night. Within four or five minutes of leaving the show we had a million quid. That's extraordinary. 'From what we're seeing now from iTunes it's gone bonkers. The pre-orders of the thing were ridiculous.' As soon as the song premiered on X Factor, it became the most trending topic on Twitter worldwide - with users using #BandAid30 to share their thoughts. Standing ovation: X Factor judges Louis Walsh, Mel B, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Simon Cowell stood up to applaud the song's premiere. Within five minutes of leaving the show, the song had raised £1million . Premiere: A clip from the video showed U2 frontman Bono in the recording studio. The new track marks the 30th anniversary of the song, which was originally put together to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia . The £1million was raised through a combination of pre-sales on iTunes and text donations. On the show, viewers were told they could text AID to 70060 to give £5. Chancellor George Osborne has agreed to waive VAT on the single's sales, to focus proceeds on the charity effort, and iTunes said it is waiving its fees. The new recording of Do They Know It's Christmas marks the 30th anniversary of the song, which was originally put together to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. The new Band Aid line-up includes 11 musicians who have never had a UK number one single – a stark contrast to the original group that included members of Bananarama, Duran Duran and Status Quo. The new cohort does have 28 number ones between them, but half of these come from veteran stars Bono, 54, Midge Ure, 61, Queen drummer Roger Taylor, 65, and Sir Bob, 63. Members of the bands Bastille, Elbow and Underworld, as well as artists including Emeli Sande, 27, Paloma Faith, 33, and Jessie Ware, 30, are all taking part despite having never had a single top the UK charts. In demand: Sales of the song on iTunes have gone 'bonkers', Sir Bob Geldof said today. The charity single features a number of acts including boyband One Direction, seen above in a clip from the X Factor video . Pledge: Sir Bob Geldof with X Factor host Dermot O'Leary (left) and singer Olly Murs, who performs on the track, on last night's show.

Above, Sir Bob Geldof (seen with Dermot O'Leary, left, and Olly Murs, right) receives a standing ovation from the judges . The new Band Aid 30 single is already at the top of the iTunes chart, after being released this morning . However, their luck might be about to change – as the power of the internet has allowed Do They Know It's Christmas? to climb the charts three weeks before it is even released. So many fans have pre-ordered a copy on Amazon that it has shot to second on the shopping website's list of most purchased singles. And while detailed sales figures are not expected to be available until later in the week, the track is likely to top the charts at the weekend. It has become the bookies' favourite to clinch the Christmas number one. If it does take the number one spot this weekend, it will knock the official BBC Children In Need single, sung by Gareth Malone's All Star Choir, from the top of the UK charts. It's not only the line-up that has changed since Band Aid first released Do They Know It's Christmas? in 1984. The lyrics have also been altered to reflect the ebola crisis. The original line 'Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears' has been replaced with 'Where a kiss of love can kill you and there's death in every tear'. Speaking today, Geldof said that further international versions are also to be recorded. He continued: 'The Germans go into bat today, I have asked the Germans to do the German version and I have asked Carla Bruni to do it in France, to translate it into French, so they're going next.' Geldof has called the track 'a little bit of pop history' and said it delivered a powerful message about the urgent need to fight the virus, estimated to have killed more than 5,000 people in West Africa. He was also critical today about the response from some national governments. Future hit: Detailed sales figures are not expected to be available until later this week but the track is likely to top the charts at the weekend and is the bookies' favourite for Christmas No. 1. Above, Rita Ora in the video . International push: Versions of the song are also to be recorded in Germany and France, Sir Bob Geldof said today. Above, singer Ed Sheeran performs in the music video that was played on X Factor last night . He continued: ''The Germans aren't doing enough, frankly. Obviously the French have sent their troops to help in Guinea and of course the British, the squaddies are down in Sierra Leone.' 'The Germans are the most powerful economy in Europe. They are laggards and they shouldn't be. 'It's as dangerous for them as it is for us. This thing is a flight away from us.' The latest version of Do They Know It's Christmas, released today, has already raised more than £1million and is set to top the charts. If it does, it will become the fourth time the charity record has taken the number one spot. The original recording, which featured Bono, George Michael, Paul Weller, Boy George and Simon le Bon, was the biggest-selling single of all time in the UK when it was first released. It led to the successful Live Aid concerts in 1985, which raised around £150million for the fight against famine in Ethiopia. Since then, there have been two further charity recordings of the same track, Band Aid II in 1989 and Band Aid 20 in 2004, both of which also topped the charts. Band Aid II included contributions from Jason Donovan, Kylie Minogue, Bananarama and Sir Cliff Richard among others, while Band Aid 20 featured Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, Sir Paul McCartney and Dizzee Rascal . The 2004 version raised money for famine relief in the war ravaged Sudanese region of Darfur. Although it also reached Number 1, it sold just over one million copies, compared with the 3.5million sold by the original hit. Band Aid 20 was also criticised by the World Development Movement, which said many of the song lyrics were ‘patronising, false and out of date’. Sir Bob Geldof said he was spurred to mobilise today’s pop stars after seeing a brave nurse wipe away a tear from the cheek of a child dying of ebola. ‘The nurse forgot where she was, and what was happening, and wiped a tear from the child,’ said Sir Bob. ‘The child died and the nurse died. You can’t get more tragic than that.’ After this, Sir Bob – once disinclined to revisit Do They Know It’s Christmas after 30 years – was now utterly convinced of the need for a new version of the song. Fixed in his mind, as he rewrote some of the lyrics to the song with producer Midge Ure, was the image of the nurse wiping away the child’s tear. Now the line ‘Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears’ is replaced with ‘Where a kiss of love can kill you and there’s death in every tear’.","Sir Bob Geldof swore twice at those who branded the single ‘patronising’

"The official leading the investigation into missing Flight MH370 says he is 'confident' of finding the plane, but admitted the search could take a year. Angus Houston, a retired Australian Air Chief Marshal, said it was important that the search continues with 'urgency', ahead of a meeting to discuss operations next week. Mr Houston made the comments a day after the first official report into the disappeared plane revealed air traffic controllers did not notice MH370 was missing until 17 minutes after it vanished from radar. The report also showed officials did not dispatch a rescue team until almost four hours later - despite contacting staff in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. Scroll down for video . Angus Houston, the official in charge of the search for MH370, says he is 'confident' teams will find the aircraft . However, he warned passengers' relatives (file pic) that the search could take up to a year . The aerial search for floating debris has now been called off, but an underwater search is expected to take place in the area where, according to satellite data, officials believe the plane crashed. Officials from Australia, China and Malaysia will meet in Canberra next week to discuss how the search should take place. According to the BBC, Mr Houston said: 'That's a very important meeting because it will formalise the way ahead to ensure that this search continues with urgency and doesn't stop at any stage. 'The search will take probably in the order of eight months, maybe eight to 12 months if we have bad weather or other issues. Yesterday a month-old report was revealed by the Malaysian government under pressure from grieving families. Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein (right) said the release was in the interests of transparency . Report: Malaysian authorities have released the five-page document almost a month after it was finished . 'But we're totally committed to find MH370 and I'm confident that with an effective search we will eventually find the aircraft.' The preliminary report, written almost a month ago and dated April 9, was meant to stay confidential but the Malaysian Prime Minister bowed to demands of families who complained the government had not done enough and published it yesterday. The report confirms the plane disappeared from Malaysian radar at . 1.21 am on March 8 with 227 passengers and 12 crew on board, and no trace of it has been found since. It was passing into Vietnamese airspace, and should have been picked up by counterparts there. But the report reveals Vietnamese air traffic controllers only . queried about it with their Malaysian colleagues at 1.38am. The Malaysian authorities then contacted area control centres in Singapore, Hong Kong, Cambodia and an operations centre at Malaysia Airlines, and none could find any trace of the plane. Release: As well as the report, authorities have revealed this map showing possible flight paths . Standing down: Crews from several nations searching for MH370, pictured in Perth, were called off this week . But it took another four hours, until 5.30am local time, before a Rescue Coordination Centre in the Malaysian city of Kuala Lumpur was activated. The report said the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which sets worldwide standards, should discuss new methods of real-time tracking to ensure a huge passenger jet is never lost again. It said: 'While commercial air . transport aircraft spend considerable amounts of time operating over . remote areas, there is currently no requirement for real time tracking . of these. 'There have now . been two occasions during the last five years when large commercial air . transport aircraft have gone missing and their last position was not . accurately known. 'This uncertainty resulted in significant difficulty in locating the aircraft in a timely manner. 'Therefore, the Malaysian Air Accident Investigation Bureau makes [its] safety recommendation to the ICAO.' Delay: A passage of the report reveals how authorities waited until 5.30am local time before launching a search . Mystery: The report confirms authorities' belief that the plane flew either north or south when it vanished . As well as the five-page report the government released other information from the . investigation into the flight. It included audio recordings of . conversations between the cockpit and air traffic control, the plane's . cargo manifest and its seating plan. Malaysia . also released a map showing the plane's deducted flight path and . a document detailing actions taken by authorities in the hours after . the Boeing 777 disappeared from radar. Another report showed Malaysia Airlines at one point thought the plane, built in 2002, may have entered Cambodian airspace. The airline said in the report that 'MH370 was able to exchange signals with the flight and flying in Cambodian airspace,' but that Cambodian authorities said they had no information or contact with Flight 370. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak last week appointed a team of experts to review all the information the government had and decide what should be made public. Tragedy: The flight had 227 passengers and 12 crew including Fariq Hamid (left) and pilot Zaharie Ahmad . Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said today: 'The prime minister set, as a guiding principle, the rule that as long as the release of a particular piece of information does not hamper the investigation or the search operation, in the interests of openness and transparency, the information should be made public.' Hishammuddin said Malaysia's military radar tracked the jet making a turn-back in a westerly direction after playing back radar data the next morning, nearly seven hours after the plane vanished from civilian radar. He said he was informed about the military discovery two hours later and relayed this to Najib, who immediately ordered a search in the Strait of Malacca. He defended the military's inaction in pursuing the plane for identification. 'The aircraft was categorized as friendly by the radar operator and therefore no further action was taken at the time,' Hishammuddin said. The cargo manifest, meanwhile, includes a receipt for a package containing lithium ion batteries, noting that the package 'must be handled with care.' Disappeared: The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 which vanished almost two months ago without trace . Some questions had been raised in March about the batteries and whether they could explode. But Malaysia Airlines said then that they were in compliance with international requirements and classified as 'non-dangerous goods.' Meanwhile, Malaysia Airlines today advised relatives of passengers who were aboard Flight 370 to move out of hotels and return home to wait for news on the search for the plane. Since the jet disappeared, the airline has been putting the relatives up in hotels, where they have been briefed on the search. But the airline said today it would close its family assistance centers around the world by May 7, and that the families should receive search updates from 'the comfort of their own homes.' The airline said that it would establish family support centers in Kuala Lumpur and Beijing, and that it would keep in close touch with the relatives through means including phone calls and meetings. Malaysia Airlines also said it would soon make advanced compensation payments to the relatives. No wreckage from the plane has been found, and an aerial search for surface debris ended Monday after six weeks of fruitless hunting. An unmanned submarine is continuing to search underwater in an area of the southern Indian Ocean where sounds consistent with a plane's black box were detected in early April. Additional equipment is expected to be brought in within the next few weeks to scour an expanded underwater area. The head of the search effort has predicted that the search could drag on for as long as a year.","Officials meeting Australia next week to decide next phase of mission .

"Feeling the pressure to look good naked: The average British man will now spend £46.79 on beauty treatments to prepare for their first night of passion with a new partner . For modern men it takes a lot more than a comb of the hair and a clean shirt to make them feel prepared for a date. In fact, according to a survey carried out by msn.co.uk they are now spending more on beauty treatments than women to ensure they look their best. The poll of 2,000 Brits found that British men fork out an average of £46.79 on treatments including haircuts, back and pubic hair waxing, and even facials. They are most likely to spend this amount on a date which they expect to end in the bedroom. Women on the other hand spend an . average of £41.79 on things like hair removal, new bed linen and . lingerie if they believe sex is on the cards with a new man. More than half (55 per cent) said they . make the investment ahead of an anticipated first night of passion because it makes them feel confident and 23 per cent . believe society puts pressure on them to look good naked. Msn.co.uk relationship expert Dr Pam . Spurr said: 'It's fascinating that men are spending more on pre-date . preparation than women, but I do hear from many men that they feel the . pressure to impress their dates.' She added: 'It might also seem . surprising in times of recession that the average Brit bloke spends . nearly £50 simply getting ready for a 'hot date', with women not too far . behind. But there is enormous competition out there and so . psychologically it makes a singleton feel ready to put their best foot . forward.' Your place or mine? On average, men think the first night of passion should be after the third date but the majority of women want to wait till at least the fifth . The research found that men and women differ on when they think is the best time to have sex with a new partner. The majority of men believed three . dates was enough before slipping between the sheets while women said . they would want to wait till they've had least five dates. Both men and women agreed personality and self-confidence were turn ons but dirty sheets were a turn off. Men were particularly turned off by untamed body hair - such as facial hair or hairy legs - while women didn't like a man who was unshaved or in a bad outfit. Being more specific on what they found attractive about intimate areas, nearly half of the men (42 per cent) said they liked it is a woman had a 'Brazilian' while 34 per cent prefered a trim of the bikini line. Just one per cent said they liked vajazzling - the decorating of a woman's parts made famous by TV show The Only Way Is Essex. Meanwhile, nearly of the women, 45 per cent, said they liked a man to be 'ungroomed and very hairy' 'downstairs' while 38 per cent prefered them to be neatly trimmed. Just six per cent were attracted by the 'Columbian' (a full genital wax).","British men spend £46.79 on beauty treatments if they expect a date to end in the bedroom .

"The California man accused of planting drugs on the PTA president of his son's school and blamed it on his estranged wife won't be going to jail anytime soon. A judge in Orange County Superior Court called a mistrial in the case against Kent Easter, after the jury couldn't come to a decision. The seven-woman five-man jury started deliberations late Tuesday morning, but announced they were in deadlock on Wednesday. The judge sent them for the day in hopes of breaking the deadlock but today they were still undecided. The jury started off 8-3 in favor of guilt, and ended with 11-1 in favor of guilt. Scroll down for video . Charged: Jill Easter, 38, left, was sentenced to 120 days in jail for planting drugs in a PTA president's car. But her husband and alleged conspirator Kent Easter, 38, right, was temporarily off the hook today as a judge called a mistrial in his case . No reaction: Easter was emotionless in court today as the judge handed out the favorable ruling of a mistrial . Frustrated: Jury Foreman Gary Capozzoli talked about how frustrated he was with the mistrial and the fact that they couldn't convince one jury member to side with guilt . 'Personally, I'm very frustrated,' jury foreman Gary Capozzoli told KABC. 'The group of 11 felt firmly that guilt was there. And unfortunately the lone vote could not be convinced that that was the case.' Prosecutors have not yet decided if they want to retry Easter, but a pretrial hearing has been set for December 5. Easter's wife Jill was sentenced to 120 days in jail in a separate trial after pleading guilty. Easter and his now-estranged wife were accused of conspiring against Kelli Peters, a volunteer at Plaza Vista Elementary School which their son attended. It is alleged that the Easters conspired to frame Kelli Peters by putting Vicodin, Percocet, marijuana and a used marijuana pipe behind the front seat of her car. Victim: The duo sought revenge on Mrs Peters, pictured, because they believed the woman wasn't properly supervising their son, according to police, and resorted to extreme measures to get her fired - and imprisoned . Kent's attorney Tom Bienert told jurors that Jill planted the drugs in Peters’ car without her husband’s knowledge.  Jill Easter pleaded guilty to her part last month. The couple, both lawyers, were charged with conspiracy to procure false arrest, false imprisonment and conspiracy to falsely report a crime. Mrs Peters is a well-known school volunteer and the PTA president at Plaza Vista School. Prosecutors say the Easters disliked Peters because they felt she didn't properly supervise their son. The current allegations aren't the first time the couple had a run in with Peters. They sued Peters in March 2010 after she locked their son, then a first-grader, out of the school for less than 20 minutes. The case was dismissed. Out: Police said that on February 16, 2011, the Easters enacted a plan to get rid of Mrs Peters, who was the Parent Teacher's Association president at the Plaza Vista Elementary School, pictured . Facing charges: Kent and Jill Easter could be jailed for three years if they are convicted on all charges . Facing charges: Kent and Jill Easter could be jailed for three years if they are convicted on all charges . The couple were thought to be seeking revenge on Mrs Peters because of a longstanding feud over their son, according to police, and resorted to extreme measures to get her fired - and imprisoned. At one point, Jill Easter requested a restraining order against Mrs Peters, claiming she was psychotic and unstable. She alleged the school volunteer was harassing her son and had even threatened to kill her. She claimed that Ms Peters 'will stop at nothing to silence my son' and had been calling him psychotic and unstable to other parents. 'She is stalking me and attempting to intimidate me at my son's school and while I run errands in Irvine,' she alleged.The request for a restraining order was denied. The Easters are scheduled to be arraigned July 17. If convicted on all charges, they would face up to three years in prison.

"Sen. John Hoeven says Venezuela has released four missionaries from North Dakota who were detained several days ago. Hoeven says in a statement his office learned from pastor Bruce Dick of the Bethel Evangelical Free Church in Devils Lake that Venezuelan authorities released the missionaries Saturday. U.S. Embassy Press Director Glenn Guimond said the missionaries boarded a plane out of the country Saturday morning and would not be allowed back for two years. Missionaries from the Bethel Evangelical Free Church in Devils Lake say that Venezuelan authorities have released their missionaires . The missionaries were apparently detained Wednesday while working in conjunction with a church west of Caracas. They had been in the country for several days providing medical assistance. They've been making trips for several years. Hoeven's spokesman, Don Canton, says Dick confirmed the group was headed to nearby Aruba on Saturday. Dick didn't travel with the group. The New York Times reports that Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro had spoken out against what he believes were capitalist aggressors and especially the U.S. for the country's economic woes only hours after the missionaries were detained. Venezuela is going through recession, inflation, and a shortage of medicines and goods.","Missionaries  detained Wednesday while working in conjunction with a church west of Caracas .

"Armed robbers have been caught on CCTV trying to smash their way into a watch shop in a brutal heist using an axe and a sledgehammer, which ended in failure when the staff shut the security gates. The criminals attempted to bash into Watches of Switzerland using a moped, a sledgehammer and an axe after riding up to the shop on New Bond Street on a moped. One of the criminals also sprayed people with a noxious liquid, thought to be ammonia, which injured one of the guards in the store. The gang rolls up the pavement on New Bond Street, with one of the members disembarking and brandishing an axe, ready to hit the store's doors. One of the raiders (centre) appears to be pointing a handgun . Centre, the raider with the axe begins smashing at the shopfront, as the raider with the sledgehammer and what appears to be a handgun heads towards the doors . At about 11.05 am, the gang, consisting of six men on three mopeds, rode down from Oxford Street in London's West End toward the store. One of the mopeds mounted the pavement and headed toward the shop, while the other two followed shortly after they reached the junction on Derring Street. They rode up at speed, scatting passers by on the pavement. When they reached the store, the raiders rammed the door with a moped, and hit it with the axe and the sledgehammer repeatedly. One man took to spraying passers-by who got too close with the noxious liquid, eventually injuring a guard. When they realise they cannot get into the store as the staff have shut the stores security gates, they scramble around the opening to the store, warding off passers-by . The attempted criminals begin to make their escape, nearly knocking over several people on the way out of the street . One of the raiders is also believed to have been carrying a handgun throughout the raid, which can be seen in the CCTV images. Eventually the staff managed to operate the security shutters and lock the gang out, causing them to flee. As they fled on their three mopeds, they nearly knocked over members of the public. Nothing was stolen from the store, but the security guard is currently in hospital with potentially life-changing injuries, and several thousand pounds worth of damage was done to the store. The incident is being investigated by Flying Squad officers of the London Metropolitan Police based at Putney, in south west London.","Gang of six on three mopeds drove at West End store, ramming the doors .

"Two boys were rescued from an Indian sweat shop after watching an 11-year-old friend get clubbed to death by a fellow child worker. The 13-year-olds, who typically toiled from 8am to 10pm and then slept on the bangle factory floor, were ordered by bosses to cover up the crime after the attacker fled by washing away the blood. Deepak and Rajesh, whose names have been changed to protect their identities, were then trapped in a tiny room and forced to spend 24 hours with the bloody corpse and its smashed skull. Labour pain: Rajesh, left, and Deepak were ordered to wash the crime spot when another worker, aged 11, was allegedly murdered by another boy, who has since run away from the Delhi bangle factory where they worked . They and the seven other children trapped in the bangle workshop, based in a two-storey house in capital New Delhi, were only freed when neighbours heard cries and called the police. The pair, who earned just 1,000 . rupees - or £11 - a month, are now being looked after by a charity but . remain traumatised by their ordeal. ‘We would wake up at 8am and, only . after washing our faces, would start making bangles. Work ended by 10 at . night by when each of us made 25 packets of bangles,' said Rajesh. 'Barely able to move a muscle, we would fall asleep right where we worked.' He and Deepak, who are both from Kotla Bigha, a village 600 miles from Delhi, were sent by their parents to work at the sweat shop in the Jahagirpurni district in a bid to pay off their mounting debts. ‘How will my family survive if I don’t . send home money?’ asks Deepak, who speaks like an adult despite his young age. Suffering: Rajesh was sold by his parents to the sweat shop where he slept after toiling from morning till night . Deepak has seven brothers and sisters. His mother is blind and his father is an out-of-work contractor. His . 19-year-old sister is about to get married and the family is steeped in . debts. The pair made bangles with the victim . as well as the murderer. But the employer also manufactured polythene . bags in the same building and exploited seven other children in that . business. It was these children who were forced . to join Deepak and Rajesh and spend an horrific 24 hours with the body of . their friend, who authorities are calling Vinod in a bid to protect his . real identity. ‘We knew something was wrong. We never saw any children come out of the building,’ a resident said. Appalling: The bangle factory in New Delhi where the boys were each forced to make 25 packets a day . The . children who worked at the bangle factory are all aged below 14, and . India's Child Labour Act bars the employment of children below that age . in . hazardous works. According . to Rakesh Senger of NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan, which is looking after . the two children, the National Commission for Protection of Child . Rights, in an affidavit before the high court, had pledged to make . Jahangirpuri a child labour-free zone. ‘That was in 2009 and we’re still looking at a hub of unregulated . factories where many stories perhaps more heinous than those of Rajesh, . Deepak or Vinod remain untold,’ he said.","Boys watched in horror as friend was clubbed to death 'by fellow worker'

"A judge praised burglars for their ‘courage’ and claimed prison ‘very rarely does anybody any good’ as he allowed a serial intruder to walk free from court. Judge Peter Bowers said burglar Richard Rochford deserved to be jailed for two-and-a-half years but he decided to take an ‘extraordinary chance’ by not locking him up. Recognising the controversy he was  causing, the judge added: ‘I might get pilloried for it.’ Controversial: Judge Peter Bowers admitted he could be 'pilloried' for his . decision to let Richard Rochford go free after he admitted to a string . of burglaries . His astonishing comments were condemned . by victims of the burglar and follow a series of controversial remarks . by the same judge in previous cases. Rochford, 26, burgled three homes in East Cleveland and tried to burgle . another in the space of five days. He committed the crimes to feed a . drug addiction that started when he was in prison for another offence, . Teesside Crown Court was told. 'Serial burglar': Richard Rochford went on a burglary spree in February . Passing sentence, Judge Bowers told him: ‘It takes a huge amount of . courage as far as I can see for someone to burgle somebody’s house. I . wouldn’t have the nerve. ‘Yet somehow, bolstered by drugs and desperation, you were prepared to . do that.’ The judge added: ‘I think prison very rarely does anybody any . good. It mostly leaves people the chance to change their own mind if . they want to. I don’t think anybody would benefit from sending you to . prison today. We’d all just feel a bit easier that a burglar had been . taken off the streets.’ Rochford could have been jailed for two-and-a-half years but instead he . was given a suspended 12-month jail sentence, a two-year supervision . order with drug rehabilitation, 200 hours’ unpaid work and a one-year . driving ban. The offence was Rochford’s first burglary conviction, . although he was cautioned for burgling a home at the age of ten. He has . previously been jailed for three years for arson. Rochford went on a burglary spree in February. He took a laptop, satnav . and money from the first home he raided and drove away the family’s Ford . Focus car, which he damaged and abandoned. 'It takes a huge amount of courage as far as I can see for someone to burgle somebody's home. I wouldn't have the nerve' Judge Peter Bowers . The following night he took jewellery, a handbag and electrical items . from another home. His girlfriend Amy Kyme, 22, who acted as lookout and . helped dispose of the stolen goods, was given a suspended prison . sentence. Rochford walked into both unlocked homes while the owners . slept. He admitted two burglaries and asked for another burglary and an . attempted burglary to be taken into consideration. He also admitted . aggravated vehicle taking. Graham Brown, defending, told the court the drug habit Rochford . developed ‘scarred his life’ and ‘the system failed him’. He claimed the . petty crook had changed his ways. Mr Brown said Rochford had had a ‘major wake-up call,’ and had ‘seen the . light’. He confessed, co-operated with police and stopped using drugs, . the court heard. Rochford ransacked the home of Mark Clayton, 47, an Army veteran who . served in Afghanistan and Bosnia. Mr Clayton said the judge made a . ‘grave misjudgment’. Sentencing: Rochford was given a suspended 12-month jail sentence at Teesside Crown Court . He added: ‘Picking dead bodies up after they’ve been blown up, to go . into that takes courage. Walking into someone’s house on an . opportunistic whim and basically devastating someone’s life by taking . things that man has worked so hard for all his life, and taking it away . without a thought, isn’t courage.’ Mr Clayton said his son Mark, 16, was at first wrongly arrested on . suspicion of the burglary, causing further upset for his family. Rochford stole a wallet containing £500 of life savings when he raided . the home of retired shipyard worker John Hopper, 73, and wife Vera, 71. Daughter Sharon Hopper, 40, said: ‘I can’t believe what the judge said. What really took courage was my parents having to continue living in . their house after he had invaded their privacy. ‘Until the judge has had his own home burgled while he is lying asleep inside it, he cannot possibly know the fear and distress suffered by . decent people like my parents.’ Judge Bowers, 67, is a married father of three who has been a judge for more than 20 years. He has made contradictory comments about burglary sentencing in recent . months. In May, he criticised sentencing guidelines that let first-time . burglars escape with a ‘slap across the wrist’. But weeks later, he allowed a man with almost 80 crimes on his record to . walk free for a burglary committed four days after his release from . prison, telling the court: ‘I must be getting soft in my old age.’ Judge Bowers then told David Wray, 39: ‘I am quite sure you are capable . of a lot better. If you are bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, you’ll be all . right.’","Judge Peter Bowers admitted he could be 'pilloried' for his controversial decision .

"A cargo of 20billion euros in cash (£16.75billion) has lain unclaimed at a Moscow airport for six years amid allegations it could be the secret fortune of Saddam Hussein. The stash, now under high security in a cargo depot, is held on 200 wooden pallets each worth 100 million euros, enough to keep the entire NHS going for almost two months. Russian customs have demanded the real owner of the booty ""presents himself"" to claim the fortune, but while a number of bogus and unconvincing attempts have been made to obtain it, no-one has satisfied the authorities that they are the rightful recipient. Under armed guard at Sheremetyevo airport in Russia there is £16.75bn in cash stored on wooden pallets . 'It is possible that this is the money of Saddam Hussein,' an anonymous intelligence source told Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper. The cash mountain, all in 100 euro notes, was flown to Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow from Frankfurt on 7 August 2007 and it has remained frozen there ever since. Russian sources say the authorities have failed to untangle the identity of the ultimate owner of the money, which - strangely - arrived at the airport without a specified recipient on the consignment. Why Saddam's ill-gotten nest egg would have been sent from Germany to Russia four years after he was toppled, and eight months after his execution, is unclear, but this is not the only theory about the money's origin. It is claimed that the Iraqi tyrant had shifted £7.5 billion to Moscow in diplomatic bags before he was ousted, yet this was far short of the full wealth he had amassed. Documents show Farzin Motlagh as the sender of the money but he has not come to claim the cash . Dead dictators: theories suggest the money could have actually belonged to either Saddam Hussein (left), former ruler of Iraq, or Colonel Gaddafi, who was shot following the Libyan uprising . 'There are other possibilities too,' said a security source last night. Saddam was not the only dictator who funnelled away a fortune: what about Muammar Gaddafi? 'Another explanation is that this is Russian mafia money or the fortune of corrupt Russian officials but that has become  too dangerous for anyone to claim. It is a gargantuan sum.' The waybill, while not naming a recipient, suggested the owner was 45-year-old Farzin Koroorian Motlagh. His passport details show him to be Iranian, but Russian customs and other agencies appear far from convinced that he is the ultimate owner. Nor has he appeared in Moscow to claim the loot. Reports last night suggested that the cash was intended for an obscure foundation called The World of Kind People, yet its headquarters are Ukrainian and the final destination of the cash was Russia. It's boss, called Alexander Shipilov, 53, is one of a number of people who have failed to convince the authorities to hand him cash that would make him wealthier than Roman Abramovich, who is worth £9 billion. His charitable organisation is reported to have offered a two billion euro fee to lawyers to win the case, but Moscow's legal experts show no desire to take it on. Vadim Lyalin, a customs affairs expert, said: 'The shipper didn't specify a recipient. This is rather odd. It suggests that something is wrong with the cash. 'Surely someone would have claimed the cargo from the very beginning. It remains unknown who exactly did so. 'Probably, there was a certain plan how this cash was supposed to cross the Russian border since no-one with any  sense would send such money to ""nowhere"". 'Something must have gone wrong, and ""Mr X"" failed to receive the cargo. After a number of failed attempts to collect the cash, it was decided to act via a foundation. 'This is a common money laundering practice.' Whoever manages to convince Russian authorities the money is theirs will be worth more than Roman Abramovich . The Russian government has so far not seized the money. Lyalin added: 'It turns out that there are no reasonable grounds for seizing it. 'The owner of the cash is named on paper. The cash is real and was transferred from a German bank.' The bank has been named as Deutsche Bank Group, though this is not confirmed. 'Customs demanded the owner of the cargo to appear in person,' said Lyalin.  'The authorities had to make sure that the owner was alive and is not a fake.' Motlagh (also known as Farzin Ali Karoryan Mutlaq) - who in 2010 was accused of being the ""mastermind"" of an attempt to steal $14billion from the Central Bank of Abu Dhabi using false documents - has not appeared in Moscow to stake his claim. He was reported to have avoided trial in the United Arab Emirates by fleeing to Iran. It is unclear if  there is any link between the Abu Dhabi and Moscow cases, but in any event the Russians have rejected his attempts to use intermediaries to claim the cash. One source familiar with the situation said that a dozen groups have sought to claim the cash, all claiming to have Motlagh's authority. 'They include criminals, Chechen groups, and  Ukrainian gangsters,' said the source. The security source claimed that Motlagh was a likely 'front man who lost control of a fortune he was nursing on behalf of shady interests related to a wicked dictator, corrupt senior officials, or a huge mafia operation linked to a state. We may never know to whom it belongs.'","Cash in 100 euro notes is stored on wooden pallets .

Reach for the stars: A starfish captured in the Isle of Purbeck, Dorset. Pearson says his aim was to capture unappreciated beach life above and below the water . 'I find ""split level"" or ""half and half"" photography captures a unique perspective not often seen by many people,' he says. 'It's a really effective way of taking pictures of marine life or people underwater in the context of the wider coastal environment.

To capture the perfect picture, the keen photographer uses a wide angle camera lens and spends a great deal of time finding the best locations, checking the tides and ensuring the weather is correct, before wading into the cold water. 'It can take a lot of patience to get the perfect picture when you're in less than perfect conditions,' says Pearson.

"A teenage boy has admitted raping a 13-year-old classmate just after they had been in a sex education lesson together. The student, who cannot be named, led the young victim to a secluded part of the grounds in a North Wales school and then attacked her. Discussing the class they had been in he  asked her if she wanted to 'try sex' and despite the young girl repeatedly telling him 'no' he pinned her down and raped her. Guilty: A 13-year-old boy has admitted a raping a classmate after a sex education class, Dolgellau Youth Court, pictured, in North Wales heard . He told her afterwards: 'You can go now' and she did not reveal her ordeal until a year later. Sentencing: District Judge Andrew Shaw, who previously represented Princess Diana's butler Paul Burrell, gave the boy a 12-month referral order . The boy, now 15, appeared in Dolgellau Youth Court in North Wales last week and admitted the rape. He was put on a 12-month referral order and must sign on the sex offenders list for 30 months after the judge decided not to refer the case to crown court, which can give longer sentences. Education chiefs in Gwynedd, the Welsh county where it took place, have launched an investigation into the teaching of sex in schools because the attack was carried out just after a sex education class. A Gwynedd Council spokesman said: 'As soon as this serious allegation was brought to our attention, the matter was immediately referred to North Wales Police for investigation. 'Now that the legal process has been concluded, we will be working with North Wales Police and other relevant partners to carry out a detailed review of the incident to identify whether there are any lessons to be learned. 'Safeguarding the welfare of the county's children is a key priority for Gwynedd Council and our partners. 'When an allegation is presented to us that a young person may have been the victim of a crime, we have detailed processes in place that are then followed in accordance with the relevant all Wales child protection procedures.' The sexual attack came to light a year after the incident when a school nurse realised the young girl appeared unhappy. She asked if anything was worrying her and the teenage girl told her about the rape. The boy is now in foster care and no longer lives in the area. He will have to register with police where he is living and where he travels for the next two-and-a-half years. Most state comprehensives already offer sex education as part of the national curriculum. But thousands of academies, free and faith schools are not required to teach the national curriculum, meaning they are free to drop the subject. Provision in primary schools is also patchy, with most not teaching anything until the final years. This year the Liberal Democrats announced plans to force all state schools, including primaries, to teach sex education. Nick Clegg’s Schools Minister David Laws committed the party to introducing sex education for all children aged seven and over to help them become ‘good citizens’. The move, backed by Labour but opposed by the Conservatives, would force thousands of schools to increase the amount of sex education on offer. Countries such as the Netherlands and Sweden have been held up as examples of a more liberal and open attitude to sex education than the UK. In the Netherlands, sex and relationship education begins in primary schools for children as young as six. It has one of the lowest teenage pregnancy rates in the world. British parents retain the right to withdraw their children from sex education classes, and surveys have frequently shown that many oppose school sex education for young children. Because District Judge Andrew Shaw decided not send him to Crown Court, where there are higher sentencing powers, the 12-month referral order was the maximum sentence he was able to give. Sex and relationship education, compulsory from age 11 onwards, involves teaching children about reproduction, sexuality and sexual health. The Government says it does not promote early sexual activity or any particular sexual orientation. Some parts of sex and relationship education are compulsory and these biological aspects of sexual maturity and intercourse are part of the national curriculum for science. Secondary school pupils are taught about relationships, love and care and the responsibilities of parenthood as well as safe sex and contraception. Guidelines state classes must focus on boys as much as girls, build self-esteem, teach the responsibility and consequences of sexual activity and parenthood and ensure young people understand how the law applies to sexual relationships. Katie Russell, from rape survivor charity Rape Crisis England and Wales, said anecdotal evidence showed the rape of young teenagers by friends was 'not uncommon'. Ms Russell said: 'The fact it happened after a sex education class I am sure gives concern about the teaching of sex education in school. 'I would say it highlights the importance of teaching sex and relationship education in schools that focuses not just on the biology and mechanics of sex but about emotions and consent, respect and relationships. 'It is only through genuine education, and much earlier than 13 I would say, that we can help stop this happening.'","Teenager raped victim after taking her to secluded spot after class .

"We usually associate power cords with unsightly, tangled cables that need to be hidden away. But a group of US researchers believes everyday cables can be revolutionised using cheap sensors to perform complex tasks. Their research could lead to radios that turn on by bending the cable, or lamps that switch off when its wires are kicked. Scroll down for video . A prototype of a hard drive cable. A pull on the cord sends a request to for safe ejection of the device . The technology is being developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as part of the 'Cord UIs' project. 'Everyone hates cables,' Philipp Schoessler of MIT's Tangible Media Group told FastCoDesign. 'Every device has one, and yet we see them as a nuisance. We wanted to see if we could give cords additional meaning.' Using a water hose for inspiration, the research team developed a five prototypes of 'super cables' to demonstrate their abilities. Using a water hose for inspiration, the research team developed a five prototypes of 'super cables' to demonstrate their abilities . The first of the prototypes was a lamp with the dimmer knob replaced by a knot on the cord (top).  In another prototype, a clip clamping on the Macbook charger wire was able to control a computer's power function (bottom left). Another cable (bottom right) allowed the user to pinch headphone to control the play function . There seems to be a wave of chargers that promise to speed up the time it takes to fully charge a phone or tablet. The latest one, SONICable, claims to halve the amount of time it takes to get a battery from zero to 100 per cent, it is available to pre-order for both iPhone and Android handsets. Designed by a team from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the SONICable has two functions. When it’s plugged into a device, but switched off, it acts like a standard USB cable and syncs content from one device to another. But, when it is switched on, the syncing functions are disabled so the cable concentrates all of its energy into charging the connected device. The Indiegogo campaign features a graphic that shows the SONICable charging a device twice as fast as a traditional charger. SONICable comes with a Lightning connector, for the iPhone 5 and later models, the fourth generation iPad and above, and the iPad mini range. It also has a microUSB option that will work for HTC, Samsung and other compatible devices, including eReaders. After the initial run of cables are shipped, they will retail for $36 (£24). They are expected to be available sometime next month. Each of the cords was controlled by either knotting, pinching, sensing pressure, bending or stretching. The first of the prototypes was a study lamp with the dimmer knob replaced by a knot on the cord. As the knot is tightened, embedded sensors and a micro-controller dims the light. In another prototype, a clip clamping on the Macbook charger wire was able to control a computer's power function, including sending it to sleep. It was able to do this because the charger cable, infused with pressure-sensitive sensors, sent a pulse that was detected by the computer. They embedded sensors that detect whether a knot has been tied in a cord, along with where and how tight it is to control a gadget, such as a lamp. The team also created headphones use special external woven fibres that detect touch and pressure. Pinching the cord triggers the pause functionality of the iPhone's 3.5mm jack. Existing sensors were also used to help detect if a cable is being stretched too far. A final prototype involved a hard drive cable. A pull on the cord sends requests to the computer for safe ejection of the device. The scientists say most of the capabilities being explored in Cord UIs would be cheap and easy for companies to incorporate into existing devices. 'Most of the presented interactions lend strongly from the metaphor of regarding the cord as a hose and the power and data as liquid flowing in that hose,' they wrote in their paper. 'Cords offer endless possibilities of manual manipulation.'

Mother Kathy Amaya, who lives in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and son, David Amaya Barrick, 37, finally reconnected Saturday at an airport in San Diego. The emotional meeting was hampered by the fact that Mr Barrick only speaks Spanish and Ms Amaya speaks only English, CNN noted. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . At long last: Mother Kathy Amaya, who lives in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and son, David Amaya Barrick, 37, finally reconnected Saturday at an airport in San Diego. Emotional embrace: Mother and son hugged upon first meeting, their first in three decades . 'I love you and I missed you a lot, I welcome you into my life,' the woman's son said - in Spanish, according to CNN. 'I love you and I'm very happy to see you and I'm not going to let you go,' she replied . They will spend a few days in San Diego before traveling to Wisconsin to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner, the network reported. Ms Amaya has four other children, all half-siblings to Mr Barrick, two of them still live at home and are looking forward to meeting their brother. Soon to be reunited: David Amaya Barrick was raised my his grandparents and does not speak any English. He had no idea his mother had been looking for him . Proof: When he was caught sneaking over the border from Mexico, immigration did not believe he was an American citizen until they later found his birth certificate . Before he was taken: Mother and son together in much happier times . She said she has been looking for her . child ever since her estranged husband abducted him and though she knew . he was in Mexico, she did not have the money to hire a private . investigator.

'They . told me he was beaten and robbed before he crossed the border and the . thieves took his money and his cell (phone),' Amaya said. 'They said he . seemed like a really good guy, and that he only speaks Spanish and I . don't.' Barrick was . born in Chicago in 1977 while Amaya was married to his father, but she . said her spouse became abusive and the couple split when the boy was . one-years-old. After . some time had passed, Amaya began letting the father visit his son and . 'then one day (the child) was just gone', she said. 'I reported his abduction, but when police found out he was with his dad, they weren't worried about it.' Amaya said the boy's father told her . that he had taken the toddler, then two years of age, to Mexico and left . him there with family members. His father and aunt took David to . Mexico under a one-month permit to visit his grandparents. However, he told NBC 7 his father left him there and he has only seen him a few times in the last 30 years.

"Just a quarter of eighth and 12th grade students in the United States have solid writing skills, even when allowed to use spell-check and other computer word processing tools, according to results of a national exam released on Friday. Twenty-four per cent of students at each grade level were able to write essays that were well developed, organized and had proper language and grammar. Three per cent scored as advanced and the remaining students had just partial mastery of these skills. Students who took the writing test . inn 2011 had an advantage that previous test takers did not: a computer . with spell-check and thesaurus. Results are in: Only twenty-four per cent of students at each grade level were able to write essays that were well developed, organized and had proper language and grammar (stock photo) 'It is important to remember this is first draft writing,' said Cornelia Orr, executive director of the National Assessment Governing Board, which administers the Nation's Report Card tests. 'They did have some time to edit, but it wasn't extensive editing,' she added in comments to the Associated Press. Previously, students taking the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) writing test had to use pencil and paper, but with changes in . technology, and the need to write across electronic formats, the . decision was made to switch to computers. Report card: The NAEP is a congressionally authorized project . She said word processing . tools alone wouldn't result in significantly better writing scores if . students didn't have the core skills of being able to organize ideas and . present them in a clear and grammatical fashion. Still, . students in both grades who used the thesaurus and the backspace key . more frequently had higher scores than those who used them less often. Students in the 12th grade who had to write four or five pages a week . for English homework also had higher scores. Because . this was the first version of the computerized test, the board . cautioned against comparing the results to previous exams. In 2007, 33 . per cent of eighth grade students scored at the proficient level, which . represents solid writing skills, as did 24 per cent at grade 12. The results at both grade levels showed a continued achievement gap between white, black, Hispanic and Asian students. At . the eighth grade, Asian students had the highest average score, which . was 33 points higher than black students on a 300-point scale. At the . 12th grade, white students scored 27 points above black students. The NAEP is a congressionally . authorized project of the National Center for Education Statistics . (NCES) within the Institute of Education Sciences of the U.S. Department . of Education. Orr said . students use technology and tools like spell-check on a daily basis. 'It's as if years ago we had given them a pencil to write the essay and . took away the eraser,' she said. The numbers: A significant achievement gap was found between white, black, Hispanic and Asian students . There was also a gender gap, with . girls scoring 20 points higher on average than boys in the eighth grade . and 14 points higher in 12th grade. Those . who qualified for free and reduced price lunch, a key indicator of . poverty, also had lower scores than those who did not; there was a 27 . point difference between the two at the eighth grade. For . the 2011 exam, laptops were brought into public and private schools . across the country and more than 50,000 students were tested to get a . nationally representative sample. Students were given prompts that . required them to write essays that explained, persuaded or conveyed an . experience. Writing skills: U.S. students have become too reliant on using spell check on computers and lack basic writing skills, new exam results show (stock photo) Kathleen . Blake Yancey, a professor at Florida State University who served on the . advisory panel for the test, said one factor to keep in mind is that . research shows most students in the United States don't compose at the . keyboard. 'What they do . is sort of type already written documents into the machine, much as we . used to do with typewriters four decades ago,' she said. Yancey . said for this reason, there was some concern about having students . write on the computer as opposed to by hand. Likewise, having the . advantage of spell-check assumes students know how to use it. And in . some schools and neighborhoods, computers are still not easily . accessible. Technology: In the first version of the computerized test, students still didn't have the core skills of being able to organize ideas and present them in a clear and grammatical fashion . 'There are not so many students that actually learn to write composing at the keyboard,' she said. Yancey . added that many kids who do have access to computers are not . necessarily using them to write at school, but to take standardized . tests and filling in bubbles. 'Digital . technology is a technology,' she said. 'Paper and pencil is a . technology. If technology were the answer, that would be pretty simple.' Progress?

"This whale was literally jumping for joy after a rescue crew saved her friend from drowning. These extraordinary photos show a humpback whale 'celebrating' after another female was cut free from stray ropes attached to old lobster pots. The stunning images were captured by Christine Callaghan, 62, off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. She said: 'I've seen many breaches, and they are always awesome. But this one was different and special in a way that made my throat tighten.' The incredible moment was captured by Christine Callaghan, 62, a guide with a whale-watching cruiser in the region . Grommet the humpback whale bursts through the water in celebration after members of the Whale Rescue Team managed to free sidekick Foggy . Christine, a whale-watch guide with Pirate's Cove Whale & Seabird Cruises, had been leading a trip when they received reports of an entangled whale and decided to take a detour. The discovered a female humpback known as Foggy who had become ensnared in ropes from old lobster pots in the Bay of Fundy, two miles offshore of Long Island. Foggy, described by Christine as a 'Fundy favourite', was born in 1987 to a whale named Bermuda. Humpbacks return to the feeding grounds their mothers brought them to when they were calves, meaning Foggy returns to the bay year after year. The whale had rope wrapped around her head and across her blowholes and peduncle - the narrow part of her tail, just ahead of the flukes. A humpback whale swims in front of the Whale Rescue Team in the Bay of Fundy, two miles off the coast of Long Island in Nova Scotia . The humpback whale known as Grommet (front of pic) waits patiently by the side of Foggy after she became entangled in ropes in the Bay of Fundy . Foggy was dragging a mass of old lobster traps beneath her, causing her to list to one side with the weight of all the gear. However, remaining faithfully by her side throughout the ordeal was a fellow humpback known as Grommet. Another . boat, the Shearwater, from the Center for Coastal Studies in . Provincetown, happened to be in the Bay and came to offer assistance. The . Shearwater crew were able to do an initial survey and radio through . details to the Fast Response Craft that was speeding to the scene.

The Shearwater crew were able to do an initial survey and radio through details to the Fast Response Craft that was speeding to the scene . The Campobello Whale Rescue Team then used specialist equipment to cut the rope snagging Foggy's tail, and then the ones around her head. The crew decided to leave a single strand in her mouth, fearing they would cause excessive bleeding if they dragged it out, and figuring that she would likely be able to rid herself of it. The instant Foggy was freed, Grommet dove and then burst from the water in a spectacular celebratory breach. Christine . said: 'The timing, immediately after the ropes were cut completely . freeing Foggy, and the fact that it was Foggy's 'friend' that breached, . was so touching to me. As Foggy was cut free from stray ropes by whale rescuers, Grommet breached next to the rescuer's boat in an amazing display of thanks . Freedom! Foggy was freed and Grommet, who had remained faithfully by her side, was thrilled . 'Knowing how intelligent these animals are, and having observed Grommet's steadfast, seemingly protective companionship of Foggy those several hours while we waited with them for the rescue boat, I personally interpreted that breach as an act of joy and celebration that her pal was out of danger. 'Everyone on the boat felt a huge sense that we had just witnessed something wonderful.' All present were left with a smile on their face as the two whales swam away side by side up the Bay, the northernmost reach of the whale feeding ground known as the Gulf of Maine. The mouth of the Bay is one of the best places in the world to see several different species of whales, including finbacks, minkes, the very rare North Atlantic right whale and humpbacks.","The stunning images were captured by whale-watcher guide off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada ."

"A couple from North Naples, Florida were arrested on Monday after they allegedly beat up their  friend because she graciously paid their tab for them while they were at the bank. Dana Marie Streight, 39, and her boyfriend Lane McEnery, 46, were initially perturbed when they learned that the bar, North Naples County Club, didn't accept credit cards as a form of payment. Their anger turned to violence as the night unraveled. Each face battery charges and Streight faces additional charges of disorderly intoxication and resisting law enforcement without violence. Dana Marie Streight (left) and her boyfriend Lane McEnery (right) allegedly started fighting with their friend after she paid their bar tab while they were at the bank withdrawing money . The Naples Daily News reports that the couple was told that they could use the bar's ATM but that they decided to go to the bank instead. When the couple returned to the drinking-hole they discovered that their friend, whose identity has not been released, paid their tab and that's when the two women allegedly began arguing and hitting each other. Witnesses recall that after Streight began jousting with her friend that another man came to break up the fight. That's supposedly when McEnry stepped in and told the man to stop. Witnesses say that the man turned to punch McEnery who began spitting blood from a ripe wound on his face. The Collier County sheriff's arrived on the scene later to find Streight angry and covered in blood. She allegedly kept calling her her friend a, ' F***ing psycho c**t' over and over and was behaving violently and did not cooperate with police. The Naples Daily News reports that Streight demanded a glass of water from police officers when they arrived. 'Get me the f***ing fire department, I need some f****ing water,' she allegedly cried when they didn't bring her a glass. Streight and her boyfriend McEnery told told police that they were attacked by a group of people but none of the other witnesses supported that account. According to the police report, when police asked the couple why they were covered in blood theyreplied, 'because these mother f****ers are kicking the s**t out of us for no reason.' The Mail Online called both the bar who was not available for comment. The condition of Streight's friend is unknown but there were no reports of any serious injury.

"U.S. officials couldn't believe their luck last week when a suspected Taliban commander who heard there was a $100 reward for his whereabouts turned himself in to authorities. Perhaps misunderstanding the meaning of 'wanted', Mohammad Ashan sauntered up to police in Sar Howza, Paktika province, with a poster bearing his own face - and demanded the finder's fee. Officers arrested Ashan on the spot, the Washington Post reported. Nevertheless, when U.S. forces went to confirm Ashan had come forward they were understandably incredulous. 'Imbecile': The poster offering a $100 reward for information on the whereabouts of Mohammad Ashan - which he took with him when he tried to claim the money . 'We asked him, ""Is this you?""' SPC Matthew Baker told the Post. 'Mohammad Ashan answered with an incredible amount of enthusiasm, ""Yes, yes, that’s me! Can I get my award now?""' Biometric checks confirmed that the man Afghan police were holding was the alleged insurgent U.S. troops had been looking for. He is suspected of plotting at least two attacks on Afghan security forces and his face was on hundreds of posters plastered all over the district. Nato forces often distribute wanted posters, but they are rarely so effective. Civilians are usually afraid to pass on information for fear of reprisals, and Taliban fighters themselves usually avoid urban areas when they are being hunted. But not it seems, Ashan. 'Clearly,' one U.S. official told the Post, 'the man is an imbecile.' Ashan's effort to claim the reward money on his head may have been a misguided attempt to replicate the recent taunts of the White House made by Pakistani militant Hafiz Mohammad Saeed . Brazen: Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, 61, told the U.S. it should give $10million reward for his whereabouts to him, claiming he had made no secret of his movements . The 61-year-old founder of militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba mocked U.S. officials who put a £10million bounty on his head, saying they should give the reward money to him, as he had made no secret of his whereabouts. Speaking to a news conference near to Pakistan's military headquarters earlier this month, he boasted: 'I am here, I am visible. America should give that reward money to me. 'I will be in Lahore tomorrow. America can contact me whenever it wants to.' Saeed has been accused of orchestrating the 2008 attacks in the Indian city of Mumbai that killed 166 people, including six American citizens. But he operates openly in Pakistan, giving public speeches and appearing on TV talk shows.","'Clearly, the man is an imbecile,' U.S. official says ."
"The cyclist whose collision with a Connecticut woman ultimately led to her death has finally broken his silence. Jason Marshall, 31, said in a statement released by his attorney just hours after the death of Jill Tarlov that he is 'utterly devastated' about what happened, calling the incident 'an unavoidable accident.' He then added, 'I am deeply, deeply saddened about the accidental collision that I had with Ms. Jill Tarlov last week and her subsequent passing.' Scroll down for video . Breaking his silence: In a statement released this afternoon, Jason Marshall called his crash with Jill Tarlov 'an unavoidable accident' Victim: Jill Tarlov, pictured, died earlier today her family announced . Gathering evidence: NYPD investigators canvas the scene of the crash in Central Park . The Connecticut woman, was who left brain dead after being hit by the swerving cyclist last week, died on Monday her family announced. Miss Tarlov, 59, of Fairfield was in New York City on Thursday to buy her daughter a gift, when she was hit by  Marshall while walking through Central Park. The mother of two was rushed to New York Presbyterian hospital where she was put on life support. On Monday, her husband, CBS executive Mike Wittman, released a statement saying she passed. 'My wife was beautiful in every way imaginable,' Mr Wittman wrote. 'Jill was the most amazing mother to Matthew and Anna, who taught them above all that kindness, compassion, and a spirit for life were the right morals to live by. Everyone who had ever met her was somehow made better by her company. 'Even though she has been taken from us far too soon, her spirit will live on forever. On behalf of our family, I would like to thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers, and request privacy during the difficult times ahead,' Mr Wittman said. It's unclear whether her family took her off life support. Legal rep: Thought not charged with any crime yet, Marshall (above) released his statement today through his lawyer . Collision course: Witnesses described how the cyclist riding an expensive high-performance bike allegedly made no attempt to stop in the moments before the crash . Tarlov also used to work at CBS, and the company issued a statement following her death, saying they would work to help prevent similar tragedies in the future. 'We are heartsick over the passing of our dear friend and former 1010 WINS Radio colleague Jill Tarlov,' Anton Guitano, chief operating officer of CBS Local Media and Peter Dunn, presiden tof CBS television, said in a joint statement. 'As we mourn the loss of our friend and console Mike and his family, we are committed to doing what we can to bring greater public awareness of the perils of unsafe and distracted driving by motorists and cyclists that endangers pedestrians. Far too many people have been killed or seriously injured on our streets,' the statement read. Cyclist Marshall has so far, not been charged in the deadly collision. Police say the Harlem saxophonist was riding in the park's bike lane when he swerved to avoid other pedestrians and hit Tarlov. Phillip Fenton, 21, who allegedly witnessed the accident, told the New York Post: 'It didn't look like he tried to stop.' Another witness, Tom Longman, told the newspaper 'The right side of [Tarlov's] face looked really bad. There was blood all over her.' Marshall remained at the scene and suffered minor injuries. According to the New York Daily News, an online training log shows that Marshall had logged speeds above the 25 miles per hour limit. Cyclists are also supposed to slow down at crosswalks and yield to pedestrian, the Parks Department website says.

"Now he is to be a father, you might think Simon Cowell would want to start looking after himself – and his pregnant girlfriend – a little better. But it seems even the responsibilities of impending parenthood can’t stop the TV mogul from lighting up a cigarette. The 54-year-old has been spotted smoking in the company of Lauren Silverman in the past weeks, leading to fears his habit could harm his unborn baby. Habit: Simon Cowell lights up as he leaves St Martin's Theatre, London, with New York socialite Lauren Silverman, who is reportedly carrying his child. He was criticised by the charity Action on Smoking and Health . Lighting up: The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent star once confessed he started smoking at the age of eight . Pictures of him puffing away by her side even prompted health charity Action on Smoking and Health to warn all pregnant women to avoid passive smoke because of the increased risks of congenital abnormalities. After studying images of the pair, the charity’s research manager Amanda Sandford said: ‘Tobacco smoke is toxic and can harm the unborn child so it’s really important that pregnant women avoid breathing in tobacco smoke, whether through active or passive smoking. ‘Studies show that babies born to women who were exposed to secondhand smoke during pregnancy are at greater risk of having a low birth weight, congenital abnormalities and are also at increased risk of dying shortly after birth.’ Cowell is a self-confessed nicotine addict, and once admitted he started smoking at the age of eight. Earlier this year, he tried to kick his 40-a-day menthols habit by switching to smokeless electric cigarettes instead. The mogul recently said he felt he would be a good father despite not having a natural affinity with babies . But he was soon back on the tobacco, admitting: ‘I equate smoking with having a good time. I shouldn’t be saying this but, well, they’re not illegal, are they? After sex – amazing.’ Last month, Cowell had a cigarette in his hand when he and 36-year-old Miss Silverman – who is five months pregnant – went out to dinner in New York. And he was smoking again over the weekend as they walked side by side down the street in Beverly Hills on Sunday. The X Factor boss recently said he felt he would be a good father despite not having a natural affinity with babies. He said: ‘I’m not brilliant with babies. I never know what to do. But [once it’s older] I think I’ll be a good dad in terms of advice. And then I’ll get to do all the things I want to do, like go to Disneyland or Universal Studios, teach him how to drive – I love all that.’ However, he added he would ‘100% absolutely not’ change the child’s nappies. Miss Silverman divorced her husband in August after it was revealed she was carrying Cowell’s child.The New York socialite has told friends she wants to marry him.","TV mogul, 54, is self-confessed nicotine addict who enjoys a puff 'after sex'

"A celebration that started with wedding bells ended with police sirens as a result of a massive brawl that broke out in an upstate New York country club over the weekend. Seven different police agencies were called in late Saturday to break up the fight at the Orchard Park Country Club. Officers say about half of the approximately 200 guests were involved in the melee, which erupted after a member of the wedding party was tossed off the premises for inappropriate behavior. Reception rumble: A wedding celebration at Orchard Park County Club in Buffalo ended in a bloody fight involving dozens of people . Ambulance crews treated several people for injuries, including a 39-year-old man who was taken to a Buffalo hospital for treatment of a head wound. Police say damage to the banquet room included holes in walls, blood stains and broken crystal bowls. No arrests have been reported as of Tuesday morning, but the investigation continues. According to reporting by The Buffalo News, a manager at the banquet hall denied that any incident had taken place, even though police officers and witnesses described a chaotic scene at the reception Saturday night. When MailOnline contacted the venue by phone Tuesday, a manager said: 'we have no comment on that. Thank you very much.' People who responded to the reception hall on South Buffalo Street in Orchard Park Saturday told The Buffalo News that up to 100 guests came to blows at the end of the celebration at around 11pm. ‘I’m telling you, there was blood everywhere,’ said a man who worked at the venue that night. ‘There was holes punched in the walls. Words couldn’t describe it. Just when you thought it was over, another fight started.’ Police were first called to the country club about 40 minutes before the fracas to remove an unruly guest who was punched in the face after being accused of touching someone's girlfriend. Shortly after 11pm, the Orchard Park Police Department was flooded with 911 calls from the wedding venue about a massive brawl, which broke out as guests were preparing to leave. Responding officers encountered an out-of-control fight involving dozens of family members and guests. The altercation was so massive that reinforcements had to be called in from Hamburg, East Aurora, Cheektowaga, West Seneca, Erie County Sheriff's Office and State Police. By all accounts, the reception turned into a chaotic scene, with people punching one another, breaking dishes and screaming profanities. The unidentified bride was reportedly escorted off the premises to shield her from the fighting while her newlywed husband remained behind screaming at the brawlers to disperse. The fisticuffs left a 39-year-old man with a head injury that required hospitalization, but the other brawlers refused medical treatment.","The fight broke out at Orchard Park Country Club in a Buffalo suburb at the end of a wedding reception Saturday .

"A horse named Gerrard's Slip came third last in the 12.40pm at Doncaster on Saturday,  five minutes before Liverpool vs Chelsea kicked off at Anfield. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard can't escape the slip that Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho insisted  'gave the title to Manchester City' last year in the Barclays Premier League. Gerrard's Slip and his trainer, B Smart, were 18-1 to win at Doncaster but ultimately took nothing from the six furlong race. Steven Gerrard slipped to give Demba Ba a free run at goal during Chelsea's win at Anfield last season . This racecard shows how you can bet on Gerrard's Slip with Coral (and the horse's trainer is called B Smart) The horse is owned by Middleham Park Racing who appear to have a soft spot for Premier League champions City, with Kool Kompany and Captain Dunne also on their books. Mobsta, the favourite, won the race on a miserable-looking day in Doncaster, with Beardwood and Thahab coming second and third respectively. Gerrard gifted Demba Ba the goal that shattered dreams in the red half of Merseyside last year, but on Saturday Liverpool will be keen for revenge. Mourinho began his mind games on Friday, saying Chelsea weren't bothered about the game that 'meant nothing to us' but everything to Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool. Liverpool are yet to establish the form of last year that saw them  challenge for the title, as they currently sit 12 points adrift of Premier League leaders Chelsea.

"Brendan Rodgers felt the Chelsea game would be the biggest of Liverpool’s week. After an extraordinary night in Madrid on Tuesday, it has now become bigger than even he could have imagined. I was in Madrid as a fan. These occasions sum up what Liverpool are about: the Champions League, a capacity crowd in a magnificent stadium, supporters travelling in vast numbers, dreaming they will be able to say in years to come: ‘I was there the night we beat Real Madrid.’ It turned out to be a game that will live in the memory but not for the reasons anyone hoped would be the case. The team sheet that Rodgers handed in before kick-off — and the relentless debate that followed — has seen to that. Scroll down for video . Martin Skrtel reflects on the first-half, leaving the famous Bernabeu turf with Liverpool a goal down . Matchwinner Karim Benzema celebrates his strike after Liverpool's rearguard were caught flatfooted . Rodgers has received some scathing criticism for making seven changes but I am not going to join the chorus of disapproval. Some of his decisions I didn’t agree with, others I could completely understand. This is how I saw it. When we got into the Bernabeu before kick-off, the full extent of how much Rodgers had altered his team had circulated and it left many high up in the away section, who already viewed the fixture with trepidation, fearing a night even more painful than the one Madrid inflicted at Anfield. So then I began to study the team sheet. Javier Manquillo instead of Glen Johnson? I could understand that. Manquillo has been Liverpool’s best right back this season. Kolo Toure for Dejan Lovren? Again, no problem. Lovren’s erratic form meant he didn’t deserve to be picked. Fabio Borini for Mario Balotelli? No issue there. Borini covered more ground in one game than Balotelli had done in 10. The absence of Philippe Coutinho didn’t bother me, either, as he can’t be trusted to deliver in big away games. Those players who came in all deserve to start against Chelsea. Kolo Toure (left) had one of his best games in a Liverpool shirt, frequently frustrating Madrid's stars . The ever-willing Fabio Borini (centre) put in more effort than the mercurial Mario Balotelli . Rodgers, remember, wasn’t ripping up a team that had won six straight matches. Nobody knows what Liverpool’s best XI is at present, not even the manager. And if we think the best he had were on show when Madrid came to Anfield, being on the end of a 3-0 battering weakens those claims. What’s more, Liverpool were never going to attack Madrid, so the changes didn’t alter tactics. Anyone who believes Liverpool, under Gerard Houllier and Rafa Benitez, took on top teams away in Europe are living in a dream world. We didn’t. Neither did the all-conquering sides in the 1970s and 1980s. Yet what I couldn’t fathom were the omissions of Steven Gerrard (Rodgers’s captain), Jordan Henderson (his vice-captain) and the best attacker, Raheem Sterling. Those three, along with Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge, were the reason they came so close to winning the title and returned to Europe’s elite. After their efforts last season, they deserved to start in the Bernabeu. The reason players love the Champions League so much is the thought of playing in an arena such as the Bernabeu. What are the chances of Stevie playing there again? Will Jordan and Raheem ever have the opportunity in the future? You believe that you will get plenty of chances but I played for Liverpool for 17 years and a trip to the Bernabeu only came around once. Jamie Carragher (right) stifles Raul with Xabi Alonso's help during Liverpool's 1-0 win in Madrid in 2009 . Steven Gerrard (left) watches from the bench, alongside Glen Johnson and Jordan Henderson . I felt those three deserved to be in the team and it had nothing to do with sentiment. They deserved to play because they are part of Liverpool’s best team. I can imagine how they would have felt when Rodgers told them they were out. They would have been professional but they would have been devastated. When you grow up, you dream about playing against Real Madrid in the Bernabeu. During my career, I won several big trophies but, believe me, nights in the Nou Camp, the San Siro and the Bernabeu, three of football’s cathedrals, are up there in my memories; victories against Barcelona (February 2007), Inter Milan (March 2008) and Real (February 2009) were special. This squad had a similar opportunity. Yes, Liverpool played reasonably well and showed more than they had for a number of weeks but relief that they didn’t suffer a heavy defeat is not what following Liverpool in Europe should be about. What confuses me is the importance the Chelsea game has been given. It is big, of course it is. But there are 28 matches to go. Winning won’t guarantee Liverpool’s place in the top four this season, in the same way a defeat won’t leave them with too much ground to make up. Gerrard (left) and Raheem Sterling were introduced in the 69th minute. Both should have started the game . The travelling fans were in good voice as ever, but left the Bernabeu with a narrow defeat . It baffles me when teams are more interested in qualifying for the competition next season than doing their best in the competition they are already in. Chelsea isn’t make or break. Had Manchester United — a side with no European commitments — been the visitors to Anfield and Liverpool had played abroad on Wednesday night, I could have seen why Rodgers wanted Gerrard, Henderson and Sterling refreshed, but not on this occasion. They are playing a Chelsea side who have been away in Europe and had 24 hours less to recover. Liverpool stayed in Madrid after the game to train on Wednesday, too, so the players haven’t had a disrupted night’s sleep to contend with. The physical demands haven’t been so severe. This, however, is where we are. When you are involved with Liverpool, things can be moving along quietly when an issue explodes and takes over. This is one of those times. Chelsea were held by Maribor in Slovenia and played a day after Liverpool in midweek . When Jose Mourinho makes an appearance at Anfield, it is usually an eventful one . City’s Euro excuses just don’t stack up . Manchester City now need a miracle to reach the Champions League knockout stages. We keep hearing how they are unlucky because they have been drawn in tough groups but that does not wash. Manuel Pellegrini has enough quality at his disposal and should have got out of this group with Bayern Munich. Why are they behind Roma? The Italians have improved in the past two seasons but their squad does not boast the depth of City’s. Why have they failed to beat CSKA Moscow over two games? Last season, City did the double over CSKA, who lost five out of six matches. Vincent Kompany is in disbelief during City's costly Champions League defeat to CSKA Moscow . Pablo Zabaleta  sums up the mood after City concede a second early goal to Ajax in 2012. They drew 2-2 . Carlos Tevez leads the troops as they trudge off after City sank to a 1-0 defeat in Dortmund in 2012 . This isn’t like how it was for Manchester United and Arsenal when they were new to the competition. In the 1990s, they had British squads who were not used to playing in Europe, and it took time to adjust. Yes, City have had some tough draws against Dortmund, Real Madrid and Munich but they were knocked out of a group by Napoli and failed to beat Ajax, home or away, in 2012 under Roberto Mancini. City have men who have played in Champions League and World Cup finals. They should be able to negotiate these tests. The excuses don’t stack up. I said last week City’s squad needs to be broken up. Defeat by CSKA provided confirmation. This week I'm looking forward to... seeing James McCarthy continue to dazzle . Everton have a rich history of building teams around influential central midfielders, headed by the ‘Holy Trinity’ of Alan Ball, Howard Kendall and Colin Harvey. In the 1980s, the team I grew up watching was inspired by Peter Reid and Paul Bracewell, and it is looking more and more like James McCarthy, the Republic of Ireland international, is going to keep up past traditions. He has the potential to be one of the best in the Barclays Premier League. McCarthy was outstanding in Thursday’s 3-0 Europa League triumph over Lille and he will have a key role again at the Stadium of Light, as Everton look to apply pressure to the teams near the top.

Peter Reid (right) is challenged by Sheffield Wednesday's Gary Shelton during 1985's FA Cup semi-final . Paul Bracewell controls the ball during the 1989 Simod Cup final, which Everton lost to Nottingham Forest . Liverpool wanted to sign him when he was 16 and the better he plays for Everton, the more it is looking like a mistake that we allowed him to slip through our fingers. He didn’t want to leave Scotland at that age but Liverpool’s loss has been Everton’s gain. I am a big fan of McCarthy and I never fail to be impressed when I see him. I do feel he needs to add more goals to his game but, if he can do that, he will be the real deal. Everton have a top player on their hands.","Rodgers has been widely criticised for his team selection in the Bernabeu .

The move is the latest snub of London, after Secretary of State John Kerry angered some in the British government by praising France as America's 'oldest ally' and part of a coalition of the willing prepared to strike against Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, whom he called a 'thug and murderer.' Kerry made no mention of Britain in his speech on Syria, but praised France, Australia and even Turkey. Weeks later, British Prime Minister David Cameron failed to carry a vote in Parliament authorizing the use of military force in the Middle Eastern country. The 285–272 vote frustrated American military leaders and politicians. Even then, a terse White House statement said the Obama administration would 'continue to consult' with Great Britain, 'one of our closest allies and friends.' Ultimately, the U.S. called off the planned strikes. On Tuesday, though, Hollande was center-stage. 'The U.S.-French alliance has never been stronger,' Obama said. 'That's good for France. It's good for the United States. It's good for the world, because we share certain values and certain commitments and are willing to act on behalf of those commitments and values.' Obama appeared to cast aside an episode from the George W. Bush administration that had France refusing to participate in a coalition effort to invade Iraq while the UK led the way. Within weeks 'French fries' were replaced in high profile eateries – including at least one congressional cafeteria on Capitol Hill – by 'Freedom fries.' And a character on the animated comedy show The Simpsons offered a label for the French that stuck: 'Cheese-eating surrender monkeys.' Britain, meanwhile, enjoyed favored status in Washington. Then-Prime Minister Tony Blair had famously promised after the 9/11 terror attacks in New York and the Washington, D.C. suburbs that Britain would stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with the American people against a 'new evil of mass terrorism.' What a difference an election makes! George W. Bush and Tony Blair once personified the 'special' U.S.-UK relationship, partnering in an effort to oust Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein from power . The U.S.-France bilateral talks are happening on a global stage, with the very real possibility of putting England's collective nose out of joint . Despite his projection of a strong relationship between the U.S. and France, Obama offered no word on Tuesday about whether the result would be helpful to England. A French journalist had noted that he 'actually praised France very warmly today' and granted our President the first state visit of your second term.' 'Does that mean that France has become the best European ally of the U.S. and has replaced Great Britain in that role?' 'Oh, my,' a smiling Obama said, to a round of laughter. Hollande followed Obama's lead with his own family comparison. 'I have four children,' he said through a translator, 'so that makes it even more difficult for me to make any choice at all.' 'But we're not trying to be anyone's favorite. There are historic links. We share common values.' 'And I can see that our views converge on many issues. But it's not about hierarchy; it's just about being useful to the world.' Will David Cameron be pressed on Washington's 'special relationship' with London during Prime Minister's Questions? But the journalist's question wasn't meant to be playful. It continued with a more serious demand about the implications of whether BFF status exists between Washington and Paris. 'If so,' came the zinger, 'why not extend to France the no-spying agreement that you have with England after the big scandal of the NSA’s surveillance program?' Obama took issue with the premise of the question, cautioning that 'it's not actually correct to say that we have a ""no-spy agreement"" with Great Britain. That’s not actually what happens.' 'We don’t have – there’s no country where we have a no-spy agreement,' he said. 'We have, like every other country, an intelligence capability. And then we have a range of partnerships with all kinds of countries. And we’ve been in consultations with the French government to deepen those commitments.'","Obama and Francois Hollande took turns saying they couldn't declare a 'varotie' ally any more than they could choose a favorite child .

"Road closures are an all too familiar sight for many motorists, but commuters attempting to drive down this London route found it sealed off so that migrating toads could cross safely. The road in Richmond, south west London, has been sealed off to drivers to allow the amphibians to safely reach their breeding ground. Volunteer 'toad crossing' patrols have also been called in to make sure the mating toads can safely complete their annual trek from Richmond Park to a breeding pond on Ham Common, 330metres away.

"As New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich prepared to visit the Oval Office to mark the birth of a new national monument in his home state, revelations emerged about his past partnership with an environmental extremist who pleaded guilty to plotting an eco-sabotage crime against a nuclear power plant in 1990. Heinrich co-founded and chaired the New Mexico Wilderness Alliance in 1997. Another co-founder was Dave Foreman, the one-time leader of Earth First! The Daily Caller reported Monday that Foreman's wife financially supported the Democrat's 2012 US Senate campaign with donations totaling $1,750. Earth First! ran a campaign of environmentally motivated 'eco-tage' in the 1990s and 2000s. Among its initiatives was an unfulfilled plot to destroy power lines leading to a nuclear power plant. Foreman, then Earth First!'s leader, pleaded guilty to conspiring in that plot. The New Mexico Wilderness Alliance was founded six years later, in 1997. Scroll down for video . Democratic New Mexico Senator Martin Heinrich took his oath of office in 2013, but 16 years earlier he co-founded an environmental group with one of America's best known and most notorious eco-extremists . Sen. Martin Heinrich co-founded and chaired the New Mexico Wilderness Alliance with Dave Foreman (R) of the eco-sabotage group Earth First! The loose-knit organization has been active around the world, especially in the US and the UK, since the 1990s . By that time, Foreman's criminal charge had been reduced from felony conspiracy to the misdemeanor crime of vandalism to government property. That arrangement was dependent on five years of good behavior. He later paid a $250 fine. Other Earth First! activists including Foreman's wife also served on the New Mexico group's board of directors while Heinrich was its chairman. The Foremans' home often served as the organization's meeting place during that time. In a documentary film titled Earth First!: The Politics Of Radical Environmentalism, Foreman spelled out his green pressure philosophy. 'We aren't fooled for a minute that we’re engaged in the liberal reform,' he said. 'We're sticking a wrench in the system, we're slowing it down, we're thwarting it, we’re kicking it in the face.' That 'monkey wrenching' philosophy often extended to the personal lives of business and government leaders who the group saw as putting economic progress ahead of the planet. 'The earth is not dying,' its official motto read. 'It is being killed. And those who are killing it have names and addresses.' Watch the full documentary here . The group put out several hit lists during the 1990s and 2000s, including one in its newsletter, the Earth First! Journal, that spelled out the names and addresses of biotechnology executives involved with the genetic modification of food crops. FBI reports showed that Ted Kaczynski, the so-called 'Unabomber' who ran a deadly bombing campaign in the United States from 1978 to 1995, was first inspired to kill after reading such a hit list published by Earth First! His first murder victim was Thomas Mosser, an advertising executive at Burson-Marstellar. In his widely published manifesto, Kaczynski misspelled the firm's name as 'Burston,' making the exact same error as the Earth First! Journal's hit list. Both Earth First! and Kaczynski believed, incorrectly, that Mosser had a hand in rehabilitating the public image of Exxon after the Valdez oil spill in Alaska. FBI agents found copies of the Earth First! Journal in the secluded Montana cabin that served as Kaczynski's home for several years. Anti-GMO crop demonstrators from the radical green group Earth First have led protests in Scotland, England, the United States and other countries. In some cases, biotech crops near the protest sites were subsequently damaged or destroyed in actions for anonymous groups later claimed credit . Ron Arnold, the executive vice president of the nonprofit Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise, told MailOnline that Foreman 'is a very mixed bag.' 'He advocates for the ""rewilding"" of . America, meaning the depopulation of major sections of the nation. His . chief tactic since a serious run-in with the law a decade ago has been . ""incrementalism,"" eradicating developed areas a bit at a time within the . system, such as pressing for new ""protective"" designations such as . national monuments and wilderness areas.' Arnold also noted that Foreman later resigned from Earth First! A spokeswoman for Oklahoma Republican . Senator James Inhofe, who has crossed swords with the environmental . movement throughout his time in Washington, did not immediately respond . to a request for comment.

"While JFK did not order the programme, Deane says he was 'aware' of it . President John F. Kennedy secretly endorsed the release of hardened criminals to assassinate Cuban leader Fidel Castro to curb the Communist threat, a new book has claimed. At the height of tensions between America and neighbouring Communist Cuba in the early 1960s, JFK was implicit in the freeing of rapists, drug dealers, and Mafia hitmen through CIA in a bid to recruit 'untraceable' spies willing to risk their lives on dangerous missions rather than go back to jail, a new book sensationally claims. Desperate to remove Castro from power, the president resorted to using dangerous criminals as operatives - rather than CIA agents - to 'do America's dirty work' as they couldn't be linked back to his administration, it is claimed. In one failed plot, an ex con was smuggled into Cuba in 1962 to pose as a waiter in Castro's favourite restaurant where he would drop poison tablets into the revolutionary leader's soup. Height of the Cold War: Desperate to remove Fidel Castro, right, from power, President John F. Kennedy, left, resorted to using dangerous criminals as operatives - . rather than CIA agents - to 'do America's dirty work' The explosive claims come in a new book by veteran American Journalist and author William Deane, who claims specially-recruited criminals became 'untouchable' and were allowed to embark on 'crime sprees' in the US without fear of prosecution. Deane, former assignment editor at American news networks ABC and CBS, says he uncovered the programme - which he believes is still in operation today - after following the 'trail of destruction' left by one such operative. Though JFK did not order the setting up of the top secret programme, Deane says that as president Kennedy would have 'been aware' of it. 'For over 50 years, the CIA and American . government has been systematically releasing dangerous criminals back . into society to work for them on secret missions overseas,' said Deane, whose new book Smooth Criminal . details the life of alleged CIA operative and 'one-man American crime . wave' Dave Riley. 'The . programme started during the Kennedy administration at the start of the . 1960s as a clandestine means of dealing with the Communist threat of . Castro, and was given the seal of approval by JFK - who was still . smarting following the political embarrassment of the failed Bay of Pigs . Invasion of Cuba in 1961. 'One man American crime wave': The details of the plot were revealed by veteran journalist and author William Deane, whose new book Smooth Criminal, right, details the life of alleged CIA operative and 'one-man American crime wave' Dave Riley . 'Criminals were ideal operatives as . they were ruthless and willing to risk their lives during missions . rather than be sent back to prison. They also couldn't be officially . connected with the CIA so it didn't matter if they were captured - there . was no risk of America's shady policies being exposed. 'Riley . was a typical recruit. Highly intelligent, ambitious and with no . morals. The CIA sent him on many missions abroad, including to Cuba to . assassinate Castro,' added Deane. 'Between . missions he was allowed to do what he liked - which generally consisted . of embezzlement, fraud, gunrunning and drug dealing - without fear of . being arrested or prosecuted.' Warning: Deane claims the CIA continues to recruit hardened criminals to 'do America's dirty work' with impunity . Deane claims to have first encountered Riley back in 1961 while working as a DJ at a radio station in Miami, Florida. Riley, . then in his early 20s and with ambitions of being the 'next Frank . Sinatra', had connections with the Mafia and used his connections to . 'persuade' the radio station to play his records. Though . they lost touch, Deane next heard of Riley in April 1962 when working . as a cub reporter for a Miami TV station - after hearing he had hijacked . a plane to Cuba. According . to news reports, on Friday, April 13, 1962, Riley and an accomplice had . forced pilot Reginald Doan at gunpoint to fly them to the communist . island, where they planned to defect, only for the Cuban authorities to . imprison them before sending them back to Miami. Deane . says he was contacted by Riley prior to the Black Friday Skyjacking . trial and during that meeting revealed that he was working for the CIA . and had been sent to infiltrate Cuba as a spy. 'The skyjacking was just a smokescreen conjured up by the CIA after the mission went wrong. 'Riley confessed that he'd been . recruited by the intelligence agency while in prison for extortion of a . public official back in 1960, and had been sent to Cuba to carry out a . number of assignments - including one to assassinate Castro. 'He . had posed as a waiter at one of Castro's favourite restaurants and been . supplied with Botulinum tablets - an untraceable poison - by the CIA to . drop into his soup, but Castro must have got wind of the plan as he . suddenly stopped eating there.' Deane . admits that at first he thought that Riley was a 'fantasist' and, after . the criminal was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the skyjacking by . the U.S. Supreme Court in November 1964, largely forgot about him. JFK with military leaders in 1962: The programme started during the Kennedy administration at the start of the 1960s as a clandestine means of dealing with the Communist threat of Castro. but Deane claims the practice is still in use today . It was only after his retirement from CBS in 2005, when he started writing Smooth Criminal, that Deane discovered that Riley might have been telling the truth about the criminal operatives programme all along. Deane traced Riley's whereabouts from the time of the skyjacking trial onwards and found that far from serving his time in jail, he had apparently been back on the streets committing crimes within a matter of months. The journalist uncovered over 40 . newspaper reports of Riley's various crimes in archives and gained . further corroboration of his seeming invulnerability to prosecution . after tracking down several of his victims. He . added: 'Riley was a one-man crime wave who was allowed by the CIA, and . indirectly the president, to consistently get away with his crimes in . return for his occasional assistance. 'In . the late 1960s and early '70s he went on undercover missions to . Vietnam, Cambodia and other troubled South Asian countries, and back at . home got away with embezzlement, fraud, gunrunning, drug dealing and . sexual assault among other crimes. Smoking gun: Deane says Riley had posed as a waiter at one of Castro's (pictured) favourite restaurants and been supplied with Botulinum tablets - an untraceable poison - by the CIA to drop into his soup, but Castro must have got wind of the plan as he suddenly stopped eating there . 'He has left a string of victims across the USA over the last 40 years, but the police and FBI have been powerless to act because he is protected by the CIA. The agency maintains a policy of complete secrecy and doesn't want to risk compromising operations by having one of their operatives involved in a public trial. 'One unfortunate woman who came across Riley was swindled out of $20,000 - her life savings - and the deeds to several properties, but the police and Feds weren't allowed to warn her, and weren't allowed to stop him.' Deane says that he has evidence of Riley living in New York in 2005, but after that the scene goes cold. He claims requests for information from the FBI, CIA, Treasury and other government agencies were ignored and suspects Riley, now in his 70s, is either dead or has been placed into a Federal Witness Protection scheme to put him out of reach. Deane says he doesn't disapprove of America's criminal operatives programme per se, but has written Smooth Criminal to warn the American public about the programme in case they become victims of 'untouchables' such as Riley. He added: 'America has lots of enemies and security has to be maintained if we are to prevent another 9/11 so I am not against a programme that helps protect the nation. 'What I do object to is the CIA's insistence on complete secrecy. The rationale that a few Americans have to suffer for the sake of 315 million is not acceptable. 'It's sad and pathetic that totally innocent Americans have lost virtually everything, including their homes and businesses, while the Feds stood by and did nothing but protect their released criminals. 'The CIA should be capable of controlling freed criminals without exposing their clandestine operations, and if they can't, should discretely warn potential victims to keep away from these people.'","Revelations made by journalist Bill Deane in new book 'Smooth Criminal'

"Breakout: Benjamin Hudon-Barbeau is now back in custody after a daring jail break from a prison in Saint-Jerome, Quebec . Two inmates escaped from a prison in Quebec during an audacious operation in which a helicopter flew into the jail and airlifted the convicts away. A pilot, thought to have had a gun to his head, lowered the aircraft over the Saint-Jerome prison's exercise yard. Prisoners Benjamin Hudon-Barbeau, 36, and Danny Provencal, 33, held on to ropes attached to the vehicle before being flown away. Police later arrested four people 30 miles from the prison, including the two escapee inmates, who are said to have links to the Hells Angels biker gang. Hudon-Barbeau was arrested on Sunday, while police established a security perimeter around a building where Provencal had barricaded himself in. After negotiations the absconder eventually surrendered himself peacefully. Earlier on Sunday, police received a call from  Saint-Jerome jail, reporting the escape around 2:20 p.m. The jail's warden told police that Hudon-Barbeau and Provencal had grabbed a rope dropped from the helicopter to make their getaway, Richard said. One witness described the attempted escape as a 'James Bond moment'. A man, claiming to . be Hudon-Barbeau, called in to Montreal radio station 98.5 FM shortly . after the escape claiming he was trying to evade police and was 'ready . to die,' CBC reported. 'It will end badly,' the man said. 'I'll kill myself, . I'm 36-years-old, I was told that I would die in prison.' 'The way they're treating me in there, it's unreal,' the man told the radio station. 'They won't let me be. They put me back in prison for nothing.' Arrests: Police vehicles block a road just outside the town of Chertsey, Quebec, after the escape. Four people were later arrested . Authorities did not immediately respond to the claims made in the radio station interview. He also claimed to have been shot in the leg during the escape. The daring breakout resulted in an extensive manhunt, both by land and air, with police tracking down the helicopter in Mont-Tremblant, about 53 miles (85 kilometers) away from the jail. The helicopter's pilot, described as an 'important witness', was the only person remaining at the scene and was taken to a local hospital and treated for shock. Police declined to comment on press reports the pilot had a gun to his head and whether the helicopter had been hijacked. Hijacked: The helicopter was found miles from the scene with only the pilot still inside. Authorities believe the pilot, who was treated in hospital for shock, may have been forced to participate in the breakout . Scene of escape: Four people, including the two escapees, were later arrested. Reports suggest the two men have links to the Hells Angels . 'He's going to be questioned later on by investigators, within the . next couple of hours,' Sgt. Benoit Richard said. He said it was too early to know for certain what the pilot's role was in the escape. According to a provincial police report, Hudon-Barbeau was arrested in November on two firearm related charges and for associating with people who have a criminal record. The arrest came as part of an investigation of a double murder in Quebec. Yves Galarneau, the correctional services manager at Saint-Jerome jail, said there are no security measures in place at the jail to prevent a helicopter from swooping down from above. 'As far as I know, it's a first in Quebec,' he told reporters at the scene. 'It's exceptional.' Cut-off: A police block in place before the men were captured. Provencal eventually handed himself over after barricading himself in a building . A police Twitter feed reported that officers were in pursuit of a 'suspect vehicle' at 4:45 pm, according to the Globe and Mail. The . Saint-Jerome prison, located about 37 miles northwest . of Montreal, experienced a mini-riot by about a dozen prisoners a little . over a month ago. In that incident, police . were called in to secure the outside of the prison, which holds about . 480 inmates, and prison staff used pepper spray to disperse the mob. Although the tactic may have been a first for Quebec, a helicopter has been used in several other jailbreaks. A New York businessman, Joel David Kaplan, used a chopper to escape from a Mexican jail in 1971, later writing a book about it. Pascal Payet, a French prisoner, used a helicopter to escape on three occasions, only to be caught by authorities on every occasion.","Benjamin Hudon-Barbeau, 36, and Danny Provencal, 33, involved in escape .

"A retired architect has put his skills to work making a spectacular treehouse for lucky children in Terrell, Texas. James Curvan now spends his time building elaborate play areas for his friends' children and this one is truly a work of art. More like a mini-mansion than a treehouse, Curvan let his imagination run riot to create a complex building with a walkway, stairs, a ladder and a slide as possible options for getting in and out. Elaborate: Retired architect James Curvan now uses his skills to build treehouses for his friends' children . Mansion: James Curvan's play houses have different rooms and levels to explore . The interior is no less deluxe and well-thought out. The children can admire the scaled down fireplace, the wallpaper, telephone and pint-sized wooden furniture that make the treehouse so cosy. For warm weather, there is a table and chair set on the balcony or a separate shaded platform in the other tree, reached by a treetop walkway. The more adventurous children can also play on the built-in climbing wall and zipwire all in their own back garden. Paradise: Lucky children in Texas have had their most demanding specifications met in this adventure playhouse . Fairytale house: James Curvan spent his career building shops and houses but now he is letting imagination take over as a treehouse designer . Painstaking: It has serious attention to detail with street lights, window boxes and scaled-down topiary . Dog house: Not to be left out, even the family pet has his own luxury pad . Even the dog has been well catered for, with a small wooden kennel tucked in between the street lamp and the window boxes. However demanding children are these days, surely anyone would be impressed by this in their back garden. Rather than the standard draughty room with makeshift furniture, this is a treehouse that means business. Using his architecture degree from The University of Texas at Austin, Curvan has built more conventional shops and homes in the past, but now he gets to be a little more creative. Treetop adventure: Children playing on the walkway between the platform and the house . Cute: The interior has a country feel with wallpaper, elaborate pained windows and wooden furniture . Outdoor fun: There are several ways up to the house including a wooden ladder to clamber up . Walkway: There is an outdoor seating area over on the other tree for when it the weather is too good to sit inside . Welcoming: The entrance has a seating area and an elaborate stained glass window above the front door . Charming: The treehouse even has a tiled fireplace with a miniature grate . Dream house: Curvan says that he listens to exactly what the children want and then designs the details from there . James Curvan told County Line magazine that the key to his success was listening to the ideas of the children themselves. He said: 'They like certain colors, certain animals, and other things. I listen to what they want and then design from that.'After he has listened to the parents over the budget, he makes a scaled-down version of the finished product. Construction: The playhouse as a work in progress . The finished article: The treehouse looks deluxe and inviting from every angle . When he shows the children a model of their future treehouse, he says that 'their eyes pop open'.The intricate design looks no less impressive at night when the chimney, gable ends and balconies can all be seen clearly by the fairy lights. Curvan also does stage planning and set design. Spectacular: The miniature wooden mansion looks just as impressive by night .

Speaking earlier this week, he said: 'There is no way it can get down, if it jumps it will be splattered.' On Thursday night, with the light fading, crews retired for the night but placed a humane trap on the ledge, in the hope it would capture the animal. By that time, the grey and white cat, wearing a light blue collar, had spent at least 24 hours on the viaduct above Chestergate. A spokesman for the RSPCA, speaking on Thursday night, said: 'Officers from RSPCA and Greater Manchester Fire Service have spent the day doing all they can to try to rescue a cat stuck on a ledge on a viaduct on Chestergate Street, Stockport. 'The ledge is 90ft off the ground and 5ft from the top of the viaduct. 'An . RSPCA officer went up on a hydraulic platform on Thursday but the cat . wouldn't come to him so we secured a cat trap on the ledge which we . hope the cat will get into so that we can get it down.' How did you get up there? The cat's tiny figure can be seen in the middle of the viaduct 90ft from the ground and five foot from the top of the viaduct. RSPCA and firefighters used a hydraulic lift to get up to the cat . When RSPCA officers went back to the site this morning, they discovered the curious feline had taken the bait and was safely inside their cat trap. One RSPCA officer went up on the hydraulic platform to lift the tired and hungry cat down at about 12.15pm. A spokeswoman for the RSPCA said: 'It was a very precarious position the cat managed to get itself into.' The organisation is now looking after the cat at its centre in Salford and is appealing for the owner to come forward. 'We were hoping the cat was microchipped but it isn't so we don't know a name or who the owner is at the moment. 'It is certainly someone's pet because the cat is in good condition. It has been fed and watered and is at RSPCA Greater Manchester' Huge: The viaduct is a landmark in Stockport but posed a challenge for RSPCA officers and firefighters who had to try to reach the cat safely. They stopped as darkeness fell on Thursday but returned today to catch it .","Feline became stranded 90ft above Stockport, Manchester on Wednesday .

"A diver has spoken of the terrifying moment he was nearly swallowed by a 40-tonne whale. Rainer Schimpf, 47, was filming the annual sardine run off the coast of South Africa when a 15-metre-long Bryde's whale attacked a ball of fish below him. Luckily the giant mammal swerved at the last moment to avoid sucking him into its gaping mouth - but it still gave him a shock as it breached just yards away. Scroll down for video . Diver Rainer Schimpf, 47, has spoken of the moment he was nearly swallowed by a 40-tonne whale.  He was filming the annual sardine run when a 15m Bryde's whale attacked a ball of fish below him . He said: 'I saw him coming up and I thought 'that's it for me'. The diameter of his mouth was big enough to swallow a car - he would have barely felt me going in.'

The tour operator was out with guests and his wife, Silke, who managed to take a photograph as the whale breached just yards from her husband . The sardine run sees billions of the tiny fish migrating up the east coast of Africa - attracting sharks, dolphins, diving birds and whales - including the huge Bryde's whales.

A pod of dolphins attack a bait ball of sardines off the coast of Port Elizabeth. The diver said: 'I saw him coming up and I thought 'that's it for me'.

The sardine run sees billions of the tiny fish migrating up the east coast of Africa - attracting sharks, dolphins, diving birds and whales - including the huge Bryde's whales . Every year between May and July millions of sardines gather on a spectacular marine migration. They head eastwards from their cool spawning waters near Cape Town in search of zooplankton. Likened to east Africa's buffalo migration, the sardine run sees them spawn and migrate from the cool waters of the Agulhas Bank, northward to the warmer waters along the east coast. Shoals are known to be four miles long and one mile wide, and are clearly visible from the surface of the ocean. Followed by thousands of hungry dolphins, sharks, sea birds and seals, the sardines protect themselves from this onslaught by forming into giant balls called 'bait balls' which can measure as large as 65 feet, or 20 metres, in diameter. He said: 'There was a little bait ball below me and a group of sharks. It was only when the sharks scattered that I realised a whale was coming up directly at me. 'At the last moment he must have realised I was there and he diverted away from me and actually missed most of the bait ball. 'Had he not diverted he would have swallowed me whole.' He . added: 'Years ago there was a story about a guy who was swallowed by a . sperm whale. His friends managed to snare the whale and cut it open and . found he was still alive inside.

"A seven-year-old boy miraculously survived three nights stuck down a roadside service shaft in freezing temperatures of -10C after his faithful dog kept him warm. Raul Kutliakhmetov was trying to rescue the stray dog when he slipped and fell - leaving them both stuck in three-metre deep roadside service shaft. The boy and the dog were trapped inside the hole in for three days and nights - only managing to survive and avoid hypothermia by hugging each other for their body warmth. Man's best friend: Seven-year-old Raul Kutliakhmetov became trapped down a three-metre deep roadside service shaft while trying to rescue a stray dog near his home town of Bulgakovo in the Urals . Keeping each other alive: Raul and the dog huddled together to keep warm as temperatures in the shaft plummeted to -10C . A doctor who treated Raul told The Siberian Times: 'We are in awe at how he managed to survive, sitting inside there for three days. He told us that all that time his dog and him were clutching to each other trying to warm each other up.' More than 200 people joined the search to find Raul but it wasn't until rescuers heard the dog barking from the hole 72 hours later that they found the schoolboy. Raul, who was left weak and exhausted by his ordeal, and the dog were then both pulled out of the shaft. Speaking shortly after his rescue, Raul told the newspaper: 'I was coming back home from school and heard a strange noise. It was coming from inside the uncovered hole on the side of the road. I looked inside and saw my favourite dog down there'. Raul said he had often played with the dog in his home village Bulgakovo, in Bashkiria in the Urals, so didn't want to leave him trapped in the shaft. Large operation: More than 200 people joined the search to find Raul who was missing for three days . Saved: Doctors were amazed that Raul manged to survive in such freezing conditions . He then walked home to change clothes before returning to rescue the dog. But Raul then fell three metres down into the shaft and was unable to climb out. He said: 'I wanted to save the dog and fell inside; I was calling but no-one heard me. I'm shivering a lot and my legs and arms and aching'. The stone walls meant that Raul's calls couldn't be easily heard by rescuers. But road engineer Maksim Belskiy heard about the missing boy on the radio and decided to check the service shafts around the area with a colleague. They heard the dog barking and went in search of the noise. Then they discovered the boy and the dog huddled together. The stray dog was also rescued alive but has since disappeared.","Raul Kutliakhmetov was trying to rescue stray dog when he slipped and fell .

Despite that, the Reds have gone on to finish in the top four on the three previous occasions that they have had exactly 14 points after 10 games. Jose Mourinho’s side have been the most clinical in the top flight scoring with 23% of their attempts. Chelsea have netted four goals in the opening 15 minutes of matches this season, more than any other team in the top flight.

"Public health officials in the UK are grappling with a skyrocketing number of cases of a debilitating mosquito virus as British holidaymakers return from countries where an outbreak is rapidly spreading. Nearly 200 British tourists have been diagnosed with chikungunya in 2014 as the number of cases has quintupled in a little more than two months, according to figures released by Public Health England on Friday. Of those, 162 have been associated with travel to the Caribbean and South and Central America, where health experts say the deadly outbreak is likely to get worse. Scroll down for video... Outbreak: Public Health England has been made aware of 197 cases of chikungunya in 2014 . Public Health England has been made aware of 197 cases of chikungunya in 2014 as holidaymakers are encouraged to cover their skin and wear mosquito repellent if they are travelling to the Caribbean to beat the winter blues. The latest figures represent a 432 per cent increase from the last update on September 16, when just 37 cases had been reported in the UK. The countries from which cases have been most frequently reported include Jamaica, Barbados and Grenada. Dr Jane Jones, travel and migrant health expert at Public Health England, said: ‘Chikungunya is an unpleasant viral illness that can cause fever and joint pains which in some patients may persist for a prolonged period. ‘It is spread by mosquitos and is more usually found in parts of Asia and Africa but in recent years we have seen new areas of the world becoming affected, including the Caribbean and other parts of the Americas.’ Dr Dipti Patel, director of the National Travel Health Network and Centre, added: ‘There is no vaccine to prevent chikungunya. ‘Anyone returning from affected areas with symptoms such as fever and joint pain should seek medical advice.’ The chikungunya virus, transmitted through infected mosquito bites, has spread to more than 30 Caribbean nations since it was first reported by the World Health Organisation in December 2013, when a case was discovered in St Martin, a French overseas territory. With more than 700,000 suspected cases and approximately 120 deaths reported, experts are telling tourists to protect themselves if they are heading to the region for winter sun. Earlier this month, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported more than 1,600 travellers returning to the US with chikungunya as of November 4. More cases are being reported every day on the island as victims arrive at hospitals or surgeries with chikungunya symptoms, including fever, headaches, rashes and muscle and joint pain. The worst of the outbreak in the Caribbean is occurring in the Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Haiti and Martinique, where more than 600,000 suspected cases have been reported. Most of the UK cases involve tourists who visited Jamaica (pictured), Barbados and Grenada . Dr Tim Brooks, head of Public Health England’s rare and imported pathogens laboratory, said: ‘Chikungunya is now a common infection in travellers from the Caribbean, and is currently reported more frequently than dengue. ‘The Aedes mosquitoes which spread the disease are most active during daylight hours. ‘Particular vigilance with bite avoidance should be taken around dawn and dusk. ‘Doctors should consider chikungunya in patients with a fever who return from the Caribbean, especially if they have symptoms of arthritis, and test them for the disease.’ A tourist makes a purchase at a fruit and vegetable market in Grenada, where some Brits have fallen ill . Dr Laith Yakob, an infectious disease ecologist with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told MailOnline Travel earlier this month that people should speak to their GP or a travel doctor before their trip. Once they arrive, they should keep their skin covered during the day, as mosquitoes are ‘day biters’, and regularly apply insect repellent containing DEET, he said. And they should seek immediate medical attention at the onset of symptoms. He said: ‘For most people within three to seven days they’ll have fever, then joint pain in the hands and wrists can persist for weeks or even months. ‘The joint pain can spread and can be quite debilitating.’ Normally, the majority of UK cases are associated with travel to South and South East Asia, say experts . Patients are often left bedridden but they can recover within three to five days with proper treatment. Dr Yakob said the elderly are at particular risk of developing severe symptoms that can result in death. Trials of an anti-viral drug in the US have had positive results, but there is currently no vaccine commercially available. A small number of cases result in death and up to 10 per cent of patients suffer from arthritis, chronic joint pain and fatigue. Complications can include hepatitis, myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), and neurological and ocular disorders. Experts are telling holidaymakers to cover up while visiting Barbados (pictured) and other islands . Dr Yakob said the symptoms of chikungunya and dengue fever, also spread by infected mosquitoes, are similar, so people who believe they are infected should seek a proper lab diagnosis. The virus does not occur in the UK but Public Health England has been monitoring for signs of infected blood-suckers. Despite the rise in cases involving tourists who visited the Americas, a majority of UK cases are associated with travel to South and South East Asia, NaTHNaC says. In October, lab tests confirmed four people contracted the virus in Montpellier, France – prompting fears it could spread to the UK. Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted by infected female mosquitoes with symptoms including high fever, headaches, rashes and severe joint pain. After being bitten the onset of illness occurs usually between four and eight days but can range from two to 12. There is no vaccine or cure and treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. Most patients recover fully but in some cases joint pain may persist for several months or even years. Occasional cases of eye, neurological and heart complications have been reported, in addition to gastrointestinal complaints. Serious complications are not common, but in older people, the disease can contribute to the cause of death. The disease was first described during an outbreak in Tanzania in 1952 and has spread to nearly 40 countries in Asia, Africa, the Americas and Europe. Europe’s first transmission was reported during a localised outbreak that affected nearly 200 people in north-eastern Italy in 2007. Last month, France confirmed four cases of ‘locally-acquired’ infection in Montpellier. Since 2005, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Maldives and Myanmar have reported over 1.9 million cases. Experts say chikungunya shares some clinical signs with dengue and can be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common. The name ‘chikungunya’ derives from a word in the Kimakonde language, meaning ‘to become contorted’ and describes the stooped appearance of sufferers with joint pain.

"Islamic extremists are infiltrating schools, university campuses and scout groups across the UK, a new report has claimed. Hardline groups, blamed for radicalising young British Muslims, have posted invitations on social media sites and at university campuses to public talks in an 'unprecedented scale', according to Sharia Watch UK. The group, which monitors Islamic extremists, will publish its report highlighting the operations of 15 people it claims hold 'extremist views' who were allowed to give public talks or lectures at 20 institutions. Scroll down for video . Hardline Islam groups, have posted invitations on social media sites and at university campuses to public talks in an 'unprecedented scale', according to Sharia Watch UK. Activist Hamza Tzortzis is named in the report . They include the Islamic Education and Research Academy (iERA), whose speakers have been accused of advocating anti-Semitic and homophobic views, the Sunday Telegraph reports. The iERA is currently under investigation by the Charity Commission over regulatory issues in its 'policies for organising events and inviting external speakers'. But leading members of the group have given talks at universities, a school and a south London scout group, according to the Sharia Watch UK report. Among those addressing the lectures was chairman and founder Abdur Raheem Green, a British Muslim convert who is reported to believe that beating women will ‘bring them to goodness’. It is also claimed that he has said that adultery is punishable by a 'slow and painful death', and has been seen on a YouTube video demanding that a Jewish man is removed form his sight while giving a talk at Hyde Park Corner. According to the report he was booked to address an Islamic event at Acklam Grange Secondary School in Middlesbrough. Students from across the North East were also invited to attend. Among those addressing the lectures was chairman and founder Abdur Raheem Green, a British Muslim convert who is reported to believe that beating women will ‘bring them to goodness’ Activist Hamza Tzortzis is also named in the report, which states that he has claimed that anyone fighting against the Muslim community 'should be killed', adding that the punishment should be 'beheading'. The report, entitled Learning Jihad:  Islamists in British Universities, claims that he has been scheduled to give talks to the Universities of Dundee, Cardiff and Surrey and also the School of Oriental and African Studies in the six months leading to July. He is descriebd on the iERA website as a 'popular speaker' at UK universities. Figures supplied to the report's authors by Students Rights revealed there were 233 events of 'concern' posted on social media. The report, entitled Learning Jihad: Islamists in British Universities, claims that he has been scheduled to give talks to the University of Dundee among a number of others . An iERA spokesman told the Sunday Telegraph the group had no plans to infiltrate universities. They added: 'We are an educational academy and run open debates and educational talks and campaigns around the UK and overseas.' The spokesman went on to deny the group's members promoted anti-Semitism, homophobia, or violence against women. In September Home Secretary Theresa May announced sweeping new powers banning preachers of hate from public speaking or spreading their poison on social media. The Extremist Disruption Orders – which have been dubbed Asbos for hate clerics –  will also include anybody who seeks to ‘overthrow democracy’. In the past, the rules could have applied to spokesmen for Sinn Fein, such as Gerry Adams. The restrictions placed on the hate preachers will be backed by criminal punishments and a possible jail term. They could include a ban on speaking at public events. Anything they want to put on social media would have to be cleared by the authorities in advance, and the fanatics could also be banned from attending specific events and told who they can associate with, in powers that are similar to the now defunct control orders.","Hardline groups, blamed for radicalising young British Muslims, have posted invitations on social media sites to public talks .

"Canned: The BBC faces further questions over why a 10-minute Newsnight film looking into allegations of child sex abuse by Jimmy Savile (above) was dropped last December . The BBC today faced further questions over why a ten-minute Newsnight film looking into allegations of child sex abuse by Jimmy Savile was dropped by the programme's editor last December. The item was spiked - despite journalists interviewing ten alleged victims and witnesses, and believing they had enough information to broadcast the story. The corporation insisted that it decided not to proceed with the Newsnight film for 'editorial reasons' because the abuse story 'could not be substantiated'. But the programme was due to go out a couple of weeks before the airing by the BBC of Christmas tributes to the presenter. Sources within the BBC's newsroom said they feared that the corporation was embarrassed about the timing of the report, according to the Guardian. It came as veteran radio DJ Paul Gambaccini lifted the lid on how the Jim'll Fix It star used his power in the BBC to dodge sex abuse claims. Mr Gambaccini, 63, said said the world of showbiz had been aware of the claims of abuse by the flamboyant celebrity for decades before victims finally told their story this week. ITV will broadcast a documentary tonight, featuring claims from five women that they were sexually abused by Savile when they were girls. It builds on the unreleased Newsnight film and is based on an investigation conducted by former detective Mark Williams-Thomas, who acted as an adviser to the BBC team. Newsnight's work began almost immediately after Savile's death at the age of 84. A month later, the BBC team had persuaded one victim to be filmed on the record - while the others were only prepared to give evidence anonymously or under pseudonyms. The Newsnight reporters involved were confident enough in their material to put together a script for a ten- to 12-minute package, indicating they believed their film was largely complete, The Guardian reported. A source told the paper that initially editor Peter Rippon was understood to be ready to air it. However, the mood changed soon afterwards. It is understood that the reporters were asked to meet two preconditions set by Rippon. Cover-up? Newsnight, presented by Jeremy Paxman (above), spiked the film despite journalists interviewing 10 alleged victims and witnesses and believing they had enough information to broadcast the story . First, they had to demonstrate that there had been a police investigation into Savile. Newsnight was able to confirm privately that he had been interviewed under caution in 2007 - a fact not stated in public until Monday. At this point, a second condition was introduced. Newsnight had learned that the Crown Prosecution Service had concluded that it was not in the public interest to charge Savile, and the Newsnight team was asked to find out why. Some of those interviewed by the BBC said they believed Savile was not charged because by then he was too old. The production team were asked to confirm this with the CPS, but the prosecutors would only say they did not proceed against Savile for lack of evidence. It is understood that when this information was relayed to Rippon, it was used as the justification for quashing the film. On the defence: Newsnight editor Peter Rippon (above) said the current affairs show dropped the story because it 'had not established any institutional failure' on behalf of the police or Crown Prosecution Service . It is understood that Helen Boaden, the director of BBC News, was made aware of the Newsnight investigation as part of routine editorial procedures. But insiders said she did not take the final decision on whether the programme should be broadcast. A . Labour MP on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee said the BBC had to . look into the circumstances in which the Newsnight film was pulled, as well as . claims that Savile's alleged abuse of young girls was known about at the . corporation decades ago. Paul . Farrelly, who is himself a former journalist, said: 'Given the . seriousness of the allegations, it is incumbent on the BBC to . investigate what it knew, and when. 'That . investigation should also include a full look at the circumstances in . which this programme was withdrawn. What the BBC needs to specify in . particular is what it means by ‘editorial reasons’, which can cover a . multitude of circumstances.' Asked . why nothing was done, former BBC journalist and founder of the . ChildLine child-protection charity Esther Rantzen told Channel 4 News: . 'Maybe it was just the fact that Jimmy knew everybody. 'We made him into the Jimmy Savile who was untouchable, who nobody could criticise.' Mr Rippon said the current affairs . show dropped the story because it 'had not established any institutional . failure' on behalf of the police or Crown Prosecution Service. Writing . on a BBC blog, Mr Rippon said it was 'totally untrue' he had come under . any pressure to drop the story from within the corporation. He . said: 'I decided we should pursue the story because of the nature of . the allegations and because the key witness told us the police had . investigated the claims. But the case had been dropped on the grounds he . was too old. 'This . made the public interest case from a Newsnight point of view potentially . strong. If we could establish some sort of institutional failure we . would have a much stronger story.' He . added the CPS told Newsnight no action was taken against the star . because of 'lack of evidence' and 'it would not be correct to say that . his age and frailty was the reason'. Mr . Rippon said: 'I felt it was significant the guidance was included and . we had not established any institutional failure, and I judged it . weakened the story from a Newsnight perspective. I took the decision not . to publish.' Influential: Sir Jimmy Savile (left) used his power and . influence at the BBC to keep the lid on sex abuse claims, according to . veteran radio DJ Paul Gambaccini (right) 'Jimmy knew everybody': ChildLine founder Esther Rantzen (left) said Savile had become 'untouchable' to the point where nobody could criticise him . Lib Dem MP Adrian Sanders, who is also on . the culture select committee, said the key issue was whether someone at . the BBC had made a complaint: 'That would be a game changer.' Meanwhile, the BBC has said it will . make direct contact with police to provide full support over the . 'disturbing allegations' involving Savile. It comes as a historic rape allegation made against the entertainer was referred to Scotland Yard by officers in Surrey. A . spokesman for the BBC said: 'A number of serious and disturbing . allegations have been made over the past few days about the sexual abuse . of teenage girls by Jimmy Savile. 'Some . of these allegations relate to activity on BBC premises in the 1960s . and 70s. We are horrified by allegations that anything of this sort . could have happened at the BBC - or have been carried out by anyone . working for the BBC. 'They are allegations of a serious criminal nature which the police have the proper powers to investigate. 'So . we have today asked the BBC investigations unit to make direct contact . with all the police forces in receipt of allegations and offer to help . them investigate these matters and provide full support to any lines of . inquiry they wish to pursue.' 'Horrified': The BBC has said it will make direct contact with police to provide full support over the sex abuse allegations involving the Jim'll Fix It star . The investigations unit is a division of the BBC responsible for security and safety matters within the corporation. It was also revealed yesterday that Jersey and Surrey police both investigated accusations made against the entertainer about alleged abuse in two children’s homes, but decided there was not enough evidence to proceed. A spokeswoman for Jersey police said: 'During the course of the States of Jersey Police’s historic abuse investigation, a verbal allegation of indecent assault said to have occurred during the 1970s at the former children’s home Haut de la Garenne was received. 'The allegation was investigated but there was insufficient evidence to proceed.' In 2007, Surrey Police received an allegation of indecent assault that was alleged to have taken place at a children’s home in Staines during the 1970s. The force said: 'The allegation was investigated and an individual was interviewed under caution. 'The matter was referred to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision who advised there was insufficient evidence to take any further action.'","Film canned despite ten alleged victims and witnesses being interviewed .

"This is the chilling moment a gunman was caught on security camera just seconds before shooting a taxi driver three times. The bearded man jumped into the back of a cab in the Bronx area of New York in the early hours of Sunday, police said. He then pulled out a gun and threatened driver Raphael Martinez, 54, in his cab around 5.10am when the driver did not understand his demands. A goateed gunman was caught on CCTV tape moments before shooting a livery-cab driver in The Bronx early on Sunday morning . The unknown assailant threatened driver Raphael Martinez, 54, in his cab around 5.10am . The attack was captured on the in-car security cameras. According to the New York Post, police said he shot at the cab driver five times, hitting him twice, before waiting until the wounded, married father of three stumbled outside the vehicle — and shot him again. Police said the incident happened at White Plains Road and Lafayette Avenue in the Soundview section. The victim was hospitalised but is now in a stable condition, at Jacobi Medical Center. His brother Julian Martinez said: 'My brother was saying, ‘Wait! I don’t understand you!’ and [the perp] just started shooting. '[The gunman] didn’t give him time,' Julian said. 'He just shot him. All he had was $8.' Manny Lopez, a dispatcher at DAT, the livery service where the victim works, said that after the shooting, the driver had called for help via his radio. Raphael Martinez was in stable condition last night. The suspect, described as a man in his 20s, was last seen wearing a tan bubble jacket and a hooded sweatshirt with 'Abercrombie Fitch' written on the front as seen in the images here.

"Died today: Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm. He inspired a generation of the New Left but was accused of being an apologist for Stalinism . Eric Hobsbawm, the eminent Marxist historian, died yesterday at the age of 95. Professor Hobsbawm, who once described himself as an ‘unrepentant communist’, was a towering figure on the British Left  for decades. Born in Egypt to Jewish parents, he fled Nazi Germany in 1933, coming to Britain where he became a prolific writer and hugely influential thinker. His books were studied by generations of history students, and his history of the 20th century, . The Age Of Extremes, has been translated into more than 40 languages. He faced criticism in later years for continuing to promote communism long after it had been discredited in Russia and Eastern Europe. But admirers said that his humanity and interest in ordinary people transcended his hardline political beliefs. Labour Party leader Ed Miliband yesterday led the tributes to a man he said had ‘brought history out of the ivory tower and into people’s lives’. Mr Miliband, whose late father Ralph was a close friend of Professor Hobsbawm, described him as ‘a lovely man, with whom I had some of the most stimulating and challenging conversations about politics and the world’. He added: ‘Eric Hobsbawm was an extraordinary historian, a man passionate about his politics and a great friend of my family. Long association: Birkbeck College, London, where Mr Hobsbawm began as a lecturer in 1947 and was finally appointed president in 2002 . 'Giant of progressive politics': Former PM Tony Blair, left, led tributes to Mr Hobsbawm today, but the historian's critics have accused him of being an apologist for the brutal policies of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, right . ‘His historical works brought hundreds of years of British  history to hundreds of thousands of people.’ Professor Hobsbawm’s daughter Julia said yesterday that her father died overnight at the Royal Free Hospital in London. He had been suffering from pneumonia and leukaemia. She said: ‘Right up until the end he was keeping up what he did best, he . was keeping up with current affairs. There was a stack of newspapers by . his bed.’ He spent his career as a lecturer at Birkbeck College in London, becoming its president in 2002. Despite his communist sympathies he was made a Companion of Honour in 1998, placing him in the ranks of luminaries such as Stephen Hawking, Doris Lessing and Sir Ian McKellen.","Lifelong Communist inspired a generation of thinkers on the New Left .

"In 1984, the year Frankie Goes to Hollywood's Relax finally hit the top of the UK charts, Britons' destination of choice was Spain followed by France. Thirty years on, with Taylor Swift telling us to Shake It Off, France has dropped out of the top three altogether and Spanish is relegated to third place. When it comes to a short haul holiday the nation's favourite is now Italy leading with 11.7 per cent, according to an independent survey by One Poll commissioned by James Villas.

"CLICK HERE to read Sunni Upal's full match report from the O2 Arena . Stars from the worlds of sports and showbiz turned out in force to watch the fifth regular season NBA contest staged in London when the struggling New York Knicks came up against the Milwaukee Bucks at the sold-out O2 Arena. Around 60 Premier League players were believed to be in on the guest list, although few are likely to have had better views than those shared by Arsenal legend Thierry Henry and Chelsea team-mates Cesc Fagregas and Didier Drogba from their courtside seats. Gunners midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain did, however, get close to a couple of Knicks cheerleaders for a glamourous photo taken backstage. Henry, who could have picked up his affection for basketball while playing in the MLS for New York Red Bulls, was given a standing ovation when his image was flashed up on the big screen ahead of the game. Other sports stars at the event included former England striker Michael Owen, the England rugby union team's No 8, Billy Vunipola, and British heavyweight boxing sensation Anthony Joshua.

On court, the Knicks could not halt their dismal run of 15 straight defeats and, despite a late fightback, were defeated 95-79 by the Bucks in front of a sell-out 18,500 crowd in the capital.

Brandon Knight also had 20 points, while Giannis Antetokounmpo (16), Khris Middleton (14) and Zaza Pachulia (11) also reached double figures in another impressive team performance by Jason Kidd’s side. The defeat for the Knicks was their 16th in a row and 26th in their last 27 matches. It was also a third straight loss against the Bucks this season. ‘It’s not good enough and we have to get better,’ New York Knicks head coach said. ‘We have to work harder than what we are and put more time and effort in to get the results that we want. ‘We have played against this team four times including pre-season and they’re just better than us.’ Reality TV star Millie McIntosh of Made in Chelsea fame strikes a pose on the red carpet prior to the game .

Thursday night’s game was the fifth regular-season contest to be staged at the arena in south London since 2011, and one of the most one-sided. Two years is a very long time in basketball. In January 2013, the Knicks came to London and brushed aside a Detroit Pistons side 102-87 on their way to finishing second behind the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference. This team is not even a shadow of that side, and they return home with their league-worst record at a dire 5-36 with their next win seemingly a world away. Even the return of Anthony from injury couldn’t keep things close against a young, dynamic Bucks side that moved to 21-19 for the season and remained well and truly on course for a play-off spot in the Eastern Conference. London fans will at least be happy that Anthony was on the court after making the long trip over having missed the previous six games with a knee injury. Anthony played 27 minutes and scored 25 points, but they were all in vain for the London 2012 Olympic basketball gold medallist.","The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the New York Knicks 95-79 in the fifth regular-season NBA contest staged in London .

"It is famous the world over as the picturesque setting of the default iPad screensaver. But while the beautiful Pyramid Lake, in Nevada, may look tranquil, legend has it the spirits of sick children and a heartbroken mermaid lurk beneath its waters. Members of a Native American Paiute Tribe, who have lived by the 350 foot sink for centuries, claim dark secrets are concealed in the depths of the lake. The beautiful Pyramid Lake, in Nevada, is known the world over as the default iPad screensaver - but some claim dark secrets are concealed in its depths . Members of the Native American Paiute Tribe, who have lived by the 350 foot sink for centuries, believe the lake is haunted by the ghosts of disabled and premature infants thrown into it . According to the myth, the lake is haunted by the ghosts of disabled and premature infants thrown into it. Visitors have reportedly heard the cries of the 'Water Babies', who were hurled into the lake because they would not survive the harsh desert climate. It is also said to be home to a mermaid who married a member of the tribe but became embittered after being banished from the village. She apparently swore revenge on anyone who came too close to the water's edge, and locals warn of the dangers of straying close to the shoreline. The saying goes: 'If you hear them you will have bad luck, if you see them you are dead.' Landscape gardener Simon Robinson, 37, . spent a day by the lake because he is a 'big iPad fan' and wanted to see . where the shot was taken. The lake provides the picturesque setting for the default screensaver on the iPad . Mr Robinson said: 'I'd heard it had was one of the most spectacular desert lakes in the world. 'I only heard about the legend when I was filling my car with petrol and the Native American woman at the garage asked me what had brought me there. 'She said they have a few Apple fans coming through and she always tells them the legend of the ""Water Babies"" and the mermaid. 'She . said she didn't believe herself, but enough people in the area had . heard or knew people who had heard strange childish voices by the lake. 'It happens especially in spring. The lake is also said to be home to a mermaid who married a member of the tribe but became embittered after being banished from the village . 'She added it was easier to wind up the older tourists than the Apple fans, who were more likely to ""believe in machines than the supernatural"".' He also spoke to a fisherman going out on the lake on a boat. Mr Robinson said: 'When I asked, he said that of course he had heard of the legends and he knew that fisherman drowned each spring. 'But he put it down to bad weather conditions and the fact that the lake gets very deep very very quickly after the shore. 'He believes that fisherman come up, drink beers, get drunk, loose their footing and fall into the 350ft deep lake. Members of a Native American Paiute Tribe say the lake is haunted by the ghosts of disabled and premature infants thrown into it. Pictured is the 23rd Annual Las Vegas Paiute Snow-Mountain Pow-Wow, hosted by the Las Vegas Paiute Tribe in 2011 . 'He did joke that it could be a mermaid who had a taste for drunken anglers. 'The Mermaid legend is thousands of years old going back to a time when the tribe settled the area. 'But the origins of the Water Babies legend is in dispute. 'Some claim it could actually be a white pioneer legend that denigrate the so called ""savagery"" of the local tribe that has sometime become associated with the tribe themselves while others deny it. 'The jury is still out really. Whatever the truth, it's a stunning place.' Chief Winnemucca, of the Northern Paiutes, who died in 1882 . The term Paiute refers to three related groups of Native Americans indigenous to the Great Basin. The Northern Paiute were traditionally from eastern California, western Nevada and southeast Oregon, while the Owens Valley Paiute are based on the California-Nevada border. The Southern Paiute meanwhile traditionally lived in the Colorado River basin and Mojave Desert in northern Arizona and southeastern California, southern Nevada and southern Utah. The Northern Paiute's lifestyle was well adapted to the desert environment in which they lived, with each tribe or band occupying a single territory, usually centred on a lake or wetland. Each band were named after a characteristic food source - the people at Pyramid Lake were known as the Cui Ui Ticutta, meaning Cui-ui eaters. Sustained contact with Euro-Americans came about during the early 1840s, prompting a number of violent incidents as the Euro-American settlement progressed. The Pyramid Lake War of 1860 was one such confrontation.","Members of Paiute Tribe claim dark secrets are concealed in the lake .

"A mother-of-five relived her terror as she hid just feet from the Kenyan mall terrorists, with nothing more than a flimsy table to shield her young daughters. Katherine Walton, an American who lives in Kenya, had been shopping with her five children at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi on September 21 when shooting erupted. Mrs Walton scrambled to hide under a flimsy table with her three daughters - four-year-old Portia, Gigi, two, and baby Petra as the terrorists stalked the main floor, just feet from they were poorly hidden. Scroll down for video . Mrs Walton races from the mall carrying her two-year-old while a Kenyan woman shields her baby under the cover of police officers . Katherine Walton recalls her horrifying ordeal when she was forced to shield her three young daughters under a flimsy table during a terrorist attack on the Westgate mall in Nairobi, Kenya on September 21 . Mrs Walton told NBC's Dateline tonight: 'I think the first thought was, ''I really . can't believe this is happening.'' 'And then it was, you know, just . instinct to grab the girls and run. … A Kenyan woman came and scooped up . Portia.  And we both ran right behind this - display table.' The frantic mother's next thought was for her two sons who had wandered off to do their own shopping elsewhere in the mall. She called them to tell them not to come out of the store and hide. Teenager Blaise Walton told Dateline . that he had been at the cash register with his younger brother, ten-year-old Ian, . when they realized that something dreadful was happening. Blaise said: 'Everyone looked to the main entrance and then people go flying through the air.' The boys ran to a store room where they arranged bags of flour around them and pulled stacks of toilet paper rolls over their heads. His younger brother, ten-year-old Ian, added: 'All my brother and I did was just pray for our family and laid there.' Portia Walton, five, ran to Mr Abdul Haji from where she had been hiding from terrorists with her mother Katherine and sisters. Her mother can be seen crouching behind a table in the rear of the picture . The five Walton children survived the terrorist attack at the Kenyan Mall on September 21 . Mrs Walton meanwhile was trapped on the main floor of the mall where al-Shabaab terrorists were stalking with large weapons, looking for victims to shoot dead. The mother recalled: 'I saw them.  I saw two whole men. … They . were talking very slow, and as I've thought about it, they almost had a . demeanor like they owned the place. They looked my direction. … It was . pretty terrifying.' Mrs Walton calmed her daughters by rubbing their backs and making soothing noises as they stayed frozen in place for four and a half hours. The Walton family meet Mr Haji again - who four-year-old Portia knows as the man who saved her life . Finally, there was a glimmer of hope. The Kenyan woman turned to Mrs Walton and said: 'The cops are here.' However it wasn't the police - but a Good Samaritan volunteer Abdul Haji. The businessman had been having a meeting nearby when he heard about the Westgate attack and ran to help his brother, an undercover agent for the Kenyan intelligence service - bringing his own handgun. He saw the women cowering with the little girls, saying that Mrs Walton 'looked very scared'. Husband and father Phillip Walton was thousands of miles away in North Carolina on business when his family were caught up in a terrorist attack . With a few words he planned an exit strategy with Mrs Walton but then her five-year-old Portia burst out of their hiding place and went running towards Mr Haji. Mrs Walton said of her daughter: 'She's typically kind of cautious, maybe a little bit anxious and - not one just to get up and run … I think she saw the hope.' The image of the brave five-year-old running across the mall became one of the most poignant of the massacre where at least 67 people died. Luckily for the family, the Walton sons were also rescued from their storeroom hiding place after around four hours. For husband and father Phillip Walton, 39, who was in North Carolina on a business trip at the time, it was an incredibly harrowing time. He told the Today show: 'I was trying to follow news reports as they came in.I had a close friend who was keeping me updated via Facebook. 'You just feel very helpless when you’re 9,000 miles away and you know that your entire family is going through something like this.'

"There was anger last night after Scottish and Welsh members of Team GB refused to sing the National Anthem. Footballer Kim Little said she had made a ‘personal choice’ not to sing it before her team’s matches at the Olympics because she is Scottish.

Staying silent: While other sang around him Welsh footballer Ryan Giggs, (pictured centre) was criticised for failing to sing the National Anthem at the first British men's football match of the Olympics . Team GB line up for the NAtional Anthem, which Craig Bellamy (far left) and Ryan Giggs (far right) refused to sing . Decision: Footballer Kim Little said she had made a 'personal choice' not to sing it before her team's matches at the Olympics because she is Scottish . And last night Welsh footballers Ryan . Giggs and Craig Bellamy were criticised for failing to sing the National . Anthem at the first British men’s football match of the Olympics. Their decisions are likely to cause huge offence to many fans of Team GB. Miss Little’s family said the . 22-year-old footballer had chosen not to sing the anthem ‘because she is . Scottish’. The rarely sung fifth verse of the anthem, written in the . 1740s, includes the controversial words: ‘Rebellious Scots to crush.’ The British Olympic Association was . said to be furious about her decision. A spokesman for the association – . which has previously stated that all athletes should learn the National . Anthem – gave a terse statement saying: 'It's an individual choice (as to whether or not to sing), but the most important thing is to show respect.' Other British athletes openly . criticised her stance. Former javelin thrower and Olympic silver . medallist Fatima Whitbread said: ‘I think it’s a poor show if you are . competing under a British flag and you don’t feel proud to be British. Bellamy silences his critics netting from a Ryan Giggs cross to put Great Britain ahead . All smiles: Bellamy's Anthem snub is quickly forgotten as he opens the scoring for Team GB . Patriotic: Team GB manager Stuart Pearce proudly belted out the national anthem before the game . ‘It’s fine for you to believe in . Scottish independence and to have your own beliefs – there has always . been a bit of a rivalry – but if you are competing under a British flag . you need to feel British.’ But Miss Little’s grandfather William . Little, 82, who is an SNP voter and wants an independent Scotland, said . he ‘supported her 100 per cent’ in her decision. ‘It’s the national anthem of England, . and she is Scottish,’ he said. ‘It is her decision and I support it 100 . per cent. I would have done the same. In my personal view I would like . to see a Scotland team at the Olympics.’ He admitted his granddaughter’s decision would ‘offend some people’, but added: ‘I don’t think that’s a bad thing.’ A young Team GB fan gets into the Olympic spirit with her face painted up in patriotic red, white and blue . Young fans cheer on the British men at a packed Old Trafford . Come on, boys: Young shirtless fans enjoy the action . In a BBC interview Miss Little, who is . from Mintlaw, Aberdeenshire, said her decision not to sing the anthem . was ‘just a personal choice’. After the match that night, she told reporters: ‘I’m delighted to be representing Scotland in the Great Britain team.’ Her father Calvin Little, 55, an NHS worker, said he was not aware of his daughter’s decision not to sing the National Anthem. He said: ‘I wouldn’t say she is a . nationalist. She is very patriotic for Scotland. She is cheering for . Team GB and we’re very pleased and we’re very proud of her.’ The second Scottish player who could . be seen not singing the anthem, Miss Dieke, was born in Massachusetts to . Nigerian parents but mostly raised in Scotland. Crowded House: Old Trafford was nearly full as the fans flocked to Manchester for Team GB's opening group game . Line up: Team GB pose for the traditional pre-match photo . The Senegal team pose for picture ahead of kick off . Joy: Senegal's Moussa Konate celebrates scoring the late equaliser that denied Team GB a winning start . She qualified to play for the USA, the . gold medal favourites, but rejected their overtures eight years ago in . favour of the country where she was brought up. The 31-year-old defender, who plays . for Swedish side Vittsjö GIK, has said: ‘I came to Cumbernauld when I . was three-and-a-half and Scotland is the only country I would feel . comfortable playing for... Scotland’s all I’ve known from an early age.’ It was not known last night if Giggs . and Bellamy had made an active decision not to sing the anthem at the . start of the match against Senegal. Giggs, who is the Team GB men’s . football captain, has previously said he is ‘Welsh and proud of it’ but . sees it as ‘nothing but positive’ that he can play for Team GB as well. But his and Bellamy’s failure to sing . drew criticism on football forums and Twitter. One forum member wrote: . ‘Ryan Giggs and Craig Bellamy not singing the national anthem of Great . Britain was bang out of order! They should be honoured to be there!’ Another wrote: ‘I think it’s down to . the fact that they feel under pressure not to sing the national anthem, . probably get slated by the taffies.’ However, the two Welshmen did their . best to deflect any criticism of their commitment to the cause by . combining for the opening goal, with Bellamy netting off a Ryan Giggs . cross. But there was heartbreak for Team GB as Senegal drew level with less than ten minutes to go. It was Britain's first Olympic men's . football match since 1960, but it's 100 years since they last lifted . gold in this tournament. And in contrast to the disappointing crowd that watched the women's opening game, 72,176 turned up to watch the men in action. Giggs, 38, had said before the game: 'To . be involved in a tournament at such a late stage of my career is one . I'm looking forward to. Show of support: A young fan painted her face with the Union Jack, while another fan shows her support for one man whose omission threatened to overshadow the team's preparations . Olympics spirit: A Senegal fan is all smiles before kick-off . 'All the lads have embraced it, we were fortunate to go to the village last week, you want to enjoy the Olympic experience but the bottom line is you want to win football matches.' But it follows another embarrassing day for the Olympic organisers after Welsh player Joe Allen was described as English in the official programme. The midfielder, who speaks fluent Welsh and plays for Swansea City, is one of five Welshmen in the Team GB squad but the only one mistaken;t identified as English. A London 2012 spokeswoman said: 'There was an error in our programme and we inadvertently listed Joe Allen as English.

"Those who decided to skip Black Friday shopping in favor of a trip to the Grand Canyon yesterday got to see the natural wonder from an extraordinary perspective. Due to a rare weather phenomenon, the canyon's famous gorges were filled with a river of fog.

"Dozens of frustrated onlookers jumped into the surf to try to save a beached humpback whale after repeated attempts to rescue the 15-20 tonne mammal at Palm Cove had failed throughout the day. Despite freezing temperatures and the high risk of danger, the footage on Channel Nine News shows the spectators deciding to take matters into their own hands by using their combined weight to move the eight-metre mammal as light was fading. But the juvenile humpback whale will spend a second night on the shore after authorities informed the exasperated onlookers that it was too dangerous to continue the rescue mission in the dark.

Authorities informed the exasperated onlookers that it was too dangerous to continue the rescue mission in the dark . The whale has experienced a distressing 24 hours after it washed up on the beach at 6.30pm on Tuesday night and was actually freed Wednesday afternoon but was soon washed onto the shore again. The dedicated team was placed in a hairy situation earlier in the day when the whale rolled over on its back almost trapping the rescuers who quickly clambered out of the way. There was then grave concerns that the mammal would drown before it eventually flipped back over as the relieved crowd cheered. The tireless operation began at sunrise when a harness from Sea World was put around the whale and attached to a rescue boat but all three attempts to tow the heavy animal failed with the rope snapping every time. As the tide went out half way through the day, the rescuers were left with no choice but to shelter the whale and keep it wet with buckets of water. The rescue operation will resume at sunrise on Thursday.

There was then grave concerns that the mammal would drown before it eventually flipped back over as the relieved crowd cheered . The juvenile humpback whale will spend a second night on the shore and the operation will resume at sunrise on Thursday . This is the third whale to have beached in the past 24 hours with two rescued in NSW on Tuesday night during the whales' annual migration from Antarctica to their breeding grounds in the Great Barrier Reef. A spate of humpback whales becoming beached on east coast beaches is a positive sign of the species' staggering recovery in Australia from almost extinction to nearly 50,000 in under 30 years, an expert has said. If the population continues to rise at such a high rate there will soon be more whales on Australia's east coast than existed in the natural population before commercial whaling began. Scroll down for video . Covered: The stranded Humpback Whale on Palm Beach, Gold Coast, has had a tent erected around it while Sea World staff tended to it . Waiting game: Rescue teams made numerous attempts to rescue the whale but to no avail . There were just 200 humpback whales left alive on the east coast of Australia before the commercial whaling ban was introduced in 1986 - now they are flourishing, with 20,000 currently migrating along the shores. 'Australia's humpback whale population are increasing rapidly and are recovering as a result of the ban on commercial whaling,' Southern Cross University Professor Peter Harrison said. 'We have seen a 10 per cent increase in births this year and expect another 2000 whales to be added to the population,' he told MailOnline. 'Back then in the last century very few people were studying them but it's estimated before whaling there were 23-26,000 whales. 'At present we expect to exceed 30,000 whales on the east coast in the next decade,' Dr Harrison explained. He added if you combine the west and east coast whale populations, Australia could now have around 50,000 humpback whales. Another humpback whale was stranded on a sand bank at the Gold Coast earlier in the week, but finally managed to swim its way to freedom two days later . Help is at hand: The whale calf is tended to by Sea World staff after beaching itself at Palm Beach on the Gold Coast . Crowds: People gathered to see the whale on the beach before further attempts to return the whale to deeper water began again at high tide around 5pm . The huge population rise will eventually even out when the whales use up the ocean's natural resources. A Sea World spokesman told Mailonline there is no 'real reason' why whales strand themselves but there are more wales around at the moment which is why the number of incidents has risen. 'There are 20,000 whales on the Gold Coast in this migration,' he said. 'As for why some are stranded there is no real reason, it all depends on the whales individual behaviour.' A resident alerted authorities about the latest beached whale about 7pm on Tuesday night, after spotting it near the Palm Beach shoreline. 'It's pretty dangerous. This animal is probably around 15 to 20 tonne. Once the tide starts to come in, which it's doing now, you can't really get close to the animal because it could roll, it could lift it's tail,' Sea World spokesman Trevor Long told the ABC. 'So we'd ask that no-one goes down there and tries to get close to the animal.' Sea World staff are involved in Wednesday's Queensland rescue effort, and hope to use a harness to tow it back out to sea. Stranded: The huge creature was hoped to be freed at first light on Thursday . 'Pretty dangerous': Sea World spokesman Trevor Long told the ABC said that people shouldn't get close to the whale . Rescue operation: A team helping to try and free the whale after it was spotted on Tuesday night . 'Currently the tide is against us, we are waiting for this afternoon to free it,' a Sea World spokesperson told MailOnline. A second distressed humpback whale was trapped in fishing nets for more than eight hours at The Pass in Byron Bay on Tuesday. The whale reportedly had a rope wrapped around its dorsal fin and tail, and was spotted at first light on Tuesday morning. New South Wales Parks and Wildlife service kept and eye on the whale early in the day and in a joint effort with Queensland Fisheries officers managed to free the animal just before 4pm. Also on Tuesday, a third whale was freed off NSW on the far south coast in Narooma. The migration period runs from July until October when the whales make the return journey to their southern feasting grounds. The International Whale Commission banned commercial whaling in 1986 to conserve depleted species . Only last weekend two groups of humpback whales were spotted heading north a few hundred metres of Bluff Rock near Yeppoon.","A 15-20 tonne whale was freed on Palm Beach, Queensland on Wednesday afternoon but then was soon washed up again .

"Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's support from voters has plummeted and he is now as unpopular as Julia Gillard ever was, a new poll has revealed just days after his government delivered a harsh first budget. This comes as Mr Abbott launched a stunning riposte in defence of the budget on Sunday, saying 'selective hearing' from the electorate was to blame for any confusion over the cost-cutting package. Labor has been boosted to a 12 percentage point lead over the Coalition in the two-party vote at 56/44, the monthly Fairfax-Nielsen nationwide phone poll showed on Monday. Mr Abbott says he has delivered a budget in line with Australians' expectations, despite 75% of people polled by Galaxy claiming they will be worse off . Mr Abbott's negative rating has also hit minus 28 per cent, which is as low as any number former Prime Minister Ms Gillard recorded at her most unpopular. Labor leader Bill Shorten has also jumped to an 11 point advantage as preferred prime minister over Tony Abbott for the first time ever, leading 51 per cent to 40. Since Treasurer Joe Hockey delivered the budget on Tuesday, the Abbott Government has been fending off accusations they broke election promises. Mr Abbott spent Sunday again defending the budget, which includes a Medicare co-payment, pension cuts and a fuel excise rise. In one interview the Prime Minister admitted his first budget included 'increased taxes' and in another he pointed to selective listening for confusion about election promises. 'Well, I know that people hear different things,' Mr Abbott told ABC's Insiders TV program. Mr Abbott's negative rating has hit minus 28 per cent, which is as low as any number recorded by former Prime Minister Julia Gillard (pictured in September 2013) Meanwhile Labor is using the Budget as chance to show a united front. At the annual Australian Labor Party Conference in Melbourne, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten told members the budget had brought Labor together. 'This terrible budget of the Abbott Government, it has defined the Labor party,' he said on Sunday. 'Friends, the Labor Party nationally has its voice back.' Labor will oppose doctor co-payments, a raised pension age, restrictions on unemployment benefits, cuts to state funding and the fuel excise. Also on Mr Shorten's hit list is Mr Abbott's 'juvenile' paid parental scheme. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten and his party will oppose key measures of the budget, including the doctor co-payment and pension cuts . The Opposition Leader claims millionaires will have an extra $50,000 in their pockets they don't need. 'See how that goes for pensioners trying to get an extra smear of vegemite on their toast on day 13 of their budget,' Mr Shorten said. Labor are joined by The Greens and Palmer United Party who are also opposing several measures. It means Mr Abbott will have to push hard to win Senate support for the harshest of his budget measures. The Labor party are not the only one opposing the new cuts and payments. The Greens and the Palmer United Party are also opposed to the measures . Mr Shorten went on further to say the Government was using the state's cuts to schools and hospitals funding as a smokescreen to hit taxpayers with another tax. 'They are actually increasing taxes through the back door,' he told Labor members. Mr Shorten said the states had no other choice but to raise the GST to recover the lost funding. Labor have labelled it blackmail as well as the Greens. Tony Abbott says everyone needs to help pay down the nation's $667 billion debt . But Mr Abbott said it was about ending handouts the Government could not afford. 'What I've got to do is ensure that at the Commonwealth level, we are not living beyond our means, we're not mortgaging our future and piling up never-ending debt for our children and grandchildren,' he told Fairfax radio. While Mr Abbott and Mr Shorten gave their two cents, state and territory leaders gathered at an emergency meeting in Sydney to discuss the $80 billion hole left in state funding due to cuts in Tuesday's budget. But the states quashed any chance of a GST or income tax hike - it was something else on their minds. Following Labor's lead, the leaders took a united front and called for an urgent Council of Australian Governments meeting prior to July 1. Tony Abbott said no election promises were broken when Joe Hockey (pcitured) handed down his budget . And they aren't the only ones feeling the pinch. Sunday's latest Galaxy poll, published by News Corporation, showed 75 per cent of people thought they would be worse off because of the budget. And thousands of protesters who rallied in capital cities reflected that position. But Mr Abbott continues to insist that the budget was in line with what his government promised, including stopping the boats, cutting the carbon tax, funding better roads and getting the balance sheets under control. 'I don't want to plead the fine print but I do believe that we have fundamentally kept faith with people,' he said. Mr Abbott said everyone had to share the burden caused by Labor 'spending like a drunken sailor'. But the Prime Minister did not renew threats to hold a double-dissolution election over the budget, saying the crossbenchers would understand the harsher measures.","Prime Minister's support from voters has plunged, new poll shows .
His negative rating has hit minus 28 per cent - as bad Julia Gillard .

"A strange reenactment of a replica of a big whale being harpooned has been used as a source of entertainment at a festival in Japan.

"Fighter: Phoenix bus driver Todd Allen Shields was arrested Friday for beating up a passenger . A bus driver in Phoenix, Arizona was arrested Friday for beating up a 21-year-old man who tried to use a reduced-fare metro card for minors. The driver, 45-year-old Todd Allen Shields, was stopped at the Montebello and 19th Avenue bus stop in Phoenix when the young man tried to get on his bus with the reduced fare card. Shields didn't believe that the man was young enough to use it and demanded he show ID. The man refused and that's when . things got heated. A verbal argument ensued and eventually the bus . driver threw the man off the bus. Desirae Madrid was on the bus when the fight took place and recorded the incident on her phone. 'The bus driver stood up and picked . him up to where the kid's feet was literally off the floor and threw him . out and I just remember seeing the kid fly off the other side of the . little block that's there and his feet were literally in the air,' Madrid told Fox 10. Outside . on the sidewalk the driver continued to punch and beat the man - even . slamming his head onto a metal bench. Only one man tried to break up the . fight. While Madrid . noticed other passengers recording the incident, she was the only one to . call police and wait around to give a report of what happened. She says she watched her video over and over, and it still shocks her to see what happened. 'It makes me angry and sick to my stomach,' Madrid told ABC 15. 'He is the driver and deals with the public every day. He is supposed to be a professional.' The driver is an employee of Veolia Transportation, a Phoenix city contractor that runs the bus system. They released a statement Friday saying that the driver was put on investigative leave, pending a formal investigation into the incident. Suspended: Shields was put on investigative leave on Friday, in a statement released by his employer - Veolia Transportation . 'I hope that the bus driver loses his job and can't work with [the] public,' Madrid said. Shields was arrested Friday afternoon and charged with assault in addition to disorderly conduct and criminal damage. Police say the man he beat up is ok, and only suffered minor injuries.","Todd Allen Shields, 45, was arrested Friday after beating up a 21-year-old  passenger who tried to use a reduced-fare metro card for minors .

"Kentucky Republican Senator Mitch McConnell is poised to take over control of the upper house of Congress in January, but his mild-mannered governing style won't include a push to repeal the Obamacare health insurance overhaul law completely. 'If I had the ability, obviously I'd get rid of it,' he told reporters at the University of Louisville political institute that bears his name on Wednesday, in a press conference that ended in a rare round of applause. And 'it's no secret that every one of my members thinks Obamacare was a huge legislative mistake,' he jabbed . McConnell did preview some targeting of a few of the Affordable Care Act's more vexing provisions, however – including 'pieces of it that are tremendously unpopular with the American people.' He singled out a medical device tax that he said has driven jobs overseas, the individual health insurance mandate, and a 50-full-time-employee compliance threshold that has pushed hundreds of thousands of employers to cut workers' hours and alter 'the 40-hour work week' with temporary hires. Scroll down for video . IN CONTROL: Mitch McConnell, the soon-to-be-anointed US Senate Majority Leader, fielded question Wednesday about jobs, Obamacare, trade, energy, government shutdowns and immigration . DOLDRUMS: President Barack Obama, shown Tuesday at a White House meeting on the Ebola crisis, has been backed into a corned by a Republican sweep, left with only a veto pen in his bag of tricks . 'These are the kinds of things that I believe there is a bipartisan majority in the Senate to approve,' he told TIME magazine. Stripping the individual mandate out of Obamacare, however, would likely have the same effect as killing the law entirely. Without a legal requirement that Americans have health insurance, there's not likely to be enough money in the system to subsidize government-funded Medicare and other benefits for Americans who can't afford to buy insurance policies. All seven Republicans who won previously Democratic Senate seats on Tuesday campaigned heavily on an Obamacare repeal. McConnell also told TIME that winning approval for the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline would be part of his first to-do list. 'We haven't had an energy bill in seven years,' he lamented during his Wednesday press conference. McConnell was cautious on Wednesday in predicting how he would work with President Barack Obama, a staunch liberal whose policies were largely repudiated Tuesday night. 'The veto pen is a pretty powerful tool,' McConnell admitted, but he said trade issues and tax reform could help the two pols meet in the middle despite conservative tea partiers' instincts to resist cooperating. 'What's exporting jobs is having the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world,' he said. McConnell spoke on the phone with Obama before he talked to reporters, and suggested that the White House was willing to roll up its sleeves – and that the president was nearly as frustrated with Harry Reid's Senate slow-walking leadership as Republicans were. 'The House passed over 300 pieces of legislation' in the last two years, he claimed, 'many on a bipartisan basis, and nothing was done with them in the Senate. We're going to go back to work and actually pass legislation.' And Obama, he said, told him: 'Send us trade agreements. We're interested in looking at them.' McConnell told reporters he would adopt the Cold War negotiating strategy of 'Trust but verify.' 'We'll see if we can work with the president,' he said. 'I hope so. ... we'll find out.' And ultimately, 'there's only one Democrat who counts: the president. ... Democrats in Congress will support whatever he agrees to do.' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell will take over control of the upper chamber of Congress from Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, and laid out part of his agenda in a rare sit-down interview . CRUSHED: Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes was a distant second in Tuesday's election, handing McConnell another term in the Senate – and the keys to the highest office in Congress . Asked how he planned to respond to the Obama's promised unilateral action on immigration, the newly minted Senate leader pointed to congressional budgeting. 'The way that you push back on executive overreach is through the funding process,' he told TIME. 'We’re going to pass a budget. We’re going to pass appropriations bills.' 'Appropriations bills are going to have prescriptions of certain things that we think he ought not to be doing by either reducing the funding or restricting the funding.' He put it more crisply on Wednesday, saying the Republican-led Senate would 'use the power of the purse to push back.' Obama is expected to announce soon a dramatic overhaul of immigration policy that could include a temporary amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants. While he lacks the power to redefine the requirements for legal resident status without help from Congress – now a practical impossibility with the GOP in charge – the president can halt deportations and even issue green cards and work permits that would be in effect until the end of his term in office. In order to pull that off, however, the Department Homeland Security would need funding from Capitol Hill. DHS recently invited contractors to bid on a project that would enable the agency to create as many as 34 million new documents to help illegal immigrants mainstream themselves into American society. GOP leaders were wary on Wednesday about Obama's intentions. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told reporters that 'The president has consistently lied to the American people ... on immigration reform.' He promised an all-out push to generate public support for his party's priorities. But McConnell's biggest challenge – on Obamacare, immigration and other key issues – could be the thought of working closely with tea party conservatives in his own caucus. He was standoffish with his fellow Kentuckian Rand Paul in 2010 during election season as the right-winger squared off against a McConnell-favored moderate in the Republican primary. FIGHTING WORDS: Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told reporters on Wednesday that 'the president has consistently lied to the American people ... on immigration reform.' BLUEGRASS CAUCUS: Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (left) helped McConnell with his tea party street cred, and celebrated Tuesday night on stage with McConnell and his wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao (right) Once Paul prevailed and became the GOP's candidate, however, McConnell was in the mood to make friends. McConnell himself faced a tea party challenger this year, and it was Paul who helped him restore his street cred among conservatives. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will be another thorn in the new majority leader's side. He has said he plans to agitate for a wholesale Obamacare repeal, likely an empty gesture as the president holds a veto pen. TIME asked the senator about the possibility of a government shutdown if Obama holds fast on his policies and Republicans push back with threats to cut off funding on a large scale. 'No. There is no possibility of a government shutdown,' McConnell said. 'Remember me?' he laughed. 'I’m the guy that gets us out of government shutdowns.'","'There will be no government shutdown, so no default on the national debt,' said McConnell, previewing a US Senate under Republican control .

Huge waves could be seen crashing against the breakwater in Hartlepool today. Tomorrow will see a North and South divide as the North stays dry, but rain moves across the country from the South West bringing showers in the South and parts of Wales . More showers and windy weather is expected on Thursday across the whole country, but Friday should be more settled, with some dry and sunny spells . Although the weather is expected to be warmer over the weekend, there is no guarantee that it will be dry with wet weather set to return on Saturday and Sunday in Scotland and Western areas . The weather is also expected to feel warmer at the end of the week, with possible highs of 21C in London on Friday. But the wet weather is set to return for the weekend, with heavy rain forecast for Scotland and Western areas. 'Some places will have seen half a month's rainfall in the last 24 hours, but the rain is now petering off,' said Laura Young, of the Met Office. 'We've had a good run of fine weather and now we are seeing typical Autumnal weather. 'The weekend is looking unsettled but the exact detail is unknown at the moment. It will be windy everywhere but we don't yet know if the showers will stay in the South West or spread.' Hayfever sufferers face autumn misery with imminent warm weather threatening a spate of itchy eyes and runny noses (file picture) Hayfever sufferers face autumn misery with imminent warm weather threatening a spate of itchy eyes and runny noses. Levels of fungal spores in the air are set to rise from 'low' to 'moderate' in parts of Britain later this week. Doctors are already seeing more patients needing medication when numbers should have started to drop by now, they said. And with an Indian summer likely to push temperatures to 21C (70F) by the weekend, Britons are bracing themselves for things to get worse. Nottingham-based GP Dr Ian Campbell said: 'I have seen more hayfever patients coming for their medication than usual at this time of year. 'I saw a family just this week who were sneezing, I don't know why this is, it is very unusual especially as it has been quite wet recently. 'I don't recall it being this bad last year, hayfever is a problem in August and into September but this far into October is very unusual.' The Met Office said pollen and fungal spore counts are expected to remain at moderate levels in parts of the country until Friday. The problem this year has been made worse by a growth spurt of Ragweed, a plant native to the United States which after invading Britain filled the air with highly allergenic pollen grains. The plant is rarely found in the UK as it requires warm weather before the first winter frost to survive. But experts say this year has been ideal because of the long summer and extended warm weather into autumn. The Met Office said two types of fungal spores - Cladosporium and Sporobolomyces - are the most abundant with levels only likely to drop when the weather gets colder. Allergy UK's scientific director Dr Jean Emberlin said: 'At this time of year there are fungal spores in the air but very few places measure this so we have to go on the weather. 'Levels of spores rise in warm and dry weather, and although they affect fewer people than pollen in the summer there will be those suffering from seasonal allergic rhinitis as a result. 'The message is that people should not assume they have a cold if they find themselves sneezing but that it might be an allergy, and cold medicine will not help if it is.'","Much of the country lashed by rain and winds of 40mph overnight as the dismal spell of October weather continues .

"Caroline Flack was on holiday in Ibiza when word finally arrived that after keeping her hanging on for most of this year, ITV bosses had decided she wouldn't be part of the next series of The X Factor's popular spin-off show The Xtra Factor. She promptly went out and got raging drunk. She's not the type to moan about how difficult things are. She prefers to say things are 'challenging'. They certainly can be when you work for Simon Cowell, whether you're a rags-to-riches talent show winner, a highly paid judge or a presenter. Taken its toll: Caroline says that therapy was helpful in changing the way she thinks as she is a self-confessed worrier . Caroline's been the successful host of The Xtra Factor since 2011, and while the main show's ratings plummeted during that time, her chemistry with co-host Olly Murs made sure The Xtra Factor's went up. But the world and his wife had been auditioning for the role as she stood by smiling. Now – even more cutting – her job has been given to Radio 1 DJ Sarah-Jane Crawford. As Simon would probably say – with the inevitable shrug – 'that's showbiz'. The news of her departure was broken by Caroline herself on Twitter. Caroline was met with a flood of online abuse when she started dating Harry Styles who was 14 years her junior . 'After three brilliant years of hosting The Xtra Factor it's time to pass the baton. It's been incredible and I'll never forget it,' she said. Today she's stoical about the cut-throat nature of the business. 'With this industry you have to learn to cope with the ups and downs quite early on – you have  to be prepared for what it's like,' she says. 'It's a competitive industry and there will always be other people who want to do your job. I very much know what the industry is like. It makes it fun and interesting. You do it because you love it. The ups are good and the downs can be challenging. 'I don't see it as being bad at all – it's an exciting time. Simon keeps changing his shows on a regular basis, and change is healthy when it comes to television. Even if you look back at his programmes from five years ago they look dated. He's always discovering something new.' Caroline, 34, is putting on a brave face. She tells me she's a born worrier, and if she prefers to see challenges rather than difficulties that's because she endured a baptism of fire when she was first thrust into the limelight after she started dating One Direction's Harry Styles, who was 14 years her junior, shortly after she started on The Xtra Factor. The two met when she interviewed him on the show and he bombarded her with emails until she agreed to a date. They were in a relationship for three months. Not everyone was happy about it, to put it mildly. She was branded a 'cradle-snatcher' and inundated with hate mail, one magazine even showed its readers how to make a voodoo doll of her. 'When the bullies first started it became a bit all-consuming and I got a bit lost in my thoughts,' she recalls. 'It was horrible. But the more you learn about Twitter the more you realise it's an outlet for people to be angry. I was always comfortable in my own skin until people started criticising it. They'd talk about my appearance and call me fat. At first I thought, ""What have I done wrong?"" Now I know there are a lot of angry people out there. You don't get the ups without the downs, or the downs without the ups. Brave face: Caroline announced her dismissal from the Xtra Factor via Twitter last week . She first went for therapy many years earlier when her parents divorced, and found the techniques she learnt then helped her get over the online bullying. 'For me, therapy was a way of changing the way you think,' she says. 'I do over-think things. I've always been a worrier, ever since I was a child. My twin sister has always been the complete opposite and I think I worry more about her than she does about herself. Her three children call me Aunty Safe when they're with me; I'm over-protective. I'm prepared for every eventuality.' Caroline's a grafter who discovered quite young that if going in one direction doesn't work, there can be another way around. Growing up in rural Norfolk with her three siblings, she always knew she wanted to be on TV – she just wasn't sure how. 'I was a massive TV addict because I lived in a village where there wasn't much going on – it was a sort of escapism,' she says. 'I was obsessed with Grange Hill and EastEnders and wanted to live in their world.' Knock back: One of Caroline's best friends Radio 1 DJ Sarah-Jane Crawford will replace her on the Xtra Factor . She started appearing in local pantos and studied musical theatre in Cambridge before moving to London with the dream of treading the West End boards. She never has; she found work as an actress on the comedy sketch show Bo' Selecta! and was considered so funny she started getting work as a presenter. 'Things worked themselves out in a way I never expected,' she says. 'Although there's part of me, the little actress in there, that would still like a go doing musical theatre.' She's now dating music manager Jack Street – a mere ten years her junior – who recently moved into her north London flat. 'I wouldn't say I'm completely settled down,' she says, adding that some of her favourite times are when she's completely alone with just the TV for company. She recently posed with a baby bump at a friend's baby shower, but purses her lips when I ask whether she's planning to have babies with Jack. 'That's a difficult question. I do hope for a family one day but not right now. I hope I get to have children, though; I think that's the point of life.' She laughs at her reputation as a cougar – a woman who likes to go out with younger men. 'I suppose if someone is going to force you into a category it's a fun category to be in. No one really knows what's going on in my private life, though. Everyone has their secrets. I could be known for something a lot worse. It's not a bad way to live your life.' She's just hosted a new comedy panel show Viral Tap on Channel 4 and presented the celebrity Soccer Aid match a couple of weeks ago which raised more than £5 million for Unicef. She's also the face of communications company TalkTalk. She recently helped it celebrate signing up its millionth TV customer. She's busy enough, she insists, and says she's pleased with the way things are progressing. 'I'm living out my ambition. Each job is as challenging as the last. My hope is just to keep on working and I'm ambitious for a nice long career. I'm looking forward to whatever it is I do next.' Caroline is helping TalkTalk say 'thanks a million' to its 1 million TV customers.","Caroline Flack has become known as quite the cougar .

Meanwhile to the left of the picture another fight is taking place between a larger women wearing yellow and a woman in a green t-shirt. This bout is more of a wrestling match than boxing and the larger lady users her extra weight to gain an all-important advantage.

"A Georgia teenager who was homeless for most of her time at school credits hard work for her being made valedictorian of her graduating class. 'I just told myself to keep working, because the future will not be like this anymore,' Chelesa Fearce, from Clayton County, said. The 17-year-old, who had to live in her mother's car sometimes, did so well at Charles Drew High School that she will start college as a junior in the fall. Scroll down for video: . Ambitious: Homeless schoolgirl Chelesa Fearce has been picked to be valedictorian at her high school . 'Worry about being a little hungry sometimes, go . hungry sometimes.

Chelesa's grades were good enough for her to enroll in Advanced Placement courses for her last two years of high school. She also achieved a SAT score of 1900. She is due to attend Spelman College in Atlanta in the fall. The schoolgirl's mother, Reenita Shephard, said that although the family of five sometimes had an apartment to live in, it was only ever for a short time. 'Ended up back in another shelter . because I got laid off from my job maybe about four or five times, . she said. The family regularly had to move apartments, or live in shelters, hotels or the family car, while they still had one. 'My mom, whenever we're in that situation, she always finds . a way out of it.

"Britain cannot go on as a 'bloated, high-taxing, welfare-heavy nation', David Cameron warned today as he set out the 'moral case' for tax cuts. The Prime Minister said it was 'morally wrong' for the government to spend money 'as if it grows on trees'. He said major changes to the tax system introduced by the coalition and promised by the Tories will mean the average worker get a £3,800 income tax cut between 2015 and 2020. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron said there was a 'moral case' for cutting taxes to 'incentivise' work' Mr Cameron vowed that tax cuts could go ahead even while spending cuts are being made to balance the books. He argued that it was better to ‘incentivise work’ instead of allowing people to languish on welfare, and improved people’s living standards. The Tories have put two major tax cuts at the heart of their bid for re-election. At the Conservative conference earlier this month, Mr Cameron promised that no-one earning the minimum wage - equivalent to £12,500-a-year - would pay any income tax at all, he said, giving a tax cut to 30million people. He also announced the point at which the 40p tax rate is levied would rise from around £42,000 to £50,000 - a huge boost for middle class families. The two commitments, which he later pledged to start implementing straight away even before the deficit is due to be eliminated, will cost £7.2bn a year which is as yet unfunded. It prompted speculation that departments such as schools, defence and local government could be asked to take major budget cuts if the Tories win the next election. In an article justifying the move today, the Prime Minister said cutting taxes was at the heart of his pitch for the next election and drew a ‘stark choice’ between the Conservatives and Labour. ‘Nowhere is the contrast more stark than on taxation’, he wrote in The Times. ‘Labour wants to put up taxes on people’s homes, jobs, pensions — even their deaths. 'Conservatives are committed to cutting your taxes. We know the economic case for cutting taxes: in a competitive world we cannot afford to carry on as a bloated, high-taxing, welfare-heavy nation. ‘We have to direct our resources to incentivising work through tax cuts and not incentivising welfare through extra benefit entitlements. ‘We have to fight the notion that you can endlessly suck more taxes out of businesses and bite the hand that feeds…For me, the simplest way to help with living standards is this: allow people to take home more of their own money.’ In Mr Cameron’s first comment on how these tax cuts would be funded, he said they would be ‘hard but doable’. Tory tax cut promises prompted speculation that departments such as schools, defence and local government could be asked to take major budget cuts . George Osborne has already announced the next government would have to make £25bn worth of savings, starting with a new squeeze on welfare for those aged under 21. He went on to say that apart from the economic case there was also a ‘moral case’. He wrote: ‘It is morally right that the rich pay their fair share in tax; and right that those who are able to contribute to our public services and safety nets do so. But what is morally wrong is government spending money as if it grows on trees. ‘Every single pound of public money started as private earning…a huge amount of hard work: early morning alarms, long commutes, hours spent on the factory floor, the office, the hospital ward or the classroom. ‘On the other side of the coin are those who work hard, many on low incomes, who would desperately like to spend more money on their family.’ The article suggests Mr Cameron will try and see off the threat from Ukip with an attractive economic pitch – offering tax cuts to those struggling on low incomes. But Labour’s Chris Leslie the Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said the promises were not borne out by Mr Cameron’s actions. ‘While millionaires have been given a huge tax cut, ordinary working people are paying more because he raised VAT and cut tax credits’, Mr Leslie said. ‘Independent figures from the IFS show that by next year families will be £974 a year worse off because of tax and benefit changes since 2010. And David Cameron still won’t rule out raising VAT again on families and pensioners to pay for £7 billion of unfunded tax promises.’ Chris Leslie MP, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, responding to David Cameron’s article in The Times, said: ‘David Cameron will be judged on his actions, not his words. He’s raised taxes 24 times. While millionaires have been given a huge tax cut, ordinary working people are paying more because he raised VAT and cut tax credits. ‘Independent figures from the IFS show that by next year families will be £974 a year worse off because of tax and benefit changes since 2010. And David Cameron still won’t rule out raising VAT again on families and pen-sioners to pay for £7 billion of unfunded tax promises. ‘Labour’s economic plan will introduce a lower 10p starting rate of tax for 24 million people on middle and low incomes and cut business rates for small firms. ‘We will tackle tax avoidance and introduce a mansion tax to invest in our National Health Service. And to balance the books in a fairer way we’ll reverse David Cameron’s £3 billion tax cut for the top one per cent of earners.”","Prime Minister claimed reducing taxes helped to 'incentivise work'

"In a crisis, Peaches Geldof is nothing if not versatile. Having accidentally tipped her baby out of his buggy while chatting on the phone, the young mother expertly demonstrated how to scoop him back up…while carrying on the conversation. Miss Geldof, 23, was quick to point a finger of blame for the calamity at London’s potholed pavements. Multi-tasking: Peaches out with Astala, left, before the buggy tips and crashes after hitting a pothole, right . Over he goes: Little Astala lies half out of the pram, but Peaches still has her phone in hand . Writing about the incident on Twitter, she said four-month-old Astala wasn’t injured. She insisted he had been strapped in but it would appear he was saved mostly by the hood of his buggy. ‘It’s impossible to see these cracks when pushing a pram,’ she wrote. ‘The Mayor of London should do something about it it’s ridiculous!’ Miss Geldof married rock singer Thomas Cohen, 20, on Saturday. The pair bought a flat in East London, before Astala was born in April. They wed in the same church where the family said goodbye to her mother Paula Yates 12 years ago. Friends and family of the couple made their way to the picturesque St Mary Magdalene at St Lawrence Church in the village of Davington, near Faversham in Kent. It is the second wedding for Sir Bob Geldof's daughter who wed American singer Max Drummey in Las Vegas in 2008. Hands free: She continues to chat as she gathers him up and is still on the phone as she comforts him . Blame: The new mother took to Twitter to point the finger at the state of London's potholes . The couple split in February 2009 but were not divorced until April 2011. Many of those arriving at the wedding were seen sporting retro-inspired outfits and there were certainly a number of snappy styles on show. On Friday Peaches posted a snap of her left hand to her Twitter page and wrote: 'Very soon my engagement ring will have a wedding band under it! SO excited- my last few days of not being a wife!!!!' Peaches was known for being a party girl in her late teens and early twenties but has settled down in recent years. Earlier this week the DJ enjoyed her hen party at a sushi restaurant in London but the event was an extremely timid affair with Peaches back at home before 11pm. Peaches and Tom announced their engagement in December last year and shortly after they revealed that Peaches was expecting their first child. Peaches' mother Paula died from a heroin overdose in 2000 leaving her and her sisters Pixie, Fifi and Tiger Lily to be brought up by Geldof.","Little Astala was tipped out of his buggy after it hit a pothole .

'If you make the tragic mistake of using these weapons, there will be consequences and you will be held accountable.' The president didn't go into further details about what this would entail.

"For more than 32,000 years, dogs have been our faithful companions, living, eating and breathing with us as we moved from cave-dwellers to city-builders. Around this time, the planet lost our closest cousins - and, many argue, our competitors: Neanderthal man, who had previously occupied present-day Europe for a staggering 250,000 years. Now, an anthropologist is suggesting these two facts may be related - and it was our close friendship with our canine associates that tipped the balance in favour of modern man. Pat Shipman said that the advantages that domesticating a dog brought for us were so fundamental to our own evolution, that it made us 'top dog' out of the competing primate species. All gone to dust: A lifelike museum figure of a Neanderthal Man is one of the few reminders of the past . Shipman analysed the results of excavations of fossilised canid bones from Europe, during the time when humans and Neanderthals overlapped. The research first of all established a framework to our early 'best friend' relationships, with early humans adding dog teeth to jewellery, showing how they were worshipped, and rarely adorning cave art with images of dogs - implying dogs were treated with a reverence not shown to the animals they hunted. The advantages dogs gave early man were huge - the animals themselves were likely to be larger than our modern day pooches, at least the size of German Shepherds. Because of this, they could be used as 'beasts of burden', carrying animal carcasses and supplies from place to place, leaving humans to reserve their energies for the hunt. An artist's impression of a Neanderthal site in Britain, in the days before Home Sapiens arrived on the scene . Lost in time: Neanderthal Man now only lives on in our fiction, dramas, and occasional excavations . In return, the animals gained warmth, food and companionship, or, as Shipman puts it, 'a virtuous circle of cooperation'. They may also have influenced how we communicate. Humans and dogs are the only animals which have large 'whites of the eyes', and will follow the gaze of another person. This has not been found in other species, and it is argued that, as our man-dog relationship evolved, we learned to use these non-verbal cues more often. As such,dogs became one of the first tools, or technologies, that humanity began to use, and as the relationship developed both ways, it became a lot deeper ingrained into our psyche. And, in those early days where every advantage was needed to survive, Neanderthal man might simply have been unable to cope with the new species which rapidly moved across Europe. In short, Shipman said: 'Animals were not incidental to our evolution into Homo sapiens - They were essential to it. They are what made us human.'","Dogs were our first 'tools', helping us reserve our energies for the hunt .

"It has become a craze with humans, and even pets have been getting in on the act. And now, it seems, even wild fish have been infected with photobombing, judging from these pictures of Gavin, who has become the main attraction for divers near Green Island, off Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

Photobombing is genuinely considered to ruin people's pictures but, as these snaps reveal, tourists are delighted when he becomes part of their holiday memories. Karl Kuhle, general manager for Seawalker Australia, said grinning Gavin had become something of a celebrity. He said: 'Gavin's been around for a couple of years now, and he looks forward to coming over and grinning his lovely little head off at all our guests. 'He does seem to actually swim up for his photo, and with a free feed on offer and gorgeous females for company, who wouldn't be smiling? 'Seriously though, in some photos he seems to have less of a grin than others, but I reckon he's still having a ball.' Centre of attention: Gavin loves stealing the limelight but is equally happy playing with his mates once the tours have packed up for the day . Pucker: Some might say Gavin has a bit of a narcissistic streak as he sidles up for another snap . Karl said the diving tours operate within the guidelines of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to ensure conservation. Bluebarred parrotfish like Gavin grow up to 1m-long and to 6.5kg in weight. Their teeth in both jaws are fused into a parrot-like peak. Adults normally swim alone and feed by scraping algae from the reef and coral. Gavin and his species are vital to the reef-building process because they crush rubble and dead coral into sand as they feed. He said: 'We feed less than 1kg of approved fish food per day to the hundreds of fish that like Gavin, enjoy meeting Seawalker guests. 'Our staff do the feeding, not the guests, but they get to enjoy watching him come up and grin into their faces as he swipes a little feed. 'I would realistically expect that from a conservation viewpoint there is little difference , regulations help ensure this, by our presence in the water. 'We operate for less than six hours a day, so Gav and his mates are off elsewhere or just hanging around for the other 18 or so hours.'",Fish can't resist hijacking divers' photographs by the Great Barrier Reef .

"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made an awkward gaffe during a radio interview yesterday by confusing Britain's main political parties. While being quizzed by Jenni Murray for Woman's Hour, Clinton suggested that the Conservatives and Tories were opponents, when in fact the two names refer to the same party. The gaffe is particularly embarrassing for Clinton as she used to be Secretary of State, and so is expected to have extensive knowledge of foreign affairs. Scroll down to listen . Despite being a former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton managed to confuse the names of Britain's two main political parties yesterday . It is a role she will likely campaign on when it comes to the presidential race in 2016, which she is widely tipped to enter for the Democrats. Speaking about the 'special relationship' between Britain and the US, she said: 'There's not just a common language, but a common set of values that we can fall back on. 'It doesn't matter in our country whether it's a Republican or a Democrat or frankly, in your country, whether it's a Conservative or a Tory' Despite the stumble, Hillary appeared to be back on track while giving a similar interview half an hour later to Jeremy Vine on Radio 2, when she correctly identified Britain's two main parties as Conservative and Labour. During the Woamn's Hour interview, Hillary also spoke about her marriage to Bill, saying that forgiving his infidelity was 'absolutely the right choice' for her - but adding that she respects women who choose not to pardon philandering husbands. In a wide-ranging interview with BBC radio, Mrs Clinton said forgiveness is 'a choice' but that she is 'grateful every day' that it was a choice that she made. While speaking with Jenni Murray on Woman's Hour (left), Clinton made the error, but corrected herself half an hour later when speaking with Jeremy Vine (right) identifying the two main parties as Labour and Conservative . 'It's not by accident that the great religions, the great writers, talk about how the person who forgives is liberated maybe even more than the person who is forgiven,' she told Woman's Hour on Radio 4. But in a sign of her commitment to politics and public office, the former secretary of state also described the moment of the U.S. commando raid to kill Osama Bin Laden as 'the most stressful 30 minutes of my life.' But she laughed at the occasion Vladimir Putin made it clear that he would have preferred her husband's company out tagging polar bears in the Arctic, describing her relationship with Russia's president as 'fascinating'. She said the pair had managed to find common ground in issues including wildlife trafficking but added that she had also had 'some very difficult and strong disagreements with him.' 'He is someone who is trying to move Russia backwards to regain greatness, as opposed to taking Russia, with all of its assets and talents of its people, and moving it forward,' said Mrs Clinton. 'I think that's his conflict. 'He has a tendency to want to impose his will, first on the Russian people and then on people on his borders, as we've seen on Ukraine but also on Georgia and elsewhere. 'I think you have to be strong in dealing with him, and patient.' Hard questioning: In a wide-ranging interview with BBC radio presenter Jenni Murray, Mrs Clinton said forgiveness is 'a choice' but that she is 'grateful every day' that it was a choice that she made . Widely expected to make a second bid . for the president in 2016, Mrs Clinton appeared on Woman's Hour to talk . about her new book, Hard Choices, an account of her four years as . America's top diplomat. But . with Monica Lewinsky also in London this week, presenter Jenni Murray . pressed her on personal issues that went far beyond her role in the . Obama administration. Mrs . Clinton initially tried to dodge a probing question about how her . perception of Ms Lewinsky, the former White House intern with whom Mr . Clinton admitted having had an 'inappropriate relationship'. 'That's . something that we have certainly moved beyond and our country have . moved beyond,' said Mrs Clinton, before changing tack to talk about the . U.S.'s economic problems. But pressed by Murray to explain what it is about her husband that allowed her to forgive him, Mrs Clinton said: 'Forgiveness is a choice and I fully respect those who don't make that choice, for whatever reason. 'But for me it was absolutely the right choice. And it is something that is incredibly difficult but I am grateful every day that that's the choice that I've made. 'I have counselled others to see if, in their own hearts, they can also do that. If they can't fine, but even if they do and then choose a different path, fine as well.' Her comments came after Ms Lewinsky was this week seen mingling with royalty and stars at high-profile parties in London. The 40-year-old has broken cover after nearly a decade of keeping a low profile with an article in Vanity Fair and an appearance in a forthcoming National Geographic documentary on the 1990s in which she calls herself 'the most humiliated woman in the world. Moving on: Monica Lewinsky has made a decision to stop laying low and 'It's time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress' Sitting pretty: Lewinsky says she decided to 'stick her head above the parapet' and come out of her self-imposed exile . But while Ms Lewinsky's role in one of the greatest sex scandals of recent times has overshadowed much of her life, Mrs Clinton has gone from strength to strength as a top official of the world's most powerful nation. Mrs Clinton spoke about one of the most dramatic moments in that career today, when she explained the situation behind the famous photo of her and others in Obama's cabinet as they watched the Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, which is included in her book. It famously shows her with her hand over her mouth. 'I was not conscious of what I was doing, I was just reacting in a very visceral way because it was the most stressful and intense 30 minutes-plus of my entire life,' she told Woman's Hour. Stressful: Mrs Clinton explained the story of that famous photo of her and her colleagues in Obama's cabinet as they watched the Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, which is included in her book . She explains how she was the official who had recommended to President Obama that he order the mission, but she was nevertheless concerned that things could go wrong. It appeared her fears had been realised when the tail of one of the SEAL team's helicopters clipped a building as it came in to land, disabling it. 'We'd planned for it but still you hold your breath when it's going on,' she said. Sales of Mrs Clinton's book have so far been well short of expectations, reaching just 160,000 in its first week. By comparison Clinton's book Living History sold 600,000 copies in a single week when it was released in 2003, leading publishing group Simon & Schuster to believe Hard Choices would be a hit. But sales of the book continue to plummet, and it looks increasingly unlikely bookstores will be able to sell the million hard copies the publishing group distributed to them when the book dropped earlier this month.","Mrs Clinton confused names of political parties in interview with BBC .

"The greatness of Dame Mary Peters lies in the fact that her finest sporting achievement proved to be a beginning and not an end. This was further recognised on Tuesday evening when she was named as a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the New Year’s Honours List. She becomes only the second sports figure, after Lord Coe, to be elevated into such company usually reserved for luminaries of the arts, science and politics. Athlete Mary Peters at Buckingham Palace in London in 2000 after she was invested as a Dame Commander . As with Lord Coe, it is largely recognition for what Dame Mary, 75, has done since winning an Olympic gold medal in the days when such things had enormous rarity value among British athletes. ‘I am thrilled to receive such a prestigious honour, being one of only 47 Companions of Honour in the UK, it was totally unexpected,’ she said on Tuesday after becoming British sport’s most decorated woman. ‘Everything I have done in my interesting life has been a gift so there was no need for recognition. I have been so privileged.’ Many will see this as fitting reward for someone who is too seldom associated with that admittedly well-worn tag of National Treasure. That is, perhaps, because she has happily identified herself with one specific part of the kingdom, Northern Ireland, since dramatically winning Britain’s solitary gold, in the pentathlon, at Munich in 1972. Peters celebrates crossing the line during the 1972 Olympics where she picked up gold in the pentathlon . Dame Mary attempts a successful jump during the high jump event of the 1972 Olympic games in Munich . Barely had the bauble been placed around her neck than she was receiving a death threat from the IRA at a time when the Troubles were raging at their most disturbing pitch. ‘Mary Peters is a Protestant and has won a medal for Britain. An attempt will be made on her life and it will be blamed on the IRA … her home will going up in the near future,’ a chilling Irish voice told the BBC in a phone call. Far from being intimidated, she insisted on returning home immediately to share her success with the place she had long since fallen in love with having moved there from Liverpool as an 11-year-old. ‘I’m going straight to Belfast,’ she declared. Queen Elizabeth II joins Dame Mary Peters during a visit to Belfast in Northern Ireland this summer . After arriving at the heavily fortified airport, she was paraded on an open-top truck down Royal Avenue, barely a month after 22 bombs had been detonated in the city on one single day. Protestants and Catholics alike famously lined the streets together to acclaim her. Ever since that day she has proved to be a great friend to all sections of the community there, working tirelessly to unite people, raise money for sport and good causes, and act as an ambassador for the province. Tuesday's honour was the latest in a progression which began, inevitably, by being named Sports Personality of the Year shortly after triumph in Germany. Following on were an MBE, CBE and her promotion to DBE (Dame Commander) in 2000. Peters presents Rory McIlroy with a Worldwide Achievement Award on behalf of the Mary Peters Trust in 2013 . On a purely sporting basis her achievement in winning gold was remarkable. Having shown athletic prowess as a teenager, she was encouraged by her father, who bought in two tonnes of sand to create a practice area for the long jump in a nearby field. He also bought enough cement to create a shot putt circle to perfect what would be her best discipline. She missed out by one place on a bronze medal in 1964 and came ninth at Mexico City in 1968. As she recalled, getting to training on the track at Queen’s University in those times was often not easy due to frequent disruption caused by the Troubles. At 33, Munich would be her last chance, but she was up against the strongly favoured West German Heide Rosendahl. Peters led after the first day but endured a sleepless night in which ‘every time I looked at my watch it seemed the hands had moved backwards’. Standing on the podium in Munich, Peters acknowledges the crowd having won a gold medal in the pentathlon . Rosendahl had her two best events to come and trailed by just 47 points when they lined up for the final 200metres. Peters managed her fourth personal best out of five but lost by 10 metres, and then followed an agonising few minutes while officials worked out the totals. With both competitors surrounded by photographers during the unbearable wait, Peters only knew she had won when Rosendahl sportingly held out her arms and congratulated her. She had won by a mere 10 points with a world-record score. The next day was to become the blackest in Olympic history, as the massacre of Israeli athletes began, as if Peters needed reminding of such horrors. Peters was made Dame in 2000 for services to Sport and to the community in Northern Ireland . She did not need to make her future in Northern Ireland afterwards, receiving job offers from as far away as Australia and America, but chose to stay and use her fame to make Belfast a better place. Blessed with a natural openness and matronly warmth, she first raised enough money to resurface the cinder track at Queen’s University. She has held nine chairmanship, president and vice-president positions on various boards and, in 2009, became Lord Lieutenant of Belfast. Aside from anything, she blazed a trail for the likes of Daley Thompson, Denise Lewis and Jessica Ennis-Hill to establish multi-sport competition as something of a British speciality, and they will have joined in hailing the latest honour.","The 75-year-old won gold in the pentathlon at the 1972 Munich Olympics .

"A British family has been awarded £9,400 in compensation after they fell seriously ill at a Greek resort where raw sewage leaked into baby pools and the kitchen area was infested with rats. Mum-of-two Tarina Phillips and three other family members were forced to seek medical treatment during their holiday at the Corfu Sea Gardens hotel in September 2013. The 39-year-old nurse said the family, from Kent, visited the picturesque island in the Ionian Sea for a relaxing getaway, but the holiday was ruined by illness just a few days after their arrival. Tarina Phillips, her son, Jake, and her one-year-old daughter, Isabella, fell ill during a holiday in Greece . Tarina's 19-year-old son, Jake, was taken to hospital by ambulance after complaining of serious stomach cramps and had to pay nearly £100 for the 2.5-hour taxi journey back to the hotel. Her 37-year-old husband, Patrick, a landscape gardener, sought treatment from an on-site doctor as his condition worsened. He received intravenous fluids and antibiotics in an attempt to control his symptoms. Their two-year-old daughter, Isabella, who was one at the time, was affected by ‘severe’ weight loss during their stay at the hotel, according to their law firm. Tarina said: ‘We all started getting symptoms within the first few days and the illness lasted throughout our stay so much so my daughter had lost a significant amount of weight. ‘My husband was hit the hardest. He spent almost all of his time in the hotel room.’ Tarina Phillips' husband, Patrick, was placed on an IV drip and their daughter lost weight after falling ill . The family, who booked with tour operator Thomas Cook, said food appeared to be constantly re-served throughout the day and was often cold or undercooked. They said the hotel’s restaurants were infested with flies and the kitchen areas attracted rats, while raw sewage was seen leaking into a baby pool which shares the same filter as the main pool. When hotel staff were informed, the pools were not closed or even cleaned, the family claimed. Back in Britain, Tarina hired solicitors with Your Holiday Claims, a division of Farnworth Rose in Lancashire, to pursue a claim against Thomas Cook. The family members received a combined payout of more than £9,000 in a settlement that was reached out of court. In their claim, the family said raw sewage leaked into pools, which staff failed to clean despite complaints . While she was satisfied with the settlement, Tarina said the experience has made the family fearful of all-inclusive holidays. Tarina told MailOnline Travel: ‘It put us off wanting to go abroad ever again. ‘We’ve been abroad several times and have been to some really nice places … and then when we went to Corfu I couldn’t believe the difference.’ Anne Thomson, head of travel law at Your Holiday Claims, said: ‘It is always concerning to hear of a family contracting such an illness on holiday. It can be an incredibly distressing experience for a family. ‘When food is served undercooked or swimming pool water becomes contaminated, holidaymakers are placed at serious risk of illness. ‘It is vital that all tour operators and hotel management ensure that high standards of food and hygiene are maintained at all times in order to prevent such outbreaks of illness from occurring.’ The island of Corfu is a popular destination for British tourists thanks to its clear waters and sandy beaches . In recent months, the law firm has helped 16 holidaymakers to obtain compensation after illness spoilt family holidays at the Corfu Sea Gardens hotel. The tourists affected by the outbreaks have received a combined total of more than £30,000 in compensation. In a statement, Thomas Cook said: 'Thomas Cook is sorry that the Phillips family fell ill while on holiday at the Corfu Sea Gardens hotel in Greece in September 2013. We can confirm we have reached an agreement with their legal representatives. 'We would like to assure customers that incidents of this type are rare, as Thomas Cook closely audits all the properties to which it operates to ensure that only the very highest hygiene standards are maintained. 'We would kindly ask any customers who may have concerns relating to their holiday to contact us directly and as quickly as possible so that we can deal with them personally in an open, honest and fair manner.'","Tarina Phillips and three relatives were forced to seek medical attention .

"Britain’s worst benefit-scrounging con artists can today be exposed. Using fake identities of dead pensioners, Irish immigrants and even a fake MI5 spy benefit fraudsters stole hundreds of thousands of pounds last year, MailOnline can reveal. One man stole £85,000 using a raft of stolen identities which he claimed he needed in his role as an undercover British agent. Another woman posed as her dead mother to claim more than £70,000 – while living in Portugal. A gang of fraudsters meanwhile illegally claimed more than £100,000 in illness and disability benefits claiming to be Irish immigrants unable to work because they had been injured in car crashes. Peter Fischer (left) claimed he worked as a ‘sub-contractor’ for MI5 to steal benefits, while Maria Lucas claimed British welfare for her dead mother while living in Portugal . PETER FISCHER . James Bond imitator Peter Fischer fraudulently claimed Income Support, Disability Living Allowance and Pension Credit using multiple identities. He offered the excuse that he worked as a ‘sub-contractor’ for MI5 - which meant he needed to create ‘legends’ to be able to work in various areas. Fischer insisted throughout that he was an undercover agent, using the identities as a 'legend' to infiltrate enemies of the UK. He told investigators that several lives would be in jeopardy if we took him to Court as his real identity would become known. The fraudster claimed the property that he owned in Spain was used as a base for MI5 agents to rest and recuperate. He was actually running a business from Spain while claiming benefits in the UK. He was sentenced to 15 months in prison for stealing £85,000 - suspended for 15 months. MARIA JOAO FERREIRA LUCAS . Maria Joao Ferreira Lucas was sent down for a year after stealing £73,500 in benefits. Lucas posed as her dead mother to claim benefits – failing to inform the Department for Work and Pensions of her death while transferring all the cash claimed by her mother into her own account. In June 2008 Lucas phoned the DWP, posing as her mother who had died six months earlier, and asked for all benefits to be paid into her account. Lucas then wrote to Lambeth Local Authority, claiming to be her mother and asked for all council tax benefits to also be redirected to her own account in Portugal. Officials eventually tracked down her down in Portugal and when she returned to the UK on September 10 she was arrested and interviewed. She admitted that she had fraudulently claimed benefits in her dead mother’s name and that she had been living in Portugal. The hearing last month discovered that she had stolen a total of some £73,526.66, from false claims of Disability Living Allowance, Housing Benefit, Carers Allowance and Income Support. DEREK FIELDS . Derek Fields was monitored by Government officials and found to be part of a gang who used stolen identities of Irish workers to work to claim out of work benefits . Mr Fields and his gang stole £103,000 of taxpayers’ money after hijacking the identities of 60 people . Derek Fields was part of a gang who used stolen identities of Irish workers to work to claim out of work benefits. The gang stole £103,000 of taxpayers’ money after hijacking the identities of 60 people. In the vast majority of cases, they claimed Employment and Support Allowance under the pretence that they had broken limbs in car crashes. The fraud took place over 18 months while the Government eventually caught them through undercover surveillance. Derek Fields was sentenced in January this year to 30 months in prison, with 15 months to be served on licence. LEONARD SHEPPARD AND MERLE SHEPPARD . For over ten years, Leonard Sheppard assumed the identity of another man who had died in 1986. He made false claims for Invalidity benefit, Retirement pension, Pension credit, Attendance allowance, Housing benefit and Council tax benefit totalling over £120,000. He had also fraudulently obtained a driving licence in the name of the dead man. Leonard Sheppard, pictured with his wife Merle, assumed the identity of another man who had died in 1986 . He stole tens of thousands of pounds in false claims for Invalidity benefit, Retirement pension, Pension credit, Attendance allowance, Housing benefit and Council tax . Meanwhile, his wife Merle Sheppard lived with Sheppard for several years while claiming benefits as a single person – as well as Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit for a property she didn’t live in. Investigators discovered large sums of monies credited to an account in the name of the dead man – including a payment for almost £150,000. When arrested at his home in Peterborough, he admitted that his real name was Leonard Sheppard. His partner was also arrested. A search on the property resulted in £30,000.00 being seized in cash. Merle Sheppard lived with her husband for several years while claiming benefits as a single person . Leonard was sentenced in January 2014 to 12 months in prison. Merle was sentenced in September 2014 to a three month suspended prison sentence . Leonard admitted hijacking the Identity of someone who had died. He claimed the large sums of money in his account was from his late mother – who passed away in the late 1980s – and he put into a fund for his daughter. He was charged with six offences - one of cheating the public revenue, two of fraud by false representation, and three of social security act charges in relation to the housing benefit and council tax benefit. He was sentenced in January 2014 to 12 months in prison. Merle was sentenced in September 2014 to a three month suspended prison sentence. IAN BURNS . Ian Burns stole benefits using the name of a dead Irishman . Pensioner Ian Burns claimed three other people’s state pension and a host of other benefits, including that of a dead Irish national. Over an 11 year period he claimed over £226,000 before eventually being found guilty in December. The shocking scale of abuse has forced the Government to introduce a major clampdown on people abroad who steal the identities of dead pensioners. Overseas pensioners must now provide life certificates every two years to prove they are still eligible for the state pension. Department for Work and Pensions Minister Mark Harper said: ‘Benefit fraudsters are fast discovering that they have nowhere to hide when they break the law. ‘We know it’s a minority who commit identity fraud but we will do everything in our power to stop these people from stealing money from hardworking taxpayers. ‘Our fraud investigators have new and better methods of detecting benefit cheats so it’s becoming more difficult to escape punishment.’ Richard West, Director, DWP Fraud and Error Service, added: ‘These cases should send a clear message to any criminals cheating the system that no matter where they are in the world, we have the means to catch them. ‘Anyone found guilty of fraud will have to pay the stolen money back, and under tougher new rules they will have to do so more quickly. That’s on top of any prison sentence or fine handed out by the courts.’ In the last year the Government recovered more than £1.3 billion in fraudulent payments and has introduced a raft of measures to counter benefit fraud.","James Bond imitator Peter Fischer fraudulently claimed £85,000 in benefits .

"The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both hit all-time highs today as investors gave their stamp of approval to the Republican takeover of the US Senate. The Down was up 100.69 points, 0.6percent, and closed at a record 17,484.53. The S&P was also up 0.6percent and closed at a record 2023.57. Energy companies, which have suffered massive losses thanks to cheap oil, led the rally over hopes that the new GOP majority will lead to approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada and the easing of environmental regulations, which business say have become stricter and more cumbersome under President Barack Obama's administration. The president had blocked construction of the Keystone XL pipeline over environmental concerns, but will now face increasing pressure to approve the project. Record highs: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (blue) and the S&P 500 (orange) both hit new highs the day after Republicans took over the Senate . The S&P energy index was the only one of ten primary S&P 500 sectors to be negative for the year, though it rose 1.6percent Tuesday as the strongest group of the day. Equities rose on relief that election results were clear, with the upcoming Senate majority party not in doubt. Investors had been concerned that some close races would be forced into run-offs, an outcome that could have led to weeks of delay in knowing which party would control Congress's upper chamber. 'It had looked like some of the races would be very close and that we might not know who controlled the Senate, but in the end the results were pretty decisive,' said John Carey, portfolio manager at Pioneer Investment Management in Boston. 'That's good news for the industries that had been subject to regulatory issues.' Business is hoping that the new Republican majority could also lead to deals on immigration reform, a reform of the tax code that would cut rates while limiting deductions and reducing red tape that advocates say has piled up since Obama took office. New hope: Investors hope the GOP and President Barack Obama can finally reach a deal . Also helping the markets rally was a positive jobs report. US private employers added 230,000 jobs in October, more than expected and the most since June, according to the ADP National Employment report. The data could raise hopes for Friday's closely-watched payroll report. Separately, the pace of growth in the US services sector slowed more than expected in October, sliding for a second month to its lowest level since June, according to the Institute for Supply Management's services index. Time Warner Inc rose 2.9 percent to $77.16 after it reported revenue growth of 3 percent. Activision Blizzard Inc late Tuesday raised its full-year forecast, sending shares up 3 percent to $20.55. Limiting the Nasdaq's advance, TripAdvisor Inc dropped 14 percent to $72.29 and was the S&P's biggest decliner a day after posting weaker-than-expected earnings.

"Los Angeles police received an unusual call on Tuesday, after a man reported seeing two women loading a 4ft alligator into a van and driving off. Fearing that the women were planning to abandon the creature in the desert, the retired police officer tailed them as he contacted the authorities. When police pulled the van over the driver admitted to having the alligator, and added that a kangaroo was on board too. Snap shot: Spike the alligator poses on a police car after his owners were pulled over in California . The women explained they were part of the Zoo to You project, which brings exotic creatures to schools. Unfortunately the alligator, named Spike, has soiled his cage on the way back from Quartz Hill Elementary School and the women had pulled over to clean him up. Deputy Michael Rust told the Los Angeles Times that at first he did not believe the call about the exotic animals. 'When I heard it on the radio, I'm thinking, ""Yeah, an alligator. OK"",' he said. 'Maybe an iguana, but an alligator?' Realizing that no creatures were in danger of being harmed, the police took a few 'snaps' of the alligator on their police car, before sending him on his way. Alligators get their heat from sunning themselves on rocks so, as well as enjoying being the center of attention, Spike also made the most of his chance to warm himself on the police car. Partner in crime: When police pulled over the Zoo to You van, the drivers admitted they had a kangaroo too . Restroom break: Zoo to You had pulled over to give Spike the alligator a bathroom break on the way home . In their report, the Los Angeles Police . Department said: 'It seems the alligator forgot to use the restroom . before leaving the school and soiled its cage. This caused the ladies to . stop,' NBC 4 reported. The Zoo to You project in Paso Robles offers permanent homes to abandoned, injured or abused wild and exotic animals, from tigers and alligators, to lizards, porcupines and eagles. Some of the animals are used in their education program and are taken to schools to help teach children about conservation. It is not the first time Spike has been the center of attention. In April he met Jay Leno as he appeared on The Tonight Show. Celebrity status: Jay Leno met Spike the alligator on The Tonight Show in April . Campaign: Zoo to You cares for abandoned exotic animals, and raises awareness about conservation . The talk show host rubbed his belly to send him to sleep on the show, aired on April 5. When Spike was pulled over by police, he was traveling back from an elementary school with Zoo to You's kangaroo. Deputy Rust added: 'We get all kinds of animal calls, from bulls to bears to mountain lions. But I've never heard of an alligator.'","Exotic animals were visiting school as part of the Zoo to You project .

"Footage taken by a fire chief responding to the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crash has revealed he was not told a 16-year-old girl was lying injured on the runway - leaving him unable to prevent her from being fatally hit by an emergency vehicle. Ye Meng Yuan, a student from China, was killed when one of the responding vehicles ran over her after she was covered by fire-retardant foam at the San Fransisco International Airport on July 6. Video filmed by a camera on the fire chief's helmet has now revealed that, although firefighters had seen her on the runway, the message was not communicated to the chief, Mark Johnson. It meant that responding vehicles were also not told of her whereabouts, leaving a foam rig to hit her. Chaos: Footage taken from a fire chief's helmet cam shows foam rigs responding to the scene. By this point, a Chinese schoolgirl had been found on the ground but the chief was apparently not told . Fatal: It is believed that this foam rig fatally hit Ye Mengyuan. At this point, she was lying somewhere in front of the chief after landing by the plane's left wing, but she was covered with foam . Ye's death is under review by investigators from the fire and police departments and the National Transportation Safety Board. As part of the probe, the footage from Johnson's camera is being reviewed. It was also seen by a reporter at the San Francisco Chronicle, who described what the chief saw. After the plane apparently landed too slow and hit the sea wall - ripping off the craft's tail and sending the plane smashing into the runway - Ye was ejected and landed by the left wing. Two San Francisco Fire Department firefighters who responded to the scene in a truck say they spotted her lying in the fetal position on the runway, and two other firefighters concluded that she was dead - although a coroner has since said that she was still alive at this point. Chaos: This image shows the chief, Mark Johnson, as he responded to the crash scene on July 6 . Response: Rigs douse the burning shell with fire-retardant foam, which also covered 16-year-old Ye . Mix up: She had been seen by other firefighters who had mistakenly concluded she was dead; it is not believed her whereabouts were communicated to the battalion chief . It is not clear why the latter two firefighters thought she was dead, the Chronicle reported. It was at this point that Johnson arrived on the scene and took over control of the scene. Victim: Ye died from blunt force trauma as a result of being hit by a vehicle, the coroner said . In the footage, the first foam rig - driven by two men who saw her body - is seen driving away from the scene as Johnson arrives and looks over the area where Ye's foam-covered body lies. But according to the footage, the girl's location was not reported to him; the battalion chief should have been told of the girl's whereabouts, whether or not she was alive or dead. A second fire rig then arrived on the scene and, after dousing the plane with foam, the driver said she needed to fill up the vehicle again. Unaware there was a victim beneath the foam, the driver pulled off and hit her. In a tragic twist, the rig, labeled Rescue 37, was not fitted with heat-sensing equipment like other firefighting vehicles at the airport. The equipment would have detected the body beneath the foam, the Chronicle reported. After Johnson directed the firefighters to leave the scene after hearing everyone was off the plane, another lieutenant approached him and told him there was a body nearby . On the footage, Johnson walks over and looks at the girl's crushed body. 'My God,' he says, before asking for someone to cover her body with a yellow tarp. Aerial images of the scene taken by . the Associated Press later showed the girl's body covered with the tarp. Tire tracks could apparently be seen running up to the body. Discovery: After a lieutenant spots the girl's body, Johnson asks for it to be covered with a tarp . Investigation: The footage is being used by authorities to probe what went wrong before the girl's death . The San Francisco Chronicle has not shared the footage online after its source asked it not be uploaded while the investigation continues. It is not known exactly how Ye ended up on the runway near the left wing, but according to the San Mateo County coroner, she was alive for several minutes until she was struck. The coroner concluded that she died of blunt force trauma as a result of being hit by a vehicle. None of the officers who feature in the footage have responded to a request for comment, while Johnson said he would need the approval of Fire Department superiors to be able to do so. Ye's middle school classmate, 16-year-old Wang Linjia, also died in the July 6 crash. The other victim, 15-year-old Liu Yipeng, died from her injuries six days after the crash. Scene: The yellow tarp is right, by the truck. Tire tracks can apparently be seen near to her body . Beyond recognition: The charred remains of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 after crash landing in San Francisco . Wang was among a group of injured passengers who did not get immediate medical help after the crash; rescuers did not spot her until 14 minutes later. The victims were top students who were to spend a few weeks at a Christian summer camp in California, where they planned to practice English to boost their chances of attending a U.S. college. The crash occurred after the airliner collided with a rocky seawall just short the runway. There were 182 survivors taken to hospitals, though most suffered only minor injuries. An initial investigation indicated that the pilots failed to realize until too late that the aircraft was dangerously low and flying too slow. The investigation continues.

"Up close and personal, an American alligator with jaws open wide proudly displays rows of rough edged teeth and spotted pink tongue. The half-submerged reptile glows in bright yellow - caused by the strong reflection of fresh grass shoots on the surface of the clear water. Brave photographer Masa Ushioda captured the shots of this wild gator in vast marsh land in the Everglades National Park, in Florida, USA. Huge jaws: An American alligator with jaws open wide proudly displays rows of rough edged teeth and spotted pink tongue . Marsh lands: The half-submerged reptile glows in bright yellow - caused by the strong reflection of fresh, almost fluorescent grass shoots on the surface of the water . After waiting weeks for storm clouds to disperse and murky water to clear, the 43-year-old then had to navigate a huge number of waterways. He said: ‘Fortunately I had an American Indian lady to guide and assist. She could imitate the quacking and squeaking sound of alligators and this immediately attracted the gators - so well in fact it created another problem. ‘Since her sound gathered all of the alligators nearby, suddenly this ten-foot reptile chased other alligators 50 yards to the right and 100 yards to the left. ‘Sometimes it submerged and attacked other alligators from down below by headbutting. Enormous: Brave photographer Masa Ushioda captured the shots of this wild gator in vast marsh land in the Everglades National Park, in Florida . ‘All I could do was wait - for the alligator and then for the light.’ Despite the threat of other gators invading on this reptile's territory, Masa wanted to get as close as possible. After trying to swim with the creature, the 43-year-old decided the best way to get his under-over water shots was to set up a pole cam on higher ground. What lies beneath: An American alligator swims beneath the waters and glides over rocks . Unfazed by its fierce reputation, Masa said: ‘Alligators in the wild are just as much afraid of humans as we are of them. ‘They are particularly sensitive to vibrations and movement, so I have to be absolutely quiet and still like a rock to get the alligator to come close. ‘This gator was calm as long as I didn't move and agitate him.’ Seemingly smiling with water bubbles rising from its jaws, the alligator looks almost as happy as Masa to be caught on camera. The Tokyo-born-and-raised photographer admits the shoot was immensely rewarding. He said: ‘Bright sunlight and blue sky were critical elements in this picture - in addition to getting a wild 10-foot alligator in the middle of the viewfinder with a perfect angle. ‘One day the weather won't cooperate. On the other day, alligators won't. ‘Extreme patience is required but it was so rewarding.’ Peak-a-boo: The alligators teeth are clearly visible as he bobs his head just above the water . Powerful: The American alligator opens his jaw wide as his eyes look above the surface of the clear water . Gliding: The American alligator glides through water in vast marsh land in the Everglades National Park, in Florida, USA . Danger ahead: Photographer Masa Ushioda captured the half-submerged reptile glowing in bright yellow beneath the surface of the water . The American alligator, sometimes referred to colloquially as a gator or an alligator, is a large crocodilian reptile endemic to the southeastern United States. It is one of two living species in the genus Alligator within the family Alligatoridae; it is larger than the other extant alligator species, the Chinese alligator. Adult male American alligators measure 3.4 to 4.6 metres (11 to 15 foot) in length, and can weigh 453 kg (999 lb). Females are smaller, measuring around 3 metres (9.8 foot). The American alligator inhabits freshwater wetlands, such as marshes and cypress swamps from Texas to North Carolina. It is distinguished from the sympatric American crocodile by its broader snout, with overlapping jaws and darker coloration, and is less tolerant of saltwater but more tolerant of cooler climates than the American crocodile, which is found only in tropical climates. Alligators are apex predators and consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. They also play an important role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, but especially during the breeding season, alligators bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates. Historically, hunting has decimated their population, and the American alligator was listed as an endangered species by the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The species is the official state reptile of three American states: Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi.","A brave photographer caught the images of an alligator gliding through the Everglades National Park in Florida .

"Los Angeles residents have their claws out against Department of Water and Power after one of its workers rescued a cat from atop a utility pole, only to drop it from above his bucket truck. KTLA reported that residents called the Los Angeles Fire Department and LADWP to remove the cat, which had been lying on top of a utility pole in the suburb of Sunland. According to an onlooker, a worker sent by LADWP donned gloves and went up in using his truck's extending bucket to pluck the cat from the pole. Scroll down for video . Tossed: The utility worker rescued the cat from the pole before dropping him towards a lawn next to the bucket truck . One witness, Mark, described the worker as being 'gentle' during the rescue, saying 'He coaxed it over to him. He got it in the bucket. He started coming back down.' 'He stopped about halfway,' said Mark, before taking the cat out of the bucket and dangling it over the edge. In video of the rescue, the worker can be heard telling a woman standing under the pole to get out of the way before tossing the cat towards the grass. The woman is heard screaming before attempting to catch the cat with a green blanket while it zips away into a nearby yard. The utility worker apologized to the crowd, saying 'Sorry, he was really clawing me up there.' 'I realize he's not a professional cat rescuer, and I thank him for doing the job,' Gail, another onlooker told KTLA. Rescue: The utility worker was described as 'gentle' when he went up in the bucket to try and coax the cat down . 'For the future it would be great if he could do something, or other people could learn, that if they're going to do a cat rescue, to try to come to the ground level.' 'The bottom line is that the cat was rescued,' LADWP spokesperson Michelle Figueroa told the Los Angeles Times. 'Staff risked electrocution to save the cat.' Cats have been known to survive extremely high falls, and a study even found that longer falls increased a cat's chances of emerging unharmed. Though onlookers did not have a chance to see what harm befell the rescued feline, veterinarian Peggy Herrera said the animal seemed to have emerged unscathed. 'Likely if there had been any significant injury, it wouldn't have skedaddled so quickly,' said Herrera.","Residents said the cat had been on top of the pole for three days and called the Department of Water and Power .

"A woman who discovered her ex-boyfriend had set up a dating website profile took revenge by hiring a removal firm to empty his flat, a court has heard. Corinna Finney was ordered to carry out community service after she admitted arranging for Brian Waite's possessions to be removed, leaving him to come home to a bare flat. However, after walking free from Swindon Magistrates' Court she insisted she did not regret what she did to her estranged lover. Complaint: Finney, pictured outside Swindon Magistrates' Court, claimed that her punishment was too harsh . Couple: Finney and Mr Waite dated for 18 months before splitting earlier this year . Finney, 39, had been in a relationship with Mr Waite for 18 months before the affair started to break down earlier this year. She discovered that he had set up a profile on a dating website for over-40s, even though they were discussing whether to reconcile with each other. On March 14, Mr Waite, 53, left his flat in Swindon, Wiltshire at 7.45am to spend the day watching the racing at the Cheltenham Festival. Michelle Hewitt, prosecuting, said: 'Throughout the day he received numerous phone calls from the defendant asking what time he was going to be home. 'She had arranged for a man with a van to come round and the place was stripped bare of everything; the carpets, clothing, food and the fridge, the television, oven, cutlery, and his curtains - everything.' Fury: The case of Finney's anger was this online dating profile on a website for over-40s . Action: The jilted lover hired a removal firm to empty out Mr Waite's flat, located in this building in Swindon . Mr Waite returned home at 8.15pm and was horrified to discover all of the items from inside his property had disappeared. 'He suspected the defendant and the police went to her address the next day but none of the property was recovered,' the prosecutor said. 'Fortunately, a lot of it was later recovered but some items, including his clothing, carpets and food were never recovered.' The value of Mr Waite's lost belongings amounted to £950, according to Ms Hewitt. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mr Waite said he had returned to his flat after enjoying a day at the races. 'I was met with a shocking sight,' he said. 'The entire contents of my flat had been stripped out. Food had been stolen from the cupboards - I was literally left with the clothes I was wearing. 'When I opened the door to my flat, it was a shock I shall never forget. I just wanted to make a clean break from Corinna, without all of this hassle. 'I have no carpets, bed or clothing, all I had left were the clothes I was wearing - it is going to cost me a lot of money to replace it.' Punishment: Finney was handed a 15-month community order despite being warned that she could face jail . Victim: Mr Waite says he lost possessions worth a total of nearly £1,000 . Mr Waite immediately suspected Finney, who is unemployed and lives in Swindon, and after she was arrested she pleaded guilty to theft. Gordon Hotson, mitigating, said that the defendant and Mr Waite had been trying to resolve issues in their relationship at the time of the offence. 'It came as a great shock to her to discover that behind her back he was still using dating-type websites, when they were trying to make a go of things,' he said. 'For some considerable time, she had been suffering considerable emotional difficulties and the discovery just caused her to snap. 'She wanted to do something that would affect him as she had been affected very badly by the discovery of his alleged infidelity. 'It was the last straw and she acted without properly thinking through the consequence of her actions.' Defiant: Corinna Finney says she does not regret emptying out the flat of her ex-boyfriend Brian Waite . The magistrate told Finney she could have been given a prison sentence, but instead gave her a 15-month community order and told her to pay £560 in compensation to the victim. Nigel Spinney, chair of the bench, told Finney: 'This was a serious offence, with some planning involved in organising a white van to come and remove all of this furniture. 'We could be sending you to prison today but we are not going to. In the circumstances, from what we have heard and read, we are going to give you a community order today.' Speaking outside court, Finney refused to apologise and insisted that Mr Waite 'got what he deserved'. She added: 'I'm still not sorry, not in the slightest. The court was a bit harsh, but I'm not sorry, you can print that.'","Corinna Finney, 39, had recently broken up with boyfriend Brian Waite, 53 .

"British companies are actively recruiting Romanians to come and work as midwives, waiters and hotel workers in the UK. Ahead of Britain opening its borders in January, weekly jobs fairs are being held in the capital Bucharest. And dozens of recruitment websites are advertising low-skilled jobs in this country – some offering the promise of ‘cash daily’ and others claiming knowledge of English is ‘not necessary’. Under the EU's freedom of movement laws, all 29million citizens of Bulgaria and Romania, which joined in 2007, will gain unrestricted rights to live and work in Britain . Romanian recruiters said they believed young people in the UK 'didn't want' the blue-collar jobs . The roles vary from minimum wage bartending to a £34,000-a-year job as an NHS midwife – which comes with a ‘relocation package’, raising questions over the costs of such  overseas recruitment. One advert reads: ‘Britain will remove restrictions on the labour market from 2014! Do not miss the start!’ Another boasts of the joys of working in the ‘historic, multicultural and glorious United Kingdom’, advising Romanians that they would ‘join hundreds of fellow Eastern Europeans’ already working there. Critics have warned such a large influx of Romanian workers will put huge pressure on public services, and make it harder for British people to get jobs. According to recruitment website Tjobs, 59,377 UK jobs have been advertised through them this  year and 60,828 candidates have responded . A recent study by the IRES, the Romanian Institute for Migration and Strategy, found the UK was the most-sought after destination to work among young Romanians . Recruitment agencies claim they have already found staff for dozens of UK-based hotel groups including Marriott, Hilton, De Vere and the Pride of Britain consortium, as well as fast-food chains such as KFC and private care homes. An unnamed NHS Trust in the north of England is advertising the midwifery jobs through Active Business Consult, based in Cluj-Napoca, in the former Transylvania region. Many of the jobs advertised have start dates of January 1, 2014, when the restrictions on Romanians working and living in the UK are lifted. Under the EU’s freedom of movement laws, all 29million citizens of Bulgaria and Romania, which joined in 2007, will gain unrestricted rights to live and work in Britain. Ahead of Britain opening its borders in January, weekly jobs fairs are being held in the capital Bucharest . Thousands are expected to arrive, in a trend similar to the one that followed Poland’s accession in 2004. According to recruitment website Tjobs, 59,377 UK jobs have been advertised through them this  year and 60,828 candidates have responded. Two years ago 41,715 were advertised. One advertisement for taxi drivers . claims ‘no experience required’ and illegally states that certain . vacancies in the South East, are ‘female only’ positions. It . read: ‘It is not like being a taxi driver in Romania. You are supplied . with jobs by the company. You will be self-employed and receive cash . daily.’ Open door: Under EU freedom of movement laws, all 29million citizens of Bulgaria and Romania, which joined in 2007, gain unrestricted rights to live and work in Britain from January 1, 2014 - the start date of many jobs . A banner for G&G Recruitment, which specialises in finding work for Romanian workers in the British hospitality industry . Hundreds of taxi driver jobs are being advertised with applicants required to have just one month’s driving experience. Another advertisement for 100 butchers’ positions declared: ‘Knowledge of English is not necessary!’ Peter Bone, Tory MP for . Wellingborough, said the revelations about jobs fairs shows that ‘the . number of people coming here is going to be in the thousands’. He said: ‘We should stop Bulgarians and Romanians coming here after 1 January and worry about the EU afterwards. 'Having . more and more people coming into this country is going to make matters . worse. It is not good for social cohesion, it will put huge pressure on . our public services, and it will make it harder for British people to . get jobs.’ Romanian recruiters said they believed young people in the UK ‘didn’t want’ the blue-collar jobs. Calin . Stefanescu, chief executive of Tjobs, said: ‘The UK’s young population . doesn’t want to work any more in a factory, or as welders, lock smiths, . carpenters, in agriculture or as a nurses and waiters. ‘Countries like Poland, Romania and Bulgaria still have a large number of blue-collar workers available.’ And . hospitality chiefs also defended their move to recruit in Romania – . blaming the UK benefits culture, which they said made British youths . reluctant to work.

"An enraged 16-stone naked German women had to be handcuffed by police officers after she went on the rampage at a health club when two other visitors suggested she was taking up too much room in the sauna. Danice Mueller, 35, claims she got into a row with two other guests after they accused her of being too big in the sauna at the club in Karlsruhe, a claim the two guests denied. She also claims one guest said that she would have been 'drowned in the middle ages'. When a manager at the club tried to defuse the situation Mrs Mueller, a nurse, refused to be placated and continued shouting. In the end they called police - but she still refused to relax. Rage: Danica Mueller, who weighs 16 stone, allegedly flipped after guests at her health club said she took up too much space in the sauna . One of the sauna guests reportedly told Mrs Mueller that people like her were 'drowned in the middle ages'. File picture . Police said that she and her partner had attacked officers, and she had to be handcuffed and arrested. A police spokesman said that four officers had been sent and added: 'We asked her first to get dressed and leave three times, but her reply was to insult them. 'A further two policeman were called as back up. She still refused to leave and injured two officers in her protests. Her 54-year-old boyfriend then also started making a scene.' Police overpowered the pair and they were removed in handcuffs - naked - from the sauna. Scuffle: It took four police to overpower the furious woman and her husband . Danica said: 'I was treated very badly, a guest started insulting me, saying someone as fat as me should not be in there. 'Then another sauna guest joined in saying people like me were drowned in the middle ages. I did not want to sit back and take the insults and asked them to stop.' She now faces GBH charges, verbal abuse charges and resisting a request from law enforcers.

"If Derby County continue to perform like this, promotion to the Premier League seems inevitable. Steve McClaren’s side cemented their place at the top of the Championship by taking control from the off and playing some quicksilver stuff. Two sumptuous goals from Jeff Hendrick and Jesse Lingard early on were the decisive moments, but their football could have produced more. It got a little frayed in the second half, with McClaren demanding more from his team as a few passes went astray, but goalkeeper Lee Grant was not troubled. Jeff Hendrick starred for Derby and scored the opener before providing the assist for Jesse Lingard's goal . The on-loan Lingard (centre) slots home the second goal for Derby to give them a 2-0 lead over Charlton . Tom Ince (left) was a constant threat for the Rams and came close to getting on the scoresheet . Derby starting XI (4-3-3): Grant 6.5; Christie 6.5, Keogh 6.5, Shotton 6.5, Forsyth 6.5; Hughes 7 (Bryson 76’ 5.5), Thorne 7 (Mascarell 71’ 5), Hendrick 7.5; Ince 7, Bent 6.5, Lingard 7 (Dawkins 69’ 5.5) Subs not used: Roos, Buxton, Ward, Thomas . Boss: Steve McClaren 7 . Goals: Hendrick 9, Lingard 17 .

Manager: Guy Luzon 6 . Referee: David Coote 7 . MOTM: Hendrick . The impression has been that Derby were stuttering slightly, needing a late penalty to beat Sheffield Wednesday last Saturday having drawn their previous two Championship games from behind and losing to Reading in the FA Cup. But this victory over Charlton, in front of their owners flown over from North America, made it eight wins from their last 11 league matches. ‘The first-half was fantastic, but it is very difficult to keep that tempo,’ said McClaren. ‘There was a maturity about the performance. A good night’s work, we move on. ‘I hope we can keep it up. As I’ve always said, with ten games to go that’s when the season starts.’ His opposite number Guy Luzon, was unequivocal. ‘They are the best team in the league. They deserve to be in the Premier League,’ he said. ‘I am sure if they continue to play like this, to move the ball well, to press the opponent, they have the quality.’ Derby were at Charlton early and took the lead in the ninth minute. Will Hughes threaded a pass to Darren Bent, who turned provider by teeing up Hendrick for the simplest of finishes from two yards. Bent has scored seven goals during this loan move from Aston Villa but his cross showed he can assist too. Five minutes later Tom Ince sent a crisp shot just wide of the post, drawing mistaken cheers from some in the stands. Will Hughes (right) dominated the midfield throughout and keeps a close eye on Charlton's Chris Eagles . In the 17th minute it did become 2-0. Hendrick slipped a delightful pass to Lingard, who galloped onto the ball and struck an accurate first-time finish into the far corner. It was the winger’s first goal on his first league start since joining on loan from Manchester United. Hughes sent another shot narrowly wide at the end of a flowing move before Hendrick hit the crossbar from range on the stroke of half-time. Derby’s ability in the transfer market under chief executive Sam Rush was evident, the front trio of Bent, Ince and Lingard all secured on loan during a busy winter window. Their quality glimmered. George Thorne performed well in his second start in four days following seven months out with a serious knee injury, before McClaren withdrew him in the 71st minute. Charlton boss Luzon made three changes to try to affect matters, with Chris Eagles again sent on. He could not repeat his scoring trick from the 3-0 win over Wigan though. Johann Berg-Gunmundson had a free-kick in a threatening position but whipped it over the bar. That was as close as the visitors came. Having gotten over a small wobble in that second period, Derby saw the game out comfortably as their supporters were able to sing about ‘Being top of the table’. The challenge is to make good on this promise and stay there. Richard Keogh (left) is challenged by Igor Vetokele during his side's 2-0 victory over Charlton .

"Pet owners wanting to take their animals abroad will have to complete reams of extra paperwork due to tough new measures to prevent smugglers from Eastern Europe bringing in illegal puppies which may have rabies. Vets around the country have reported dogs coming in to Britain from countries such as Lithuania, Hungary and Slovakia with fake papers and without being vaccinated against the virulent disease. UK port controls identified 376 dogs arriving with faulty paperwork last year, up from 89 in 2010. The increased trade has been fuelled by demand for cheap pedigree puppies sold for up to £300 on the internet instead of the £500 to £1,200 asked by some breeders in Britain. Talulah the puppy had to go into quarantine after it was discovered he had been illegally smuggled into the country from Lithuania . Now Ministers have approved a secure new  pet passport to prevent criminals falsifying information. It follows alarm last October when two puppies contracted rabies in Holland within a week of being imported from Bulgaria. From December, new pet passports will have a unique number printed on every page and the  section recording the pet’s microchip number and the date of the rabies vaccine will be laminated to help prevent fraud. The name, address and contact details of the vet will also be included. Puppies travelling into Britain and the rest of the EU will have to be at least 15 weeks old. A 12-week minimum age for puppies to be vaccinated against rabies is being introduced and pets must wait three weeks before travelling. Twiglet the Irish Terrier had no problems returning to the UK after a trip to the continent as he had his Pet Passport . For the first time, pets will also have to be checked as they cross borders on their way to the UK.The new royal blue passports will include the date the pet was vaccinated against rabies, the date valid for travel and the vaccine expiry date. Pets must be revaccinated every five years to qualify for a passport. Owners who already have valid pet passports are not required to buy a new one. Valerie John, from West Drayton, West London, last month paid £700 for her pug Tallulah from what she thought was an established breeder in Hertfordshire, only to discover the dog was from Lithuania. She said: ‘The vet spotted straight away the papers were fake. Tallulah was only seven or eight weeks old and too young to have a rabies vaccination so had to go into quarantine, which is going to cost £1,100.’","One dog a day is being caught traveling into the UK on a forged passport .

"He is the wing wizard who combined sublime talent with incredible longevity. Sir Stanley Matthews played until he was 50 having taken care of his body in an era when science and sport never mixed. He made his debut in March 1932 for Stoke City and played his last game for them 33 years later on February 6, exactly half a century ago. In between, he forged hero status at Blackpool, winning the 1953 FA Cup in a final that became synonymous with his name. He won two Second Division titles 30 years apart, was knighted while still playing and won 54 England caps. Matthews, who died aged 85 in 2000, would have been 100 last Sunday. Sportsmail hears from a former team-mate, an adversary, a famous friend and his daughter. Sir Stanley Matthews (left) won the 1953 FA Cup with Blackpool in what became known as the 'Matthews Final' Matthews (right) is the only player ever to have knighted while he was still alive after . Matthews won two Second Division titles with his hometown club Stoke - 30 years apart from each other . Matthews receives an AXA Legends Award outside of the old Wembley 1998 . JIMMY ARMFIELD Team-mate at Blackpool . People talk about him being England’s greatest footballer; he was certainly Blackpool’s. The success we had was down to his talismanic stature. He was the one who attracted the crowds and was known throughout the world. Dads would take their sons to watch the greatest player they’d seen. Matthews was a national treasure. The first time I was picked for the England Under 23 team, Joe Smith — Blackpool’s manager — sent for me. I thought he was going to pat me on the back but he said: ‘The FA have sent a letter that they want you to play in Denmark. Have you thanked Stan?’ I asked why and he replied: ‘Anyone can play behind Stan.’ Everyone said what a wonderful passer I was at right back but all I was doing was giving the ball to the great man. I never once saw him out of breath. That’s an incredible thing to say because when I came in he would have been in his late 30s. When he went back to Stoke everyone thought that was it but he won them promotion. There was an aura around him. I picture him with the No 7 on the back of that tangerine jersey. Most full backs’ memories of Matthews will be looking at that number on his back! He never got booked. He never queried a referee, dived, looked for a free-kick. He’d never retaliate. And he had some kickings. The man known as 'Wizard of the Dribble' goes past a Charlton defender while playing for Blackpool in 1957 . Matthews was a pioneer in taking care of himself before the advent of nutritional advice and sports science . People would come to games especially to see Matthews who was then regarded as England's greatest . Matthews (right) is held aloft on team-mate's shoulders after inspiring Blackpool's FA Cup victory . Stan was a consummate pro. He was the first one who really worked at personal fitness. In a morning you could go down to the beach at 8am and he’d be there doing deep breathing then jogging up and down. I learned more from him than any coach. I’d just watch him. He had quite an amusing streak. He could make funny, but cutting, remarks. We were playing at Arsenal. I picked him out with my left foot and instead of landing at his feet it hit his chest. My pass gave the defender a good chance of nailing him again. When he got off the floor, Stan looked straight at me and said: ‘Shocking. Absolutely shocking’. That shoved some life into me! The emotion of the 1953 FA Cup final came because Blackpool had lost in 1948 and ’51. This was going to be third time lucky. Stan would get his medal. It was Coronation year, we were going to climb Everest and Gordon Richards was going to win the Derby. The first two came off and it was Stan’s turn. We were 3-1 down to Bolton. The game was transformed by Stan Mortensen belting in a free-kick. Matthews sprang to life in that last half-hour. He was unstoppable. He told me that I shouldn’t go around trying to kick people because that’s not what football is about. He said: ‘Once a full back kicks me I’ve got him. I know he’s frightened of me.’ Matthews puts in a cross for Bill Perry to score the winning goal in the 1953 FA Cup final . The Duke of Edinburgh shakes hands with Matthews ahead of match between England and Scotland 1949 . It was that era just after the war — stiff upper lip. Stan embodied that feeling around the country. That’s why when we played away from home we knew the crowd wanted to see him. For a man to get knighted while he was still playing ... can you see anyone else doing that? Can you see away crowds applauding like they did for Stan? CLIFF JONES Opponent at Tottenham . Stan warmed up with weighted boots on — like diver’s boots. Then his actual football boots were made out of calf leather. A little firm in Northampton made them. I’ve never seen boots like them. So light, you could bend them into all shapes. They only lasted about three games. You can imagine the effects of jogging around in weighted boots then slipping on these light boots. He could run the 100m as fast as Jesse Owens. He was very forward-thinking. Just before the game he would have a drink of egg, milk and glucose powder. His pre-match meal, if you like. He said to me: ‘What’s your pre-match meal?’ I said probably a bit of steak or chicken about three hours before kick-off. He said: ‘Why don’t you try this?’ Four heaped tablespoons of glucose powder. It was a great source of energy. Matthews' speed can be associated with his training techniques, which included wearing diving boots . Even after his retirement, Matthews was a keen advocate of sports fitness . Matthews shres a changing room with (L-R) Cliff Jones, Alan Gilzean, Jimmy Greaves before farewell game . On a Monday he wouldn’t have anything to eat. He would just drink eight pints of water to flush his system out. These days they call it detoxifying. He was very much his own man. He would have vitamin tablets. All things we never thought of. That’s why he played until he was 50. Ryan Giggs was 40 when he packed it in. Stan went on for another 10 years! It was Harry Johnston, captain of Blackpool at the time, who said: ‘We have this winger who doesn’t score goals, won’t head a ball and there is no chance of him tackling back, but he is the greatest winger you’ll ever see.’ It was his control and over 10-15 yards he was lightning. He would just jog up to a full back, drop a shoulder and go outside him and be gone. Full backs knew what he was going to do but there was nothing they could do about it. JEAN GOUGH Matthews’ daughter . As a little girl I remember him as a loving daddy who did his utmost to keep his family out of the limelight. In the 1940s he became the first sporting superstar — acclaimed all over the world despite there being no TV and very little media. In order not to be recognised he would wear sunglasses and a hat. It never worked! Friday nights were film nights. As a family we always slipped on to the back row at the cinema once the lights went down. Matthews with his family (L-R) daughter Jean, son Stanley Jnr and wife Betty . Matthews takes on Chelsea midfielder Eddie McCreadie (right) at Stamford Bridge in 1963 . I remember the discipline my dad followed. I can see him now, making his carrot juice every day. He managed to obtain a tiny juicer. All visitors to the house were offered this magical health drink. The only trouble was that too much carrot juice could make your skin go yellow! Pop was obsessed with eating the right foods. I passed this on to my own children. Stan’s granddaughter Samantha is a leading authority on nutrition in Texas and she and Pop planned to write a book together but sadly never got round to it. I can see him now, doing his deep breathing and stretching exercises before going for his workout on Blackpool beach. Sometimes he would take me with him and I cherish this time with him. His aim was to be the fastest man in the world over 10 yards so that he could skip around the defenders. PETER COATES Stoke chairman and friend . Stan is Stoke’s legendary player. He was the first football man to become a truly international figure. The gates would go up in London because they wanted to see him. It would happen in Europe and South America — because they didn’t see him on the telly. Even now, when I travel abroad and mention Stoke I hear ‘Ah, Stanley Matthews.’ The turnout for his funeral was the largest apart from royalty and Winston Churchill. Matthews poses for a picture from his garden, he passed away in 2000 while on holiday in Tenerife . England's (L-R) Paul Scholes, David Beckham and Kieron Dyer wear black armbands following Matthews death . The funeral possession of Matthews passes through Stoke's Britannia Stadium in March 2000 . A statue of Matthews at the Britannia Stadium was unveiled by Kevin Keegan in 2011 . Sir Bobby Charlton told me a story. He said, ‘Jackie (his brother) and I used to go to Newcastle when Stoke were playing and we would stand by the corner flag to get close to Matthews.’ I first saw him just after the war as a young boy and I later got to know him well. He would come to mine for dinner and eat like a mouse. He was a man before his time, intent on prolonging his career. He once told me: ‘One mistake I made was I retired too early. I had two more years in me.’ He wanted to be Peter Pan, he never wanted to grow old. Even in his 80s he had a spring in his step.","Sir Stanley Matthews continued playing professionally until he was 50 .

"Villa fans had begun to call for an end to Paul Lambert’s reign when Christian Benteke sent a half-volley into the net a minute from time. A year to the day since Sheffield United humbled Aston Villa in the third round, this match was on the verge of turning into another disaster.

He collected a long pass from Carlos Sanchez and powered a shot from 20 yards to leave Blackpool goalkeeper Joe Lewis flapping helplessly. It was only the 12th goal Villa fans have seen in 22 matches this season. Lambert has introduced a style that relies on retaining possession and insisted the switch in tactics would ultimately produce results and questioned the protests. ‘When you have dominance of the ball, and are getting into great areas, then it’s strange to hear that,’ he said. ‘It’s different when your backs are against it and you’re not dominating the game. ‘They are entitled to say what they want, no problem. ‘I’ve had it my career at times but it doesn’t do the lads any good. The players have been great. ‘Don’t get me wrong, they’ll be hurt by it. But they enjoy the way they’re playing, especially since we’ve changed the style.’ The attendance was meagre, half-capacity at 21,837. The swathes of empty seats created a training-ground atmosphere that was replicated by training-ground football.

Lambert lined his side up in a 3-5-1-1 formation, with Ashley Westwood an unorthodox centre back. But the system was abandoned after 30 minutes, with Blackpool using Steve Davies as sole striker. For long periods, Lee Clark’s team did what was required, holding firm to increase the anxiety around this stadium.

"It's where the future of the British monarchy is decided, but the finer points of what goes on inside the Royal bedroom remain, thankfully, private. And yet it hasn't always been that way. In Medieval times, travelling kings used their mobile royal bedchamber as a meeting place, conducting day-to-day business with courtiers on their bed. Moreover, kings and queens would sleep separately, meeting only for conjugal visits. During the Tudor and Stuart periods - from when Henry VII came to the throne in 1485 - the bedroom quickly took over from the battlefield as the stage where the long-term success of the dynasty would be secured: what happened behind closed doors became a matter of intense public scrutiny. The bed of Queen Caroline, Queen Consort of King George IV from 1820 until her death in 1821 . The bed of Mary of Modena Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland as the second wife of James II and VI from 1685 to 1688 . Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries the royal bedchamber became a place where aspiring courtiers could gain influence and status: if you were admitted to see the king or queen in their undergarments, you knew you were pretty important. Now inquisitive historian Lucy Worsley has journeyed into the late night lives of the Royal family, peeking behind the bedroom doors of Medieval kings right through to Queen Victoria. Tales From The Royal Bedchamber, screened on BBC4 next week, explores the history of the Royal bedroom, its significance, its style, who was allowed into it and what it meant if you were. Worsley visits palaces around Britain, from Hampton Court to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, investigating how the bedrooms of the royal family were regarded throughout history. The bed of Queen Charlotte, wife of George III, who died in 1818 at Kew Palace . During the reign of Henry VIII the royal bedchamber became a matter of intense public interest, as the nation became as obsessed as the king was with securing the royal dynasty with a male heir . Speaking to MailOnline, Worsley said: 'The royal bedroom used to be a very, very public place. It was only with Queen Victoria that the bedroom doors really swung closed, and that was partly to do with her character - she really didn't like the human body very much - and partly to do with the chastity and modesty of the age. 'Until the Victorian period there were always people trooping through the royal bedroom.' Speaking about the current royal family, Worsley said: 'There is still a big overlap between the nation and the . monarchy, but they're not quite the same thing. The body of the royal . family doesn't represent the nation as much as it used to. 'They keep a big boundary between us and them, and although it sounds surprising given media coverage, they are very private - especially by comparison to the monarchs of the past.' Describing the wedding night of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon, Worsley said: 'Catherine was led from the wedding feast by ladies in waiting, then courtiers de-robed Henry in the bedchamber. 'Until the very last minute the room would have been full of people cheering them on. Then, in the morning, there would have been the ""inspection of the sheets"" by the ladies of the bedchamber to see if the marriage had been consummated and maybe an heir was on the way.' The bed Queen Anne commissioned as her death bed, but which wasn't ready until after she died . Historian Lucy Worsley travels into the most intimate rooms used by the Royal family to uncover the history of the royal bedroom . Lucy Worsley travels through Britain visiting royal palaces in search of the history of the royal bedroom . She laments the fact that none of Henry VIII's bedrooms remained in tact, marvels over the extraordinarily ornate bed commissioned by Queen Anne as her deathbed - but, unfortunately, not completed in time - later heralded by George III as 'the most splendid bed in the universe'. 'When King James II's wife Mary gave birth to a healthy baby boy in Hampton Court Palace in 1688, the protestants were not happy. 'James II was catholic . and very unpopular, so the new baby meant there was an heir to the throne who would continue his catholic reign. 'To cause trouble, protestants spread a rumour that Mary's baby had died during childbirth, and that an impostor baby had been snuck into the bedroom by a servant who had carried the swapped baby through the palace in a bed-warming pan. 'They released enormous amounts of detail, including a map of the route the pan had travelled, and although it was, of course, total rubbish, James II was forced to print the accounts of 40 witnesses who had been in the room for the birth: having witnesses was important then, as people needed to be there to check an heir had been born. 'The thing was James . was so unpopular that people wanted to believe the story, so they did, and eventually they knocked him off the throne. 'James lost control of the royal bedroom, and thus lost his kingdom. The story reveals the power of what happens in the royal bedroom.' Lucy Worsley . The documentary pairs up with an exhibition of Royal bedrooms currently underway at Hampton Court Palace. Secrets of the Royal Bedchamber explores the bedchamber of the 17th and 18th century royal court, focusing on six magnificent royal beds, including Queen Anne’s magnificent velvet state bed; the state bed of James II's Queen, Mary of Modena, where the famous 'warming pan' incident occurred; and the 'travelling bed' of George II, which . comes apart into 54 pieces and is testament to a time when the King and . his court were often on the move. A palace spokesman said: 'For the first time ever the world’s largest and rarest collection of early state beds will be presented in one dramatic display which tells the story of how and why the bedchamber became the most public and important destination in the Palace. 'The exhibition will also offer a chance to view architect John Vanbrugh's Prince of Wales’s Apartments - opened for the first time in 20 years. 'Through the stories of their royal owners and servants, visitors will be able to explore the elaborate, sometimes bizarre bedchamber rituals, unusual sleeping arrangements and enjoy the luxurious excesses of the Stuart and Hanoverian courts.' Historic Royal Palaces' exhibition curator, Sebastian Edwards, said: 'Visitors to the exhibition will discover that, far from being restful places of privacy, the state bedchamber was the seat of power - the equivalent of the modern day boardroom, from which the business of the Kingdom was conducted. 'Events which took place in and around these beds had enormous consequences for society, politics and history. 'Courtiers were knighted, wars were brokered, marriages consummated and mistresses wooed all in the shadow of the royal bed. These are extraordinary beds - but not as we know them today.'

"Labour's health spokesman Andy Burnham was accused of ‘political posturing’ for calling for a halt to private companies running NHS services. Mr Burnham backed Jarrow-style protest marches against the coalition's health reforms, claiming the 'privatisation’ of the health service is ‘indefensible’. But his speech in Manchester came under fire because as health secretary in the last Labour government he extended the use of the private sector services. Scroll down for video . Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham backed protest marches against the involvement of private firms in the NHS, something he signed off when in government . Mr Burnham called for all pending NHS contracts with the private sector to be put on hold until the next election - except where there are ‘threats to on-going service provision’. But in office, he oversaw the process of private companies bidding to run Hinchingbrooke hospital in Cambridge. It is the first hospital to be run by a private firm, a model which Labour now say they oppose. Mr Burnham said: 'When people look back, this could turn out to be no ordinary summer for the NHS. 'In just over two weeks, a group of mums from Darlington will set out from the North East, retracing the steps of the Jarrow marchers. 'The People’s March for the NHS aims to raise awareness about, in their words, “the Government’s assault on our most prized possession”. 'It remains to be seen whether it catches the public mood. But I think it might. There is growing anxiety about where the NHS is heading - and anger that people have never voted for such changes.' The original Jarrow March in 1936 saw a band of jobless men walk 300 miles to London to protest about unemployment and poverty during the Great Depression. Mr Burnham said some of the private contracts currently proposed will last for five or ten years at least, which will ‘tie the hands of the next government’. Spending on private providers, he says, has now exceeded £10billion. ‘When did the British public ever give their consent for this?’, he said. ‘The reason people love and trust the NHS is because for all its faults, it is a service that is based on people not profits’, he added. ‘It is indefensible for the character of the country’s most valued institution to be changed in this way without the public being given a say.’ But even the NHS Confederation – which presents all providers of health and care services - was sceptical. Chief operating officer Matt Tee said: ‘The test should be what is right for patients and local communities. 'Our members are very clear that there are plenty of things which keep them awake at night, but contracting is rarely cited as one of them. He called for politicians of all parties ‘to engage with the real issues facing the health and social care system and to play their part in taking forward an honest debate with the public about how to address them.’ The original Jarrow March in 1936 saw a band of jobless men walk 300 miles to London to protest about unemployment and poverty during the Great Depression. A 50th anniversary march was also held in 1986 (pictured) Conservatives pointed out Mr Burnham’s change of tune since his party’s 2010 manifesto in which Labour promised to allow foundation hospitals – which run their own finances – to have the freedom ‘to increase their private services where these are consistent with NHS values’. A Conservative spokesman said: ‘Use of the private sector by the NHS doubled in the last four years of Labour, a far bigger increase than under this government. ‘Andy Burnham himself signed off the privatisation of Hinchingbrooke Hospital during Labour's final year so it is pure political posturing to try to interfere with doctors making the best clinical judgements for patients. Yesterday Hazel Blears, a former minister under Tony Blair, wrote an article cautioning against making decisions about public services on the basis of ideology. She wrote in Progress magazine that under New Labour: ‘The party adopted a more open-minded approach to the private sector, rightly determined to dispel notions it was anti-business. ‘But it also achieved fantastic improvements in the standard of public services, becoming the first government since the war to cut crime while achieving the lowest ever NHS waiting times.’ The Coalition have carried out a controversial £3billion reorganisation of the national health service which they say puts budgets back in the hands of doctors. Critics say it allows too many vital services such as cancer care to be run for profit rather than for patients. Mr Burnham pointed to two contracts for cancer care in Staffordshire – lasting 10 years with a combined value of £1.2bn; a five year contract for elderly care in Cambridge worth £800million, and a contract for services in Oxford and Milton Keynes which has been put up for ‘auction’ to the cheapest bidder.","Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham launches Labour's NHS campaign .

"Cyclists with tiny cameras fitted to their helmets to film aggressive drivers have become a common sight – but now horse riders are getting in on the act. A miniature camera has gone on sale that can be attached to horses’ tails. It is wrapped in a high-visibility sleeve bearing the words: ‘Smile, you’re on camera.’ Safety: Inventor David Daly says his speed camera on a horse's tail can reduce accidents as it will encourage drivers to slow down (stock image) Inventor David Daly said there were 3,000 accidents a year involving horses and vehicles. Two riders and 14 horses were killed in 2012. He said he hoped drivers who saw the yellow sleeve on a horse’s tail would slow down and be more considerate if they thought they were being filmed by the £49.95 camera. Elsewhere on his  Gizapaw website, Mr Daly sells a sleeve that describes the horse's usual behaviour so those approaching it now what to expect. Dubbed ABS, which stands for Animal Behavior Sleeve, the products feature words such as 'novice' and 'kicker' to forewarn unfamiliar riders.

"Paul Lambert has told Darren Bent his exile from the Aston Villa team was ‘nothing personal’ and suggested the ex-England striker might look at himself for answers. The Scot also revealed there was no interest from top-flight teams in Bent, who at £18million is Villa’s record signing. Bent moved to Championship club Derby County this month on a deal until June to effectively end his four-year stay at Villa Park. His £65,000-a-week contract finishes this summer. Paul Lambert has told Darren Bent that his exile from Aston Villa's team was because he wasn't good enough . Bent questioned whether his exile was a personal snub from the Aston Villa manager . Earlier this month Bent, 30, questioned whether his absence from the Villa side was a personal snub from Lambert, who said: ‘I think Darren has got to be honest with himself. If you ask anyone here they’d tell you it’s nothing personal. 'I never stood in his way to go to any other club. The only clubs that came in for him were Championship clubs — not one Premier League club.

"He was the man who rescued his beloved Wolverhampton Wanderers from ruin, spent £60million on securing their return to the top flight, then sold the club for £10 to secure more investment. He was the man who donated so much to charity that Wolves staff will need to sift through pages and pages to calculate the final total. He was the man who demanded staff wear a tie on match days. Sir Jack Hayward died on Tuesday, aged 91. There may never be another football-club owner quite like him. Sir Jack Hayward poses outside Molineux stadium before a home game for Wolves . Born on June 14, 1923, less than half a mile from Molineux Stadium, Jack was only five years old when he first crawled under the turnstiles to watch his team. His final match was Jody Craddock’s testimonial in May, two days after Wolves beat Carlisle to gain promotion to the Championship with a record points haul. In between, Sir Jack bought Wolves for £2m in 1990 and spent far more trying to reach the Premier League, a dream realised for a single season in 2003. Former owner and chairman of Wolves Sir Jack Hayward holds a sign renaming Molineux Way . Hayward sold Wolves to current chairman Steve Morgan for £10 and a promise of £30million investment . Four years later he sold up to Steve Morgan for just a tenner, on the proviso that the new custodian would pump in £30million. It was a decision that caused deep divisions within Sir Jack’s family but ensured a prosperous future for the club. Their fabulous stadium, which fell impeccably silent for a minute of respect before Tuesday’s FA Cup third-round replay against Fulham, is testimony to that. As is the pristine training ground bearing Sir Jack’s name. Based predominantly in the Bahamas, the islands where he made his £160m fortune through developing the city of Freeport, he was nevertheless unfailingly patriotic, earning the nickname Union Jack through sustained philanthropy over many years. Hayward celebrates promotion to the Premier League with then manager Dave Jones back in 2003 . After battling illness for several months, Sir Jack passed away in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Jez Moxey, Wolves chief executive since 2000, paid tribute to his friend. ‘He was an all-round good guy and we are heartbroken at his loss,’ said Moxey. ‘He was the most generous-hearted, kind man you could ever want to meet. But he also had a ruthless streak that was as tough as anyone. ‘He was very principled. Certain things other people didn’t think were important were very important to him. I remember Derek Harrington, the vice-chairman, said to me: “Jez, on match day make sure you wear a tie. Sir Jack demands it”. ‘The club could have gone out of business at the time he stepped in. It certainly would not have been nurtured and loved the way it has to create what we have now. Hayward looks delighted as he holds a scarf after becoming Wolves chairman in 1990 . Hayward (centre) stand with supporters during a Wolves game back in 1991 . ‘Unfortunately, a lot of people measure football simply by league position, how many points you have got. But he had a philanthropic approach to it, as an asset for the city, to be saved for the fans, and managed in a way befitting of him as a patriot of the club. ‘We’ve tried to do that. Sir Jack’s influence remains as strong today as it was when he was the chairman.’ At times during his tenure, Sir Jack, whose generosity extended to buying Lundy Island for the National Truest, regretted the way he had let his heart rule his head on how money was invested — famously labelling himself the ‘Golden Tit’ in 1999. But, spurred on by the glory years he witnessed in the 1950s, he continued to invest and was at the Millennium Stadium in 2003 to see Wolves beat Sheffield United in the play-off final to reach the Premier League. ‘He lived in Whitmore Reans, a stone’s throw from Molineux, and used to climb under the turnstiles to watch his heroes,’ recalled Moxey. ‘He went on to fulfil a lifelong dream of owning the club.’","Sir Jack Hayward was Wolves owner for 17 years between 1990 and 2007 .

"Newsflash: striker scores goal and celebrates wildly. Par for the course usually, but when Saido Berahino is concerned it warrants observation. Seven days after he failed to raise a smile despite four goals against Gateshead in the FA Cup, Berahino struck again, a winner against Hull, and exhibited the emotion that shows this game is more than just a job. Arms wide, he waved enthusiastically and pointed to the stands where he later revealed his sister Mirielle was situated. ‘Let’s see if that celebration makes the headlines!’ he said. Well here you go, Saido. Saido Berahino of West Bromwich Albion (left) scores the winner against Hull on Saturday at The Hawthorns . Berahino celebrates after scoring the winner for West Brom alongside team-mate Victor Anichebe (right) Berahino (second left) was criticised for not celebrating any of his four goals in West Brom's emphatic FA Cup win over Gateshead last weekend . Clearly irritated at the reaction his ‘professional’ response to scoring four provoked, Berahino clarified his view. ‘I’m almost a target out there, everyone is trying to bring a bad name to me,’ he said. ‘It is not in the rules that you’ve got to celebrate. Loads of players don’t. But I’m always the one getting blamed and picked out. I just smile and keep my mouth shut. ‘I don’t understand why certain things are written about me. To all my fans out there, I’m just trying to enjoy my football, make everyone happy and maybe one day achieve my dreams.’ Tony Pulis has won six of his last nine league games as a manager. There are the underlying issues though, which his last comment hints at. Berahino wants to play Champions League football; a realistic aim for a striker with 14 goals this season. But no bids have come in yet — Liverpool are said to be monitoring the situation, while Tottenham have distanced themselves — and talks initially intended to improve a £12,000-a-week contract are on hold. Tony Pulis watches on in his first Premier League match in charge of West Brom on Saturday at the Hawthorns . Berahino is due to appear before Runcorn Magistrates’ Court on January 19 on a drink-drive charge, the day of West Brom’s game at Everton. Berahino last week had a meeting with new head coach Tony Pulis, who wants to keep him but is minded to accept offers in excess of £20million. ‘It went well,’ Berahino said. ‘Obviously there are always rumours but all I can control is what I do on the field.’ Jamie Vardy (left) and Troy Deeney (right) and  are on West Brom's list of targets for this transfer window . ‘I’m not going to say we are not going to sell him,’ said Pulis after his first league match in charge. ‘If a stupid offer comes in I’d look stupid if I said I’m not going to sell him. But if we get another striker in and keep him that will make my day.’ Leicester’s Jamie Vardy and Troy Deeney of Watford are on West Brom’s list of targets. Brown Ideye, the £9m club-record signing from Dinamo Kiev, started against Hull but is woefully short of the required standard. He missed a glorious chance in the first half when slipped clear by Berahino, who drilled an indirect free-kick 12 minutes from time.","West Brom secure vital 1-0 win against fellow strugglers Hull in Tony Pulis' first Premier League game in charge of the Baggies on Saturday .

Neola Robinson, from Texas, was arrested on Saturday for the murder of her husband Pleasant Ervin 'Shorty' Robinson, 52, who went missing in June 2010. The month before, Robinson angrily said to a friend while they were drinking at a bar that she didn't want her husband of three years to come home 'because if he does he’s going to be missing some body parts, or I’m going to kill him. I don't care if I go to prison.' The 62-year-old has been charged with murder. She is on suicide watch in prison where she is being held on $150,000 bail. Charged: Neola Robinson, 62, is charged in connection with the murder of her husband, Ervin Robinson . Buried: The body of Neola Robinson's husband, Ervin, was found in the front yard of the home where they used to live . Shorty's daughter Crystal Robinson . told the Star Telegram her father had been married eight times before . and she thought he had finally met someone who made her happy. Their problems started when she was . injured in a car wreck in October 2009. She had to stop working and grew . jealous about her husband's female friends. Crystal said by May the following . year her dad planned on leaving his wife and removed all the funds from . their joint checking account and opened a separate one. Soon after, Robinson became . upset with her husband when he went to a friend’s funeral against her . wishes. According to the search warrant affidavit, hours after the funeral, Neola Robinson found her husband at Lynn’s . Saloon in Azle with one of his female friends. That’s when she said her husband had better not come home or . she would dismember or kill him, according to the affidavit. Four days later, police responded to a . domestic dispute at the house where Neola Robinson had locked her . husband outside because he refused to give her money, the document said. Michael Wright, co-owner of TJ . Machine & Tool in Azle, where Shorty Robinson had worked, filed the . missing-person report on June 16, 2010, after Robinson didn’t show up . for two weeks.

Marital troubles: The couple were often heard arguing and had violent episodes but it has still come as shock to many in the community . He said he was not surprised by the recent discovery. 'I had always suspected that something bad had happened to him,' Wright said on Wednesday. Pleasant Ervin Robinson was last seen . on May 29, 2010, on a store security video in the Fort Worth suburb of . Lake Worth buying food and mattresses.

She died on Tuesday afternoon in a hospice. Michelle, herself a mother of a two-year-old girl, spoke of the shock her friends and family felt when the cancer returned. 'It was just heartbreaking. She had the scan and it had got into her lungs. That was it. 'The chemo would prolong her life but they had to stop treatment in June because it wasn't working.' She added 'She was always thinking of her little girl. Her husband Ash has been her rock and his mum Nonny has constantly cared for Gigi. 'There are so many people that loved her, everyone she knew loved her. When she spoke to you, it would feel as if you were the only person in her life at that moment. 'I told her I would be talking to her for eternity. She said that for her last few days she wanted love and stroking and candles in the room. She didn't like people to cry.'

Her husband Ashley released a statement, saying: 'Rebekah had wonderful care and felt loved and safe right up until the end, especially with the outstanding nursing staff at the Hospice in the Weald, who were exceptional.

'I'd also like to thank everyone for their kind wishes and messages at this difficult time. My daughter and I take a great deal of comfort from this as we come to terms with life without our Rebekah.' Rebekah first noticed a lump at Christmas in 2007, when she was seven and a half months pregnant. Initially she thought it was the baby moving, but was horrified when she realised it was a walnut-sized mass in her left breast. Anxious that it might be a tumour, she went first to her GP then a locum doctor. Both of them initially told her that she had a blocked milk duct. Speaking to the Mail in 2009, she said: 'The private consultant I [eventually] saw said he believed it was cancer even before he ran a single test. 'At that moment it was as though a bomb had exploded inside my world, destroying every certainty. 'I could barely think. 'Although Gigi was crying with hunger, the last thing I wanted to do was to get out my breast and start feeding her, knowing there was something alien and poisonous growing in there, but I knew she needed my milk. 'It was surreal; I was only 35, with a newborn baby. I couldn’t have imagined that something so awful could happen.’ Rebekah had planned to breast-feed for six months. Instead, she was given a drug to dry up her milk supply before surgery to remove the tumour. 'That was a particularly devastating moment,' she recalled. 'Suddenly being a mother wasn't the priority; the priority was staying alive.' More blows were to follow: a biopsy showed the cancer was grade three – a very aggressive form – and an examination of her lymph nodes revealed the disease had spread.

So what should have been a time of joy at the arrival of her baby became a daily battle with despair as she and her fiancé, garage owner Ashley Pitman, 47, faced up to the challenges that lay ahead. The days and weeks were marked out not by Gigi’s precious milestones but hospital appointments and gruelling rounds of chemotherapy. ‘I missed out on so much,’ says Rebekah. ‘When I had my first round of chemo I felt so sick that I couldn’t interact with Gigi – all I could do was come home and take her to bed with me. Then I realised I would have to hand her over to someone – my mother, Ash’s mother or my neighbour Victoria – because she needed stimulation to grow. 'On the day I started to lose my hair from the chemo, I was changing her nappy and she reached up and stroked my head. She gave me such strength through the toughest of times.' Her agent Belfield and Ward tweeted the news of her death: 'Darling Rebekah Gibbs, a true inspiration and dazzling light, never to be forgotten.'

Born in Torquay, Devon, Rebekah attended the Doreen Bird College of Performing Arts in Sidcup, whose alumni include Spice Girl Mel C. She appeared in the West End musicals Starlight Express, Grease and Fame before landing the part of Nina Farr, a paramedic, in Casualty in 2004. She left in 2006 to start a family, and went into healthy living overdrive; she was training for a half-marathon when she found out she was expecting Gigi. Poignantly, in a book she wrote about her struggle with the disease, Gibbs wrote a moving open letter to Gigi, telling her how much she loves her. 'The book is part of my preparations for Gigi’s life, with or without me,' she said. 'If I can’t be there, all I want is for her and Ash to be happy. 'But for now, I have to concentrate on how much joy and fun I can cram into our remaining time together, because I have no way of knowing how long I’ve got.'

Mr Brittnacher awoke on Monday morning to the rousing bark of his dog around 5.45am when Smith broke down the screen door and entered the kitchen. 'I heard a ruckus at the door, walked to the door, and saw the young man holding a gun. I used to own a nightclub, and I knew it was never a good idea to talk to people holding guns,' he told ABC News. Scene: The intruder's car broke down and he broke into this house with a gun . Even match: Charles Smith, 38, was bested by Ervin Brittnacher, 79 . Not only that, but Smith was muttering incoherently, hinting at the trouble that a later drug test would later reveal. 'I didn’t know whether to be scared or feel sorry for him,' Brittnacher told local station KENS5. 'I just took that old hand and give him a good old chop, and normally, that really hurts bad,' he said, describing his karate-style moves. To make sure Smith was out, Mr Brittnacher followed that with a punch to the throat, which ended the fight. Back in the day: Brittnacher earned second place in a large bull riding competition . Calmer days: Now Brittnacher spends his time farming in Texas . Playing dirty is nothing new to Mr Brittnacher who gained fame at an early age as a bull rider and cowboy who steadied himself on bucking broncos and bulls. Beyond that, he also worked as a bouncer at a honky tonk that he owned so Mr Brittnacher is used to breaking up fights, though that was some time ago. 'You can get run over real bad if you don't protect yourself,' he said. Smith did not suffer and permanent damage, and that comes as a surprise to some who know Mr Brittnacher. 'I figured he would hurt him worse,' Mr Brittnacher's son Mark told KENS5. 'He’s not someone to mess with. Nicest man you’d ever want to meet. Do anything for you. But you don’t want to cross him, push him around. He ain’t going to put up with that.' WATCH THE VIDEO HERE .

"Having claimed he felt like a supply teacher in his previous managerial role, Tim Sherwood had a response ready for his Aston Villa unveiling. ‘I’m the headmaster now!’ he grinned. His five-month spell last season as Tottenham Hotspur head coach saw him gain the highest Premier League win ratio of any boss at White Hart Lane but also hear repeated questions about his position. ‘I kept getting told “This man wants your job” and “That man’s been spoken to.” It was every week,’ he recalled. Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood was unveiled at Villa Park on Monday . Sherwood was speaking on Monday at his press conference unveiling to the media as their new manager . Score some goals — Villa have mustered just 12 Premier League goals so far. Sherwood said getting Christian Benteke to improve on his tally of three this season is key. ‘I’m sure we can tap into that confidence and get him back firing,’ he said. Revealing his half-time team-talk against Leicester, he said: ‘I told them to play with less fear. We need to play with a little more freedom.’ Find an assistant manager — Chris Ramsey not joining will be a ‘loss’, Sherwood admitted, with his former Spurs colleague now in charge at QPR. Swindon Town’s No 2 Luke Williams has been mentioned but Sherwood ruled him out and said he won’t rush into the decision. Get the fans onside — Pretty much sorted by Sherwood’s mere presence, following angry scenes at Paul Lambert’s last match - the defeat to Hull. Sherwood talked a good game as well. He said: ‘I think every club needs excitement, the fans pay their money and we need to give them that.’ ‘I dealt with it and got on with the job. It was difficult. What was I going to do? Roll in the corner and die? I’m not going to do that. I’m a fighter. I’ll fight till the bitter end.’ That is the psychology desperately needed at Villa now. They are in a scrap and, as Sherwood insisted, ‘need to start throwing a few punches’. There was more than words of blood and thunder but his immediate understanding that Villa have been gripped by attacking apprehension is fundamental to their chances of survival. Under Paul Lambert, Villa scored just 12 Premier League goals in 25 games to sit 18th in the table. ‘I think they fear losing too much,’ explained Sherwood. ‘It has to hurt them to lose but they cannot worry.’ Six wins is his initial target. The key, he insisted, was getting Christian Benteke back firing, comparing the Belgian striker to Emmanuel Adebayor, who enjoyed a renaissance once Sherwood took over at Spurs. ‘Yes, it was the case with Ade and it could possibly be the case with Christian. We hope it will be,’ said Sherwood, who revealed one message during his half-time intervention against Leicester on Sunday was to supply Benteke with the ball more often. ‘I remember playing against Christian Benteke as a manager what a handful he can be. We need to get back to that. All the best clubs in the world were after him. I’m sure Tottenham were interested. ‘It’s not a one-man team though. There are a lot of big players. No one wants to get relegated. It will hurt them to drop into the Championship. We can’t let that happen. They need to start performing.’ Benteke failed to find the back of the net once more as  Villa progressed past Leicester City in the FA Cup . Sherwood believes he can the best out of Benteke before the end of the season with Aston Villa . Tim Sherwood has the best win percentage (59.1) of any Tottenham manager in Premier League history. Current manager Mauricio Pochettino is third with a win % of 52. Sherwood famously rattled a few cages when offering a frank assessment on Tottenham players following a 4-0 defeat to Chelsea. ‘Lacking guts and character,’ he said. ‘Watch this space!’ he grinned again when asked if he would deliver similar stinging assessments at Villa. ‘If I’m going to be guilty of something it will be honesty,’ Sherwood said. ‘If they do well they will be told. If they don’t do well they will also be told. Some people need to be patted on the back. Some people need a kick up the backside.’ Sherwood acted as a breath of fresh air at a club where a stale odour had begun to cling. He knows a sharp shock is needed to jolt positive results out of an underperforming squad. ‘Right now it’s all about winning,’ he said. ‘Don’t expect too many 18-years-olds on Saturday (against Stoke).’ Sherwood will begin his search for an assistant soon, but it will not be Chris Ramsey, his trusted lieutenant at Spurs, who is now in charge at QPR. ‘Chris will be a loss because he’s very good at what he does,’ said Sherwood. ‘He’s got a different role now. Interestingly enough, I hope he makes a mess of it!’ Sherwood has targeted six wins from Villa's final 13 Premier League matches to ensure safety . The Villa Park managerial job is the second of Sherwood's career after starting out at Tottenham last season . He said talks broke down on his own move to Loftus Road because ‘it wasn’t right for either party’ and conceded he believed the West Bromwich Albion job was ‘quite close’ before Tony Pulis took the reins. ‘The longer you stay out people think “Ooh, might not get back in”,’ admitted Sherwood. ‘A lot of the time I was out it was my choice.’ Sherwood will finish his UEFA Pro Licence in September on a course run by the Welsh FA alongside Garry Monk, Craig Bellamy, Les Ferdinand, Sol Campbell and Patrick Vieira. On the subject of his credentials at this level, the 46-year-old said plainly: ‘There are a lot of poor experienced managers.’ American owner Randy Lerner, who has the club on the market, has offered only a brief telephone conversation so far, with chief executive Tom Fox handling affairs in England. ‘Every club is up for sale at the right price,’ said Sherwood. ‘I can’t worry about that.’ Prices in the club shop for gilets, Sherwood’s signature touchline attire, have been chopped from £42 to £29 — a reduction pre-dating his arrival. He walked in wearing a suit and v-neck jumper, prompting one reporter immediately to question the whereabouts of his customary garb. ‘I thought it would be two seconds before I heard a gilet joke,’ he said. ‘It was one!’ Villa have left it late to make a change, but judging by Sherwood’s comic timing, they have the man for the challenge. Villa have put their club gilets on sale following the appointment of Sherwood . The gilets have been reduced in price to £29 and were a popular item choice  to wear by Sherwood at Spurs .

"With its horns, long white body and slithery form, it looks like a mythical beast . But this four-metre long horned creature is only too real - as the stench from its decomposing flesh proved. The mysterious sea creature was washed ashore in Villaricos, Spain - and tests are being done on the carcass to determine what it is. The four-metres long creature, seen with its head detached from its body, is in an advanced state of decomposition . A swimmer stumbled across the horn head and decayed body on a Spanish beach . An unfortunate swimmer stumbled across the head before coming across the rest of the body, the Huffington Post reported. Civil Protection Coordinator Maria Sanchez said: 'We have no idea what it can be, but it smelled bad, because it was so badly decomposed', Digital Spy reported. She added: 'A lady found one part, and we helped her retrieve the rest… We have no idea what it was. It really stank, as it was in the advanced stages of decomposition,' Inquisitr reported. The extent of the deterioration of the creature meant most of the remains had to be buried for safety reasons. Several . theories have been suggested about what the creature is - ranging from . it being a type of shark to it being an oar fish, but researchers are . still examining it. Programa en Defensa de la Fauna Marina (PROMAR) spokesman Paco Toledano was also puzzled, Yahoo reported. Several theories have been suggested about what the creature is - ranging from it being a type of shark to it being an oar fish . He said: 'It's hard to know what we’re dealing with,' Mr Toldano told ideal.es. 'It is broken up and we can not identify what ii is. Maybe it's a bull fish', he joked. 'Perhaps if we were able to analyse the bones we might know more, but for this specific genetic analysis it is very expensive and who would pay? 'We've certainly never before seen anything like this.' A spokesman for the Marine Biological Association said: 'A few people have said it could be the backbone of a shark with the rest of it decaying away. 'Really we would need a vertebrae to properly identify it. If it was a shark it would have cartilage skeleton as opposed to bone. 'As for the horns  - it's pretty inconclusive. No one knows of anything with horns in the sea. From the picture you wonder if it is even part of the creature.'","Spanish marine biologists mystified by the creature that was spotted dead in the shallows by a woman on the beach at Villaricos .

"With 11 Barclays Premier League goals in 21 games, Aston Villa’s season review for 2014-15 is unlikely to extend to cinematic length. Ten minutes, roll credits. To beef it up, a section could detail Pep Guardiola’s role. It was a trip to observe Bayern Munich train under the Spanish innovator at the start of last month that convinced Paul Lambert to adopt a new, possession-based style for a team who can’t score goals, don’t create chances and serve up precious little entertainment. Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert is under pressure having seen his side score just 11 league goals this season . Star striker Christian Benteke has scored just two Premier League goals since returning from injury . Lambert decided to change his side's style of play after watching Pep Guadriola's Bayern Munich train . 11 - Aston Villa . 18 - Sunderland . 19 - Burnley . 20 - West Brom, Hull, Leicester . 22 - Crystal Palace, Stoke . It was an admirable ambition by Lambert. The result? ‘Too much passing, not enough purpose,’ one observer noted. It is not like Villa were swashbuckling prior to Guardiola opening his Bavarian gates. But a barren run since Boxing Day, with Villa slipping to just three points above the relegation zone, has seen supporters chant for Lambert’s head. Liverpool’s visit, to begin a vital sequence against Bournemouth, Arsenal and Chelsea, is hugely important. The atmosphere promises to be edgy. Three supporter sites have called for those with tickets in the Holte End to leave their seats vacant for the first eight minutes to mark the number of full seasons Randy Lerner has owned the club. Watch for 82 minutes, is the idea, in recognition of the year Villa won the European Cup. Few even dream those heady days can return but nor do supporters of one of England’s oldest and biggest clubs expect to witness such limp displays on and off the field. There is mounting frustration Villa cannot compete better in the transfer market or Premier League table. ‘We don’t like the word “protest”, it is more a demonstration,’ said Damian Dugdale of The Villa Blog. ‘We’d like to think this has positive connotations. ‘The demonstration suggests that if we continue down this path it might well be that the Holte End is half-empty.’ Former England and Villa manager Graham Taylor lives on the outskirts of Birmingham and has gauged the mood. Three Villa fan sites are planning to leave their seat vacant for the first eight minutes on Saturday . Former Villa manager Graham Taylor believes fans have become 'disaffected' with their football club . ‘Supporters do come up to me to express their feelings and I must say I am surprised it has taken this long for such action to materialise,’ he said. ‘That is not to say I’m advocating Paul getting the sack at all, just the fans have seemed disaffected for quite a while.’ Much stems from Lerner’s loss of interest. Having shot for the stars with Martin O’Neill and missed, the American billionaire tightened the purse strings five years ago. He enjoyed the top-six finishes and the 2010 League Cup final but grew tired of the ‘week-in, week-out battles’ football throws up. Last May he announced his intention to sell up but has found no buyers, so the club finds itself in limbo. Paralysis is another interpretation. Lambert’s job is secure so long as relegation is avoided. Lerner is reluctant to spend cash that will not maintain or enhance the price he wants for the club. Chief executive Tom Fox was appointed last summer from a role at Arsenal, where he negotiated large-scale sponsorship deals worth millions. Owner Randy Lerner has decided to tighten his purse strings since Martin O'Neill's departure in 2010 . American billionaire Lerner (right), pictured in 2006, is keen on selling the Premier League club . Villa’s shirt sponsorship with Dafabet expires this summer. Back in August, Fox was targeting up to £14million per year for the next deal. It will be a big achievement if he gets that figure. Attendances are also falling. In the 2007-08 season, average crowds were 40,398, close to capacity. This season the figure is 32,239, with the lowest attendance in 15 years recorded when Southampton visited: 25,311. Malaise from on high creeps into the stands. What Villa followers crave is a sign of sunnier times to come, a reason to get aspirational. Lambert’s team have scored just seven goals at home in the Premier League. FA Cup opponents Bournemouth have rippled the net more often in the city of Birmingham, following their 8-0 win at St Andrew’s. Lambert, not unreasonably, points to Villa’s defence conceding just 23 goals, the fifth-lowest in the top flight. But the paucity of excitement up front is palpable. Following consecutive, tedious 0-0 draws against Sunderland and Crystal Palace, a third against lowly Blackpool in the FA Cup beckoned until Christian Benteke came up with the goods late on. In the moments preceding his strike, home fans turned on Lambert for the first time. Their calls for him to be sacked found air again last time out in the 1-0 defeat by Leicester. Mutiny in the stands threatens to emerge against Liverpool if Villa’s recently-acquired style continues to produce a desperate dearth of scoring opportunities. The problem stems from hardly any of this ball retention being dangerous to opponents. Promising winger Jack Grealish could be sent out on loan after failing to hold down a regular first team spot . At goal kicks, full backs drop to near the corner flags to receive passes from Brad Guzan and build attacks. But frequently moves stall when crossing the halfway line. Pace on the flanks is a huge issue, as is creativity through the middle. There is scarcely anything to get fans off their seats for the right reasons. Hopes were high for winger Jack Grealish this season, a local lad. He enjoyed cameo roles that energised supporters but now finds himself out of the reckoning and looking for a loan move. No Harry Kane heroics here. However, the mood in camp is said to still be positive. Benteke has not looked himself lately but, like Lambert, has a habit of turning in a performance when most needed. Lambert has pleaded with fans not to go through with their walkout and a win against Liverpool would lift the gloom considerably. But deeper issues remain. Until Lerner completes a sale or Lambert inspires a surge of form, Villa Park will continue to be cast as Bleak House.","Aston Villa have the worst Premier League record in front of goal .

"A Florida man has been charged with battery after allegedly punching a pizza deliveryman in the face ‘because he forgot the garlic knots,’ according to a police report. Robert Wheeler, 48, was arrested nearly two weeks ago following the skirmish that broke out outside a house in his hometown of Vero Beach. The deliveryman, 19-year-old Jonathon Feigen, told investigators that the 346-pound Wheeler struck him below the left eye after he rolled down the window of his vehicle. Charged: Robert Wheeler, 48, is accused of punching a 19-year-old deliveryman in the face for failing to bring him garlic knots . Feigen, who had slight redness and swelling in the spot where he was hit, according to the police report, had initially declined medical attention, according to the Smoking Gun. However, his mother later contacted River County Sheriff’s Office deputies and said that she was taking her son to an emergency room because he was complaining of headache and nausea. On August 19, shortly before 6pm, Feigen pulled up to a house at 445 9th Street Southwest, where Wheeler was waiting for him. The 48-year-old, who has the words ‘Fat’ and ‘Boy’ tattooed on his arms, told the 19-year-old to roll down his window and punched him in the face as Feigen was talking on his cell phone. The victim told police Wheeler said he struck him because ‘he forgot the garlic knots.’ Not that dough: Wheeler told police he punched Feigen because the pizzeria owes him money, not because he forgot to deliver garlic knots . The dissatisfied customer then instructed Feigen to ‘give it [the punch] to the person working on the phone back at the restaurant,’ the station WPTV reported. When officials arrived in Wheeler’s house to question him about the incident, the 48-year-old unemployed man admitted to assaulting the deliveryman, but said that he did not do it over the forgotten garlic knots, but rather because the pizzeria owed him money. Wheeler has been charged with misdemeanor battery and released from River County Jail on $500 bond.","Robert Wheeler, 48, has been charged with misdemeanor battery .

"Punch-up: Krystel Coleman, 29, sister of the bride, was allegedly punched unconscious by her own uncle .

"Tony Pulis has revealed West Ham co-owner David Sullivan called West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace to clear the air after Carlton Cole’s switch to the Hawthorns collapsed at the last minute on transfer deadline day.

It left Cole furious with manager Sam Allardyce, but Pulis said the situation had always been clear to West Brom. Even so, Sullivan spoke to Peace to explain the eleventh hour change. Carlton Cole was close to finalising a deadline day move to West Brom from West . The deal collapsed at the 11th hour because West Ham could not bring in another striker . Tony Pulis said David Sullivan called Jeremy Peace to explain the situation and clear the air . ‘David Sullivan called our chairman and spoke to him, and that shows you how both parties were,’ said Pulis. ‘I think he spoke to Jeremy and said to him that if the situation had been different we’d have done the deal, which was right through to the last minutes of negotiations. ‘But there was never any secret as to what the situation was. If they had brought someone in then Carlton would have been available. If they didn’t then he was going back, which was made clear so that was fine.’ Cole is set to face West Brom at the Hawthorns on Saturday. ‘That’s the way it spins at times,’ said Pulis. 'I’ve always thought he’s a good player who gives you different options, and on his day he’s a handful, whilst his goalscoring record - when he plays - is decent.

"One of the last remaining survivors of the largest Jewish revolt of the Second World War has died at the age of 93. Boruch Spiegel, who is believed to have given the signal to launch the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of 1943, was described by his son Julius as a 'reluctant hero', following his death in Montreal. Mr Spiegel was among 750 Jews who managed to hold off heavily armed German soldiers for more than a month as they tried to storm the Polish ghetto, intent on transporting its occupants to Nazi death camps. 'Reluctant hero': Boruch Spiegel, seen in a family photograph taken in the 1970s or 1980s, fought the Nazis during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of 1943 . With Mr Spiegel's death on May 9, the tiny group of . survivors of the legendary World War II revolt that was crushed 70 years . ago this month grows even smaller. The then 23-year-old was one of about 750 Jewish fighters who on April 19, 1943, launched an uprising that took the Germans off guard. The fighters were overwhelmingly outnumbered and outgunned and the revolt never had a real chance of victory, but the determined insurgents still managed to hold out for a month - longer than some countries invaded by Hitler. 'Modest': Boruch Spiegel, seen before the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, escaped the ghetto through the sewers along with his future wife as the Germans began to crush the rebellion . 'He was very modest, a reluctant hero,' his son Julius Spiegel said of his father. 'He was given an opportunity and he took it. I don’t think he was braver or more resourceful than anyone else.' By the end of May German forces had crushed the uprising, by which time Mr Spiegel had escaped the ghetto through the sewers along with a few dozen other fighters - among them his future wife, Chaika Belchatowska. They trawled through underground sewage canals to reach the so-called 'Aryan side' of the Polish capital. Those left behind were sent to death camps such as Treblinka, where most died. Their struggle endures as a symbol of resistance against the odds and a desire to maintain human dignity in the worst of possible conditions. Ultimately, though, the German revenge was brutal; the Warsaw Ghetto was systematically burned down building by building, culminating in the demolition of the Great Synagogue of Warsaw. After surviving the ghetto uprising, Mr Spiegel and his future wife joined the Polish partisans and also took part in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, a larger city-wide revolt against the occupying Germans. 'He was essentially an ordinary guy forced by circumstances to do things that were out of character,' Julius Spiegel said. Born in October 1919, Mr Spiegel grew up in Warsaw, the son of an Orthodox woman and a leather worker father, according to a New York Times report. After the Germans invaded in 1939, Mr Spiegel and his brother Beryl became involved in the Bundist underground. The Spiegel family managed to hold out for a period as Jewish families were deported around them, thanks to a steel door on their apartment, but his father died of malnutrition and his mother, two sisters, and brother Beryl died in a manner he never learned. Mr Spiegel himself was once taken to the staging area for the Treblinka camp, but managed to escape and return to the ghetto, the report said. Even after the Germans crushed the 1943 uprising, Mr Spiegel fought with Partisans before returning to Warsaw to fight with Poles in a further revolt from August to September 1944. Warsaw was liberated in January 1945. The Spiegels moved to Canada in 1948, where Mr Spiegel followed in the footsteps of his father by working in the leather industry, eventually establishing his own factory.

It's not clear how many of the Warsaw Ghetto fighters are still living, but the number is certainly small. When . Poland held national ceremonies last month marking the 70th anniversary . of the start of the ghetto uprising, officials in Warsaw said they . believed there could be four survivors left. Only . one, Simha Rotem, was visibly present at the ceremony, giving a speech . and accepting a high state honor from the Polish president. However, Havi Dreifuss, a historian and Holocaust expert with Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem, the Jerusalem-based Holocaust research institution and museum, warned against trying to put a number on how many fighters remain, in part because it's sometimes hard to distinguish fighters from other resisters. She noted that aside from those with weapons, there were others who were entrenched in hiding places and refused to obey Nazi orders to show up for transportations to labor or concentration camps, and that an appreciation has grown over time for their resistance during the uprising. Borech Spiegel is survived by his son, Julius, a retired parks commissioner for Brooklyn, daughter Mindy Spiegel of Montreal, and four grandchildren. His wife died in 2002. During the Second World War as many as 400,000 Polish Jews were crammed into the confines of the Warsaw Ghetto. Within its walls they lived under the shadow of rampant disease and starvation, even before German troops began transporting Jews en masse to the Treblinka extermination camp. The seeds were sown for the Warsaw Ghetto uprising in January 1943, when German soldiers arriving to implement a second deportation of Jews to the camp were met by Jewish resistance fighters who engaged them in clashes. Battle of honour: A Jewish rebel is seen leaving a house surrounded by German soldiers inside the Warsaw Ghetto, during the uprising that peaked during April and May 1943 . The deportation was halted after a period of days and only saw 5,000 - rather than the intended 7,000 - Jews taken away. The occupants of the ghetto were ready to fight what was regarded as a battle of honour for the Jewish people, led by two resistance organisations; the ZZW and the ZOB. On 19 April 1943 the police and SS auxiliary forces entered the ghetto for a further deportation action intended to last three days. They were ambushed by Jewish insurgents firing and tossing Molotov cocktails and hand grenades from alleyways, sewers, and windows. The Germans suffered casualties and their advance was halted. German forces resorted to systematically burning down the ghetto, building by building, prompting thousands of surviving Jews and fighters to take cover in underground bunkers or the sewer system. Many were forced out of their hiding places by troops who dropped in smoke bombs. On May 8, the Germans discovered a large dugout located at Miła 18 Street, which served as ŻOB's main command post. Most of the organisation's remaining leadership and dozens of others committed a mass suicide by ingesting cyanide. The suppression of the uprising officially ended on 16 May 1943, with the demolition of the Great Synagogue of Warsaw.","WWII resistance fighter Boruch Spiegel died in Montreal aged 93 .

"A retired priest allegedly had his ear bitten off in an unholy punch-up with another retired clergyman. Father Thomas Byrne, 80, told Father Thomas Smith, 81, to pick the flesh up off the ground and put it in his pocket after the brawl on Friday in Perth, Australia, according to police. But it was only when Father Smith returned to his retirement flat and pulled it out of his pocket that he realised it was his right ear, East Perth Magistrates Court heard. Father Thomas Byrne, 80, allegedly bit off 81-year-old Father Thomas Smith's ear in a brawl in Perth, Australia; picture posed by model . Father Byrne appeared in . court charged with grievous bodily harm over the incident involving . Father Smith, both of whom share the retirement home with a third . retired Catholic priest. The court was told that a violent brawl broke out at the retirement home complex in the Perth suburb of Dianella over a parking spot. Police told the hearing that it took some time for Father Smith to realise his ear had been bitten off. Once he realised that the flesh was his ear, Father Smith is said to have wrapped it in a tea towel and driven to a local medical centre, where staff phoned for an ambulance and police. He was kept in Perth’s Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital after surgery to try to save the severed ear. The punch-up took place over a parking spot in the Perth suburb of Dianella, pictured, the court heard . It appeared that Father Byrne had also suffered a bruising in the alleged fight. When he appeared in East Perth’s Magistrates Court he sported a black eye. Police prosecutor Chris Lawler said Father Byrne did not have a police record but he had concerns for the safety of the victim if bail was approved. ‘They live in the same complex but they are both funded by the Catholic Church,’ Mr Lawler told the court. Magistrate Greg Benn imposed strict bail conditions on Father Byrne, including an order not to go within 10 yards of Father Smith, nor act in a violent or threatening manner towards him. A neighbour living in the retirement home told PerthNow he was shocked to hear about the alleged fight ‘because we’re all in our 80s and retired priests.’ Father Byrne is due to appear in court again on December 7 to allow him to take further legal advice.

"Stuart Pearce is coming under increasing scrutiny at Nottingham Forest as it emerged that associates close to owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi sought counsel from players over the former England international’s management style. Pressure is mounting on the Forest boss after a run of two wins in 19 matches that has seen the team slide to 11th in the table and get knocked out of both cup competitions. Forest’s FA Cup exit to League One Rochdale last Saturday left Pearce fielding questions about his future, with the match against Sheffield Wednesday at the City Ground this weekend followed by the trip to fierce rivals Derby County seven days later gathering importance. Stuart Pearce is under increased pressure at Nottingham Forest after a run of just two wins in 19 games . The Rochdale players celebrate with Peter Vincenti after his penalty gave the hosts a FA Cup win over Forest . Senior figures at the club, including chief executive Paul Faulkner and advisor John McGovern, are understood to be pressing for managerial stability and patience, while fans remain firmly supportive of their legendary former left-back. But the canvassing of opinion from Pearce’s squad suggests it is an issue Al-Hasawi is giving serious consideration. Unusually, McGovern watched training on Tuesday alongside head of finance Lalou Tifrit, officially named also as the owner’s representative, and Hassan Saif, known by many as Al-Hasawi’s eyes and ears. It is believed their presence was to gauge the mood. Al-Hasawi has been abroad but will attend the match against Wednesday and plans to talk to Pearce about the slump in form. Serious questions are likely if Forest lose again. Aided by £5.5million record-signing Britt Assombalonga and £1.5m Michail Antonio, Forest started the season superbly, winning seven and losing none of their first 10 matches to sit top of the Championship. Fawaz Al Hasawi (centre) feels Forest may need a change in their philosophy to turn around their barren run . But there has been little to cheer since, with the team losing their last three games. On Monday night Emad Alqahtani, a friend of Al-Hasawi, sparked discussion on Twitter by translating an interview the Forest owner gave to Kuwaiti television. Alqahtani, who has watched games from the City Ground directors’ box, wrote Al-Hasawi suggested a ‘change’ might be needed after the next two games but later clarified he meant in philosophy rather than management. Al-Hasawi has sacked three managers, Sean O’Driscoll, Alex McLeish and Billy Davies, since taking over in July 2012. He is aware of the good feeling Pearce breeds though and Andy Reid this week said players must 'look within themselves’ about performances. Forest are looking to strengthen their squad this window, despite a transfer embargo limiting spend to £600,000 on the wages of loan players or free transfers. Right-back Todd Kane is set to arrive on loan from Chelsea.","Nottingham Forest have won just twice in 19 games .

"The 300-million-year-old remains of two prehistoric amphibians that have been preserved as one choked on the other are to be sold at auction for £150,000. The fossilised creatures, that resemble modern crocodiles, were discovered in Rhineland-Palatinate, near Frankfurt in Germany, and are thought to be extremely rare. The ancient skeletons are in such good condition they show that the larger, 2ft creature died of suffocation just after it bit the smaller one in half. The fossils of the two amphibians in their final moments were discovered in Rhineland-Palatinate, near Frankfurt in Germany, and are thought to be extremely rare . Even minute details such as skin impressions and the sharp teeth of the killer animal have been perfectly preserved. Sclerocephalus haeuseri lived around 300 million years ago, between the Upper Carboniferous and the Lower Permian periods. The creature looked like a cross between a crocodile and a salamander. Adults could reach a length of up to five feet. Experts believe the creature's young were similar to modern frogs - breathing with external gills when young like tadpoles but eventually developing air breathing lungs. Experts are delighted with the discovery because is it one of few fossil examples of this species, Sclerocephalus haeuseri. The animal looked similar to a crocodile and a salamander today and are thought to be aquatic creatures. Historians and scientists also believe this is thought to be the first fossil discovered that shows a creature of this species dying of suffocation. James Walker, 64, director of nature and science at Heritage Auctions in Texas, where the auction ill be held, said: 'The fossil was found in the Saar-Ruhe Basin in the Rheinland-Pfalz area of what used to be West Germany. 'The fossil dates back to somewhere around the boundary between the Upper Carboniferous and the Lower Permian, between 301 and 297 million years old. Sclerocephalus haeuseri (CGI pictured) lived 300 million years ago and looked similar to a crocodile and a salamander. Scientists believe the fossil is the first to show one dying by suffocation . 'This was the lower boundary of the Permian and it was a time of great transition in climates and ecology. 'The larger one bit off more than it could swallow, in this case, and it was killed by choking on dinner. The smaller one died because it was bitten in half. 'The larger one is a Sclerocephalus haeuseri and the smaller is most likely to be of the same species. They were similar to the crocodiles and alligators of today. 'It is rare to find fossils to begin with, and well-preserved ones are even rarer. 'Examples where both died as a consequence of what could be termed stupid behaviour are quite rare. 'The 'stupid' individuals remove themselves from the gene-pool, and therefore tend to not pass one their 'stupid' genes or behavior. 'Only that the owners are private collectors of long standing with an eye for the rare and unusual.' The auction will be held on Oct 19th and 20th.","The 300-million-year-old remains were discovered near Frankfurt, Germany .

"A goal to repay his £3.25million fee in one go? Quite possibly. Carles Gil brought a sparkle seldom seen at Villa Park with a wonderful strike to avert the danger of another exit to lower-league opposition for Paul Lambert. The Spaniard marked his first Aston Villa start following his move from Valencia in a style Lambert hoped, rather than expected. Picking up the ball from Christian Benteke on the right, he drove at Ian Harte, cut inside and waved his left-foot like a wand to send the ball arcing beautifully into the far corner. A moment to get the Villa fans off their seats, a moment that gave hope for the future. This was only their second goal in more than 11 hours of play but Gil is a player alright, his strike the high point of an appearance full of promise.

Andreas Weimann added a second goal that ultimately proved the winner when Callum Wilson struck in added time for the visitors. It was only the third time this season Villa have scored more than once in a game. So an upset of sorts. It is Gil’s contribution, however, that will live in the memory. Villa Park was given a much-needed lift 10 minutes before kick-off with the announcement that Fabian Delph had signed a new four-and-a-half year contract. The England midfielder addressed the crowd via a video over the big screens, but his words were largely inaudible and it needed the stadium announcer to clarify the positive news. Delph was absent from the Villa line-up, which featured six changes to Lambert’s last selection. Gil was handed his full debut, and Ciaran Clark returned from suspension to captain the side. Shay Given, Kieran Richardson and Leandro Bacuna were the trio who could not be classed as regular starters. Howe stuck to his usual pattern and made wholesale changes – eight from the team that lost to Leeds United in midweek. Tommy Elphick and Steve Cook retained their places, as did Harry Arter. He was instrumental in Bournemouth performing better than the Premier League side throughout the first half. Arter’s movement and passing – operating in front of Villa the defence – appeared an illustration of what Lambert’s team have lacked during their barren scoring run. Villa failed to register a shot on target in the opening period – but should have done after nine minutes. Weimann timed his run to meet Hutton’s cross from the right without breaking stride but sent his header wide as the home fans readied themselves for a cathartic release of noise. From then, it was Howe’s Championship leaders who fashioned the better opportunities. Arter put through Shaun MacDonald with a one-touch pass and the Bournemouth midfielder rounded Given to send a shot towards goal. Richardson recovered to clear near the line. In the 32nd minute Eunan O’Kane struck from range requiring a tip wide from Given at full-stretch and then Arter saw a shot deflected into the side-netting. O’Kane tried again, this time sending a curling effort just over. Aston Villa's new No 25 runs to celebrate in front of the Villa Park faithful . Bournemouth goalkeeper Lee Camp fails to stop Weimann's shot from hitting the back of the net . Shortly before half-time O’Kane fed Yann Kermorgant but as the striker bore down on goal to pull the trigger Jores Okore performed an excellent sliding tackle. Christian Benteke was continuing to perform with little gusto and boos from the Holte End greeted the interval whistle. The stage seemed set for another exit to lower league opposition. But up stepped Gil to produce a different kind of FA Cup magic. Lambert wheeled around in celebration that his January signing had paid immediate dividends. Turns out Villa scoring was this game’s Cup shock, and the surprise was doubled with another lovely goal 19 minutes from the end. Bacuna picked out Hutton’s run down the right and the Scot pulled back a first-time cross to Weimann, who applied a cushion finish into the far corner. Bournemouth found the net in injury time, when Adam Smith pulled back a cross for substitute Callu Wilson to convert. Could the Cherries do a Bradford? No. As they pushed for an unlikely equaliser, Villa mounted a counter-attack that saw Benteke feed substitute Ashley Westwood whose shot was heading in until Lee Camp stretched a hand. No matter.

"A grieving husband is building a monument of love to his late wife - a copy of the Taj Mahal in his garden. Faizul Hasan Kadari, 77, has used up his life saving to build the miniature 50ft by 50ft version of the iconic structure in memory of his wife Tajammuli Begum. He embarked on the project after promising his wife, who was childless, on her deathbed that he would create something that she would be remembered by. Scroll down for video . Faizul Hassan Kadari is using up his life savings to build the memorial to his beloved wife Tajammuli Begum . He has spent the past year constructing the sandstone 50ft by 50ft mini Taj Mahal . The original Taj Mahal, in nearby Agra, was also built as a memorial. It was created by the Mughal emperor Shan Jahan in memory of his third wife Mumtaz Maham . So far he has spent £10,500 of his life . savings, sold off family heirlooms and raided his pension to build the . 5000sq ft structure. He is struggling to complete the job because of a lack of money but refuses to take donations as he wants to prove his devotion to his wife, who died in December 2011. Mr Kadari said: 'I never had any children and my wife . told me on her death bed that since we don't have anyone to continue our . name we will be forgotten. 'That day I promised her that I will make a grave in her name so grand the entire world will remember us forever.' Mr Kadari can see the Taj Mahal from his home in rural  Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh state, India. His decision to copy it is fitting as the original structure in Agra was itself a loving tribute to a late wife. The white marble mausoleum was built in 1631 by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his third wife Mumtaz Mahal. Like the original, Mr Kadari's version also houses the body of his late wife but it is made from sandstone, redstone, cement and iron. The former postmaster also hopes that he can be buried there next to his beloved wife. But work has ground to a halt after his money ran dry. Former postmaster Mr Kadari said he is running out of money but refuses to take donations . Mr Kadari promised his wife on her death bed to create something they could be remembered by . Mr Kadari has used up his life savings on the project and sold his wife's ornaments to help pay for it . He said: 'I laid the foundations in February 2012. I used to work on it for eight hours a day including one hour for lunch. 'But last September I had to stop because I couldn't find enough money to pay people to help me with the labour. 'So far I sold off my land worth six lakhs (£7,000) and my wife's ornaments for 1.5 lakhs (£1,700) and withdrawn all my money from my pension, which totalled another 1.5 lakhs. 'Now all I can afford to spend is about one lakh a year (£1,155). I cannot afford anything more than that and it is not enough to sustain the building work needed. 'All I care about is completing the structure before I die.' Eventually Mr Kadari hopes to replicate the intricate details of the original - including sprawling fountains in front, a tree lined approach and ornate brick work. But currently the frail pensioner is unable to work on his dream due to the intense summer heat and a lack of funds. He said: 'There is a little bit of . money trouble but I will not take any financial help from anyone and I . will complete this structure on my own. 'People . did tell me that I shouldn't be wasting my money and that it would have . been better spent on funding a young couples own marriage. The couple rarely argued and Mr Kadari said in their entire marriage they never had a large fight . Mr Kadari also hopes to be buried in the mini Taj Mahal next to his beloved wife . Neighbours said the mini Taj Mahal has made the area famous across India . Mr Kadari poses with his cousin Maidul Hassan Qadri in front of his mini Taj Mahal . 'But to those people I say that this has been built in remembrance of my wife.' The structure has made the local area famous across India with people desperate to see the mini Taj Mahal. His neighbour and cousin Mazaal Hassan Quadri said: 'This will obviously beautify our village. It has already made us very famous in the name of the mini Taj Mahal. 'It is famous across the whole of India. He has been getting calls from people in Delhi, Bombay, Kerala and all over Uttar Pradesh asking about it and wanting to visit.' Mr Kadari says the next step in edging closer to completion is building a structure for the building to stand on, elevating it up off the ground. He said: 'Me and my wife married at a very young age, but in our entire time together we never had a major fight or argument other than small quarrels. 'Even though she could not bear us a child, never did I think of marrying any other person. I hope we can rest in peace together in our Taj Mahal.'","Faizul Hasan Kadari spent a year building memorial to wife Tajammuli Begum .

She faces charges of gross vehicle manslaughter and drunk driving in the death of her father, which came only two days before Father's Day. is said by witnesses to have ignored her father's pleas to stay while he stood behind the car, and instead ran over him as she backed out of the driveway. She then stopped the car after realizing her father was injured and sat crying until being taken into custody by police. Images from the scene showed the car about halfway out of the driveway and Barton being led away from the scene in handcuffs while her husband Tad Barton trailed a number of steps behind. Tragic loss: Barton's alleged drunk driving is said to have taken her father's life only two day's before Father's Day . Need for speed: A review of California court records showed Barton has multiple traffic violations to her name, including a DUI conviction from 2006 . Family members told investigators that . Lucky Barton argued with several of them after drinking that evening, . the Press-Enterprise reported. Father Bounmy Rajsombath was rushed to a Riverside hospital, where he was pronounced dead Friday night. A man identifying himself as Rajsombath's son-in-law said that his father-in-law ran a refugee camp in Thailand where people fleeing the communist insurgency in Laos during the Vietnam War.

"Two brothers in law who went on a sponsored walk wearing comedy mankinis had to be picked up by police - after they were pelted with stones and eggs by residents who told them 'this is a Muslim area' and demanded they leave. Steven Ellis, 41, and Jason Hendry, 22, wanted to walk eight miles from Solihull to Birmingham city centre wearing the outfit featured in 2006 film Borat to raise money for Birmingham Dogs' Home. But they ended up being escorted by officers after they were attacked as they passed through the Sparkbrook area of the city, claiming police said they had offended local Muslims during Ramadan. Finish line: Steven Ellis (left), 41, and Jason Hendry (right), 22, wanted to walk eight miles from Solihull to Birmingham city centre wearing the outfit featured in 2006 film Borat . They were driven through the area as locals hurled abuse at them - calling them paedophiles. Mr Ellis’s wife Victoria, 36, had followed the pair's journey in a car, with the couple's five young children. She said: ‘We were basically run out of the area. We had stopped at a supermarket car park to give the dogs a drink as it was a hot day, and we were suddenly surrounded. ‘The men were taking off their jackets and threatening to fight Jason. I have seen nothing like it in my life before. The children were terrified as within minutes a crowd of 30 or 40 men assembled. ‘They began throwing stones and eggs at us. They were shouting at Jason saying that he was a pervert and a paedophile, and one of them called me a dirty white s***. ‘They told us that they hated dogs and told us to get out of the car park. The children were petrified and asked why these people were calling me a s***. ‘One egg narrowly missed hitting my 12-year-old son, Jason, leaving him petrified and even passing cars ended up being hit by the eggs and stones. The abuse was appalling. Shocked: Mr Hendry and Mr Ellis were driven through the area in Birmingham as locals hurled abuse at them . ‘We called the police and they came straight away. I asked the police what they were going to do to help us but they just said it was because of sensitivities over an EDL (English Defence League) march and Ramadan. 'It was disrespectful for the men to come here half-naked. This is a Muslim area and we don't want to see that' Irshad Armani, local butcher . ‘We didn't even know there was an EDL . march planned for that day - we had nothing to do with it. Our family . just love dogs, we've homed a rescue dog and we wanted to raise money to . help the charity.’ But local butcher Irshad Armani, 22, said: 'It was disrespectful for the men to come here half-naked. This is a Muslim area and we don't want to see that. 'People were fasting and we do not want . to see anything considered impure or dirty during such an important . month. That is why people were so upset by it.' Scene: West Midlands Police said officers were called to reports of tensions on Stratford Road (file picture) in Sparkhill on July 20 due to a group of men wearing fancy dress whilst on a charity walk . Iqbal Khan, 25, a carpet shop owner, . added: 'They came here saying it was for charity, but what they were . wearing barely covered their private parts. Not impressed: The brothers in law were attacked as they passed through the Sparkbrook area of the city . 'We see people come and go doing charity around here - black, white, Asian - but it is not appropriate to do it in a bad way, dressed as they were, especially when this is mainly an Asian and Pakistani area.' Mr Hendry said: ‘A man who was in a nearby hairdresser came over and started having a go at us and then a guard at the supermarket and the manager came out and joined in. ‘It was disgusting behaviour. I was furious. I was angry with the local people for how they reacted and we tried to explain it was just a bit of fun, to raise money for charity.’ The police escorted them all back to Birmingham Dogs' Home because there were two groups of men waiting at the end of the road. He added: ‘But it was also frustrating to have to be escorted as it made us feel like we had done something wrong. I am shocked and disgusted that this should happen in our city. ‘It was like something you see on TV. The idea behind the mankini walk started off as a dare and then we decided to make it a reality and do it to raise money for charity.’ ‘We have a love and passion for dogs and we both wanted to do it to raise money for Birmingham Dogs' Home.’ Mrs Hendry added: ‘I grew up to respect people irrespective of colour or creed as have my children. But this was totally appalling and has made me so angry that this should happen during an event to help a charity.’ Comedy attire: The mankini was made famous in 2006 film Borat, seen being promoted here at the Cannes Film Festival in the same year by actor Sacha Baron Cohen (centre), who played the main character . However Raja Ahmad, 46, a local shopkeeper, said: 'The men were partially dressed and it's not really appreciated around here by the Asian or the English community. ‘The police moved them on and they said they were covering their modesty but it upset a lot of people in the community.' 'They told us that they hated dogs and told us to get out of the car park. The children were petrified and asked why these people were calling me a s***' Victoria Ellis, 36, wife of Steven Ellis . The men raised £300 from the event, and have donated the money to the dogs' home. A West Midlands Police spokesman said: ‘Police were called to reports of tensions on Stratford Road in Sparkhill at around 2:50pm on July 20 due to a group of men wearing fancy dress whilst on a charity walk. ‘Officers attended and worked closely with those at the scene to resolve the situation peacefully in order to ensure no unnecessary or unintended upset was caused. ‘Police left the area around 25 minutes later and there were no further calls to the location.’","Steven Ellis, 41, and Jason Hendry, 22, wanted to walk in Birmingham ."
"Darren Bent did not require long to show just why Steve McClaren sought his services this month. The former England striker, signed on-loan from Aston Villa, arrived as a substitute in the 63rd minute with the match goalless. Five minutes later, with seemingly his first touch, he had edged Derby ahead. Like his goal against Chesterfield in the FA Cup, this came from just two yards out – here, a poke home after Ryan Shotton’s long throw had been glanced skywards by Matt Kilgallon. Darren Bent celebrates giving Derby County the lead over Blackburn Rovers . Bent runs away in celebration after scoring the opening goal for Derby in the Championship tie . Derby pushed on for promotion in the Championship by seeing off Blackburn . Derby County (4-3-3): Grant 7.5; Shotton 6.5, Keogh 7, Buxton 7, Forsyth 6.5; Hendrick 6.5, Mascarell 7, Hughes 7; Ward 6 (Bennett 86’), Martin 6, Dawkins 6 (Bent 63’ 8) Subs not used: Roos, Christie, Bryson, Albentosa, Warnock .

Subs not used: Eastwood, Williamson, Taylor, Duffy . Booked: Olsson, Conway . Manager: Gary Bowyer 6 . Referee: Andy Davies 6 . Man of the Match: Darren Bent . Attendance: 26,373 . Bent scored again in injury time, once more from close range. He tapped in when Chris Martin’s shot from Mason Bennett’s cross spilled his way. Small distances, big difference. Bent’s impact means McClaren’s team move up to second, level on points with leaders Bournemouth. Already his temporary move, costing Derby around a quarter of his £65,000 per week wages, is paying off. A joke cruel on Paul Lambert’s side swiftly emerged at full-time. Bent is now Villa’s top scorer this season – with five goals including two from his loan spell at Brighton. Andreas Weimann has four in a claret and blue shirt. Any thoughts Rudy Gestede might have of going the opposite direction to Bent this January were dashed when he lasted just 21 minutes. Starting on the bench, he was introduced shortly before the interval following an injury to Tom Cairney, but was himself forced off midway through the second half. As he limped away he must have recognised this was this was far from a productive outing in the shop window. West Bromwich Albion and Hull have been suitors so far baulking at his £4million fee. Oddly, Jordan Rhodes, another target for top-flight clubs keen on buying an attacking edge this month, remained on the bench even then. Instead Gary Bowyer sent Chris Brown on for Gestede, and he brought a brilliant save from Lee Grant with a left-foot shot soon after. Rhodes, who Swansea have looked at for £11m, only arrived when injury to Grant Hanley forced Bowyer’s hand. He was unable to alter the course of events. Richard Keogh tries to block a shot by Blackbun's Josh King during the Championship match . Derby are continuing their push for promotion to the top flight with their latest win over Blackburn . Derby dismissed Chesterfield in their FA Cup match but still kept their promotion push on track . These two teams entered this match having enjoyed FA Cup victories. Derby dismissed Chesterfield, Blackburn stunned Swansea. Fifth round matches against Reading and Stoke can wait, though. At any rate, both clubs would take promotion to the Premier League ahead of cup silverware. Derby were looking for a response to their last Championship encounter, a dramatic defeat here to Nottingham Forest. Blackburn had slipped into the distance of the play-off race in recent weeks, entering this match without a league win in four games. Derby began the aggressors, pinning the visitors back. In the fifth minute Will Hughes cut inside and struck a sweet drive that crashed into the stanchion. In the 19th minute Jeff Hendrick fed Jamie Ward but the winger fired over. By the half hour Derby’s passing was slick and a smart move involving Hughes, Hendrick and Martin saw Simon Dawkins teed up. He shot horribly wide. Blackburn did have a chance three minutes before the interval, but Grant did well to scoop away Craig Conway’s dipping volley. In all likelihood this match would have ended goalless but for the intervention of Bent, a player determined to prove aged 30 he still has what it takes to score in the top division. If he keeps going in this manner he might just fire Derby there. Derby were looking for a response from their last Championship defeat against Nottingham Forest .

"Paracetamol could make difficult decisions less of a headache. Some of the brain areas involved in physical pain are also involved in mental discomfort, researchers say. Taking pills designed to suppress physical pain could therefore also be used to reduce the anguish of situations that cause us psychological pain, such as spending money or selling possessions. Paracetamol could help to ease our anxieties and suppress our psychological pain, according to a new US study . The US researchers gave volunteers either two paracetamol or two placebo pills. Half an hour later – after the paracetamol would have had time to act – they were asked to choose between two puzzles that they would like to do. Normally, after choosing between two equally attractive things, we rationalise the decision by pretending we never really liked the one we rejected. This, say the researchers, makes the choice feel less painful. But when the volunteers were asked to rate the puzzles a second time, those given the paracetamol rated the rejected puzzle less harshly than the others. The University of Kentucky scientists said this suggests they found the initial decision less painful. Writing in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, the scientists said it showed that the drug could take the pain out of decision-making . In a second experiment, the participants were given a mug and were told either that they could keep it or that it belonged to the university. They were then told they could sell the mug and asked how much they would charge. Those who owned the mug were expected to value it more highly – as we tend to find selling our possessions painful. But those who took paracetamol set the lowest prices. Writing in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, the scientists said this shows that the drug could take some of the pain out of decision-making. ‘When people make decisions, they sometimes use words related to physical pain,’ they said. ‘People might say it “hurt” to sell their home, that they were “crushed” when they decided to withdraw money from their retirement investment portfolio earlier than they’d planned... ‘We propose that the pain of decision making is not a mere metaphor. If so, numbing them to physical pain should also numb them to the psychological pain involved in some sorts of decision making. ‘Making decisions can be painful but a physical painkiller can take the pain away.’","Some parts of brain involved in physical pain also control mental discomfort .

"A U.S. venture plans to use a remote-controlled 'stealth' airship to hunt for signs of Bigfoot in the mountains of California. The Falcon Project claims to be the first organisation to employ an airborne strategy in an attempt to detect evidence of the semi-mythical hominid. They hope to use a helium-filled airship carrying thermal imaging and high resolution wireless cameras to approach and observe Bigfoot with 'minimal or no disturbance of the subject’s natural behaviour'. Scroll down for video . Stealthy: An artist's impression of the Aurora airship that Project Falcon hopes to use to conduct a thorough search of the California mountains to find evidence of Bigfoot . 'The Aurora Mk II airship offers major advantages over similar applications with helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft platforms, foremost, stealth and manoeuvrability,' the company claims. Described as a large, bipedal hairy humanoid creature living in remote wilderness areas of the United States and Canada, Bigfoot - also known as Sasquatch - has only ever been pictured once in grainy footage. The evidence for the existence of what is believed could be a species of North American Ape is almost entirely supported by anecdotal evidence, tracks and hair samples classified as an unidentified primate. Some claim it is a creature which may be found around the world under different regional names, such as the Yeti, or is at least a closely related species. Now the Falcon Project, founded by William Barnes, a gold dredger who claims to have sighted Bigfoot in 1997, hopes to gather definitive proof that Bigfoot exists in the form of clear, steady film footage of the creature in its natural habitat. The only video evidence so far: This film was shot in California in 1967 by former rodeo rider Roger Patterson. The Project Falcon team hope to capture fresh indisputable footage . The only video evidence of Bigfoot captured to date is the famous Patterson film captured by former rodeo rider Roger Patterson in California in 1967. The film has been subject to many debunking attempts but Mr Patterson insisted on its authenticity until his death in 1972. Now the Falcon Project team hope that any . fresh video evidence of the sasquatch could earn them an 'instantaneous . windfall in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.' 'The Falcon Project was formed for the purpose of acquiring motion picture evidence of a Hominoid,' the company says. 'Our . competitive advantage, relative to other Hominoid research . organizations, is that we are employing technology that no one else . possesses.' The project will use an unmanned 45ft . dual airship - the Aurora - equipped with a proprietary propulsion . system to give it a claimed top speed of 35-45mph, manoeuvrable 'with . the degree of precision necessary to track a fast-moving animal'. Bigfoot is described in reports as a large hairy ape-like creature, in a range of 6–10ft tall, weighing in excess of 500lb, and covered in dark brown or dark reddish hair. Self-styled witnesses have described large eyes, a pronounced brow ridge, and a large, low-set forehead; the top of the head has been described as rounded and crested, similar to the sagittal crest of the male gorilla. Bigfoot is commonly reported to have a strong, unpleasant smell by those who claim to have encountered it. The enormous footprints for which it is named have been as large as 24in long and 8in wide. While most casts have five toes — like all known apes — some casts of alleged Bigfoot tracks have had numbers ranging from two to six. Some have also contained claw marks, making it likely that a portion came from known animals such as bears, which have five toes and claws. Some proponents have claimed that Bigfoot is omnivorous and mainly nocturnal. Cameras that can view and film in infrared, thermal imaging and High Definition will be fitted onto the Aurora using a gyro-stabilised camera mount so that if Bigfoot is located the images will be clear and steady. The Aurora will be deployed in selected areas of appropriate habitat where reports suggest sasquatch may range. The Falcon Project claim the stealth and manoeuvrability of the airship gives it major advantages over helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft. The company says: 'From what research . suggests, everything that we have done on the ground has been . ineffective in getting close to them; therefore a perspective from the . sky, with an imaging platform to zoom in on them quickly and track their . position, seems to be the most logical way for us to pursue motion . picture evidence. Bigfoot expert: Dr Jeff Meldrum of Idaho State University will coordinate the research as principal investigator on the project . 'We believe that this ground-breaking technology will give us the element of surprise in catching Hominoids on film. 'A dual airship can track a Hominoid even if it is running at top speed or climbing a mountain.  A human on foot cannot. 'Further, the dual airship will provide the best chance at obtaining the long-awaited steady camera that has, as yet, been missing from ALL films of Hominoids in existence, because our dual airship will be fitted with a gyro to provide image stabilization.' The research is to be coordinated through Idaho State University, with Dr Jeff Meldrum, professor of anatomy and anthropology, acting as principal investigator. Dr Meldrum, one of the few academics to back the existence of Bigfoot, has been probing the question of sasquatch’s existence for nearly 17 years, ever since examining a line of inexplicable 15in bipedal footprints in south-eastern Washington state. He is the author of one of the most authoritative treatments of the subject, Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science and has published a number of scientific papers examining the footprint evidence. Dr Meldrum said: 'Even if definitive DNA sequence data point to the existence of a novel species it will not suddenly become easy to study such a rare and elusive primate in the field. 'That’s where the Falcon Project comes in.' Most scientists discount the existence of Bigfoot and consider apparent sightings to be a combination of folklore, misidentification and hoax.","Falcon Project claims to be the first to employ an airborne strategy to track down the elusive creature which has never been proven to exist .
They hope capturing reliable footage of Bigfoot could net an 'instantaneous .
