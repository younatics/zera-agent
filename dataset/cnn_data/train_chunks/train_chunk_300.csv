"(CNN) -- Halle Berry's reason for returning to TV in CBS's ""Extant"" are simple: She goes ""where the work is,"" as she told the network. And lately -- especially amid the rise of streaming original series and creatively compelling cable dramas -- an actress looking for strong material looks to TV just as often as she looks to the silver screen. In the past, an Oscar winner trading in a movie script for something airing on a broadcast network might have signaled a dwindling career. Now, ""the lines are blurring,"" Berry said. ""I have never looked at TV as a negative. As I was doing well in my movie career, I always came back to do television movies. I go where the work is. I go where the characters are. And I'm happy that other people are starting to do the same thing."" ""Extant,"" created by Mickey Fisher and executive produced by Steven Spielberg, is set in the near future and stars Berry as Molly Woods, an astronaut who's returning home after a 13-month solo mission. As Molly tries to readjust to her terrestrial family -- which includes a husband (Goran Visnjic) and an android son (Pierce Gagnon) -- she's hit with the news that she's somehow pregnant. (In case you were wondering, Spielberg says he ""read the script long before I knew about [2013's] 'Gravity' or had ever seen 'Gravity.' "") Already picked up for 13 episodes, ""Extant"" sets itself up to ponder how Molly got pregnant if she was on a mission by herself, especially with a history of fertility issues. ""You find out but slowly,"" Berry told CBS. ""It's very mysterious, it's very suspenseful, and there are many twists and turns along the way getting to that resolve."" After viewing the pilot episode, critics are cautiously optimistic. (Many, it seems, still have bitter feelings toward CBS for the bait-and-switch of ""Under the Dome."") ""A movie star has descended to television -- network television no less -- and she is not putting on airs,"" says Slate's Willa Paskin. "" 'Extant' ... tosses sci-fi films from '2001' to 'A.I.' to 'Sunshine' in a blender, and serves up a psychologically minded speculative smoothie, complete with impregnating aliens, emotional robots, and vast conspiracies. No one element of this show feels original, and yet I would totally watch more, even if just to peep at the sleek futuristic garbage cans again."" Variety too thought that ""Extant"" ""feels a bit like a Steven Spielberg greatest (and not-so-greatest) hits album"" but doesn't view that as ""an indictment so much as a road map to this CBS summer drama. ... It's certainly an intriguing launch; but then again, so was 'Under the Dome' before that narratively ran into a brick wall."" HitFix's Alan Sepinwall found ""a genuine sense of tension to the first episode,"" adding that ""it feels like the characters live in a fully-realized science fiction world. ... Berry provides (pardon the pun) enough gravity to make 'Extant' feel like a genuine work of science fiction, rather than a soap opera dressed up in sci-fi drag, which happens too often on the broadcast networks. It's a good start, at least."" Not everyone sees ""Extant's"" potential. The New York Times' Alessandra Stanley thinks ""the creators deserve credit for trying to revive this kind of classic science-fiction mystery,"" yet she found that ""the premiere, while entertaining and expertly produced, doesn't hold out a lot of promise."" For USA Today's Robert Bianco, Berry herself is ""Extant's"" trump card. ""She brings a dignity and gravity to Molly, a projected intelligence that allows you to buy her as an astronaut and to see what has happened to her as frightening rather than ridiculous,"" Bianco observes. ""Berry's all in, and you float along. ... (L)et's hope 'Extant' doesn't let her, and us, down."" CBS's hour-long ""Extant"" premieres at 9 p.m. ET/PT today.

"(CNN) -- Victoria Wilcher -- the 3-year-old Mississippi girl whose family claimed was asked to leave KFC because of her appearance -- will be fitted for a prosthetic eye. Victoria, who lost sight in her right eye and was left with severe facial scars after a pit bull attack, will meet with Raymond Peters, an ocularist who hopes to outfit her with a prosthetic eye this week at his office in Naples, Florida. An ocularist is a trained technician who makes prosthetic eyes. Peters said he doesn't care about the controversy surrounding what her family said happened to her at KFC. He just wants to help a child in need. ""That's another world as far as I am concerned. That's not going to affect me with how I help the child,"" he said of the KFC incident. ""I am focused on this child, and if that did happen, it's sad because it is a double tragedy for the child."" Victoria's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, took to Facebook last month to tell a story about how Victoria, who wears an eye patch and eats through a tube, was told to leave a KFC in Mississippi because her appearance was disturbing to other patrons. The story went viral. Online fundraising campaigns brought in thousands, including $30,000 and an apology from KFC. But veracity of the story has since been called into question. A pair of investigations found no proof she was ever asked to leave KFC and a local newspaper also cast doubt on the family's story. Both Peters, who has donated his services and assisted with travel accommodations, and Mullins spoke to CNN Sunday about Victoria's road to recovery. ""She don't have an eye socket and no cheekbone,"" said Mullins. ""We had to put her back in diapers because of the wounds on her legs. She can't pull things up and down on them. The wounds will bleed, and she screams bloody murder."" Not knowing the full extent of the damage, Peters said he is not even sure if an artificial eye is a feasible option. But that is not going to stop him from trying. ""I will help her as long as I am able,"" he said. ""We don't want this child to walk in the shadows."" Despite saying it hadn't found proof that one of its restaurants mistreated the girl or her grandmother, KFC said it will still honor its commitment to donate $30,000 to assist with Victoria's medical bills. ""We hope everyone keeps Victoria in their thoughts and prayers,"" the chain said in a statement last month. ""She will certainly be in ours.""","Victoria Wilcher, 3, will be fitted with a prosthetic eye by a Florida ocularist this week .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Prince George is now safely back home and tucked-up behind palace walls after taking his first tentative steps into a lifetime of public duties. In the end, he only officially appeared twice during the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's tour of New Zealand and Australia. First, at a play date in Wellington, then at Taronga Zoo in Sydney, but we also caught glimpses of him getting on and off planes. So what did we learn about this little monarch-in-waiting? Well for a start, he isn't little. The other babies invited to the play date were all born within a few weeks of George and he was by far the biggest, and he's quick. ""Very strong, very mobile, very happy, very active,"" said Peter Howe, who was one of the parents invited to the event. Another described the prince as ""intrepid."" Gorgeous George . The world couldn't resist those chubby cheeks and social media was awash with the pictures with the word ""cute."" The British photographer who captured the images was James Whatling, also part of the close-up team at the zoo where George met a bilby. ""You could tell he's more playful at the bilby event,"" said Whatling. ""He's not afraid. He's very happy to play. He's obviously at the cruising stage. He pulled himself up at the bilby enclosure, just to get a closer look and to try and stroke him. He looks strong, and I can't believe it will be very long until he starts to walk."" This is exactly the age when I remember my babies starting to transform and I could see that in George over the course of the three-week tour as well. If I compare the boy arriving in Wellington and to the one leaving the tour in Canberra, his ""Mohican"" hairstyle was more pronounced and he looked older. Whatling, who was next to me at both airports, said: ""He's transformed from a baby to a toddler in the course of a royal tour."" Grumpy George? Newspapers and websites have been having fun with some of George's faces. So is he really grumpy? ""No,"" says Whatling. ""He's got lovely chubby cheeks and he's full of expression. He's obviously teething and that'll make any toddler a little fractious."" Toddler George . So when the royals waved goodbye to Australia, we also waved goodbye to ""Baby George."" The next time we see him, it'll be the all new ""Toddler George"" -- and I bet he won't be hanging around for long. READ MORE: ""Kate Effect:"" Australia feels force of fashion .

"(CNN) -- His name is Gammy. He's just seven months old and is attracting attention to the murky world of surrogacy in Thailand, as the military-led country cracks down on the industry. Gammy was born with Down Syndrome in December last year to an impoverished Thai mother, Pattaramon Chanbua; one of twins she was carrying for an Australian couple. However, when it came time to take the babies home, they only took one -- a healthy girl -- leaving the ailing boy in Thailand with a mother ill-equipped to care for a child with special needs. She said the couple told her they were ""too old"" to take care of twins, according to Fairfax Media. However, on Monday, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported the father claimed doctors had only told the couple about the baby girl. ""When the girl was discharged from the hospital, the mother asked me that if I would be able to raise the boy. How come they said that they didn't know about it? I don't understand, it sounds like they are lying,"" Pattaramon told CNN. She said the couple didn't show any interest in taking the boy home. ""(They) never even looked at the boy. Even milk, they never bought for him. The boy was sleeping next to the girl's bed, diapers were run out, they never bought ones for him,"" she said. 'I was told to get rid of the baby' Pattaramon spoke to CNN from a Thai hospital where baby Gammy is receiving treatment for pneumonia. She's just 21, has two children of her own, aged six and three, and works selling snacks at a food stall. ""I was told the baby has Down (Syndrome) when I was seven months pregnant,"" she said.""I was told to get rid of the baby and there would be some ways to save the other child. I refused because it is a sin."" Pattaramon says she met the intending parents just three times, and claims the agency who put them in touch hasn't paid her the full 300,000 baht fee ($9,300). That's irrelevant now. An online crowd-funding campaign to raise money for his care has raised more than $215,000 in just 12 days. Along with Down Syndrome -- a genetic disorder that impairs growth and intellectual ability -- Gammy has a heart condition that may require surgery. ""I feel so happy, because we are poor we can't afford to pay all medical bills for the child,"" Pattaramon said. Fund-raising has now been taken over by Hands Across the Water, an Australian-based charity that works with orphans and needy children in Thailand. ""The original money was for the projected costs associated with the heart surgery -- what we'll now be able to do is to plan for the longer term needs, through to his schooling,"" the charity's founder Peter Baines told CNN. Risks of going abroad . Sam Everingham knows the challenges of having to go abroad for a much-wanted child. He and his partner spent years navigating the Indian surrogacy system before the birth of baby girls in 2011. He says the claim the parents didn't know about the boy was hard to believe. ""Most or nearly all intending parents look forward anxiously every month to scans from their surrogates showing their growing babies. The agency would send the scans over on a regular basis. There's no reason why this agency would not have done that,"" he said. Everingham is the director of Families Through Surrogacy, an organization that helps to guide intending parents through the process. ""The vast majority of cases bring happiness and joy to both parties. But it does show the need, particularly in Thailand, for more oversights and regulations and we welcome the fact that the Thai government has said they're going to be clamping down,"" he said. Worried parents . While Gammy's case has caused an outpouring of sympathy for the boy and his mother -- and anger against his would-be parents -- it's also highlighted the fears of dozens of other couples waiting for children of their own. On July 22, Thai authorities announced they were tightening restrictions on the industry. In the last few days, officials have stopped a number of babies born through surrogacy from leaving the country, Everingham said. ""There's a huge concern about that. In Australia alone we have 80 to 90 families with pregnant surrogates in Thailand, which are very concerned about their access to their children. ""We're looking for clarity from the Thai government as soon as possible about the safe passage of those babies,"" he said. While Gammy's case wasn't the catalyst for the crackdown, Families Through Surrogacy said the abandonment of disabled children by foreigners was one of the issues identified by Thai authorities. Not the first . ""From within the surrogacy community I've heard that this has happened before,"" said Michaela Stockey Bridge, a researcher from Macquarie University who has been gathering stories about people's experiences with surrogacy abroad. ""Whenever we have a case like this, it highlights the fact that we need international regulation of commercial surrogacy,"" she said. ""If there was more counseling, and the intending parents and gestational carrier were able to talk that through beforehand, it wouldn't come up in this situation -- it's such a sad outcome.""","Australian couple leave twin with Down Syndrome with surrogate mother .

"London (CNN) -- The anti-apartheid message was serious and heartfelt but the song that alerted many around the world to the injustices of the South African regime could not have been more upbeat. ""Free Nelson Mandela"" was a Top 10 hit in the United Kingdom for The Special AKA in 1984, and it instantly became the unofficial anthem and slogan for the international anti-apartheid movement. The song's eponymous subject rose to prominence in the 1950s as a radical young member of the African National Congress, the main opposition movement to the segregationist South African government. As an advocate of guerrilla attacks, Mandela, who has died aged 95, was frequently arrested and eventually convicted in 1964, along with other ANC leaders, for sabotage. He received a life prison sentence, and spent 27 years in a cell, mostly on Robben Island, off the South African coast. While Mandela languished in jail, an anti-apartheid movement slowly developed in the West, starting with sporting sanctions against South Africa and later an artists' boycott of performances in the country. The composer of ""Free Nelson Mandela,"" Jerry Dammers -- the founder of the multiracial English ska-punk band The Specials, later renamed The Special AKA -- admits he knew little about Mandela before he attended an anti-apartheid concert in London in 1983, which gave him the idea for the song. ""I'd never actually heard of Nelson Mandela although I knew a lot about the anti-apartheid movement and he was becoming a figurehead for the whole movement,"" Dammers told CNN. The keyboardist, who also wrote ""Ghost Town,"" the seminal Specials song against the policies of Great Britain's prime minister at the time, Margaret Thatcher, may not have known much about the imprisoned anti-apartheid figurehead, but his lyrics brought Mandela's struggle to the attention of a wider audience. Flare and fury: How artists lambasted Margaret Thatcher . The song's relentlessly upbeat feel certainly helped push it up the charts. ""It ends with the thing of 'I'm begging you' and then 'I'm telling you,'"" Dammers said. ""It is a demand but in a positive way, it brought some sort of hope that the situation could be sorted out."" Veteran DJ and broadcaster Paul Gambaccini said the song was effective in educating people about Mandela, whose reputation was low in the West at the time. ""Now we have this sainted vision of Mandela, but at the time Thatcher treated him as a terrorist. So to release a record about someone whom your PM considers a terrorist is quite brave."" The song helped to change perceptions about Mandela, according to Gambaccini, a presenter on leading UK station BBC Radio 2. ""It did educate people about apartheid an incredible amount, because they certainly weren't going to learn about Mandela from conventional sources. The word on him from on high was very bad, so it was up to musicians to take a leading role in rehabilitating his reputation."" ""Free Nelson Mandela"" was also an extremely effective protest song, he added, a view echoed in 2010 by left-leaning current affairs magazine New Statesman, which included it in a list of the top 20 political anthems of all time. ""'Free Nelson Mandela' was effective for two reasons,"" he said. ""It's a good pop record in that it's catchy and sounds good. And you immediately know what it's about, because the first three words are 'Free Nelson Mandela.' And secondly it had a clear message that the audience agreed with."" And the fact that The Specials were at the time a ""Top 10 band"" meant the audience took note. ""If the Specials say it, there must be something to it,"" as Gambaccini noted. Four years later, in 1988, Dammers and the band Simple Minds helped organize the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Concert at London's Wembley Stadium, featuring acts such as Dire Straits, George Michael and Sting. Peter Gabriel played ""Biko"" about another anti-apartheid activist, while Steven Van Zandt performed his influential song ""Sun City."" The event was watched by a global television audience of 600 million and is credited with hardening popular opposition internationally to the apartheid regime. Gambaccini is proud of his contribution to the event, for which he was one of the TV presenters. ""The concert was an incredible success,"" he said. ""It had the biggest TV audience to date, and put Mandela in Topic A position around the world. But it might never have happened without the song 'Free Nelson Mandela,' because this inspired some of the artists who appeared at Wembley to be there."" As the impact of the concert rippled around the world, the South African government was secretly holding talks with Mandela. These meetings culminated in his release on February 11, 1990. Four years later, he succeeded F.W. de Klerk to become the republic's first black president. Mandela never forgot the debt he owed to supporters in the United Kingdom. In 1996 he used a speech to both Houses of Parliament in London to give his thanks: ""We take this opportunity once more to pay tribute to the millions of Britons who, through the years, stood up to say: No to apartheid!"" In 2008, singer Amy Winehouse joined Dammers for the finale to a concert in London's Hyde Park marking Mandela's 90th birthday. The song's message had long since been realized -- and indeed the by-then-frail elder statesman appeared onstage -- but it was received as warmly as ever. CNN's Nima Elbagir contributed to this report.","""Free Nelson Mandela,"" by The Special AKA raised awareness of the jailed ANC figurehead .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama sought to put a human face on the heated political debate over immigration on Friday when he oversaw a naturalization ceremony for members of the military. In what's become a White House tradition, Obama hosted immigrants who signed up to serve in the military, or whose spouses enlisted, and watched as they were sworn in as American citizens. The roster included 15 active duty members, two veterans, one reservist and seven military spouses. ""You did something extraordinary: You signed up to serve in the United States military,"" Obama told the new citizens on Friday. ""You answered the call --- to fight and potentially to give your life for a country that you didn't fully belong to yet. You understood what makes us American is not just circumstances of birth, or the names in our family tree. It's that timeless belief that from many we are one."" Oscar Vanegas Gonzalez, a Marine private first class who was born in Guatemala and came to the United States when he was 19, became a citizen at the White House on Friday. In Guatemala, ""it was hard to have a good future,"" Gonzalez said. ""This is a great nation. I want to be a part of this,"" he said. ""There are so many options and opportunities of just being someone here, in the United States of America."" The President has hosted naturalization ceremonies for military families in four of his five years in the White House. Immigration debate . Friday's event, however, comes amid a fiery debate among lawmakers over immigration reform and border security, spurred in part by an influx of immigrant children arriving in the United States without their parents. Obama has vowed to follow the law in deporting the children, who officials say are fleeing violence in the Central American nations of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. The White House says the situation underscores the need to fix a broken immigration system, including calling for the passage of a comprehensive package of reforms approved by the Senate last year. That measure has stalled in the Republican-controlled House, leading Obama this week to announce he was planning to take executive action to make some changes on his own. Obama actions . Officials haven't previewed what specific actions Obama may take, though the Department of Homeland Security is currently reviewing its deportation policy to locate ways to make it more ""humane."" That could include extending a deferred deportation rule Obama signed in 2012 for young immigrants brought here by their families. ""I'm going to keep doing everything I can do to keep making our immigration system smarter and more efficient so hardworking men and women like all of you have the opportunity to join the American family and to serve our great nation,"" Obama said during the naturalization ceremony on Friday. ""So we can be stronger and more prosperous and more whole --- together."" Former President George W. Bush signed an executive order in 2002 allowing for expedited naturalization for immigrant servicemen and women who enlisted after September 11, 2001. Since then, more than 90,000 military members have become citizens, along with some of their children and spouses. Obama's Independence Day continues later in the evening with a party on the South Lawn for military families that features a performance by Pitbull and a prime viewing spot for fireworks on the National Mall.

"(CNN) -- During the civil rights era, Alabama Gov. George Wallace was asked by a supporter why he was fixated on the politics of race. Wallace replied, ""You know, I tried to talk about good roads and good schools and all these things that have been part of my career, and nobody listened. And then I began talking about n*ggers, and they stomped the floor."" In the 1980s, during the rise of the gay rights movement, North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms accused a political opponent for supporting ""f*ggots, perverts [and] sexual deviates of this nation."" Today, opponents of immigration reform attack undocumented immigrants as ""illegal immigrants."" Even worse, like anti-immigration extremists, some prominent elected officials use the term ""illegals."" Maine Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, said, ""I urge all Mainers to tell your city councilors and selectmen to stop handing out your money to illegals."" Not the same thing? Of course it is. Once upon a time, the n-word and f-word were utterly acceptable terminology in undermining not only the basic rights but basic humanity of black people and gay people. That those terms seem radically inappropriate and out of step with mainstream culture now is only because social movements and legal and political changes have shifted the landscape. But make no mistake about it, words matter, not only in reflecting certain dehumanizing attitudes toward historically marginalized groups but in actively perpetuating and rationalizing that dehumanization. Even now, as some people go to courts to suppress the ability of women to make decisions about their own bodies and contraceptive choices, women who stand up for reproductive freedom are being called ""sluts"" and ""whores."" Recently, I watched the stunning film, ""Documented,"" on CNN and posted my reactions on Twitter. The responses I got were mostly positive but some conservatives took issue with me. For instance, someone tweeted at me: ""How about you donate 100% of your $ to help poor American children & not illegals"" -- as though American kids are worthy and deserving and undocumented immigrant kids are not. 'I didn't know I was undocumented' Another tweeted: ""Stop disease from coming into the US. Build the wall!"" -- again, not a humane reaction but an us-versus-them mindset that reduces immigrants to a public health threat. When I tweeted that I was ""consistently troubled by [the] number of people who seem to feel more compassion toward puppies on the Internet than undocumented humans,"" among the many blistering replies I received was, ""Do the internet puppies have scabies...?"" Other responses compared undocumented immigrants to ""invaders"" and ""child abusers."" Come on, people. Is it not possible to oppose immigrant rights without resorting to attacking immigrants as human beings? The intensity of the anti-immigrant rhetoric is stunning. Even if you don't support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, can't you find some compassion for them as human beings who live on the same planet? After all, whether you think our immigration laws are properly functioning or not, the forces of economic hardship and violence that push people to leave their home countries and the promise of a better future in America that pulls people here are the same forces that pushed and pulled on many of our ancestors. Protesters block buses carrying undocumented immigrants in California . Plus we know that American industries that rely on low-wage workers and actively lure undocumented immigrants to our country sometimes offer promises of official paperwork that never materialize. The organization Race Forward has a campaign to get media organizations to ""Drop The I-Word"" in their reporting about immigration. So far, the campaign has succeeded in getting the Associated Press, USA Today, the Los Angeles Times and many other outlets to stop using the word. But the pressure continues on The New York Times, The Washington Post and radio and television outlets. And the campaign around media usage is just one step toward influencing and ultimately ending the use of the word ""illegal"" by everyone in America. Vargas: Undocumented and hiding in plain sight . As the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, ""The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."" The history of the United States that anti-immigration activists profess to defend is one perpetually defined by inclusion rather than exclusion. Our notion of our nation expanded over time to include black people and women and gay people and others who were most marginalized previously. As we celebrate the signing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act 50 years ago this month, we're reminded of protests in the lead up to that moment in which black men carried signs that simply read, ""I AM A MAN."" And as we look back on the 45th anniversary of the landmark gay liberation protests set off at the Stonewall Bar in New York, we remember protests where gay men and lesbians carried signs that simply said, ""GAY IS GOOD."" Today, most people find the n-word and the f-word incredibly offensive. Let's hope that most if not all people will feel the same way about the words ""illegals"" and ""illegal immigrants"" in the not too distant future.","The film ""Documented"" airs 9 p.m. ET Saturday, July 5, on CNN .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- In Turkey, you can't go far without coming across the name Sabanci. Sabanci Holding is the country's largest financial and industrial conglomerate. Also present in 17 other countries and covering financial, energy, cement and retail sectors, the giant accounts for 12% of Istanbul Stock Exchange, and employs 56,000 people. There is also a Sabanci University, a Sabanci Foundation and a Sakip Sabanci Museum in Istanbul. And at the head of it all is one woman, Guler Sabanci, who has been chairwoman and managing director of the empire since 2004. Under Sabanci's stewardship, the company has grown at an average of 12% a year in the past decade, with plans to increase growth in the next 10 years. In 2011, Sabanci was ranked number two in the Financial Times ""Top 50 Women In World Business,"" and in 2012 was number 93 on Forbes' ""World's Most Powerful Women"" list. Sabanci, 58, is the third generation of her family -- and the first woman -- to run the company started by her grandfather Haci Omer as a textile business in Adana, southern Turkey, in the early 20th century. Guler Sabanci joined the family business -- following her five uncles -- after graduating from university in 1978 in the new tire manufacturing company. ""The tire company was something new it was just coming up, a new venture in the group,"" said Sabanci. ""When I graduated I guess I wanted to have blue-ocean strategy."" She became the first female member of the Turkish Industrialists' and Businessmen's Association, an organization founded by her uncle. ""I was the first woman, they made a big ceremony for me becoming a member,"" she said. CNN met Sabanci at the Sakip Sabanci Museum in Istanbul, once the family's summer home, named after her late uncle who donated his unique collections of Ottoman calligraphy and Turkish paintings. ""He lived here with his family in the last 25 years before it became a museum and he has donated his two collections,"" said Sabanci. ""I am very pleased to say he himself had the joy of seeing it turn into a museum. ""It was one of his (dreams) was ... to have a Picasso exhibition in this museum and I am pleased to say we were able to realize this dream. And it was a hit it was a great blockbuster, it was the first ever Picasso show in Turkey."" Other recent exhibitions have included Monet and Rembrandt. Also on Leading Women: 8 women on Twitter who will inspire, inform and amuse you . Philanthropy is important to Sabanci, who has been president of Sabanci University since she set it up in 1996. The Haci Omer Sabanci Foundation, of which she is president of the board of trustees, has made more than US$1.5 billion in charitable contributions since 1974. ""Being a good person and fair person is very important in life, I think,"" she said. ""And also life is meaningless if only you are only making money."" She extends that approach to women's rights.

But until they are 18, it is everybody's responsibility, their families, the authorities, us, everybody is responsible."" Also on Leading Women: 10 ways women can succeed at work in 2013 .

"(CNN) -- George Clooney 1, Daily Mail newspaper 0. The British newspaper's website deleted an article about Clooney, his fiancee, Amal Alamuddin, and her mother, Baria, on Wednesday, after Clooney said the article was ""completely fabricated"" and even ""dangerous."" The website subsequently apologized and said it had ""launched a full investigation."" The offending article came out on the Web on Monday and in print on Tuesday. While it is now missing from the Mail's site, rewritten versions of it still appear on hundreds of other sites -- a point that Clooney himself made in an unusual response to the Mail, published by USA Today on Wednesday morning. In order to rebut the article, Clooney had to repeat some of what it said. ""The Daily Mail has printed a completely fabricated story about my fiancee's mother opposing our marriage for religious reasons,"" Clooney wrote in USA Today. ""It says Amal's mother has been telling 'half of Beirut' that she's against the wedding. It says they joke about traditions in the Druze religion that end up with the death of the bride."" None of that is true, Clooney said. Clooney, of course, is used to media misbehavior -- thinly sourced stories about celebrities of his stature are a daily occurrence, and ""I seldom respond,"" he wrote. ""But this lie involves larger issues,"" he wrote. ""The irresponsibility, in this day and age, to exploit religious differences where none exist, is at the very least negligent and more appropriately dangerous. We have family members all over the world, and the idea that someone would inflame any part of that world for the sole reason of selling papers should be criminal."" Later on, he suggested that the Mail had moved ""into the arena of inciting violence."" So was the Mail story completely made up? MailOnline, the Web division of the newspaper, said Wednesday that it was ""not a fabrication""; rather, it was ""supplied in good faith by a reputable and trusted freelance journalist."" The Mail said the journalist ""based her story on conversations with a long-standing contact who has strong connections with senior members of the Lebanese community in the UK and the Druze in Beirut."" In other words, the journalist played a particularly bad game of telephone, repeating what one person was saying about what other people were allegedly saying about Clooney's future mother-in-law. ""We accept Mr. Clooney's assurance that the story is inaccurate and we apologise to him, Miss Amal Alamuddin and her mother, Baria, for any distress caused,"" the Mail said in a statement. ""We have removed the article from our website and will be contacting Mr. Clooney's representatives to discuss giving him the opportunity to set the record straight.""

"(CNN) -- To the list of names that contains Lukas Rosol and Steve Darcis, Nick Kyrgios can be added. The Australian teenager is the latest unheralded player to force Rafael Nadal out of Wimbledon before the quarterfinals have even landed. Kyrgios is just 19 and ranked 144 in the world, but his 7-6 5-7 7-6 6-3 victory in front of an enraptured Centre Court has inked his name into folklore at SW19. Nadal may be a two-time champion at Wimbledon but his reputation on grass has taken a battering in recent years. Vanquished by Rosol in the second round in 2012, it was the first time the Spaniard had failed to get into the third round since 2005. The following year Belgium's Darcis compounded his misery, knocking Nadal out in the first round for the first time ever. Nadal survived Rosol on his way to the last 16 this time around but there was another giantkiller waiting for him on the grass. Wimbledon debutant Kyrgios did the unthinkable and knocked the world No. 1 and 14-time grand slam champion out in four sets. ""I think I was in a bit of a zone out there,"" he told reporters after setting up a last-eight clash with Canadian eighth seed Milos Raonic, who beat Japan's Kei Nishikori 4-6 6-1 7-6 6-3. ""I didn't really notice the crowd. It hasn't really sunk in at all,"" Kyrgios added. ""I played some extraordinary tennis. I think you've got to believe you can win the match from the start. ""So many emotions, I sort of didn't know what to do, drop to the ground, throw my racket!"" There was another shock, for another reigning French Open champion in the women's draw. It's 10 years since Maria Sharapova won Wimbledon -- and she won't be ending her drought any time soon. The world No. 5 was sent packing on Centre Court by Germany's Angelique Kerber in a tense three-set affair. Kerber, ranked seventh, prevailed 7-6 4-6 6-4 and will now play Canada's Eugenie Bouchard in the quarterfinals. Sharapova saved six match-points at 4-5 down and had opportunities to level the final set at 5-5. But Kerber finally took her chance on the seventh match point to bring a thrilling finale to a pulsating encounter. ""It's unbelievable,"" Kerber told the BBC. ""We were playing on a really high level -- every single set was so close. ""I'm just so happy I won. She's a great player, she plays so great on grass. I said to myself believe in your game, hit the ball, be aggressive. In the end, it worked."" In the other half of the women's draw, Lucie Safarova ensured there will be a Czech player in this year's final. Safarova, seeded 23, defeated Ekaterina Makarova 6-3 6-1 to set up a semifinal clash against either 2011 champion Petra Kvitova or the in-form Barbara Zahlavova Strycova. Meanwhile, Roger Federer secured his place in the quarterfinals with relative ease. The 17-time grand slam champion, whose last of his seven Wimbledon triumphs came in 2012, defeated Spain's Tommy Robredo 6-1 6-4 6-4. Federer, 32, will now face fellow Swiss ace Stan Wawrinka. Wawrinka, who won his first grand slam at the 2014 Australian Open, defeated Spain's Feliciano Lopez in straight sets. ""It will be amazing to play Stan in the quarterfinals here, hopefully on Centre Court, because things like that don't happen too often in Swiss sport,"" Federer told the BBC. ""But I'm pleased with the way I am playing. I'm serving and moving well and all the things are happening that need to be happening to go deep in the tournament."" Wawrinka, now the Swiss No. 1 after many years in Federer's shadow, claimed a 7-6 7-6 6-3 win to reach his second Wimbledon quarterfinal. Federer needed just 21 minutes to win the first set 6-1 against Robredo before wrapping up the second 6-4. Robredo, seeded 23, simply had no answer and Federer closed out the match by taking the third 6-4. In the women's draw, last year's finalist Sabine Lisicki overcame a scare against Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan. The German prevailed 6-3 3-6 6-4 to set up a last eight tie with number three seed Simona Halep of Romania. Halep, the highest ranked player remaining in the draw, Zarina Diyas of Kazakhstan 6-3 6-0. ""I'm not surprised that I play a quarterfinal tomorrow,"" Halep told reporters. ""I'm third in the rankings so I have to be here in the quarterfinals. I've played really well and I have confidence in myself. ""I deserve to be here because I'm working hard every day and it's normal to be in the last matches of tournaments and grand slams."" In the women's doubles, Serena Williams was forced to retire from her match with a viral illness. Williams, playing alongside sister Venus, required lengthy treatment from the doctor and trainer before the game against Switzerland's Stefanie Voegele and Germany's Kristina Barrois. She decided to play following the warm-up but in her first service game, she served four double faults and retired with the score at 0-3. In a statement issued by the WTA Tour, Williams said: ""I am heartbroken I'm not able to continue in the tournament. I thought I could rally this morning, because I really wanted to compete, but this bug just got the best of me. ""I want to thank my sister, Kristina, Stefanie and our teams for their support. We were all looking forward to a great match. ""From the bottom of my heart, I thank all of the fans for their cheers and understanding. I look forward to returning to Wimbledon next year.""","Rafael Nadal knocked out by Australian teenager Nick Krygios .

"El Arish, Egypt (CNN) -- Bedouin smugglers involved in people trafficking are also believed to be stealing organs from refugees who are unable to pay their demands for large amounts of cash to take them into Israel. The New Generation Foundation for Human Rights and the EveryOne Group, from Italy, have presented evidence that the bodies of African refugees have been found in the Sinai desert with organs missing. Read the first part of our coverage on the plight of refugees in the Sinai . The Sawarka Bedouin tribe, one of the largest in the Sinai, was named by one Bedouin source as being involved in organ thefts. A Sawarka leader said he was aware that people trafficking was going on in Sinai and that in some cases refugees were held in bonded labor and tortured. But he added only rogue elements of his tribe were involved. According to rights groups, refugees -- from places like Ethiopia, Eritrea or Sudan -- are enslaved and tortured and the women raped if they cannot come up with the large sums of money the Bedouin try to extort from them and their families to smuggle them into Israel. Among Bedouin leaders in the Sinai, no one was willing to speak openly about the organ theft. Tribal leaders said they knew nothing about it or had only heard rumors. But Hamdy Al-Azazy, head of New Generation Foundation, has photos showing corpses with distinctive scars in the abdominal area. All the photos were taken in a morgue in the Egyptian port town of El Arish after the bodies were brought there. Al-Azazy says the organs are taken from refugees while they are still alive. ""The organs are not useful if they're dead. They drug them first and remove their organs, then leave them to die and dump them in a deep dry well along with hundreds of bodies."" He says he was once taken to the area where the bodies are dumped after the organ removal process. He says he believes corrupt Egyptian doctors are working with the Bedouins, coming to Sinai with mobile hospital units to perform the operations to remove especially corneas, livers and kidneys. ""Mobile clinics using advanced technology come from a private hospital in Cairo to an area in the deserts of Mid-Sinai and conduct physicals on the Africans before they choose those suitable, then they conduct the operation,"" Al-Azazy said. CNN showed some of the photos of the dead to Dr. Fakhry Saleh, the former head of Cairo's forensic department and an expert on the illegal organ trade. ""There are two kinds of scars. One is from a postmortem autopsy and one from surgery,"" Saleh said, pointing to a scar that he says came from an operation that must have been performed shortly before the person died. According to Saleh, the operation was conducted no more than 48 hours before death, indicated by the freshness of the scars. Furthermore, all the scars are in the area of the liver and kidney. ""They are good stitches in the area of the liver and the kidney,"" Saleh said while examining the photos on a laptop. While Saleh says he has never heard of organ theft involving African refugees, he says it seems highly probable that the scars on the bodies come from organ removal. ""They could open you up, take it out and just let you die. The mafia does not care whether you live or die. When they cut you open, it would be very painful, so they would give you anesthesia,"" Saleh later said. Saleh has done extensive research on the illegal organ business in Egypt, which preys on poor people. The World Health Organization in a recent report called Egypt a regional hub for the trade. An investigation headed by Saleh found illegal organ trafficking to be one of the most profitable criminal activities. ""Organ trade is the second most profitable trade behind only weapons trade,"" he said. ""It brings in more money than drug dealing and prostitution."" One Bedouin tribal chief did put CNN in touch with a Bedouin who used to be involved in people smuggling and who was close to the organ theft scheme. The source spoke on condition of anonymity but offered insights into the scheme. ""The doctors deal directly with the Sawarka family, and they buy the organs starting from $20,000,"" the source said in a phone interview. He offered further details of the logistics required to keep the organs fresh for the transplant into their new owners' bodies: ""The doctors come with some sort of mobile fridge where the organs can be stored for six to eight hours and resold in Cairo or elsewhere."" The source claimed doctors from Cairo are involved in the organ theft, a claim that has proved impossible to verify. ""It's like spare parts for cars,"" the Bedouin, who later agreed to meet one member of the CNN crew in person, said sarcastically toward the end of the interview. A second Bedouin, who also refused to be identified, later gave a similar account. The police general in charge of security in Northern Sinai tells CNN that his forces are aware that organ trafficking and theft are going on in their area of operations but that the authorities have not identified who is behind the schemes.","Bedouin smugglers may be stealing organs from African refugees in Sinai desert .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Stephen Colbert is not terribly worried about the NSA reading his emails. ""I don't necessarily want people reading my emails but I'm not a spy, I don't run a crime syndicate,"" he said at the RSA computer-security conference here on Friday. ""I've got things I don't want people to know but I didn't really go running for cover for a new way to encrypt."" The comedian gave the closing keynote at the RSA conference, ignoring requests from privacy activists and some members of the cybersecurity community to back out of the event. A number of security speakers dropped out of the RSA conference when Reuters reported in December that RSA had an undisclosed $10 million contract with the NSA to build a back door for the government agency into encryption software. Some protesters put on a counter-conference nearby Thursday called TrustyCon, and protesters passed out anti-NSA information outside of a conference location in downtown San Francisco. Though he is not a security expert, Colbert's reaction was closely watched by those outside of the community. RSA typically closes out its week-long conferences with big-name speakers, often from the political sphere. Condoleezza Rice, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair have all held the honor at previous conferences. This year it hired Colbert. Some called for the TV host to boycott the event, and privacy group Fight for the Future had started an online petition asking Colbert not to attend. ""Now a lot of people, maybe some in this room, were upset to learn I'd be speaking here today. Many of you see me as a champion of privacy,"" said Colbert. ""Which I know because I read your emails."" Colbert was quick to defend RSA and his decision to keep the paid gig. He said he believed the security company was exonerated by its claim to have promoted the supposedly compromised standard a full two years before the NSA payoff. Colbert asked if it was fair to boycott this conference when other major companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Verizon and Yahoo had all been linked to the NSA. He also joked that as a freedom lover, he doesn't engage in boycotts. And that he had signed a contract so his conscience was clear, as long as his check cleared. While the RSA got a pass, Colbert didn't go as easy on the NSA or Edward Snowden, whom he referred to as ""practically a war criminal"" for taking top secret U.S. intelligence to China and then to Russia. ""Was Mordor not accepting asylum requests?"" he quipped. The lines between the blustering right-leaning character Colbert plays on TV and the more liberal comedian himself were fluid during the talk, but he seemed genuine in his criticisms of the agency and its famous whistleblower. ""We can trust the NSA because without a doubt it is history's most powerful, pervasive, sophisticated surveillance agency ever to be totally pwned by a 29-year-old with a thumb drive,"" said Colbert. The rest of the talk was a mix of jokes and light political commentary, with some security humor thrown in to appease the cryptographer audience. He joked about his own fictional security startup, CloudFog, and took questions from the audience about ""Lord of the Rings,"" Jane Fonda, acting and politics. In the end, the comedian placed the blame for the NSA's programs on Americans. ""We all deserve credit for this new surveillance state that we live in because we the people voted for the Patriot Act. Democrats and Republicans alike,"" said Colbert. ""We voted for the people who voted for it, and then voted for the people who reauthorized it, then voted for the people who re-re-authorized it."" U.S. wants to extend time it can hold surveillance data . Big data, big business, Big Brother?","Comedian Stephen Colbert goes through with controversial talk at the RSA cybersecurity conference .

"(CNN) -- From hot air balloon to hang-gliding operators, plenty of airborne adventure outfits promise to let you ""soar with the birds."" Few, however, deliver on the claim quite as literally or dramatically as Nepal's Parahawking Project. An activity in which humans fly alongside beautiful Egyptian vultures, parahawking is one of the more sensational flight experiences on the planet. Flights take off from the lakeside town of Pokhara -- a jumping off point for whitewater rafting, mountain biking and other adventure activities in the Nepal's Annapurna region. Thanks to the perennial presence of thermal gusts of air, traditional paragliding is an established and popular activity in the Pokhara Valley. Many paragliding outfits operate tandem flights in the area. But only the Parahawking Project offers two flight companions -- mine were named ""Scott"" and ""Kevin."" Scott Mason was my human guide. Like most Egyptian vultures, Kevin, didn't say much, but was extremely handsome, with sharp eyes and an adorable spiked hairdo. The founder of Nepal's Parahawking Project, Mason employs two Egyptian vultures, his preferred breeds in the air, to accompany paragliders in flight. (Kevin's feathered colleague is named ""Bob."") Inspiration strikes over beers . Like other birds, Egyptian vultures conserve energy while flying by seeking ""thermals"" -- rising currents of warm air that occur when the sun heats the ground. Thermals are also important to paragliders, who use them to stay aloft for longer periods of time. Parahawking involves using trained birds to locate thermals. Human paragliders follow the birds as they fly, rewarding the birds with a piece of meat after they've been guided to a thermal. ""The birds land on the passengers' gloved hand for an inflight reward,"" according to the Parahawking Project website. The idea of using vultures to lead paragliders first came to Mason in 2001. Mason says inspiration struck over beers with the man who kick-started Nepal's paragliding industry. ""The more beers we had, the better the idea seemed,"" he says. ""Luckily, it still seemed like a good plan in the morning."" Taking flight . Though a few other operators around the world have begun offering parahawking flights, Mason, who says he's always been ""a bird guy,"" says his project is the original. In the eight years since the tandem flights with vultures took off, Mason has had a number of interesting experiences. One involved a client with no arms for the birds to land on -- a fact the man failed to mention until go time. Then there was the vegan who decided, after jumping, that she couldn't bear to touch the buffalo bait. The best part of the job ""is when a passenger is reduced to tears as the bird comes and lands on their arm during a flight,"" says Mason. Magical experience . Standing on a cliff on a sunny morning, Mason hands me a long leather glove. This will be Kevin's perch when he alights midair on my arm. His motivation will be the raw buffalo meat tucked into my fist. The whole parahawking experience, which lasts about 30 minutes, is surreal. With 8,000-meter, snow-capped peaks reflecting in the lake below, the views from the sky are phenomenal. When Kevin finds us a strong thermal, we quickly follow and ascend, and then he's called over for a reward. Sheer joy overwhelms the senses when sharing the skies with a bird at 2,000-plus meters. The concept is simple, the feeling magical. Conservation efforts . In Pokhara, parahawking is roughly twice the price of a standard tandem paragliding session. From the â‚¬125 ($170) parahawking fee, however, 1,000 Nepalese rupees (about $10.50) are donated to vulture conservation projects in Nepal. Parahawking is just part of Mason's mission to educate people on the value of vultures and threats posed to their existence. He's also helped established the Ghachok Vulture Restaurant, a community-managed safe vulture feeding site near Pokhara. Tourists sign up with the ""restaurant"" and those lucky enough to receive a forthright ""cow dead"" text are invited to see the birds devour a carcass. The parahawking season runs from about October to April. Bookings are made through the Parahawking Project website or at the Blue Sky Paragliding office in Pokhara. The Parahawking Project, Maya Devi Village, Lakeside, Pokhara, Nepal; +977 98066 47917 .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Polls closed in Bangladesh's parliamentary elections Sunday amid a boycott by major opposition parties and violence that left at least 16 people dead, officials said. Officials announced some results Sunday night. But disputes over the vote appeared to be far from over, with the country's largest opposition party calling for a fresh round of protests starting Monday against what they called ""farcical polls."" Kazi Rakibuddin Ahmad, Bangladesh's chief election commissioner, said cold weather and the opposition boycott fueled a low turnout nationwide. But a senior leader of the ruling Awami League said people ""spontaneously cast votes and rejected (the) opposition's violent activities."" ""It's a victory of democracy,"" Tofail Ahmed told reporters. Police officials reported violence in many parts of the country as opposition activists hoping to foil elections clashed with officers. Police in some areas told CNN they fired tear gas and shots at protesters who tried to attack polling stations. The capital of Dhaka was largely peaceful, but voter turnout was low. ""Presence of voters today is lower than any other time of voting,"" said Gazi Aslim Uddin, a presiding officer at a voting station in old Dhaka. Opposition protesters don't trust Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her administration and want a neutral caretaker government to oversee the vote to make sure it is fair. But that caretaker system was scrapped a few years ago. With mistrust mounting, Bangladesh has seen a series of incidents of deadly street violence over the elections in recent months. Local civic groups and international communities urged the government to cancel the voting and reschedule the elections. The largest opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and its allies boycotted Sunday's elections and enforced a general strike to thwart voting. Attackers torched about 150 polling centers and election materials nationwide. The boycott was expected to ensure a victory for the ruling Awami League party. Violence stopped voting at some centers, the country's chief election commissioner said, and officials plan to hold new polls at those locations on January 24. Senior BNP leader Osman Farruk demanded cancellation of the elections results and called for fresh elections under a neutral caretaker government. The election unrest underscores persistent problems in the South Asian nation, a country grappling with grinding poverty, political instability and development challenges.

"(CNN) -- He's perhaps the most powerful and popular politician Turkey has seen in generations. But Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan may also be the most polarizing. And now, the man who boasts economic and political accomplishments during 10 years in office is fending off complaints from large crowds of protesters that he's turning into a ""dictator."" ""The only thing that we want,"" said one of the thousands packed into anti-government demonstrations in Istanbul, ""... we want him to resign."" The editorial board of The Washington Post said Erdogan ""is offering unfortunate proof that it is possible to be both elected and authoritarian."" His accomplishments in office include unprecedented economic growth in Turkey. ""Erdogan has been a key part of that success. He has vision, drive, and his supporters united around him and push for the agenda he is building,"" said Tim Ash, head of emerging markets for Standard Bank. The prime minister has also spearheaded political reforms that brought Turkey more in line with the European Union -- and closer to the West. Despite economic boom, Erdogan targeted by protests . Under Erdogan and his ruling AKP party, Turkey lifted curbs on public expression of religion, including strict limits on women wearing Islamic-style headscarves. And he's made significant progress in ending the 30 years of guerrilla war with Kurdish separatists. Erdogan is an important ally of the United States and President Barack Obama, and a key political player in efforts to resolve the crisis in Syria. But along the way, critics say, he has steadily accumulated more and more power and shown growing intolerance of dissent. With his term set to end next year, Erdogan has repeatedly announced plans to transform the country's political system from a prime ministerial form of government to a more powerful presidential system, with himself as head of state. Many journalists say press freedoms in Turkey have declined under his rule. Reporters Without Borders says Turkey ""is currently the world's biggest prison for journalists, especially those who express views critical of the authorities on the Kurdish issue."" Erdogan rejects the accusations against him. ""I have nothing to say if they call the person who has committed himself to serving his nation a dictator,"" Erdogan said in a televised address. Opinion: Is Turkey on the verge of a meltdown? Demonstrators say otherwise. ""He has a big ego; he has this Napoleon syndrome. He takes himself as a sultan,"" said Yakup Efe Tuncay, a 28-year-old demonstrator who carried a Turkish flag in Gezi Park, ground zero for the protest movement. ""He needs to stop doing that. He's just a prime minister."" Others have different complaints about Erdogan. Many secular Turks complain that the Islamist-rooted government is intolerant of criticism and diverse lifestyles, as evidenced by the recent enactment of tight restrictions on the sale of alcohol, Fadi Hakura, manager of the Turkey Project at the London-based think tank Chatham House, said in a CNN.com column. Critics also complain about rapid urbanization and its effects on the environment, an issue that helped spark the initial protests in Gezi Park. Erdogan has made clear he expects to hold on to power. The protests, he says, will not prove to be a ""Turkish Spring,"" a reference to the Arab Spring that brought regime changes in several nations. Staunch supporters continue to stand by him. ""He's a man's man,"" said Cengizhan Safi, a resident of Kasimpasa, the Istanbul neighborhood that Erdogan grew up in. ""We love him a lot because he's a Muslim Turk and because he's from Kasimpasa."" Safi added that he and others don't take the protesters seriously. ""Because they are the minority. We are already the owners of this country."" Erdogan has said that if he wanted to mobilize his supporters on the streets, he could bring out huge crowds. But many in the region speculate that he's losing support. As such suggestions have surfaced on social media, Erdogan slammed Twitter for helping people spread ""lies."" Social media, he said, ""is the worst menace to society.'' While it's unclear how the protests will affect his future, he's not new to being the subject of controversy. In a 2011 online poll fueled by Turkish social media sites, more people picked Erdogan to be Time's Person of the Year than any other candidate. But at the same time, more people voted against the idea than for it. As Time put it, Erdogan was simultaneously the poll's ""most- and least-favored Person of the Year."" CNN's Gul Tuysuz and John Defterios contributed to this report.","NEW: PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan is ""a man's man,"" and protesters ""the minority,"" a supporter says .

"(CNN) -- A couple of hours before President Obama's prime-time speech on ISIS, Republicans Mitt Romney and Chris Christie took the opportunity of the New Jersey governor's birthday party to blast the President on his foreign policy. ""The foreign policy he's had has not been good for America, has not been good for our safety, has not been good for our friends around the world,"" Romney said. Obama outlines strategy to fight ISIS: Airstrikes in Syria, more U.S. troops . The 2012 GOP presidential nominee argued Obama should have intervened earlier in Syria and aided moderate rebels. He also painted the President as being weak in his handling of Russia's intervention in Ukraine. ""It's extraordinary that we don't have a President that knows what to do,"" Romney said. Along with foreign policy, he outlined major problems he sees with Obama's policies on the economy and education. Still, Romney encouraged the audience to ""support"" the President as he takes his next steps in fighting the militant group in Iraq and Syria. For his part, Christie went off on Obama for dismissing Romney's 2012 argument that Russia was the United States' No. 1 geopolitical foe -- an assessment that Republicans have lorded over Obama ever since the unrest began between Russia and Ukraine. ""Let me tell you something, Mr. President,"" Christie said. ""You were wrong, Mitt Romney is right, and the world is suffering because of it."" A preview of what's to come? Christie's birthday bash with Romney had all the appearances of a potential campaign rally in 2016, that is if Christie runs for President: . -- A highly complimentary introduction of Christie by the most recent GOP nominee. -- An excited audience with phones jutted in the air, taking photos. -- A giant American flag as the backdrop. -- Both wives on stage. -- And of course, blistering critiques of Obama. The New Jersey Republican Party hosted the fundraiser that was billed as an event to celebrate Christie's 52nd birthday, which was on Saturday. While they sang each others' praises Wednesday night, it was less than two years ago when many of Romney's supporters were saying that Christie cost Romney the election. They were were furious with Christie after he embraced Obama when the President came to survey Superstorm Sandy damage in New Jersey -- just a few days before Election Day. Critics argued that Christie's warm reception of Obama gave the President some bipartisan sway. In interviews after the election, however, Romney never blamed Christie, nor did he say there was bad blood between the two.

"(CNN) -- She spent her teenage years ruling the tennis world, and now Monica Seles is hoping her world of tennis can rule today's teenagers. From becoming the youngest grand slam champion to having her career shattered by a traumatic stabbing attack, then battling related weight problems before losing her father and coach to cancer, the 39-year-old has plenty of life experience to draw on for her latest project. ""I am old enough now to know that life throws different curveballs and it's about how you handle them,"" she told CNN's World Sport. ""I try to handle them as best I can."" Long retired from the top level, the former world No. 1 has followed up her autobiography by co-authoring a fictional book on life at a tennis academy. The main character of ""The Academy: Game On"" gained her entry to an elite tennis school by virtue of a scholarship, just as the eventual winner of nine grand slams did herself as a 12-year-old. Five years of training at Nick Bollettieri's famous academy in Florida turned the slender young Seles into the 1990 French Open champion at the tender age of 16 years and six months, and at 17 she became the youngest No. 1. Those records have since been broken by Martina Hingis but the fact remains that Seles -- who then represented Yugoslavia but who has since taken American citizenship -- was a prodigy whose equal the world had never seen before. Still the youngest winner at Roland Garros, she added the Australian and U.S. Open titles to her CV in 1991 -- and is now in no doubt as to what drove her to the top. ""I had an absolutely great time co-writing the book (with James LaRosa),"" Seles said. ""The main character, Maya, had a way to get into the academies, which is the same way I did -- on a scholarship. And as I always said in the book, there are two ways to get into an academy -- money or talent -- but at the end of the day talent always wins."" There can be no doubt that her ability, coupled with a fierce mental dedication, propelled Seles to the very top but her career was tragically derailed in circumstances that were unimaginable until they actually happened. A little over 20 years ago -- on April 30, 1993 -- Seles was playing a routine match in Hamburg when a deranged fan leaped over the advertising hoardings and plunged a knife into her back as she sat on her chair during a changeover. It soon emerged that the German assailant, one Gunter Parche, was a devoted fan of former world No. 1 Steffi Graf who carried out the attack in a bid to return his compatriot to the top of the rankings -- which did come to pass, but clearly for the very worst of reasons. The knife sunk one and a half inches into Seles' upper left back, and though the wounds took a few months to heal the psychological impact left far deeper scars -- as the former teenage prodigy readily admits. It would be over two years before Seles returned to the tour but with her father Karoly, who was also her coach, suffering from a cancer that would eventually take his life in 1998, the youngster's weight ballooned as she sought solace for her troubles in binge eating. She was never the same player again -- and her 2009 autobiography ""Getting a Grip"" gives a fascinating into the knock-on effects of Pache's attack. ""According to a psychiatric evaluation ... he stated that I was not 'pretty. Women shouldn't be as thin as a bone,' "" she wrote after her retirement, which came five years after her last official tour match. ""I wonder now just how much his words haunted my recovery. An integral part of my rehab revolved around cardio sessions. But I started finding excuses for avoiding the treadmill. ""Darkness had descended into my head. No matter how many ways I analyzed my situation, I couldn't find a bright side. ""Food became the only way to silence my demons. I'd walk into the kitchen, grab a bag of crisps and a bowl of chocolate ice cream, then head to the couch and eat in front of the television. ""I still don't know why my anguish found solace in food. Maybe I was subconsciously reacting to Parche's angry comment that 'women shouldn't be as thin as a bone.' If I padded myself with extra weight, I'd be protected from being hurt again."" Returning to the sport in August 1995, Seles would go on to win another grand slam -- the Australian Open in 1996 -- but even that glory was tainted. Having gone from a size eight to 18, her ballooning weight prompted such self-consciousness that she wanted to be out of the limelight as soon as possible, spending the awards ceremony in Melbourne ""thinking about getting off the court and hiding in my tracksuit."" It was to be Seles' last major title and the eating disorder sparked by Parche's savage attack continued to plague her until she played her last competitive match in 2003, as the girl who once had the world at her fingertips slipped into the shadows. ""To be thrown into the limelight at the age of 16, being No. 1 in the world and yet struggling to be a teenager is not an easy thing,"" she told CNN. ""Then at 19, to get stabbed and have my career stopped for two and a half years, decide to come back and then lose my coach/best friend/dad, I've had a lot of lows and highs -- but at the end of the day that is what life is about. ""And it's just really about living in the present."" Which is what Seles has been doing, having appeared in the popular ""Dancing with the Stars"" TV program in 2008 and now hoping to continue her career as a novelist with sequels planned to follow the publication of ""The Academy: Game On."" Fittingly, given the subject matter of her book, her writing began on the tennis circuit as she sought an escape from the monotony of endless traveling to tournaments. ""On the downtime during rain delays and traveling, I wrote a lot,"" she said. ""In tennis, everything is about hitting that yellow ball and being really focused on it -- but writing 'Game On' was just so much fun as I got to use my imagination. ""To finally see it come alive has been a great joy for me.""","Monica Seles is moving on to a new stage of her life after co-authoring a fiction novel .

"(CNN) -- Dear Speaker Boehner, . President Theodore Roosevelt enacted 1,081 executive orders during his presidency. President Dwight Eisenhower had 484. President Ronald Reagan had 381. And President George W. Bush had 291. President Barack Obama has enacted 182 executive orders -- yet the GOP accuses him of being an ""imperial president,"" and Republican members of the House of Representatives are preparing to sue him for violating the Constitution. With all due respect, Speaker Boehner, it's as though the fog of extreme partisanship that has colored your dealings with President Obama since day one has suddenly turned into a full-on fever of irrationality. Think about this for just a second: House Republicans are using taxpayer dollars to fund a lawsuit against a President who has literally done not only what every president before him has done but has done it less often and is doing so now only because House Republicans repeatedly refuse to even vote on legislation, let alone pass anything. And you have the gall to accuse the President of being the one in violation of the Constitution? Even more frustrating is how your repeated attacks on the President fall factually flat. In your essay for CNN, you write: ""After years of slow economic growth and high unemployment under President Obama, they are still asking, 'where are the jobs?' "" This is a particularly laughable assertion given last week's jobs report, which noted our economy added 288,000 jobs in June, marking 52 straight months of continuous job growth. Overall, under President Obama's leadership, the private sector has added 9.7 million jobs and an economy that was in free fall when he was elected is now in a steady recovery. Don't think that recovery is fast enough, Speaker Boehner? Then pass laws to help rather than jeering from the sidelines and rooting for America to fail so you can blame it on President Obama. You assert that you have passed jobs bills that President Obama and the Democratic Senate are ignoring, but frankly the word ""jobs"" as you use it there is questionable. Your ""jobs"" bills include legislation to repeal Obamacare, through which 20 million Americans now have health insurance, cut food stamps for poor Americans and reduce government regulations on fracking. Meanwhile, President Obama proposed an actual jobs bill that would have created construction jobs to modernize our deteriorating roads and airports, provided tax credits for employers that hired returning veterans, extended unemployment benefits, which also spurs spending, and cut payroll taxes for 98% of American businesses. But that jobs bill was killed by Republican opposition in Congress. You also accuse President Obama of ignoring the law, of acting like ""a monarch or king."" Yet the same article of the Constitution that vests power and authority in Congress vests executive power in the President. Since the founding of our country, that power has been interpreted to allow presidents to enact executive orders and determine how the duly passed laws of Congress should be prioritized and deployed. If you're looking for an example of stretching that authority to the point of breaking it, perhaps you shouldn't scrutinize a former Constitutional law professor but instead his predecessors. ""I believe in a strong, robust executive authority,"" Vice President Dick Cheney said in 2005. ""The president of the United States needs to have his constitutional powers unimpaired."" Cheney, for instance, described the War Powers Act -- in which a president must gain the approval of Congress before launching armed conflict -- as an unconstitutional ""infringement on the authority of the presidency."" In both number and scope, President Obama's use of executive actions simply pales against this and other actions one could compare. Franklin Roosevelt, the last president faced with a massive economic recession, ultimately enacted 3,522 executive orders. Even though his own party controlled both houses of Congress, FDR wasn't sued. He was elected to a third term. And his policies, including his executive orders, helped rescue America from the recession. In the face of obstructionist Republicans in Congress, President Obama's executive actions also enjoy broad public support. Some 57% of Americans supported his administrative relief for young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States when they were children. And according to a poll conducted by the LGBT advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign, 73% of Americans support an executive order to ban discrimination by federal contractors on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. If House Republicans don't like these executive orders, then pass immigration reform and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. Don't sue the President. Passing laws that our nation wants and needs is doing your job. Suing the President just because you don't like him is irresponsible partisan petulance. Speaker Boehner, you write: ""If you look back over American history, there has always been a tension between the inherent powers of the executive branch versus the inherent powers of the legislative branch."" Yes, that's true, and President Obama is simply exercising those inherent executive powers. Now please exercise yours and pass some laws to help America instead of wasting taxpayer money on a frivolous lawsuit that is nothing more than a flagrant partisan stunt. Boehner: Why we must now sue the President .","Sally Kohn: Obama has issued fewer executive orders than G.W. Bush or Reagan .
John Boehner's actions smack of irrational partisanship, she says .

"(CNN) -- After weeks of fruitless searching for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, it sounds like a promising sign. When a Chinese patrol ship picked up two pulses in the southern Indian Ocean, the head of the Australian agency coordinating search efforts called it ""an important and encouraging lead."" Investigators hope the audio signals are locator beacons from the plane's data recorders, but they're not sure yet. Is it the discovery we've all been waiting for? Could those be Malaysia Airlines Flight 370's pingers? Here are four reasons to believe and six reasons to doubt: . REASONS TO BELIEVE . 1) The frequency doesn't occur in nature. The Chinese Haixun 01 patrol ship detected pulses at a frequency of 37.5 kHz, the Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency reported. That's the same frequency of black box pingers -- and that frequency is no accident. The pingers were designed to have that frequency because it does not occur in nature. 2) There were two separate events. The Haixun 01 reported two pulses within 2 kilometers (1.25 miles) of each other. Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, head of the Joint Agency Coordination Center, described them as ""fleeting, fleeting acoustic events."" One was described as being 90 seconds long; no time was given for the other, but it was evidently shorter. ""I think the fact that we have had two detections, two acoustic events, in that location provides some promise which requires a full investigation of the location,"" Houston said. 3) You usually know a ping when you hear one. The pings are, under ideal conditions, easily recognizable. They ""ping"" like a metronome â€” with a steady pulse about once a second. 4) They're in the right spot. According to the latest analysis of Inmarsat satellite data and aircraft performance, the Haixun 01 is in the right spot. In fact, search supervisors, citing the new analysis, are moving the focus of the search to an area that includes the location of the Haixun 01. ""The area of highest probability, we think is now probably in the southern part of the area, pretty close to where Haixun 01 is operating,"" Houston said. Pulse signals raise new questions . REASONS TO DOUBT . 1) The ocean is noisy. In addition to the Haixun 01's two ""acoustic events,"" ships detected two other events in a very short time, showing exactly how noisy the ocean is. The British ship HMS Echo recorded one event that was determined to be unfounded. The Ocean Shield, an Australian naval vessel equipped with sophisticated listening equipment, has also detected ""an acoustic noise"" in another area of the ocean to the north. According to a CNN calculation, the Australian ship was about 350 miles (565 kilometers) away from the spot where the Chinese ship detected the pulses. It's also unclear whether the sound the Australian ship detected was related to Flight 370. The search team is urging patience and restraint. 2) Only one pulse was detected at a time. The Haixun 01 detected only one pulse at a time. Assuming both black box pingers are working, are close together, and are unobstructed by debris or terrain â€” and those are, admittedly, big assumptions â€” they should have heard two pingers, perhaps like a metronome with an echo. 3) These aren't ideal conditions. While pingers are easily identifiable under ideal conditions, the current conditions are far from perfect. Video of the searchers show them listening to the hydrophone with earbuds, not headsets that would block out ambient noise. So the steady ""pings"" -- which actually sound like the snap of fingers -- could be confused with or overwhelmed by other noise, such as the waves lapping against the boat. The Chinese said they did not have time to record the pulses, precluding a scientific analysis of the sounds. 4) A spare pinger on the boat might have sent the signal. In video of the Haixun 01, it appears the Chinese had a spare pinger in the boat. Anish Patel, president of pinger manufacturer Dukane Seacom, says it is not recommended to have a pinger near the area where you are trying to listen. If that pinger gets wet, it will start transmitting, potentially confusing search teams. ""I wouldn't put one where I'm measuring,"" Patel said. ""It's just not good common practice."" 5) The equipment was designed for shallow water. The hydrophone the Chinese used to detect the pulse is ""designed for shallow water applications,"" not for the deep water, said Thomas Altshuler of Teledyne Marine Systems, manufacturer of the hydrophone. ""They are using it in a scenario outside of our normal operation,"" he said. Is it possible that it heard a ping from the depths of the Indian Ocean? ""It is possible, but it would be right at the edge of that detection (capability),"" he said. 6) The underwater search of a vast area started only recently. The search area is so large, and the underwater search has just begun. It almost defies belief that the pingers could be found so soon. But then again, almost everything about this case defies belief. THE BOTTOM LINE . We'll give the final word to Angus Houston. ""This is an important encouraging lead, but one which I urge you to continue to treat carefully,"" he told reporters. ""We are working in a very big ocean and within a very large search area, and so far, since the aircraft went missing, we have had very few leads which allow us to narrow the search area."" CNN's Aaron Cooper and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Are the pulses detected by a Chinese patrol ship MH370's pingers?
The frequency and location are indications they might be .
There are also a number of reasons to doubt the latest lead ."
"(CNN) -- Vincenzo Nibali became only the sixth man in history to win all three of cycling's major tours as he sealed victory in this year's Tour de France on the Champs Elysees Sunday. Nibali stayed out of trouble on the 137.5km stage from Evry, which was won by German sprinter Marcel Kittel of the Giant-Shimano team. It left the 29-year-old Italian a commanding seven minutes 52 seconds ahead of runner-up Jean Christophe-Peraud with another Frenchman, Thibaut Pinot, in third. Astana's Nibali joins illustrious company by adding to his earlier triumphs in the Giro d'Italia and Tour of Spain. Legends Eddy Merckx of Belgium, France duo Jacques Anquetil and Bernard Hinault, Nibali's fellow Italian Felipe Gimondi and Alberto Contador of Spain are the only others to achieve the feat. Contador was one of the favorites for this year's race, but crashed out, as did reigning champion Chris Froome of Britain. It left the way clear for Nibali, who served notice of his intentions with an audacious break to win the second stage in Sheffield in England and gained more time on the cobbled fifth stage where Froome exited. Nibali continued to dominate as the race went over the Alps and Pyrenees, winning three more stages to be a deserved winner after three grueling weeks. Crossing the line with his teammates, he went straight to his wife and baby daughter to celebrate with his family. ""It's the most important and the best moment, I never imagined it could feel this good because when you find yourself on this podium on the Champs Elysees, it's unique,"" said Nibali. ""Now that I'm here it's even better than I imagined. I fought for this every day, I started building from a long way out with a winter preparation with the team because we had decided this was our objective."" Kittel, the star of the early stages of the Tour, used his raw sprinting power to match Nibali's four wins this year, edging out Norway's Alexander Kristoff with Ramunas Navardauskas of Lithuania third. Peter Sagan of Slovakia finished ninth, but had already wrapped up the green jersey for points leader despite failing to win a stage on the 2014 Tour. Kittel hinted he would be targeting green himself in future races. ""My goals won't change in the future, especially at the Tour de France,""he told the official Tour de France website. ""I'll go again for stage wins but I'm not a man of records. I've said in the past and I repeat that the green jersey can become an option in the future."" The 24-year-old Pinot, one of the great hopes of French cycling, took the white jersey for best young rider, with Rafal Majka of Poland winning the King of the Mountains classification.","Vincenzo Nibali wins Tour de France in Paris .

"(CNN) -- A Sudanese Christian woman who was sentenced to die for refusing to renounce her faith -- and then released -- has been charged on two criminal counts after trying to leave the African country for the United States, her legal team said Wednesday. Meriam Yehya Ibrahim, who was detained with her American husband, Daniel Wani, and their two children at an airport in Khartoum on Tuesday, is accused of traveling with falsified documents and giving false information, according to her legal team. The family is currently being held in a Khartoum police station and has been refused bail. Ibrahim's legal team told CNN that Daniel Wani is being held as an accessory. The family was stopped at the airport after what Ibrahim's lawyers described Tuesday as an alleged ""irregularity with her documentation."" Ibrahim has a U.S. visa and was headed to the United States with her family, her legal team said. The U.S. State Department said Tuesday that Ibrahim and her family had been ""temporarily detained at the airport"" for questioning over issues relating to their travel and documentation. ""They have not been arrested. The government has assured us of their safety,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said then. Harf said that the U.S. Embassy ""has been and will remain highly involved in working with the family and the government,"" saying ""we are engaging directly with Sudanese officials to secure their safe and swift departure from Sudan."" Sudanese authorities said Ibrahim had been detained because of the documents she submitted. Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Services said that she had South Sudanese travel documents, despite not being a citizen of South Sudan, and she was heading to the United States, which is not her native country. ""This was considered illegal by the Sudanese authorities, who have summoned both the U.S. and South Sudanese ambassadors,"" the agency said in a message posted on its media Facebook page early Wednesday. The airport detention came a day after Ibrahim's legal team announced the 27-year-old woman had been released from prison after weeks of international controversy over her conviction on apostasy and adultery charges. According to her lawyer, the case began when one of Ibrahim's relatives, a Muslim, filed a criminal complaint saying her family was shocked to find out she had married Wani, a Christian, after she was missing for several years. The Sudanese court considered Ibrahim a Muslim because her father was Muslim, but she said she was a Christian and never practiced Islam. She was charged with adultery, because a Muslim woman's marriage to a Christian man is illegal in Sudan, and with apostasy, accused of illegally renouncing what was alleged to be her original faith.","Meriam Yehya Ibrahim faces criminal charges after being stopped at Khartoum airport .

"London (CNN) -- It may not have been the most dramatic of moments, but it was certainly an important one: Two women, modestly dressed and veiled, walked proudly alongside the flag of their nation Saudi Arabia into London's Olympic stadium at the Games' spectacular opening ceremony. This understated entrance marked an extraordinary moment for the kingdom and for the Olympics itself, as the first occasion in the history of the Games when all countries participating have had women athletes in their teams. The achievement was welcomed by those at the highest echelons of sport, with Jacques Rogge, head of the International Olympic Committee, noting with pride in his speech at the opening ceremony that it was ""a major boost for gender equality."" Women have been the center of attention throughout much of the Olympics, both within and without Games venues, as they broke records, sparked drama, impressed with immense skill and poise and won medal after medal. Indeed, for many, London 2012 has truly been ""the women's Games."" For hosts Great Britain, the undoubted superstar was Jessica Ennis, a heptathlete of remarkable talent and composure who snatched gold despite immense pressure and the unforgiving lens of modern celebrity. Her comfortable win in the toughest of contests, and her vow to ""keep exactly the same and the way I am"", sparked national praise and a call from women's activists for more positive role models like her. Scores of other, lesser-known women athletes marked firsts for their countries. Tunisia's Habiba Ghribi became her country's first woman to win a medal in the games, saying afterward her medal was ""for all the Tunisian people, for Tunisian women, for the new Tunisia"". Games leave London with a golden glow . Women boxers made history by being included in the games for the first time, and the U.S.'s gymnastics team won a brace of medals for their remarkable performance. On the drama side, South Korean fencer Shin A-lam found herself at the center of one of the most extraordinary moments of the games after the dying second of one match granted her rival the gold. The sight of her in floods of tears, refusing to leave the venue moved many, even if Olympic authorities were unimpressed. But this is not to say there has not been controversy, in terms of sport, and plain, old fashioned sexism. Eight women badminton players from China, Indonesia and South Korea were disqualified for trying deliberately to lose matches in order to secure easier games. Controversy over the disparate treatment of male and female athletes arose when it was revealed that both Japan and Australia had made their women's football teams fly coach while their male colleagues enjoyed the luxury -- and extra leg room -- of business class. The incident prompted the embarrassed Australian authorities to announce they were reviewing their policies but led to accusations of inequality. U.S. coverage of their ""Fierce Five"" gymnastics team's heroine, Gabby Douglas, turned into a discussion of the African-American's hair, angering many who felt it denigrated her stunning achievement by playing into racial stereotypes. Golden girl Ennis: I'd do it for nothing . And the age-old double standard of looks versus talent came into play when British weightlifter Zoe Smith was forced to endure cruel taunts on Twitter and other social media about her appearance. Her response was to handle it with aplomb, writing on her blog: ""We don't lift weights in order to look hot, especially for the likes of men like that."" But the comments -- and the ease with which they were made on online platforms -- gave pause for thought. Despite such media storms, overall many sensed a shift in the right direction, a sea change in attitudes towards women in competitive sports. In women's football, Team GB's victory over Brazil at Wembley Stadium in front of 70,000 screaming fans, many of them young children who will provide the next generation of Olympians, was a zeitgeist moment for women's football. After the game, the sight of buggies piled up outside the arena, patiently awaiting their tiny cargo, was a small, but potent sign of change. The U.S. and Canadian women's football teams fought a remarkable battle to reach the semi finals, with the U.S. eventually prevailing 4-3 thanks to a goal in the dying seconds of the game and prompting praise from pundits as one of the most thrilling matches played by either gender in the Olympics. As for those Saudi Arabian women athletes, they failed, as expected, to win an Olympic medal, but perhaps winning just wasn't the point. Judo player Wojdan Shaherkani finally competed after a row over her headscarf ended in compromise with Olympic authorities. Despite the furor, she, too, sensed that a breakthrough had been made. ""Unfortunately, we did not win a medal, but in the future we will and I will be a star for women's participation,"" she said. ""It was the opportunity of a lifetime.""","London 2012 is the first Olympics to feature women in every national team .

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts high school student accused of raping and killing his math teacher has been indicted on charges he attacked an employee at a youth services facility, a district attorney's office announced Wednesday. According to the Suffolk County District Attorney's office, on June 2, Philip Chism followed a 29-year-old female employee into the bathroom at the Metro Youth Services facility in the Boston neighborhood of Dorchester and physically assaulted her. ""Co-workers heard her cries for help and interrupted the assault,"" the district attorney's office said. On Wednesday, Chism, 15, was charged with attempted murder by strangulation, assault with intent to murder, kidnapping and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Chism remains in custody. Suffolk County Juvenile Court has not set an arraignment date for these charges. His lawyers didn't answer calls from CNN when the new allegation surfaced last month. The teenager is accused of killing his algebra teacher, 24-year-old Colleen Ritzer, last October at Danvers High School, about 20 miles north of Boston. Police and prosecutors say he used a box cutter to kill Ritzer in a girls' bathroom. Chism pleaded not guilty to aggravated rape, robbery and murder charges in January. He is being tried as an adult.

"(CNN) -- Kenroy Williams, also known as ""Booms,"" is ""Guardian of the Reptiles"" in Hellshire, located near the Goat Islands in Jamaica. The region is centered in the Portland Bight Protected Area, an area of ocean and land set apart in 1999 to protect its rich biodiversity of birds, reptiles, plants, trees and marine life. But now, the Jamaican government is preparing to sell the Goat Islands to the China Harbour Engineering Co. to build a megafreighter seaport and industrial park. China Harbour is part of a conglomerate blacklisted by the World Bank under its Fraud and Corruption Sanctioning Policy. ""They're destroying what should be preserved,"" says Booms, who has been working to protect exceedingly rare reptiles in the area for seven years, including the critically endangered Jamaican iguana. The specifics of the development are being withheld, but Jamaica Information Service reports  it involves dredging and land reclamation, and a coal-fired power plant built to service the facilities. Environmentalists expect the mangrove forest on the two Goat Islands to be clear cut and the surrounding coral reef dredged. With the threat to Goat Islands looming, Robin Moore, a fellow with the International League of Conservation Photographers, flew to Jamaica to record images of wildlife and people who may soon see the destruction of their beaches, mangrove forest ecosystems and their livelihoods. In a short film by Moore, Booms talks about what's at stake: ""Portland Bight Protected Area consists of a beautiful beach and things that are here in Jamaica and found nowhere else, like the iguanas ... ""When the mangroves are destroyed, the earth won't stay together and then the water will take over. And that's the problem. And we won't have any beaches, and we can't do without beaches. If we have no beaches, we have no turtles. We won't have any crocodiles ..."" Booms especially fears for the Jamaican iguanas, Cyclura collei, thought to be extinct until 1990, when Edwin Duffus found one while hunting pigs in the Hellshire Hills. The Goat Islands are right off the Hellshire coast. At the time, surveys of the area revealed fewer than 100 iguanas remaining. Hope Zoo and Botanical Gardens in Kingston, teamed with the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas and others, set up a program to rear baby iguanas until they're big enough to be safe from predators. After release, the iguanas are tracked and observed to see how well they fare. The number of nesting females has grown from just six in 1991 to more than 30 in 2013. About 255 head-started iguanas have been released into Hellshire, the only place on earth -- other than the Goat Islands -- that they can survive. The Jamaica Iguana Recovery Project believes the islands are the sanctuary necessary to save the animal. During the past 24 years, millions of dollars, plus the sweat of countless biologists and research volunteers, have been invested in bringing Cyclura collei back from the brink. Although many released iguanas are breeding and nesting in the wild, the animal is still critically endangered. Jamaican iguanas can live for 40 years or more. They distinguish between strangers and researchers who come to the forest regularly and may show themselves once they feel safe. Imagine a 4-foot long, 15-pound dinosaur-like animal walking out of the bush, sitting down nearby, and making eye contact with you. ""There is indeed something special about making eye contact with a Cyclura,"" herpetologist Rick Hudson, of the Fort Worth Zoo, said. ""Back in the 1990s, you rarely saw an iguana; you might hear one crashing through the bush but glimpses were a special sight. Now, you go out in Hellshire and see big healthy iguanas that are habituated and come and hang out with you. It's the most incredible story I have ever been a part of."" The Jamaican Constitution states that the nation's citizens have ""the right to enjoy a healthy and productive environment free from the threat of injury or damage from environmental abuse and degradation of the ecological heritage."" Some argue the project will bring jobs, but as fisherwoman Paulette Coley told Moore: ""The government claims it will bring jobs and opportunity to the area, but we are not qualified, and we are not being trained for the jobs that will need to be done. They tell us what they want us to hear, but the reality is that we will be worse off."" Diana McCaulay, CEO of the Jamaica Environment Trust, says that in past projects with Chinese contractors, most of the employees have been Chinese. ""What is the benefit to Jamaica? That's not clear."" McCaulay says developing Goat Islands extends the global crisis of unsustainable exploitation of natural resources. ""Jamaica is a small island,"" she says, ""but this is happening all over the world, relentless pressure for high impact development that doesn't benefit local populations, particularly those who use the resources. ""Although global climate change is a clear danger to island nations, we are still building on the coast and taking out natural protections like mangroves. Our regulatory agencies simply cannot cope, especially with players like China who have huge financial resources and care little about the environment."" The rediscovery of the Jamaican iguana and the success of the recovery program has generated a huge conservation movement that draws international funding and ecotourism to the West Indies. This ecotourism could be developed. In 2012, tourism contributed close to $4 billion to the economy of Jamaica and 25% of jobs in the country are tourism-based. Tourists travel to see unspoiled beaches and native flora and fauna, and ideally, to see people living in a healthy relationship with their land. But if the Jamaican government sells out to Chinese developers, reversing its environmental protection laws and going against its own constitution, it will send the message that investing in tourism in Jamaica is unwise. There is still time to help the Jamaican people save their national treasure. Both Jamaica and China care about international opinion. Letters expressing concern and signatures on a petition may persuade Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller to stop the proposed development. Of his work as guardian of the reptiles ,Booms says, ""My family and friends? Some of them think it's awesome. ... Some of them ask me if I really touch the lizards and some think I'm crazy when they hear about the crocodiles. But the truth of the matter is that they don't understand, and I know that. 'Cause if they were here like me, they would understand. We are at one with nature.""","China plans huge industrial seaport in protected region of ocean and land in Jamaica .

"Stockholm, Sweden (CNN) -- The historic success of a far-right party in Swedish elections is a response to the country's ""extreme immigration policies,"" which have ""shattered"" Swedish society, the party leader said Monday. And it's part of a wave of victories for anti-immigration parties across Europe, Jimmie Akesson of the Sweden Democrats told CNN. ""All of Europe is suffering big problems from mass immigration and of course, people are becoming more and more frustrated in several European countries, which we can see from the election results,"" Akesson said. His Sweden Democrats party won 5.7 percent of the vote on Sunday and a place in the national parliament for the first time. ""We now have a platform for our ideology, and that is very important because we know that we have a big opportunity to get even more supporters,"" he said, insisting that the media had presented a ""false image"" of the party in the past. Akesson said the party did not hold racist views. No party or coalition won an overall majority Sunday. That means other parties have to talk to the Sweden Democrats, Akesson said. ""We have a situation where neither of the coalitions holds a majority, which can prove problematic in the long run if we can't find a solution,"" he said. ""So then it will be our responsibility to hold conversations and be ready to cooperate with all parties, but it is also their responsibility to talk to us."" With possession of 20 seats, the party could wind up tipping the balance of power between the two major coalitions, although party leaders have vowed not to cooperate with the Sweden Democrats. The ruling center-right coalition won re-election, the first time a non-socialist government was elected to a second term in the country's political history. Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt's center-right four-party coalition -- made up of the Moderates, the Liberals, the Christian Democrats and the Centre party -- held on to power, but lost its outright majority. ""The Swedish people have cast their vote, and they have ruled that we are the ones who should keep governing,"" Reinfeldt said at his party's election night celebration. His coalition won 49.3 percent of the vote, officials at the Swedish Election Authority said after all 5,668 voting districts reported. The opposition ""red-green"" coalition -- consisting of the Social Democrats, the Left party and the Green Party -- had 43.7 percent of the vote, election officials said. The leader of Sweden's red-green opposition coalition, Mona Sahlin, admitted defeat Sunday night. She told her supporters they were not able to regain the trust of the voters. ""We have lost,"" she said, stressing that the center-right coalition also failed to get an outright majority. The ruling coalition won 172 seats, while Sahlin's group took 157 in the 349-seat parliament. Sweden has a long tradition of socialist rule, with a cradle-to-grave welfare system. But the global financial crisis threw Sweden into one of its worst economic downturns since World War II. The ruling conservative coalition, which came into power in 2006, imposed a string of austerity measures and managed to turn Sweden's economy into one of the strongest in Europe, with an expected growth of 4.5 percent this year. The crisis management appears to have impacted many voters. ""I think the economy is the key issue,"" said one man at a Stockholm polling station. ""I think Sweden has done very well for the last few years during the global financial crisis, and I hope the government will stay on."" But with a tightening of fiscal policy, several groups in Swedish society have seen their situation worsen. Pensioners and sick people are among the hardest hit, and the leader of the red-green coalition had urged voters to vote for change on Sunday. ""There is a clear difference between the left's and the right's tax policies towards working people and pensioners,"" said one elderly woman who had just cast her ballot on Sunday. ""My pension has gone down during these last years."" ""The moderate party and the center-right alliance seeks the confidence of the voters,"" Reinfeldt said in a televised speech on Saturday, the eve of the election. ""We do this with a promise to take responsibility. We have taken Sweden through a difficult economic crisis. Many decisions have been hard to make, and not everything has been right from the beginning."" But, he said, ""after a difficult financial crisis, confidence in the future is now growing in our country. It is great to see how Sweden gets back on its feet. We are seeing more jobs and the unemployment is going down. Sweden today has Europe's strongest economy, but there is a risk for new troubled times. There are countries in our surroundings that have lost control over their economy and have had to make hard cuts and increase taxes. This will always hit the weakest the hardest. Don't put Sweden in this situation."" Meanwhile, Sahlin said, nearly all Swedes want ""a health care based on their needs, not their wallet, and a school that helps all children gain knowledge, regardless of their background ... I want to take responsibility for Sweden, the welfare state. If we can handle the jobs situation, then our economy will grow, and we can impose our welfare."" ""I am for reductions in tax, but not at any cost,"" she said. ""Don't vote away Sweden the welfare state. What we sell and tear down now will never come back."" The far-right Sweden Democrats, which received 2.9 percent of votes in 2006, nearly doubled its votes this year. But its anti-immigration policies have caused all the main party leaders to vow not to cooperate with it, even as it won seats. ""I think it is more important than ever that everyone goes to vote today so that we can stop them,"" one young woman voter said, referring to the Sweden Democrats. ""I think it would be a day of shame for all Swedes if those people would come into parliament.""","The country's immigration policies have ""shattered"" Swedish society, Jimmie Akesson says after victory .

"(CNN) -- A recent torrent of complaints has prompted Apple CEO Tim Cook to issue a public apology for the company's new maps app in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6, which previously relied on Google Maps. Addresses are not showing up correctly, public transit directions aren't available, and the satellite views make it look as if the Brooklyn Bridge is bending into the Hudson River. Unlike the naysayers, I was delighted to see the change. That's because six months ago, I broke up with Google. It's not a decision I made lightly. I was in an intimate relationship with the company for years. Google knew what I watched on YouTube and which trains I caught into New York City for a night out. It facilitated collaborations with my colleagues and helped me navigate foreign cities. We had some good times together, Google and I. Opinion: Why a naked Apple would be a better company . But over time, our relationship changed. Ads started to show up based on keywords that I had typed into the search engine or in my e-mail. In Google search, things I was looking for were now buried beneath ""helpful"" suggestions of things I wasn't interested in in the slightest. The problem was Google's latest privacy policy, which went into effect in March. Google's new rules mean that in addition to tracking your activities, it can aggregate your data across its many services and platforms such as Google Maps, Gmail, search, and Gchat, for starters. Why does Google collect and aggregate your information? Because when Google has a better picture of who you are, what you like and what you do online, it becomes even more attractive to advertisers. While Google's ecosystem offers many appealing perks and conveniences, the price you pay is your personal data. In short, when you use a Google service, you're not using a product -- you are the product. So I took matters into my own hands, and broke up with Google. Anyone coming out of a long-term relationship will tell you that breaking up is hard to do. You have to change your patterns. My first step was obviously to switch search engines. But to what? The old alternatives are all gone, absorbed by Google, Yahoo! and Bing. To make matters worse, I discovered that my own devices were working against me. Clicking a link on my computer or phone automatically opened Google Maps, search, or YouTube. I had to find new ways. Juggling directions from Nokia, Bing and MapQuest has led me on several wild goose chases while trying to get from A to B. I also spread my activities across multiple servers. I deleted my YouTube account, set my search engine to Duck Duck Go (a service that doesn't track search information), and logged into AIM. Deleting my Gmail account was the hardest -- and most revealing. It reminded me of the evil computer HAL 9000's death scene at the end of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" As I selected all the messages I have ever received and clicked the delete button, the system protested: Was I sure I wanted to do this? It reminded me of all our good times together by telling me we'd shared ""38,496 conversations since 2008."" In defense of my stupidphone . The ad bar stopped showing ads and started displaying environmentally friendly statements. Did I know that ""there is no limit to the number of times an aluminum can can be recycled""? Or that ""empty tissue boxes can provide easy and handy storage for plastic grocery bags""? I felt pangs of guilt and regret. When the screen finally displayed, ""You don't have any mail! Our servers are feeling unloved,"" I almost changed my mind. That's when it hit me. I thought we had an intimate relationship, when in fact I was being manipulated into codependence. Service by service, Google had convinced me that I needed it for everything, all to seduce me into giving up more of my personal data. Of course, Apple collects user information as well. But it is not the company's main source of revenue. Apple users pay for their products in dollars, not in personal information. Its closed system of products and devices, while decried among tech pundits, is its advantage. Apple also has a long history of treating its users not like products, but like consumers. This incentivizes improvements that put the user first, giving us a more powerful voice. After all, we can vote with our dollars and with our downloads. Breaking the Google monopoly means that all of our choices can improve. And that's why Apple's leaving Google Maps is a step in the right direction. In the meanwhile, as long as I know where my information is going, I don't mind getting a little lost. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Janet Vertesi.","User complaints prompted Apple to apologize for its new maps app .

"(CNN) -- Like the other American who volunteered to help others in Africa and ended up with Ebola, Nancy Writebol is driven first and foremost by her fervent faith. Still, that doesn't mean she doesn't need -- or deserve -- a pick-me-up. So, after arriving at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital from Liberia, Nancy Writebol asked for -- and received -- coffee from Starbucks. That was a definite plus about being back in her home country, though her husband acknowledges she has a long way to go to beat the deadly disease. ""I don't believe we can say she is in the clear, (but) I would say she is in very good hands,"" her husband, David Writebol, said Friday. ""... I am praying like never before."" 'Unassuming' woman of faith thrust into spotlight . On the same day he spoke about his wife's illness, the other infected American, who is being treated at the same Atlanta hospital, spoke publicly for the first time. Dr. Kent Brantly said in a statement that he is receiving ""the very best care possible"" and ""growing stronger every day."" Brantly and the Writebols talked about what led them to Liberia, where they thrust themselves into the midst of poverty and disease with a mission focusing on those in need. They also spoke about their struggles now to overcome Ebola. Brantly, 33, went to Liberia with his wife and two children last year to serve a two-year fellowship through a Samaritan's Purse post-residency program to practice general medicine. Infected U.S. doctor long drawn to mission work . But everything changed when Ebola started to sweep through West Africa. Brantly got a new role as medical director for the Samaritan's Purse Ebola Consolidated Case Management Center in Monrovia. ""I held the hands of countless individuals as this terrible disease took their lives away from them,"" he said Friday. ""I witnessed the horror firsthand and I can still remember every face and name."" It was in Monrovia where Brantly said he ""immediately isolated"" himself after first feeling ill. Three days later, his Ebola diagnosis was confirmed, though it didn't trigger the emotional response one might expect. ""When the result was positive, I remember a deep sense of peace that was beyond all understanding,"" he said. ""God was reminding me of what he had taught me years ago, that he will give me everything I need to be faithful to him."" Two weeks after that diagnosis, Brantly said, ""My focus ... remains the same -- to follow God."" WHO: Ebola an international health emergency . That strong Christian faith also echoed throughout David Writebol's comments about his wife. Married for 40 years, the Writebols have traveled the globe focused on their faith and their desire to help others. They are an ocean apart now, though plans are in the works to bring David Writebol from Liberia to be with his wife in Atlanta. When they do reunite, David said, ""I would give her a kiss. Hold her."" After that, the couple wouldn't necessarily go back to the comforts of America and more coffee from Starbucks. Ebola might have derailed them, but it hasn't changed their purpose in life.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods has confirmed that he will no longer be working with long-standing caddie Steve Williams after a successful 12-year relationship. Former world number one Woods, who has slipped to 20th in the world and is currently out of action with injuries to his left leg, confirmed the news on his official website. ""I want to express my deepest gratitude to Stevie for all his help, but I think it's time for a change,"" Woods said. Woods follows agent to new company . ""Stevie is an outstanding caddie and a friend and has been instrumental in many of my accomplishments. I wish him great success in the future."" The pair joined forces in March 1999, at a time when Woods had won just one major title, and since then they have flourished as a partnership -- claiming 13 majors as well as a remarkable 50 other PGA Tour titles. The 35-year-old Woods, who has not yet decided on a replacement, missed the British Open at Sandwich last week with knee and Achilles injuries having also missed the U.S. Open last month. He had been out of action for two months prior to the British Open, initially suffering the injuries at the Masters in April before withdrawing after nine holes of the Players Championship at Sawgrass in mid-May. The American has not won a tournament since the Australian Masters in November 2009, just before some well-publicized problems in his private life came to light. New Zealander Williams, 47, has caddied for Australia's Adam Scott at the last two majors and he later issued his own statement confirming that he would now caddie for Scott permanently, while expressing surprise at Woods' decision. Williams said on his own official website: ""After 13 years of loyal service needless to say this came as a shock. ""Given the circumstances of the past 18 months, working through Tiger's scandal, a new coach and with it a major swing change and Tiger battling through injuries, I am very disappointed to end our very successful partnership at this time,"" he added.

"(CNN) -- Landon Donovan, the greatest scorer in American men's soccer history and one of the players who helped raise the profile of the game in the United States, will retire after the MLS season. The Los Angeles Galaxy star told reporters in Los Angeles on Thursday that he doesn't have the same passion for the game that he had when he began playing professionally as a teenager. He said he made his final decision to leave the game about two weeks ago. ""It's bittersweet for me,"" he said. ""There is some sadness. I'm also equally excited for what's to come. As most of you know, I've been doing this for quite a long time."" Donovan said he wanted to tell the Galaxy his plans so the team could start the process of looking for a new marquee player. The 5-foot-8 forward has been the highest profile American player for many years. Donovan, 32, has netted more goals than any other player in U.S. men's national team history (57) and is the leading all-time scorer (138) for Major League Soccer. The exceptionally fast Donovan scored one of the most famous goals in U.S. history, knocking home a stoppage-time shot in the 2010 World Cup to beat Algeria and get the United States out of group play. Many expected Donovan to be named to the 2014 team and make an appearance in his fourth World Cup, but he was cut by U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who praised the player Thursday. ""He consistently raised the bar for himself these last 15 years, and he set a fantastic example for so many other American players to follow,"" Klinsmann said. ""As one of the best players in U.S. soccer history, Landon should be proud of everything he has accomplished."" His club coach said he leaves an unbelievable legacy. ""Landon Donovan is one of the most significant figures in the history of soccer in the United States,"" L.A. Galaxy coach and former U.S. coach Bruce Arena said Thursday. ""His influence on MLS and soccer in this country will continue to be felt for many years to come. U.S. goalie Tim Howard tweeted: ""It's been an honor."" Former U.S. great Claudio Reyna said: ""Congratulations @landondonovan It was great to see you evolve on and off the field over the last 15 years!"" Donovan has four goals and seven assists this year for the Galaxy, which has 15 matches left in the regular season. He also had the game-winning goal for the MLS all-stars in a 2-1 victory Wednesday night against Bayern Munich. He also played professionally in England and Germany. He said he played most of his career in the States to be near family and to help build MLS into a league respected worldwide. ""Landon is to MLS what Michael Jordan was to the NBA, Wayne Gretzky was to the NHL and Tiger Woods was to the PGA Tour: a player whose sporting accomplishments and popularity transformed their respective leagues and set a new standard for how the game would be played,"" MLS Commissioner Don Garber said. Donovan said part of the reason he took a sabbatical last year, including time away during the U.S World Cup qualifying campaign, was to see how he would feel about life away from soccer. He already had contemplated retiring, he said, but came back from his trip abroad rejuvenated and anxious to play on. Not everyone who helped him with the decision was pro-retirement, he said. At 32, he could still be a good player for a few more seasons. And he is walking away from the last two years of his contract, which pays him ""a lot of money,"" he said. He will be remembered most for his moments of brilliance for the Red, White and Blue. Donovan left an indelible mark on the U.S. national team and its history. Forget all the goals, assists or the hat tricks against Scotland, Ecuador and Cuba (he actually hung four on Cuba). There are reasons Donovan has earned a sort of cult fame among U.S. soccer's fan base, and fame among America's casual fans. He's one of the primary reasons fans of archrival Mexico shudder when they hear the chant ""dos a cero"" (two to zero). The most glorious dos a cero for American fans came when Donovan buried the second goal in the 2002 World Cup round of 16. His first game for the United States was against Mexico in 2000, when he was just 18. He scored. He was oh so fast and he could beat defenders one on one. If there was a penalty kick for the United States, he would bury it. He had a knack for well-placed set pieces, taking most of the U.S. free kicks for many years. ""I feel incredibly blessed and lucky to have played a role in the remarkable growth of MLS and U.S. Soccer during my playing career,"" he wrote Thursday. ""And while my career as a player will soon be over, rest assured I will stay connected on many levels to the beautiful game."" Donovan indicated he wanted to work with youth soccer players, possibly at an academy run by the Galaxy. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann says Donovan was 'fantastic example'

"(CNN) -- No one in the Netherlands will be panicking just yet but this isn't how the Dutch wanted to start their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. The Netherlands -- fresh off an uplifting third-place finish at the World Cup in Brazil -- lost their first Euro or World Cup qualifier since October 2011 after a slumping Czech Republic overcame Guus Hiddink's weakened side 2-1 in Group A thanks to an injury-time effort. It stemmed from a defensive blunder, as Daryl Janmaat's header intended for his keeper Jasper Cillessen went past Cillessen, hit the post and gave Vaclav Pilar an easy finish. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's Sweden topped the Netherlands three years ago when the visitors had already locked up first place in their Euro 2012 qualifying group but the last time the Netherlands lost a meaningful qualifier came seven years ago against Belarus. It wasn't the start Hiddink wanted in his second stint in charge as national team boss, especially after he saw his team fall 2-0 to Italy in a glamor friendly last week. Hiddink has been quizzed about formations since he took over from Louis van Gaal, though the absence of winger Arjen Robben might be the biggest reason why the Netherlands only managed four shots on target against the Czechs in Prague. Robben sparkled in Brazil, and the Netherlands' mediocre display Tuesday will strengthen claims that when he's not in the lineup, it's a different -- and less potent -- Oranje. Borek Dockal handed the Czechs, who were winless in four games and lost 1-0 to the U.S. at home last week, the lead in the 22nd minute with a fine effort off the post. Stefan de Vrij leveled in the 55th on a header and it appeared as if the teams would share the points. But in the first minute of injury time, Pilar struck to deliver the Czechs' first win over the Netherlands since a 3-2 result -- that match was a classic -- at Euro 2004. Fine start continues for Conte . The last time Italy played a competitive international, it garnered even more attention than usual. Not because of a win, but Luis Suarez's antics. Suarez bit defender Giorgio Chiellini -- an offense for which he later received a lengthy ban from FIFA -- and to rub salt into the wounds his Uruguay bundled out Italy in the group stage in Brazil. It was the second straight time Italy fell at the first hurdle at a World Cup and overshadowed the team's surprising run to the final at Euro 2012. Out went Cesare Prandelli as manager and in came the man who led Juventus to three straight league titles, Antonio Conte. Conte demands the best from his players, expects them to be disciplined and is very much into team spirit. He wants the players, too, to play with pride in an Italy shirt -- a shirt that he wore 20 times during his own career. His appointment was met with approval from the likes of Juventus and Italy legend Gianluigi Buffon, and the Azzurri duly upended the Dutch in Bari, Italy. In Conte's first competitive match as manager Tuesday, Italy ended a 77-year drought by topping Norway 2-0 in Group H. Not since 1937 had Italy triumphed in Norway. Conte didn't include striker Mario Balotelli in the squad for the two games and he was without the injured Andrea Pirlo, Giuseppe Rossi, Chiellini and Andrea Barzagli. But the squad he assembled was plenty good enough to defeat the Norwegians, who last played in a major tournament at Euro 2000. Simone Zaza of modest Sassuolo in Serie A was the star man, opening the scoring in the 16th minute with a deflected effort from a tight angle, hitting the crossbar after a burst of pace in the 77th and seeing his chip cleared off the line moments later. Leonardo Bonucci's free header in the 62nd minute accounted for the second goal. Joshua King created mild panic in and around the Italy box in the first half but wasn't a factor in the second as Italy bossed proceedings.","The Netherlands lose their first qualifier in three years after a 2-1 defeat to the Czechs .

"(CNN) -- An Oregon jury on Friday found the Boy Scouts of America liable for the sexual abuse of a 12-year-old boy more than 25 years ago, returning a verdict of $18.5 million in punitive damages. The plaintiff, Kerry Lewis, now 38, allowed his name to be used publicly during the trial, according to his attorneys. He is among six men suing the Boy Scouts over allegations of sexual abuse. Attorney Kelly Clark has said that when his clients were boys during the 1980s, the organization knew that at least one of them had been abused by former assistant Scoutmaster Timur Dykes. The 53-year-old convicted sex offender was released from prison in 2005 and paroled until 2013. He could not be reached on Friday. Clark also alleged that though the scout leader was removed, he was allowed to stay on as a volunteer and the abuse continued. In 1983, Dykes told troop leaders he abused 17 scouts, according to plaintiff's attorneys. During the six-week trial, Clark produced documents that he said were part of an archive of previously secret Boy Scout files that chronicled decades of abuse of boys. Earlier this month, jurors in Portland awarded Lewis $1.4 million after finding that the organization was negligent in allowing a Scout leader who was a sex offender to have contact with him. Under Oregon law, 60 percent of a punitive damages award goes to the state's crime victims' fund. The Boy Scouts of America did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment on Friday. However, lawyers for the organization have said it had not known about the scout leader's record. Once the Scouts did learn about it, the organization acted immediately and cooperated with police, the lawyers have said. The Boy Scouts have acknowledged the organization does have confidential files, but said they are made confidential in order to protect people who are ineligible to be scout leaders, but who may not have done anything illegal. A scouts spokesman has said that, in recent years, the organization has taken extensive measures to keep abusers out. In a written statement earlier this month, the Scouts said the organization intends to appeal the initial verdict. ""We are gravely disappointed with the verdict,"" it said. ""We believe that the allegations made against our youth protection efforts are not valid."" It added, ""We are saddened by what happened to the plaintiff. The actions of the man who committed these crimes do not represent the values and ideals of the Boy Scouts of America. ""The safety of the young people currently in the Scouting program has never been in question during these legal proceedings. The case focused on a discussion about what society and the BSA knew about child abuse approximately three decades ago. ""This is a long-standing societal issue that every youth-serving organization must address. Based on the standard of care of that time, the BSA believes it acted responsibly and that the evidence presented during the trial does not justify the verdict."" While holding the Boy Scouts of America 60 percent negligent, the jury said the Cascade Pacific Council -- which oversees Scouting activities in the region -- was 15 percent negligent and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints 25 percent negligent. The church has sponsored a number of Boy Scout troops, including the one to which the plaintiff belonged. Steve English, a lawyer representing the church, has said the verdict has no impact on the church, since it settled the case out of court more than a year ago. ""The church absolutely condemns any kind of child abuse,"" he said. ""Because of the way the law is set up in Oregon, we thought it made sense both to help the victim and also to get this behind the victim and us to settle this case.""","Kerry Lewis among six men suing the Boy Scouts over allegations of sexual abuse .

"(CNN) -- For a time Monday if you looked up the Wikipedia entry on John Brooks, this is what you'd find: . ""John Anthony Brooks, Jr. referred to as John Brooks (born January 28, 1993 in Berlin) is a German-American footballer. He is the greatest American since Abraham Lincoln."" If you hadn't heard his name before, you certainly have now: John Brooks is the 21-year-old who came in as a substitute into the USA vs Ghana game Monday, and scored a header to keep America's hope alive in the World Cup in Brazil. His 86th minute goal was sweet payback against Ghana -- a team that dashed America's hopes in the last two World Cups. Here's what you need to know about America's new hero: . He straddles two cultures . Each of Brooks' elbows sport a tattoo. On the left is an outline of Berlin, with a star marking the neighborhood he grew up in. The state of Illinois covers his right, with a star representing Chicago, his father's hometown. And while he has relatives stateside, his main attachments are in Berlin where his mother's from, he said in his U.S. Soccer video portrait. ""My mom, it's the most important person in my life."" His American father, a serviceman, has moved on to Switzerland. He is bilingual . Brooks mixes it up on Twitter and Facebook with posts in English and in German, and sometimes in both -- like the one he wrote about his nomination for the U.S. team. ""Happy to be called into the preliminary USMNT roster! Will work hard to be part of it! - Glücklich über meine Nominierung für die US Nationalmannschaft! Werde mein bestes geben um dabei zu sein!"" His video portrait on U.S. Soccer's website is heavily edited, sometimes in mid-sentence, and his German accent comes through at times, but he says he's proud to be part of the U.S. team. ""It was a big dream to come to this team. It's an honor to wear this jersey,"" he said. He made history Monday . Brooks wasn't in the starting lineup for Monday's game against nemesis Ghana. But he was called into service when Matt Besler complained of hamstring problems -- and the coach didn't want to take chances. Brooks goal was one for the record books. He's the first substitute in U.S. soccer history to score in a World Cup match. He seems to leave an impression . Just like Monday, he made a grand entrance during his first game with Hertha BSC, after the Berlin team he plays for ascended from the minors to the major league. Brooks scored a goal in his first game of the season in August. Then, he rushed to the airport to make his first U.S. national team match. He's part of a German presence on Team USA . Brooks is not the only German national soccer league player to make the jump across the Atlantic to kick for the U.S. national team. Four more have joined him on this World Cup journey on a soccer Mayflower of sorts. When Jürgen Klinsmann, a household name in German soccer, took over as U.S. coach, he went shopping for quality talent made in Germany -- with a U.S. passport. In addition to Brooks, the team boasts Jermaine Jones, Timothy Chandler, Julian Green and Fabian Johnson -- all of them U.S.-German dual nationals. This will make for a particularly interesting game next week, when the United States team faces soccer powerhouse Germany in the coastal resort town of Recife.

"(CNN) -- The man suspected of a series of sex attacks that left an Oklahoma city on edge this summer has died, authorities said, two weeks after crashing his car as he fled the scene of one of the alleged assaults. Desmond Campbell, 30, was presented with charges related to seven sex crimes last week, even though he was in a hospital bed -- unresponsive and in critical condition from the wreck, Tulsa Police Chief Chuck Jordan said. The state medical examiner's office confirmed Campbell's death to CNN Tuesday. ""We were prepared to file 23 felony crimes against him, including rape, robbery and first degree burglary,"" Assistant District Attorney for Tulsa County Steve Kunzweiler said. There were eight linked cases of sexual assault in Tulsa in June, according to police. They were initially linked through specific actions and statements the suspect made during the attacks. The victims were between 56-78 years old, except for one, who was 29. Campbell was identified as a suspect after an analysis of a ""tremendous amount of absolutely miraculous evidence collection and crime scene investigation,"" Jordan said. The speeding car he was traveling in struck a light pole on an interstate early on the morning of June 29, about 10 minutes after one of his alleged sexual assaults, Jordan said earlier this month. Campbell, who was not wearing a seat belt, suffered severe head injuries. A complete autopsy, including toxicology tests, will be performed. Results won't be available for at least six to nine weeks, the state medical examiner's office told CNN. ""The death of Mr. Campbell is not going to provide any justice to these victims in a criminal court of law. The justice he will face will come from a higher authority,"" Kunzweiler said. Campbell was released from prison in late April after convictions in Oklahoma City for attempted robbery, attempted kidnapping and robbery, and robbery with a dangerous weapon, Jordan said. He was imprisoned in 2007.","Desmond Campbell was in critical condition, unresponsive after June 29 wreck .

"(CNN) -- iReporters have a message for Richard Wright: Shine on, you crazy diamond. Jessica Schuette's tattoo reminds her of her late friend, who was a big fan of Pink Floyd. Wright, a founding member of epic rock group Pink Floyd, died Monday. The keyboardist had been battling cancer and succumbed at his home in Britain. Wright is credited with writing some of the band's most well-known hits, such as ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" and ""Us and Them."" Pink Floyd has thousands of devoted fans across the world, and the news of Wright's death inspired many of them to write into iReport to share how Richard Wright and the rest of the group touched and changed their lives. Jessica Schuette shared a photo of her Pink Floyd-inspired tattoo: a shimmering diamond above the words ""shine on."" She got the tattoo in 2005 in memory of her best friend, who died in a car accident. ""This was her favorite song. I got this tattoo to remember her,"" Schuette said. ""If that doesn't say something about the impact that this band has had on people, I don't know what will."" Pink Floyd touched the lives of Schuette and her friend even though they were never able to see one of the band's legendary live shows. Schuette, who is a dedicated Pink Floyd fan herself, pointed out that she's only 21 -- born 13 years after they released the epic album ""Dark Side of the Moon,"" and too young to have seen the band live when they were touring. iReport.com: Read more of Schuette's thoughts . Omar Pelea of Miami, Florida, hopes the tragedy of Wright's death will give Schuette and other fans their long-awaited chance to see the group live. He hopes the death will inspire the other members of Pink Floyd to begin touring again. Pink Floyd has not toured with lead singer and songwriter Roger Waters since 1981, although Rogers reunited with the band in 2005 for a concert at Live 8 in London. ""Now would be a good time for the remaining members to contemplate the fact that a reunion is running short on time,"" he said. ""There are bigger things in life than their differences. Perhaps they should put those differences aside and play for the world one last time.""

"(CNN) -- Nearly nine out of 10 U.S. adults have a cell phone -- and they're having a lot of problems with them. New research from the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that almost three-fourths of phone users experience dropped calls at least occasionally. Also, nearly 70% of U.S. cell users receive unwanted sales or marketing (""spam"") calls or text messages on their cell phone -- and for a quarter of cell users, that happens at least once a week. This occurs despite such marketing practices being restricted by federal and state law. (Recently, U.S. wireless carriers joined forces to create a centralized text-spam reporting system.) For people who use their cell phones to go online, slow data connections are an even bigger problem. Pew found that nearly eight in 10 people who access the Internet from their cell phones experience slow download speeds at least occasionally, and nearly half of cell users experience this problem at least weekly. According to comScore, currently just fewer than half of all U.S. cell phones are smartphones. Pew found that smartphone owners are more likely than those with simpler ""feature phones"" to experience these problems. For instance, 35% of smartphone owners experience dropped calls at least weekly, compared with 28% of feature phone owners. Just under 30% of smartphone owners receive spam texts at least weekly, compared with 21% of feature phone users. Many non-smartphones now come with Web browsers, e-mail service and other Internet-enabled features. Surprisingly, feature-phone users report substantially fewer problems with slow download speeds (31%) compared with smartphone owners (49%). It's possible that feature phone users may have lower expectations for download speeds, but this is a significant gap in relative user satisfaction. Pew noted, ""Non-white cell owners confront all four problems at somewhat higher weekly rates than do their white counterparts. This might be tied to the fact that African-Americans and Hispanics are more likely than whites to rely on their cell phones as their primary or exclusive phones for calling and for Internet access."" This report did not examine the incidence of poor audio quality with voice calls. But any cell phone user who grew up in the age of landlines can tell you that the sound quality of calls to and from cell phones is far worse than landline call quality was decades ago. In fact, last year, a fellow technology reporter mentioned to me that one day his wife called him at his office, and he was astounded at the clear call quality. ""Wow, are you on some fancy smartphone or an LTE (next-generation) network?"" he asked. She laughed and replied, ""No, I picked up a 1970s landline phone at a yard sale!"" It'll be interesting to see whether the rollout of faster 4G wireless carrier networks will ease the problems Pew has noted. In particular, voice over LTE (VoLTE) calling is often touted by carriers as offering increased reliability and better sound quality. But for now, those benefits are realized only when people on both ends of the call are on LTE networks. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Pew survey: Phone problems plague the nearly nine of 10 U.S. adults who have a cell phone .

"(CNN) -- To say I learn new things about London, England, every day is not an understatement. I am the chief cameraman in CNN's London bureau and have lived in London since 1996. I traveled so much for CNN the first few years that I only had a passing knowledge of the city. Then my wife and I had kids, so my knowledge became limited to mostly child-friendly pursuits. But as Samuel Johnson wrote, ""You find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave London. No, sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford."" So I think most people learn something new nearly every day. CNN.com asked me these questions about my adopted hometown: . Where can you get the best view of the city? It used to be a number of different places, but the London Eye is now the best place to go, hands down. If you can, time it so you are on it as the sun is near to setting, because you just might catch the beautiful orange sunset hitting the clouds, if the weather is just right. Which restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion? My wife, her family and I recently went to Petrus, one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, and it was excellent. I would definitely try that one again. Where is the best place to people watch? Probably Trafalgar Square. Not only can you watch people, but also there are fantastic views 360 degrees around you! What is your favorite neighborhood? Why? Chiswick. It is very green, very suburban, it has a lot of nice restaurants on the high street and like lots of London, you often see celebrities strolling down the street. Colin Firth and the artist Peter Blake, who designed the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper album cover, are two I have seen most recently. If I were to travel beyond my own area, Hampstead Heath and Greenwich are beautiful and green with lots of nice restaurants around. How do tourists stick out and what's the best way to blend in? London is so eclectic and because vast amounts of the people you will see are from somewhere else, it is hard to be tagged as a tourist. That said, if you are wearing an ""I (heart) London"" sweatshirt, a backpack or a baseball cap with a still camera in your hand and are standing on the left-hand side of the escalator at a Tube station, you are DEFINITELY a tourist! So avoid all those things and you will probably do well. Where do you go to relax? Home, on my couch. I travel too much for anywhere else to be relaxing. Other than that, maybe one of the many, many parks around London with my family. What essential thing should visitors see/experience if they only have a few hours? You can't do London in a few hours. If you have truly never been here before, the best thing to do is to get on a hop-on, hop-off open-top double-decker tourist bus to see the highlights and stop at what strikes your fancy. I would say walking from Trafalgar Square down Whitehall past Downing Street to the Houses of Parliament and then Westminster Abbey is a must. But the Tower of London is worth your time as well. You should spend all your time outside, but if it is raining, the museums in London are superior, generally free and a great way to pass several hours. What's the biggest tourist trap? Is there a ""tourist trap"" that's actually worth seeing? Probably the biggest tourist trap is Madame Tussauds. It is fun to be photographed with the wax figures, but once you have been there one time, that is usually enough, at least for me. But it is worth going to once. London Dungeon is the other tourist place I am not sure I need to ever visit again. Fun and frightening once, but not necessary beyond that. What is a good local souvenir? That is very hard to say, as everyone wants something different. I recently took a friend visiting around and she was looking for London snow globes. We found some in a souvenir shop after a long search. Where was your most memorable meal? Pont Street in Knightsbridge at a restaurant named Drones. It has since closed, but I lived over it for a few months when I first got to London. It is where I proposed to my wife, and that would be my most memorable meal. Are there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try? Probably one of the oddly named dishes like Toad in the Hole (sausages baked in Yorkshire pudding batter) or Spotted Dick (a classic English pudding) would be most appropriate, if only to take pictures of it and tell your friends back home. Barring that, I would suggest the British comfort food of mash and pie and a pint. The food in London is great, but there are some bad places to go, so don't let one bad meal make you slur the whole city.","The London Eye offers the best views of the city, CNN cameraman says .

"(CNN) -- Almost 20 years ago, Bill Watterson walked away from ""Calvin & Hobbes"" -- the wildly popular comic strip he created and illustrated from 1985 until 1995. Fans of the mischievous 6-year-old boy and his sardonic stuffed tiger have been left wanting more ever since. For the time being, they can at least take comfort in some cameo work released this week. Stephan Pastis writes ""Pearls Before Swine,"" which chronicles the lives of its main characters -- Pig, Rat, Zebra and Goat, and the dreaded Crocs. He's also a big Watterson fan. Last spring he attempted to reach the notoriously reclusive comics legend via e-mail, to no avail. Undeterred, Pastis included a ""Calvin & Hobbes"" reference in his next strip. In it, Pastis approaches a woman at a bar and uses his profession to impress a female patron. When the woman asks which strip he draws, Pastis says ""Ever heard of 'Calvin and Hobbes?'"" The two end up in bed, a thought bubble above Pastis' head says: ""That was wrong."" Shortly after that, much to Pastis' surprise, Watterson replied. ""Just getting an email from Bill Watterson is one of the most mind-blowing, surreal experiences I have ever had. Bill Watterson really exists? And he sends email? And he's communicating with me?"" Pastis wrote on his blog. Not only was Pastis in communication with him -- Watterson wanted to collaborate. The two decided that Watterson would contribute panels to three ""Pearls"" cartoons. The series of strips ran nationally this week with the premise that a small girl named 'Libby' (or 'Lib') would stand in for Pastis. According to Pastis' blog, 'Lib' is ""a precocious second grader who thought my art was crap"" and is really a cheeky inside joke. (Hint: 'Lib' is almost 'Bill' spelled backward). In the first of the three strips, 'Lib' draws two crocodiles eating Pastis. The second strip is more reminiscent of Watterson's ""Calvin & Hobbes"" days and features a ""Martian robot attack"" that could be seen as nod to Calvin's alter ego Spaceman Spiff. The third ends with Pastis asking Lib if she'll draw his comic forever. ""Nah. The art form's dying,"" she responds. According to Pastis, having the legendary Watterson draw his strip is like working with ""the Bigfoot of cartooning"" -- rare, and the highlight of his career. Millions of fans feel exactly the same way. Many took to Twitter guessing correctly that Watterson was the guest comic. Now if only we could get hold of a transmogrifier to turn this into the comeback ""Calvin & Hobbes"" fans have been longing for.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson has hailed the Champions League as the best football tournament on the planet, describing the World Cup as worse than a trip to the dentist. The Scot was replying to suggestions that Europe's top club competition was losing its appeal ahead of the English side's 3-0 win away to Turkish champions Bursaspor on Tuesday night. Critics of the UEFA-run event claim that there are too many meaningless games and mismatches in the group stage, with the real excitement not starting until the second round when two-leg knockout ties begin. ""The important thing is the Champions League has proved itself since its inception,"" two-time tournament winner Ferguson told reporters ahead of United's match against a side who have lost all four group games so far. ""It is better than the World Cup. It is unbelievable. There are some fantastic games. Yes, you have to get through the group stages before you get to the really exciting stage, but it is a fantastic tournament. ""If you look at the great teams in the European Cup now and think of the Premier League, you are not going to get the same crowd for Arsenal playing a lower team in the league, or the same tension and drama as you would Arsenal against Manchester United. ""It is the same in the Champions League. Inter Milan playing one of the smaller teams will not get the same crowd."" Champions Inter tumble at Tottenham . Ferguson was less complimentary about FIFA's World Cup, with the last staging in South Africa this year featuring several dull, poor-quality matches before finally taking off in the knockout stages. ""Have you seen the last six World Cups? It is better going to the dentist, I suppose,"" quipped the 68-year-old, who coached Scotland at the 1986 tournament in Mexico. United cruised to victory in the northwestern city of Bursa, despite resting several regular players, as goals from Darren Fletcher, young Frenchman Gabriel Obertan and Champions League debutant put the 2008 champions three points clear of Valencia in Group C. The Spanish club won 3-0 at home to Scottish champions Rangers. Wednesday night's highlight will be the clash between Group G leaders Real Madrid and AC Milan in Italy. The Spanish side, who have won the European title a record nine times, will be seeking to become the first club to score 700 goals in the competition, needing one more to reach that milestone. Coach Jose Mourinho has left France midfielder Lassana Diarra out of his 21-man squad, but young Spanish defender David Mateos returns. Milan trail Real by five points after losing 2-0 in the Bernabeu two weeks ago, and come into the match following Saturday's 3-1 defeat by Italian Serie A rivals Juventus. ""We're going to be more careful tomorrow,"" coach Massimiliano Allegri told reporters on Tuesday. ""In Madrid we started the game a bit frightened and made a lot of mistakes. We mustn't play like that again. ""Milan traditionally look to win by playing a good brand of football. We'll have to take to the field light-hearted and aware of our strength and technical quality. A united group ready to defend can allow its strikers to be decisive.""","Alex Ferguson defends Champions League from accusations competition has lost appeal .

"(CNN) -- Development in Bahrain has not been slow. In half a century, the small Gulf Island has grown from a hilly, desert landscape with 143,000 inhabitants to an overcrowded metropolis of 1.2 million residents. The most striking change, however, has been topographical. Up until the 1960s, the country boasted the world's largest collection of prehistoric burial mounds -- an archaeological wonder left over from the 4,000-year-old Dilmun civilization. In the decades that followed, 90% of these funerary hills fell victim to housing and infrastructure pressure, and were demolished to make room for causeways and residential estates. ""It's a really important archive,"" notes Steffen Laursen, an archaeologist with the Moesgaard Museum who has been excavating a collection referred to as the ""royal"" mounds in the northern district of A'ali. The royal mounds are so called because of their stature -- many measure 40 feet in height. The entombed, however, ranged from community leaders to the heads of commercial dynasties. Aside from the sheer breadth of mounds -- at their peak they numbered 76,000 -- their importance rests in their age, rarity and what they reveal about ancient society. Laursen has found that that the oldest mounds date from 2050 BC, when Dilmun (the name the Sumerians used to refer to the country) was little more than a collection of tribes, to 1750 BC, by which time it had morphed into an economic powerhouse in the region. Read more: Mysterious structure found at bottom of ancient lake . ""People's lives and the development of their society are frozen in these cemeteries in a way you don't see anywhere else. I see them as a unique laboratory for the study of social improvements. It's really an important archive,"" he says. Unfortunately, the mounds have for decades been at odds with development in the country. Bahrain is only 760 square kilometers yet it has the third highest population density in the world. ""There is huge pressure to build houses for the expanding population. It's an issue that's probably present in other counties, but it's exacerbated in Bahrain because of how little land is available,"" says Robert Killick, an archaeologist who in the 1990s led excavations of a settlement near the burial field at Saar in the northwest. Killick remembers leaving the site only to return and find a set of particularly impressive mounds bulldozed by a private developer. ""Bahrain's archeology department was able to carry out a little rescue work, but it was minimal, and over a very short time span,"" he recalls.""Now, it's a wasteland of flattened land with half-built houses on it."" Britta Rudolff, the managing director at Think Heritage!, an organization working with the Ministry of Culture to secure heritage status, points out that the sheer percentage of land the mounds covered makes preservation a thorny, and at times unfeasible prospect. ""Housing is a strong need here. There are a good number of young families looking for flats, who in the meantime are forced to live with their parents. The need for development and the use of cultural resources needs to be balanced in a useful way,"" she says. In the last five years, however, there's been a push by Bahrain's Ministry of Culture to better preserve the country's national treasures. Video: Reviving 'lost' Ottoman cuisine . ""Bahrain feels a huge responsibility to preserve the remaining mounds, and to transfer them to future generations,"" says Rudolff, who estimates that should UNESCO approve their petition, the mounds should be granted protection by 2016.

""It's really too little, too late,"" says Killick. ""When I worked in Bahrain in the 1990s and saw what happened to the burial field at Saar, I thought, in 20 years, Bahrain will be concrete from one side of the island to the other.

"(CNN) -- Bringing together an army of creative writers, photographers and illustrators from all around Africa and beyond, Cameroonian journalist Ntone Edjabe has set up an exciting media platform that mixes culture and politics to present an unconventional portrayal of the continent. Dubbed Chimurenga, which means ""revolutionary struggle"" in Zimbabwe's Shona language, Edjabe's creation is an award-winning, pan African literary magazine that addresses and embraces the continent's diversity, with a focus on ""the complexity of life."" ""Discourse on Africa is geared towards simplicity,"" explains Edjabe. ""Everything must be simple, 'he's a poor black man, he's a victim,' like there has to be a simple story, in a way this is what signifies Africa and global consciousness,"" he adds. ""The moment you bring a degree of complexity to it, it kind of throws people off, they just don't know where to look anymore, it's like, 'what's going on?' So Chimurenga in a way does not try to maintain the superficiality of this narrative -- we engage with life, we try to present life as complex as it really is."" The pages of the literary magazine, which has more than 100 contributors, offer its readers a variety of thoughtful content, ranging from in-depth investigation stories and analyses to poetry and photographic essays. The journal is available online, while hard copies are distributed throughout Africa, Europe, the United States and India. Read more: Bringing joy to refugees with dance . Chimurenga, which was first published in 2002, is produced roughly once a year, only when there are available funds to do so. The only constants are its provocative content, its creative packaging and, to many, its refreshing reflection of all things African. It was recently described by a writer in the UK's Financial Times as ""better than The New Yorker."" ""There's a feeling about writing something, sharing something that is beautiful and truthful from one's perspective, of course, and important, urgent almost that we demand from the contributors,"" says Edjabe. ""We ask them to put themselves on the line, so to speak, as if it really matters -- not for the check that may arrive or may not, but because he matters and because he cares about what he's writing, whether it's music, boxing, theory, analysis, does matter, to them at least."" Chimurenga recently received a much needed cash injection after winning the prestigious Prince Claus Award, given annually to individuals, groups and organizations for their outstanding achievements in the field of culture and development. The judges praised it for challenging established ideas and stimulating pan-African culture with intellect, freedom and diversity. For a publication whose survival is wholly dependent on funding, the 100,000 euro prize money was a welcome bonus. ""I take that of course with great honor,"" says Edjabe. ""I also take the check that comes with it because it's very useful to be able to plan a little bit ahead. But ... we're trying to develop our own measuring stick for excellence -- at the moment this kind of validation, and we appreciate it and we take it, we're part of a world, but it's very important that we develop our own measure for excellence."" Read more: Spreading African spirit through song . Born in Douala, Cameroon, Edjabe moved to Lagos, Nigeria to study before arriving in South Africa on the eve of democracy in 1993. Three years later he established in Cape Town the Pan African Market, a cultural center for African immigrants. More recently, Edjabe, who is also a DJ, created the Pan African Space Station, a music platform that brings together diverse African genres both online and in venues across the continent. Its radio station PASS streams music, shows and interviews live around the clock. Edjabe believes firmly that music cannot be divorced from politics. ""At some point music was a vehicle recognized by people for ideas, for subversive ideas, for revolutionary ideas, it wasn't just produced for entertainment, it had a very important role in the struggle,"" he says. ""In this country, that's very well known, how not just music, but creativity as a whole, arts as a whole, was used as a tool for liberation."" South Africa's struggle and transition from apartheid to democracy are often a central theme in Edjabe's Chimurenga. The magazine also takes a critical look at the country's relationship with the rest of continent. Its latest edition is fashioned as a back-dated newspaper -- a mock-up of a May 2008 broadsheet, addressing that month's unforgettable events in South Africa. Read more: S. Africa's dean teaches reconciliation . A series of attacks on migrants from other parts of the continent, left 62 people dead as South Africans turned on their fellow Africans creating an explosion of xenophobic violence. As an African who's lived away from home for decades now, this is a topic close to Edjabe's heart. He says it was important to re-tell the story to fill the historical gaps while re-examining the context and complexity of xenophobic violence. ""I think that the raw emotion that brings about this kind of violence to turn against your neighbor is more than what's written on a piece of paper and I feel that that sentiment, what ever it is and whatever brings it about, I think it is still there,"" says Edjabe.","Cameroonian Ntone Edjabe is the founder of the pan-African magazine Chimurenga .

"(CNN) -- It was supposed to be something of a homecoming for Eugenie Bouchard, but the 20-year-old's return to Montreal for the WTA Rogers Cup only ended in disappointment. The Canadian has so far enjoyed a season to remember, making the last four at both the Australian and French Opens, before reaching a maiden grand slam final at Wimbledon in July, losing out to Petra Kvitova. Yet the world No. 8 was unable to replicate that success in front of an expectant home crowd Tuesday in a second-round clash against American qualifier Shelby Rogers. Playing for the first time since her defeat at the All England Lawn Tennis Club, Bouchard found herself on the losing end once again, going down 6-0 2-6 6-0. Rogers -- a runner-up at the WTA event in Bad Gastein, Austria last month -- surprised her opponent, and the crowd, by storming towards the first set, producing seven winners along the way. And the 21-year-old then showed her nerve to take the third in style after Bouchard had earlier threatened to rein her back in by securing the second. ""This was my first experience in an atmosphere like this -- the whole stadium cheering for one person,"" Rogers, the world No. 113, is quoted as saying by the WTA's official website. ""I really respect what [Bouchard's] done. It's incredible to see how much support she has."" Bouchard, meanwhile, was disappointed to lose a match in her hometown, but took some satisfaction from the way she performed in the second set. ""I think I was feeling the pressure a little bit on the court -- I felt a little match rusty, kind of,"" she is quoted as saying by the WTA's official website. ""But I knew coming into the match that I can't use those as excuses. ""I knew it would be kind of a difficult situation. But I'm happy I was able to at least prove to myself that I could turn things around and not let the match run away from me completely. That's definitely a positive from the match."" The Canadian added on her opponent: ""She was solid the whole match -- she never really sprayed too many balls, and she was always there. Whenever I let up a little bit, which I think I did in the third, she was all over it."" Elsewhere, in the men's edition of the Rogers Cup -- taking place in Toronto -- Roger Federer needed just 52 minutes to advance to the third round of the competition Tuesday. The second seed, playing in his first match since his final defeat to Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon last month, eased past Canada's Peter Polansky 6-2 6-0.","Eugenie Bouchard knocked out of WTA Rogers Cup by Shelby Rogers .

"(CNN) -- Barely 120 years old, Johannesburg is suffering from growing pains as it goes through an awkward adolescence. Johannesburg is a city built on gold. It's a city still trying to recover from the injustices of apartheid and if progress can sometimes seem slow, it's worth remembering that it's only been 15 years since apartheid was finally laid to rest. Rebuilding will take time, but Johannesburg is a pragmatic city. Its endless urban sprawl won't win any beauty contests but this place has always been more about economics than aesthetics. That's because Jo' burg is a city built on gold. The metropolis was nothing but grassy farmland until prospectors struck gold a few kilometers away in 1886. Its once-abundant gold reserves helped Jo' burg grow into the largest city in South Africa and become the capital of the province of Gauteng -- a Sotho word meaning ""place of gold."" Watch Hugh Masekela take CNN on a tour of Johannesburg » . While modern day Jo' burgers prefer to look to the future, it will be a long time before the city shakes off the memories of its troubled past. Places like Soweto -- the township that was the site of the 1976 uprisings that marked the beginning of the end of white rule -- will always be associated with apartheid. Conditions in Soweto are still tough and townships like Alexandra remain desperately poor. It's true that Jo' burg has a growing black middle class, but it also has a growing divide between its haves and have-nots. After South Africa's first democratic elections in 1994 Johannesburg experienced a new, unofficial apartheid as businesses moved away from downtown to the city's wealthier, whiter, northern suburbs, leaving the city center a shadow of its once dynamic self. But things are changing. Numerous urban development projects, many intended to ready the city for the 2010 World Cup, are reinvigorating the heart of Jo' burg. The city is getting an extensive new bus system, and the much-touted Gautrain is a high-speed train line that will link Jo' burg and Pretoria. The Newtown area is growing as a cultural center, with art galleries, theaters and dance venues, and Constitution Hill, once the site of a prison that held Mahatma Gandhi and later Nelson Mandela, has been converted into the country's highest law court and a tourist attraction, with exhibitions dedicated to its unsavory past. The most cosmopolitan city in Africa, Jo' burg has always been thoroughly multicultural, but a wave of xenophobic attacks in May 2008 highlighted the tension between locals and the huge number of African immigrants who have moved to the city, attracted by its relative economic vigor. The violence did nothing to help the city's international reputation. Where Jo' burg was once associated with apartheid, it has now become associated with crime. Lurid tales of carjacking and daylight mugging have created an image of a lawless sin city, but although places like Hillbrow remain no-go areas at night, progress is being made in the war on crime. Nonetheless, the fear of crime remains potent and Jo' burg's future as a tourist destination depends on addressing the problem. If Jo' burg is a work in progress there's no doubt that much remains to be done, but it's a young city with a young population eager to take the opportunities past generations were denied. The eyes of the world will be on South Africa in summer 2010 and Jo' burgers are keen to use the World Cup to demonstrate how far their city has come and to show the world that the future is bright for the city of gold at the heart of the rainbow nation.","Johannesburg is a young city, still recovering from the injustices of apartheid .

"(CNN) -- Artist Jae Rhim Lee walked on stage at the TED Global conference in July wearing a body-hugging black and white suit she jokingly called ""ninja pajamas."" She realized the subject she wanted to talk about was unusual: ""All right, so for some of you, this may be really, really out there,"" she told the audience in Edinburgh, UK. When people laughed, she added, ""Just a little."" In reality, her Infinity Burial Project is not a laughing matter. The ""ninja pajamas"" are intended to serve as a ""mushroom death suit,"" a medium embedded with mushroom spores that would speed the decomposition of the human body after death. Lee's project starts with the observation that the human body harbors toxic chemicals that could contribute to pollution through burial or cremation. She points out that a study found the chemical Bisphenol A in 93% of people aged six and older. The CDC tracks 219 environmental chemicals in human bodies, including, she said, ""preservatives, pesticides and heavy metals like lead and mercury."" The lessons? One is ""don't become a cannibal."" More seriously, she said, burial can spread toxins present in the body, and can further harm the environment through cosmetics and other chemicals used to prepare corpses for funerals. ""Green or natural burials, which don't use embalming, are a step in the right direction, but they don't address the existing toxins in our bodies,"" she said. ""I think there's a better solution."" TED.com: Six ways mushrooms can save the world . Lee, a 2011 TED Global Fellow, studied at MIT and Wellesley College, and her work has been exhibited in the U.S. and Europe. Before taking on the burial project, she led the MIT FEMA Trailer Project, which studied the trailers used by the federal disaster agency in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Her team turned a surplus FEMA trailer, which they dubbed the Armadillo, into an environmental demonstration project for composting, water recycling and other ""green"" activities.

""As the mushrooms grow, I pick the best feeders to become Infinity Mushrooms. It's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process for the afterlife. So when I die, the Infinity Mushrooms will recognize my body and be able to eat it."" ""I realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food,"" Lee said. ""We want to eat, not be eaten by, our food. But as I watch the mushrooms grow and digest my body, I imagine the Infinity Mushroom as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death and the relationship between my body and the environment. ... ""It's a step towards accepting the fact that someday I will die and decay. It's also a step towards taking responsibility for my own burden on the planet. ...

"Phnom Penh, Cambodia (CNN) -- During the Khmer Rouge regime, I was put in prison at the age of 15 for picking mushrooms in the rice fields to feed my pregnant sister. Under the Khmer Rouge, everything belonged to the Revolution — and picking up anything from the ground without their permission was a crime. For several hours in front of about one hundred villagers, the Khmer Rouge publicly tortured me. I did not cry, because I was told not to. Then, they put me in prison. Months later, after running out of lies to tell the prison chief while begging for my life, one of the older prisoners stepped forward and pleaded to the prison chief on my behalf. Surprisingly, the prison chief agreed and I was released. I came to learn much later, however, that in exchange for me, they killed him. My experience is a mere footnote to the millions of other Cambodians who suffered and died at the hands of this regime, but it is illustrative of the ongoing struggle to find justice and closure. 35 years on, top Khmer Rouge leaders face justice in Cambodia . Trial 'will not bring back the dead' When the verdict is announced in the first trial of the Khmer Rouge tribunal's second case, there will be no winners and no cause for celebration. While the occasion marks an enormous achievement in Cambodia and the international community's long struggle to assert the primacy of human rights, peace, and the rule of law, it is a victory that can only be marked with somber contemplation. We have come a long way in forging an international system to meet the challenge of responding to and punishing mass atrocities, but judgments do not bring back the dead or restore trust. No action can assuage the anguish, sadness, and regret that haunts the survivors to this day. Over 35 years after the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime, we still see the effects from this period in almost every facet of Cambodian society. From physical scars and disabilities, to trauma and psychosocial conditions, the horrors of this period continue to manifest themselves in survivors, families, communities and institutions. Suffering under the Khmer Rouge . Many estimates found that more than a million people died under the Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1979 from execution, disease, starvation and overwork. See places where Cambodia's shocking past is on show . Like many families, my mother, my deaf sister, Keo Kolthida Ekkasakh, and I, all suffered under the Khmer Rouge. And my mother lost all three of her brothers, one sister, one daughter and many grandchildren under the regime. Nearly 60 of our family members are still missing today. Society is still divided, and the memories of this period— even memories of kindness — carry a heavy burden. I will never forget the kind act of the man in prison. I do not even know the name of the man who saved my life. I have been searching for his family members for years, in the hope that I can pay my respect for the courage and kindness he showed me. 'Too little, too late' Achieving true justice in these circumstances is an impossible feat for mankind, and an altogether late endeavor at best. Time and again, the international community has watched mass atrocities, genocide, and other heinous crimes proceed unchecked. INTERACTIVE: Five faces of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge . While our efforts in applying due process in the punishment of genocide and mass atrocities deserve recognition and respect, we should not overlook the paramount need for preventing such crimes before they occur. Prevention must be the watchword in defining our struggle, and our struggle against evil must begin with courage. We must have the courage to call out inhumanity when it occurs and take steps that prevent such crimes, rather than responding to their aftermath. We must seize the opportunity to stand up for what is right, no matter the circumstance, because we know that saving millions of lives today speaks far greater for our civilization than issuing verdicts tomorrow. This verdict regarding the two senior Khmer Rouge leaders matters a great deal to me, as should it for all Cambodians, because it gives some closure -- but closure is too little, too late for many. If only the international community would exercise the courage and resolve as the man in prison did for me, the world would need fewer verdicts.

"(CNN) -- The world's biggest airport project received a boost this week as the ruler of Dubai announced a multi-billion dollar expansion to the city's second airport. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum approved a $32 billion plan to continue development of the eponymous Al Maktoum International Airport at Dubai World Central. The airport opened its doors to passengers last year but will be beefed up to ultimately accommodate over 200 million passengers per year and 12 million tons of cargo. The first phase will include the construction of two new satellite buildings with a capacity of 120 million passengers annually and the ability to host 100 Airbus A380 aircraft at any one time. Emirates, the flag-carrier of Dubai, is Airbus' largest operator of the superjumbo. It has a current fleet of 52, with 90 more on order. The first phase of expansion is expected to be completed within six to eight years. The entire development will cover 56 square kilometers. Currently over half of passengers flying to Dubai are connecting to other destinations and the new airport will build a system of automated trains and people movers to ferry people between gates. The two terminals will be served by three runways while the airport's master plan has space to add two more. The growth of the airport to the south-west of the city center ties in with the greater development of Dubai World Central that will include residential and leisure facilities. It will also be the site of Dubai's World Expo in 2020. Paul Griffiths, CEO of Dubai Airports described the expansion as a ""strong endorsement of Dubai's aviation industry,"" and indicated the days of the Emirate's current hub, Dubai International Airport (DXB), are numbered. Passenger numbers there are expected to reach 100 million by 2020 -- since its inception it passenger numbers have grown an average of 15% per year. However the airport has little space to expand. ""Our future lies at DWC (Al Maktoum International Airport),"" said Griffiths. ""We are taking that next step to securing our future by building a brand new airport that will not only create the capacity we need in the coming decades but also provide state of the art facilities that revolutionize the airport experience."" As well as packing in the passengers, the expanded airport (and its construction) is set to support 322,000 jobs and contribute 28% to Dubai's GDP, according to Dubai Airports. Elsewhere in the region, other airports are being supersized. Qatar's Doha Hamad International Airport opened earlier this year with the world's second longest runway, while Abu Dhabi is upgrading its facilities in a $6.8 billion project set to be complete in 2017.

"(CNN) -- A radio host pointed it out to me on my book tour, with alarm: a chapter in my new book -- written three years ago about my president, Goodluck Jonathan, and his handling of Boko Haram, terror and insecurity in Nigeria -- could have been written today, almost word for word. ""The truth is that I don't feel safe,"" I wrote in ""Searching for a Vote of Confidence."" ""I, like many others living in Nigeria, will myself to feel safe, knowing I must take the risk and get onto the roads each day; we have no choice. But when it comes to the meat of it, you cannot possibly, really feel safe. Children have been kidnapped; average Nigerians' parents, ""big men"" (the elite), ""oyinbos"" (foreigners), and celebrities -- from the forbidding Pete Edochie to the clownish Mr. Ibu -- have been kidnapped; government officials have been kidnapped, and now youth corps members have been kidnapped."" Three years later, it hasn't gotten even the slightest inch better. On 14 April 2014, it happened again -- like Nigeria had never seen before. More than 200 girls were taken from school in the dead of night, by deadly terrorists with Boko Haram, in Chibok, northeastern Nigeria. It is more than two months later and we are desperate with hopelessness; we don't know when the girls will be back or, to hear a former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, tell it, if they will be back at all. According to a New York Times report, the Nigerian military is (and it hurts deeply to see this) rendered incompetent based on a collage of factors including corruption, lack of modern training, inadequate equipment and vanished morale. The Nigerian government, which is responsible for this state of affairs, has sadly shown no public will to focus on this matter until the girls are brought home. First, the president and his men were silent after the kidnap, for about two weeks, until Nigerians took to the streets, and the world paid attention. Next, it engaged in a shameful back and forth with the equally disappointing governor of Borno, the state from which the girls were kidnapped. Not done, it turned against its own citizens for shaming it into action. First, it asked protesters, with dripping disdain, to take their protests to the terrorists. Then it claimed a #BringBackOurGirls protest had been hijacked by the opposition party. When all of these threats failed, it moved into action. There have been accusations that government buses took touts to disrupt peaceful protests demanding better; the police commissioner in charge of Abuja -- forgetting briefly that the military left in 1999, apparently banned public protest -- although he later denied there was a ban. One of the president's advisers has given himself to farce, branding the informal head of the protests Obiageli Ezekwesili -- who co-founded Transparency International, was vice president of the World Bank's Africa division and has heroically given her life to this cause -- as ""an opportunist who profits from national tragedy."" While all of this is going on, Boko Haram continues to brazenly terrorize Nigerians. On June 18 Boko Haram was reported to have abducted 60 females, including children, and killed 30 men in a raid on a village in northeastern Nigeria. And just as this piece is filed, reports come in of another explosion -- the third this year -- in Abuja, the nation's capital, taking the lives of at least 21 people. We are, clearly, on our own. You hear Nigerian intellectuals say all the time -- sometimes with irritating smugness -- that Chinua Achebe's seminal ""The Trouble With Nigeria,"" written in 1987 when I was two, could have been written today and every word would yet be relevant. They are sadly right. ""The trouble with Nigeria is simply and squarely a failure of leadership,"" Achebe wrote in the book. That much is true about the kidnapped Chibok Girls. This is why citizens have refused to let #BringBackOurGirls die, more than two months after. That is why the hashtag continues to dominate conversation, protesters have refused to leave the streets, and why this is almost surely going to be an election issue. From the opposition government of Borno to the ruling government at the center, citizens will be asking why Nigerians should be punished with incompetent, thoughtless leaders who choose politics over effectiveness, pettiness over responsibility. The problem starts from our president. We really have to ask Goodluck Jonathan what he's up to, I wrote those three years ago. It is very difficult to look at our state of affairs at the moment and deliver a vote of confidence. Officials will have us believe everything is being done behind the scenes -- but governance is not a matter of faith. It is a matter of facts. We can't simply trust that the president has good intentions and knows what he is doing. Government must be seen to be working. A people cannot simply have faith in their government; the government must earn the trust of its people. A leader cannot afford to amble on, assured in his sense of destiny, without giving the followers that same sense of confidence. It is a leader's duty to lead. If our kidnapped girls are not home yet, do not be deceived; it is not a question solely of international terrorism or porous borders. Nigeria's problems go deeper than that -- we are cursed with leaders who cannot see beyond their noses, captains with no capacity for vision. On #BringBackOurGirls, Nigerians desperately need their leaders to lead. They will have no peace until they do. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Chude Jideonwo.","Nigeria ""desperate with hopelessness"" over kidnapped girls, says Chude Jideonwo .

"Carrabassett Valley, Maine (CNN) -- Several ski-lift riders fell to the ground and others were trapped in the air Tuesday when a lift a broke down at Sugarloaf Ski Resort in Maine. Before the accident, high winds had delayed the opening of the lift. Conditions at the time of the accident were windy, but not unusually so following a major snowstorm, a spokesman for the resort said. More than 200 people were trapped up to 90 minutes and as many as nine were injured, officials said. Ethan Austin, a spokesman for the resort, said the derailment on one tower of the Spillway East lift happened around 10:30 a.m. ET, when lift's cable skipped over the edge of a pulley. Five of the lift's chairs fell 25 to 30 feet and hit the ground, he said. ""The chairs were pretty mangled, but the ski patrol was there right away,"" patron Ben Martin told CNN affiliate WCSH. Winds had diminished by midmorning and resort personnel checked the lift prior to opening, Sugarloaf said in a statement. Austin said conditions were basically what is expected after a major storm. The rescue operation was completed around noon. The lift will remain closed until the preliminary investigation is completed and it is cleared by the state to resume operation, the resort said. Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington, Maine, was treating eight patients, according to spokeswoman Jill Gray. She could not provide the nature of the injuries or the conditions of the patients. A ninth person originally was taken by ambulance to Franklin Memorial, but that person had to be taken by helicopter to Maine Medical Center in Portland, Gray said. Sugarloaf said seven people were injured. Robb Atkinson, a CNN employee who initially was trapped on the lift, said he saw skiers fall from the lift when it came to an abrupt stop during high winds. ""I felt a jerk,"" said Atkinson, who was riding the lift with his wife. He also described hearing ""screams from skiers below"" as he watched at least three chairs drop 20 to 30 feet to the ground. Matt Rolfson, 17, of Albion, Maine, was on a parallel lift with a friend and shot video from his helmet cam of injured skiers. ""People on the lift yelled to see if everyone was OK,"" said Rolfson, adding a portion of the Spillway East line did a ""yo-yo."" He told CNN his lift was unaffected and he skied down later to offer assistance. High winds were gusting between 30 mph and 50 mph in the area at the time, according to CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras, and temperatures at the resort were well below freezing. Austin said Tuesday afternoon there were an estimated 220 people on the more than 100 chairs on the lift, and the process of evacuating everyone from the chairs dangling above the resort was under way. ""You had to slide off the chair lift 40 feet off the ground into a swing,"" Atkinson said. After that, skiers were lowered down to the ground and had to ski to the base of the mountain, he said. Franklin County Emergency officials contacted Gov. John Baldacci with updates on the incident and subsequent rescues, according to David Farmer, Baldacci's deputy chief of staff. ""It's extremely unusual,"" Austin said. Sugarloaf has never had a lift derailment of this nature in its 60-year history, he added. The cause of the accident was under investigation. ""We're deeply concerned about those who were injured,"" said Austin, ""and we're committed to understanding the cause of this incident. We want our guests to have fun, but our first priority is their safety."" Two inspectors with the Maine Safety Board were sent to Sugarloaf to investigate, said Farmer. The probe is ""protocol for any accident where the state government oversees certification of a ski resort,"" he added. The resort is located about 100 miles north of Portland, Maine. Atkinson and Rolfson said patrons were excited about up to two feet of new snow on the slopes. Both will be back at Sugarloaf on Wednesday. CNN's Alta Spells, Justin Lear and Phil Gast contributed to this report.","The lift will remain closed pending outcome of investigation .

"(CNN) -- Anyone can shake hands. Nelson Mandela made such a common gesture something transcendent -- a greeting that crossed all societal barriers, a symbol of reconciliation, even a declaration of victory. ""Hello! How are you? I'm so happy to see you,"" he would declare in his distinctive tenor, extending a huge right hand befitting the former boxer. Before meeting visiting dignitaries or political adversaries in five-star hotel conference rooms, Mandela made sure to approach the security guards, servers and other workers outside to shake their hands. At countless rallies of his African National Congress, crowds mobbed his path in hopes of a quick clasp from the graying leader. ""I want to put you in my pocket and take you home,"" he would tell them. Such was his common touch, a personal warmth and accessibility that delighted adoring supporters and cemented global admiration for the longtime political prisoner who became South Africa's first black president. 'Our nation has lost its greatest son' To me, a journalist who covered the ""Mandela years"" from a few months after his release from prison in 1990 through most of his presidency, he was the closest thing to a messiah I have witnessed, if you define messiah as one who brings hope to the hopeless. Tall and trim, his face often beaming an incandescent smile, Mandela had his own style expressed in colorful African shirts he wore in lieu of business suits, a teasing rapport with youngsters, and his shoulder-swinging, celebratory dance dubbed the ""Madiba shuffle"" in reference to his clan name. Leading a transformation . Wherever he went, people seemed to materialize out of the air -- scampering down alleys and around cars, scrambling over and through fences, even climbing any nearby tree or billboard for a better view. The mood was festive, not frenzied, with crowds singing praise songs in deep-voiced harmonies that elongated the second syllable of his name in an African pronunciation -- Mon-DAY-la. A lawyer of tribal royalty heritage, he possessed an unerring sense of his role as the nation's de facto leader at a time when the ANC struggled to evolve from a liberation movement to a full-fledged political party. Images of him during those years create an indelible timeline of the nation's transformation from the white rule of apartheid to a multiracial democracy. Nelson Mandela: The miracle years . There was the fist-waving, smiling Mandela who walked out of prison in 1990, his every move and word broadcast around the world as well as on national television that once banned black faces. From that moment, the machinations of South African politics changed, and the new order became obvious when the nation's first multiparty political talks began in December 1991. Watershed moments . Opening speeches by Mandela and other leaders were generally non-combative policy statements until South African President F. W. de Klerk, exercising his privilege to go last, attacked the ANC for refusing to disband its armed wing and turn over weapons. Visibly furious at de Klerk's maneuver, Mandela requested an opportunity to respond and the sympathetic moderators agreed. That alone was a shift from the old days. With the meeting hall spellbound, Mandela delivered a face-to-face upbraiding of the white president, telling de Klerk that ""even a discredited, illegitimate, minority regime must observe certain moral standards."" No one had ever witnessed such a thing in South Africa. Less visible were his efforts to control radical elements of his ANC. At the party's first legal conference in South Africa in December 1990, he lectured activists calling for a halt in secret talks between ANC leaders and the white government aimed at setting up formal negotiations. ''These statements can only be made by those who do not understand the process of negotiation,"" Mandela said in a stern voice. ""... Let me take advantage of this opportunity to educate you on the problems that face the leadership.'' After the 1993 assassination of Chris Hani, a popular communist firebrand considered a possible future ANC leader, Mandela appeared on state-run national television to urge calm among his black supporters. It was an unprecedented acknowledgement by the white government that the ANC leader was the only one who could head off potentially calamitous unrest. ""This is a watershed moment for all of us,"" he said directly to the camera. ""Our decisions and actions will determine whether we use our pain, our grief and our outrage to move forward to what is the only lasting solution for our country - an elected government of the people, by the people and for the people."" Brazile: Nelson Mandela's legacy will live on . Mandela also had a humorous side, even flirtatious at times. At election rallies in 1994, he repeatedly elicited trilling howls of ululation from women of all ages when he explained how voters should search their ballots for the picture of the ""very handsome young man"" -- referring to himself -- to mark their support for the ANC. For the lone debate of the campaign between Mandela and de Klerk, I watched on a communal television at the YWCA in Soweto to write about the reaction of teenagers in the vast black township. One handshake held a nation spellbound . As expected, they cheered each time Mandela spoke, but my lasting memory was how these young black South Africans seemed transfixed by the mere image of their leader sharing the screen with equal status to the white president. They went wild when Mandela concluded his final statement by offering his hand to de Klerk as an expression of unity, saying that despite their differences, he was willing to work with his adversary. De Klerk had little choice but to grasp it. Mandela's handshake could have another meaning. At his divorce trial in 1996, he testified in withering detail how his spouse, the popular activist Winnie Mandela, never once shared his bed while he was awake after his release from prison. ""The bedroom is where a man and woman discuss the most intimate details,"" Mandela told the court. ""There were so many things I wanted to discuss with her, but she is the type of person who fears confrontation. I was the loneliest man during the period I stayed with her."" When he finished, Mandela approached his soon to be ex-wife and shook her hand, having destroyed any chance she had of gaining a favorable settlement. I experienced many Mandela handshakes, mostly before news conferences or interviews in the usual exchange of pleasantries between political figures and journalists. Some are captured in photos that will always be prized possessions. One that was not photographed occurred after a public dressing down from the president at a Foreign Correspondents Association dinner in 1996. During the question period after Mandela spoke, I asked about his recent criticism of the South African media as biased against the ANC. Was he trying to intimidate newspapers, I wondered, or seeking to shift attention from his government's struggle to deliver promised development to poor blacks. In an angry voice, he berated the foreign media for failing to report on what he called unfair treatment the ANC received from South African newspapers. ""Why are you defending them?"" he asked of the room stunned to silence. As he left the event shortly afterward, he made his way past my table where he stopped and reached out his hand, looking me in the eye. With no words spoken, we exchanged a single, slightly pronounced shake. Another victory for his ANC secured, he headed to the exit.","Before meeting visiting dignitaries Mandela made sure to shake hands with workers .

"(CNN) -- Google, Yahoo, LinkedIn and Facebook have all released their workforce diversity reports in the past few weeks. These reports have sparked much hand-wringing about the low number of African-Americans and Latinos who are working in Silicon Valley tech companies. We expect to see a tide of more reports, illustrating a dismal situation needing attention. But, too often, stunned commentators overlook a simple fact: This problem is fixable. Tech companies need more workers, and African-American and Latino communities need more work. Silicon Valley has an insatiable demand for genius. Communities of color have an untapped supply of it. Putting aside any blaming or shaming, tech leaders and communities of color could greatly benefit by coming together -- to ensure that America stops wasting so much genius. Neither Silicon Valley nor low-opportunity communities can afford it anymore. For instance: 70% of ""Googlers"" are men, 30% women; 61% are white and 30% are Asian. Blacks and Hispanics? Only 2% and 3%, respectively. Google's May 2014 report could best be summed up with the company's own words: ""We're not where we want to be."" These reports have their place. But let us first keep in mind: As important as transparency is, simply releasing these numbers won't solve the problem. In fact, Intel, one of the world's largest tech companies, has been openly sharing its diversity stats for the past decade -- and should be applauded for doing so. And yet the company still struggles with hiring minority talent. Only one thing will make a difference: a job-training pipeline specifically designed to identify, recruit and train talented people from nontraditional backgrounds and low-opportunity communities. Black Girls CODE hosts its first hackathon . Imagine, if you will, a promising black or Latino child, sitting behind a public school desk in East Oakland. That youth is seated just half an hour's drive from Silicon Valley. But it would take something like a miracle for that child to ever find her way into a coding education program, let alone an internship or job at the world's most famous tech companies, right down the road. We need to fix this -- and we can. We won't have to start from scratch. Many grass-roots educational organizations are already working to solve this problem. They are inventing and pioneering powerful new models to bring coding education to new constituencies. Unfortunately, none has reached the necessary scale. America desperately needs an efficient solution for diversifying talent in the tech sector. If existing programs could work together in smart ways, with the best ones getting support to scale up dramatically, we could create a process that would pull extraordinary talent out of unlikely places, like Oakland, or East Los Angeles, or a Native American reservation, or, for that matter, Appalachia. One effort to create those synergies and build that pipeline is called #YesWeCode, an initiative I helped start. Our goal is to help grass-roots groups train 100,000 low-opportunity youth to become high-level computer coders. Here is how we're doing it: . Exposure: First, #YesWeCode, with the help of Facebook, is creating an online platform to unite more than 70 tech-training organizations, so young people can easily and conveniently connect to coding education programs. Training: Second, we are investing in workforce development programs that target people who wouldn't normally have access or the opportunity to enter careers in tech. Our model includes ""boot camps"" and accelerated tech-training programs to equip young people with the skills they need to succeed in a high-level tech job. Jobs: Most important, we are establishing an employers' council to ensure this pipeline results in gainful employment. This council is also building the core movement to open the doors to invite more low-opportunity talent into this pipeline. Top executives at companies like Apple and Facebook have already expressed interest in joining this council and making meaningful changes in their workforce. Our nation is sitting on an untapped goldmine of talent: amazing young people who have the creativity and the courage, but need the skills. For example, take Kalimah Priforce. He is a young Haitian-American man who grew up in group homes. After his younger brother was shot and killed behind their childhood elementary school, he made a lifelong commitment to transforming the lives of young people. At 16 years old, he founded a tech company to serve low-income neighborhoods. Kalimah went on to co-found Qeyno Labs, a start-up that works to close the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) gap in education. This past February, Kalimah created a pioneering ""hackathon"" in Oakland, California, to highlight black male achievement. Young black kids came together for three days to connect, create and code. It was a group of hoodie-wearing, laptop-wielding future Mark Zuckerbergs -- who all look a bit like Trayvon Martin. It was, almost certainly, a sign of things to come. Plenty of other low-opportunity young people are waiting to live out their own success story. That's a problem we can solve. We just need to give them the opportunity. Imagine urban youth who are not just downloading apps, but uploading them. And when they succeed, they will change a lot more than the workplace diversity numbers in Silicon Valley.","Van Jones: Google, Yahoo, LinkedIn and Facebook reports show dismal diversity levels .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As Congress comes back after a two-week recess, a national poll indicates the honeymoon may be over for congressional Democrats, although they maintain a decided advantage over the GOP. Congressional Republicans, shown at a press conference this month, have seen only negligible gains, a poll says. Forty-nine percent of people questioned this month in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. national survey say the country is better off with the Democrats controlling Congress. That's down 7 points from January, but it's 15 points higher than the 34 percent who say the nation would be better with the Republicans running Capitol Hill. Democrats won back control of both houses of Congress in the 2006 elections, and increased their majorities in November's elections. ""Most of the Democrats' loss of support has come among younger Americans,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""In January, two-thirds of those under the age of 35 said Democratic control of Congress was good for the country. Now that figure is down to 48 percent."" The poll also indicates that 62 percent of those questioned think President Obama is doing enough to cooperate with Republicans. That's down eight points from February, but it's 25 points higher than the 37 percent who feel the Republicans in Congress are doing enough to reach out to Democrats and the president. ""Traditionally, the public likes to see bipartisan cooperation in Washington,"" Holland said. ""So, the perception that the GOP isn't reaching across the aisle may be holding the party back in its efforts to capitalize on discontent with the Democratic track record so far."" Congress reconvenes this week after Easter recess. Both houses will be in session for five weeks until they break for Memorial Day. On the agenda: final passage of the budget, which could happen as early as the end of next week. Both houses passed separate versions of the budget bill before the recess. Congress also will start the long and difficult process of health care reform, with the hopes of finishing before the August recess. The equally hard battle over energy reform is also expected to get under way. Lawmakers need to vote on an $84 billion supplemental request by the Obama administration to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. A housing bill that would allow judges to rewrite mortgage payments for Americans facing foreclosure has passed the House, but could face a fight in the Senate. Also on the agenda: The House may take up banking regulations, and the Senate will hold confirmation hearings for Obama administration secretaries and undersecretaries. The poll indicates that most Americans don't think lawmakers are doing a good job. Sixty-three percent disapprove of how Congress is handling its job, with 35 percent saying they approve of what lawmakers are doing. That mark is six points higher than in February, when only 29 percent approved of how Congress was handling its job. ""The increase in overall views of Congress is due mostly to Democrats,"" Holland said. ""Democrats nationwide have seen Congress pass a Democratic president's initiatives for the first time since the 1990s and they are responding accordingly. Nonetheless, most Americans still don't have a very positive view of Congress."" The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted April 3-5, with 1,023 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. CNN's Craig Broffman and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","Poll says 49 percent of those questioned like Democratic control of Congress .

"Berlin, Germany (CNN) -- A 90-year-old man from northern Germany has been charged with 58 counts of murder for the killings of Jewish forced laborers in the final days of World War Two. The man, who was not named, was a member of the feared SS serving in what is now Austria when he allegedly carried out the crimes, the state court in Duisburg, western Germany, said Tuesday. A state office responsible for the prosecution of Nazi war crimes filed the charges. On March 29, 1945, the man brought at least 57 Jewish forced laborers in several groups to a wooded area where they were forced to give up their valuables and kneel in a ditch, the court said. ""The accused and other SS members then shot the Jewish forced laborers cruelly from the back,"" the court said. That day or the next, the court said, the man made other Jewish forced laborers who were ""exhausted and no longer able to walk"" to march near the town of Jabing, which was then in Germany and is now part of modern-day Austria. He then ""insidiously"" shot them from the back, it added. ""The accusation is that the accused let himself be led by the National Socialist (Nazi) ideology, corresponding to an extremely hostile and inhumane attitude toward the victims, who he viewed as inferior,"" the court said. The court said it must now decide whether to open proceedings against the man, who has two weeks in which to raise any objections.","Man from northern Germany charged with 58 counts of killing Jewish laborers .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy and Billy Horschel are in pole position to pocket the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup $10 million jackpot after finishing the third round tied for the lead at the season finale Tour Championship. The 27-year-old American and the world No. 1 are two of five players in the 29-strong field who can claim the $10 million prize for topping the FedEx Cup playoff series by winning the season's final event at Atlanta's East Lake Golf Club. McIlroy began the day two shots behind Horschel but a three-under par 67, compared to the American's 69, ensured the Northern Irishman drew level at nine-under par after 54 holes. After Friday's heroics, where McIlroy fired a tee shot into a spectator's trouser pocket on his way to a five-under 65, Saturday was shaping up to be equally eventful. A birdie, bogey, birdie start hinted at another day of high drama and low scoring before things settled down with a run of five pars. That sequence was broken with a birdie at the ninth followed by a bogey at 10 before an eagle three at the par five 15th saw McIlroy finally reel in his playing partner. ""I haven't really played the par fives well all week ... it was a big turning point as it tied me for the lead,"" McIlroy told Sky Sports. An errant tee shot at the par three 18th threatened to take the gloss off another polished display, but the ever-assured McIlroy made a tricky up-and-down from thick, greenside rough look simple. ""I've felt a little weary and in no way have I played my best golf, but I'm tied for the lead and I can't ask for any more,"" McIlroy said. Earlier, three front-nine birdies had seen Horschel extend his overnight lead to three shots but two bogeys at 10 and 13, coupled with McIlroy's eagle, saw his advantage disappear. Jim Furyk is by no means out of contention to win the tournament after a 67 left him two shots adrift of the joint-leaders while Ricky Fowler, England's Justin Rose and Australia's Jason Day are all one shot further back on six under. Of the remaining three players who can claim the FedEx jackpot with a win on Sunday no matter where other players finish, Chris Kirk, joint-leader with Horschel after round one, is in closest contention. The Atlanta native is five under after three rounds while Bubba Watson is three-under par. Hunter Mahan, however, will not be banking a $10m check come Monday morning -- the 32-year-old is seven-over par for his three rounds.

"(Rolling Stone) -- Bonnaroo 2012's defining singalong moment came late in the festival, which wrapped up last night in Manchester, Tenneesee. It was at That Tent shortly before 8 p.m., when New York power-pop sensation fun. hit the first chorus of their ubiquitous hit, ""We Are Young."" Across the vicinity, it seemed like every single attendee -- from festivalgoers to vendors and event staffers -- was singing along to the rousing, undeniable anthem with the same life-affirming gusto as fun.'s lead singer, Nate Ruess. Love or hate fun., but don't accuse the band of false advertising. They make light, radio-aspiring pop with no other objective than to elicit joy in their audience. In Ruess, the band has the commanding frontman to lead them to stadium-sized success if they can keep cranking out hooks that hit as hard as ""We Are Young"" does. The endgame for cultivating that kind of classic pop canon can be found in the reunited Beach Boys. The band has a treasure trove of outright classics, and they performed what felt like all of them during their Sunday afternoon set. ""Surfer Girl,"" ""Barbara Ann,"" ""Wouldn't It Be Nice,"" ""Sloop John B,"" ""Surfin' Safari,"" even ""Kokomo"" -- you name it, they probably played it. While that wasn't inherently surprising, what came as a bit of a shock was how fresh the band sounded -- even if its elder members didn't look the part -- both on their classics and on tunes from their recently released reunion LP, ""That's Why God Made the Radio."" Brian Wilson's presence is what makes this reunion so successful, but onstage he looked like the Queen of England, sitting idly behind a grand piano and taking the occasional vocal lead; Mike Love, meanwhile, seemed to be the main Beach Boy behind the wheel. Taken together with the afternoon's balmy weather and the day-in-the-park vibe of festivalgoers knocking around beach balls and splaying out on towels, the group's sublime set was just the thing for a lazy, hungover Sunday. Bonnaroo drew its initial inspiration directly from the festivals that Phish threw in the 1990s, so it was only fitting that Phish closed out the main stage with a two-set show that embodied the spirit of the fest. They did jammed-out covers of TV on the Radio's ""Golden Age"" and the Velvet Underground's ""Rock & Roll,"" dropped a deep cut (""Shafty"") for the first time since 2003 and nodded to the Tennessee environs with a rendition of the bluegrass standard ""Rocky Top."" ""Every time we play here we get to play with people we admire,"" said guitarist Trey Anastasio, referencing the band's only other proper appearance at Bonnaroo in 2009, when they brought out Bruce Springsteen. This time around, they invited Kenny Rogers onstage to sing ""The Gambler."" It seemed like an odd pairing at first, but moments later Anastasio teased ""The Gambler's"" melody again on guitar, this time incorporating it into a jam out of ""Possum"" with a knowing wink to the crowd. As the band wrapped up their four-hour enterprise with a ""Tweezer Reprise"" encore, a fireworks show erupted behind the stage, putting a wrap on Bonnaroo 2012 at large. Between the nights spent camping, the constant consumption of live music and the inevitable exhaustion, it really is tougher for musicians to make an impact at Bonnaroo on its final day. But those elements were no match for Gary Clark Jr, who held an early-arriving What Stage crowd in the palm of his hand during his set of savage barn-burners, falsetto-crooned waltzing ballads and slow-grooving dirges. Clark's blood-and-guts guitar tone and solos crescendoed like cinematic dramas, and his rhythm section knew just when to get out of the way and lay into a deep-pocketed groove. With Clark's cool, effortlessly seductive charisma, blues-rock has a new star on its hands. Bon Iver's music is well-matched for a mellow Sunday afternoon, and the band delivered a main stage set that was just relaxed enough while still managing to capture the audience. Fans sang along to favorites like ""Skinny Love"" and ""Holocene,"" and frontman Justin Vernon decided to capitalize on it by asking them to belt the line, ""What might have been lost,"" in unison during a jammy rendition of ""The Wolves (Act I and II)"" -- the chorus grew louder and louder until it turned into outright screaming. ""Let's see if we can crack open the sky or something,"" said Vernon, who got his wish when it actually did start drizzling. Judging by the size of their crowd at That Tent, Here We Go Magic was one of the most underrated bands at Bonnaroo this year, just as they were at their festival debut in 2010. Since then, the Brooklyn rockers have nailed down their hooky, artful sound, like Radiohead as interpreted by the Talking Heads. Philadelphia garage-folk crooner Kurt Vile and his backing band the Violators added some sonic tension to Centeroo with a spotty, early-evening set that peaked with highlights like the lazy, off-putting acoustic meditation ""Heart Attack"" and a washed-out cover of Bruce Springsteen's ""Downbound Train."" The festivities in Centeroo came to a close with a three-way indie-pop showdown between the Shins, Young the Giant and the aforementioned fun. The Shins played the fest's traditional indie-headliner Sunday evening slot at Which Stage and came out with guns blazing, opening with the ""Chutes Too Narrow"" favorite ""Kissing the Lipless"" and following it up with the blithe and bouncy ""Oh, Inverted World"" gem ""Caring Is Creepy."" In other words, business as usual for the good-natured power-twee quintet. Meanwhile at This Tent, Young the Giant had a sizable crowd of thousands enraptured in tunes both emotionally charged and affable, the presiding tones of the day.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A judge has delayed the preliminary hearing for Dr. Conrad Murray, charged in Michael Jackson's death, until early next year because more investigation is being done and some prosecution witnesses won't be available until then. The hearing, in which prosecutors will try to convince the judge there is probable cause to hold a trial, was expected to start in October. Murray sat silently in front of the judge at Monday's court appearance, while Jackson's elderly parents watched from the second row. Judge Michael Pastor said he ""wanted to expedite"" the case, but he understands it will take more time for each side to prepare. The preliminary hearing, which is estimated to take two or three weeks, is now scheduled to start on January 4, Pastor said. Dozens of Michael Jackson fans, angry about the pop star's death, gathered outside the courthouse Monday. A handful of them were allowed inside to witness the proceedings. Murray is charged with involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, which the Los Angeles County coroner ruled was from an overdose of propofol, a powerful anesthesia used to put surgical patients to sleep. Murray, hired as Jackson's personal doctor while the singer rehearsed for his comeback concerts, admitted giving him propofol as a sleep aid. But Murray's lawyer said the amount was much smaller than what was found in Jackson's body during the autopsy. ""The fact [of the way] that he died was a mystery a year ago, and still is,"" Houston attorney Ed Chernoff told CNN in an exclusive interview recently. Members of Jackson's family have attended each hearing since Murray's arrest in February. When brother Jermaine Jackson left the last hearing in June, he indicated some of them were not satisfied with the case against Murray. ""Dr. Murray's the fall guy,"" Jermaine Jackson said after the hearing. ""This is bulls--t."" California authorities announced last month that seven other doctors and a nurse who treated Jackson will not face criminal prosecution in connection with the singer's death. Pastor denied a request by the state medical board to order Murray to stop practicing medicine as a condition of his bond while he awaits trial.  His lawyer said he has no California patients, although he continues to treat patients in Nevada and Texas. Jackson fans have organized protests at each hearing, taunting Murray as he enters and departs the courthouse. One fan website said they would follow Murray ""into the streets"" after Monday's hearing with banners on an overpass of the Hollywood Freeway.","The preliminary hearing had been expected to begin in October .

"(CNN) -- Steven Van Zandt did not mince words. Steven Van Zandt (right) wants musicians to have a sense of history and care for their craft. ""I want to spend just a minute on a topic that never ever gets discussed in the music business -- the music,"" the Bruce Springsteen guitarist and ""Sopranos"" star said in a speech to the SXSW music and arts festival in March. ""The reason nobody wants to talk about it is because it mostly sucks! ""Who are we kidding here?"" he said. ""Nobody's buying records? Because they suck!"" He called the speech ""A Crisis of Craft,"" and implored listeners to get back to rock 'n' roll's roots. Learn how to play cover songs, he said. Get people to dance. Harness your working-class energy. Take pride in craft. It's been two months since that speech, and Van Zandt is still passionate about the subject. ""[Rock 'n' roll] is a craft that has to be learned,"" he tells CNN. ""There are things you learn by listening to great records, copying heroes."" He believes that he said some things that people were thinking, but haven't said out loud. But the rumbles are out there. The music business is in a state of flux, with the sales of more profitable CDs continuing to fall even as single downloads climb. ""American Idol's"" season is coming to an end, with rock purists once again assailing the show's slick pop sensibility. Commercial radio, country, rap and hip-hop -- they all have their critics, many of them wishing a return to the way things used to be. Blog: What do you think of the state of rock 'n' roll? Van Zandt has sympathy for all sides, coming at the issue from what he calls ""a unique perspective"" -- he's a musician, a DJ (with his radio show and Sirius XM channel, ""Little Steven's Underground Garage"") and record label honcho (Wicked Cool Records). He's quick to observe that he's not slamming all pop music. There's vibrancy in some hip-hop, he says, and he admires ""Idol,"" particularly when it promotes music history. ""But it's quite an alien world to my traditional rock 'n' roll world,"" he adds. ""It has nothing to do with it."" Within that rock 'n' roll world, he worries. Today's bands, he says, look down on performing covers, and as a result many have gotten lost in a musical wilderness. ""The result is an extraordinary amount of mediocrity,"" he says. ""There are no standards to live up to."" Which is part of the problem with rejuvenating rock 'n' roll, says Steve Greenberg, founder of S-Curve Records, which includes alt-rockers Tinted Windows and We The Kings among its acts. Technology is one problem, he observes. ""I think in the old days, in order to even be decent, it took a lot of work,"" he says. ""And today, relatively untalented and uncreative people can actually make rock 'n' roll music that sounds kind of decent. And I think that kind of fools people and causes people to be lazy."" But for Greenberg there's also a sense that the ""square pegs"" -- the naturally rebellious types -- are getting shoved in round holes. ""A lot of opportunities inevitably these days go to people who fit the format, whether the format is Top 40 radio or 'American Idol' or [Radio] Disney or whatever it is,"" he says. ""There's so much pressure to fit those slots. And it's the square pegs ultimately who are going to change the world."" The spirited Greenberg wants to channel that rebellious energy. He's high on a band he signed named Care Bears on Fire, a trio of 13-year-old Brooklyn girls who sound like the Ramones with a touch of Shonen Knife. ""Their attitude is maybe one size doesn't fit all,"" he says. ""I feel like the spirit of rock 'n' roll lives in those guys. ... They're having fun playing rock 'n' roll."" Scott Booker, the manager of the avant-pop band the Flaming Lips (""She Don't Use Jelly,"" ""Do You Realize??""), is also hoping to foster creativity. He's serving as the CEO of the Academy of Contemporary Music, a music school based at Central Oklahoma University. Drawing from a British concept, the school plans to offer courses in music, music production and the music business, many starting this fall. Booker observes record labels aren't spending as much money on developing talent. He hopes the ACM not only makes bands more signable, but also teaches them business strategies, such as setting up their own label and distribution apparatus. ""This could become a think tank for how the industry could go,"" he says, musing aloud. ""People think of music as a throwaway cultural item [nowadays]. I want to change that. ... Make things more exciting."" Technology, adds BMI executive Phil Graham, can also be rock 'n' roll's friend. ""The opportunities the digital world give the population as a whole to throw their talents to a very wide audience is a very good thing,"" he says. More people have gotten the chance to put their music out there and connect with fellow music lovers, he says. Of course, there are also old-fashioned connections. BMI sponsors dozens of showcases for new acts; young bands play clubs and hawk their CDs (or Web page). Van Zandt welcomes the efforts, but hopes there's also a connection to rock 'n' roll history. He's founded a Rock and Roll Forever Foundation to foster music education in schools. (To its credit, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum has similar programs.) ""The spark comes from whatever people are into these days -- and that very well may be 'American Idol,' "" he says. ""You start with whatever singer you're rooting for, and you start to trace back where they come from. It's up to the artists themselves to make sure that their fans know where they're coming from, to make it clear that music doesn't fall off trees.""","Steven Van Zandt: Bands aren't woodshedding, aren't learning rock 'n' roll history .

"AUSTIN, Texas (CNN) -- CD sales are down. Digital hasn't caught up. Record companies are consolidating. New bands are trying to find their own way. Baltimore-based DJ Blaqstarr, best known for his work with M.I.A., performs at SXSW. Despite all the challenging news, thousands of industry professionals and eager music fans turned out for the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas, over the weekend. The festival, tailored to recording industry talent seekers and the talent they seek, officially ended Sunday. While optimism ran high at the five-day whirlwind of panel discussions, trade shows, live concerts and private parties, much of the conversation throughout the event focused on the sobering reality of the music industry's uncertain future. ""Obviously we're going through a transition. All of the major record labels have gone through some sort of cost-cutting and consolidation over the last few years,"" said Rand Hoffman, head of business and legal affairs at Interscope Geffen A&M Records. ""Right now CD sales are falling more rapidly than digital is going up,"" he told a group of SXSW festival-goers at a panel discussion on the future of the industry. According to a release from Nielson SoundScan, which tracks record sales, over a billion songs were downloaded in 2008, an online music industry record. But the success of the individual digital song sales on popular sites such as iTunes has not replaced the lost revenue from the declining number of CD sales. Total album sales fell 14 percent in 2008, which accounts for a huge portion of record company profits. Sony Music Entertainment's Julie Swidler noted that despite the stressed state of affairs for the corporate music industry, the major labels will stay relevant, but probably as smaller versions of their past selves. ""We'll still be major, just smaller major,"" predicted Swidler, who works as the executive vice president of business affairs and general counsel. The growing trend of established artists selling and distributing their music without the aid of a major label paints an even bleaker picture for the corporate music business. ""The bottom line is if we want to continue, we have to break future superstars, and the only way to do that is artist development,"" Swidler said. Both Swidler and Hoffman see light at the end of the tunnel, however.  Watch sights and sounds of SXSW » . Hoffman acknowledged that the major labels must find a way to turn the digital sales momentum into a greater profit and predicts that the United States will eventually have a terrestrial radio performance right law, which would require radio stations to pay artists each time they play their songs. ""I can't believe that if almost every single ... Western country in the world has [a performance right], that the U.S. will go on indefinitely not having this. There's no rational basis for it. Its just politics."" And Swidler believes that the labels can adapt to the online music movement with new, creative ways of directly connecting the artist to the consumer. ""I think you're going to see online where suddenly instead of buying an album by your favorite artist, you'll buy a year's subscription to that artist,"" Swidler says. ""So it's almost as if an artist will trickle out a story for you for the entire year."" Good turnout, but not everyone is happy . If the turnout at SXSW 2009 is any indication of consumers' willingness to spend money on music, then record label executives have reason to be hopeful. The festival brought in an estimated $103 million to the Austin-area economy in 2008, and though this year's numbers have yet to be tabulated, SXSW representatives expect the amount will be on par with last year. Almost 2,000 artists played SXSW this year, which is about a hundred more than last year. An impressive list of major recording artists brought their high-profile acts to the intimate Austin stages. Kanye West, Jane's Addiction, Big Boi and Metallica all played unannounced shows, primarily to exclusive crowds of industry insiders who heard about the concerts through word of mouth,  though news of Metallica's set at the release party of ""Guitar Hero: Metallica"" on Friday was well-known around town early that morning.  Watch some of Metallica's performance » . In addition to the surprise appearances, SXSW showcased scheduled performers PJ Harvey, the Indigo Girls, Ben Harper, Third Eye Blind and droves of other hit groups, almost all of whom garnered huge crowds of enthusiastic and devoted fans. Not everyone was pleased with the festival's exclusive nature, however. To many locals, the perception is that major music acts are stealing the thunder from unsigned, local artists who are trying to attract as many label representatives to their shows as possible. Austin-based band the Vincents played a slew of gigs throughout the week and received positive feedback from the people who attended their shows, many of whom purchased their CD. But they ultimately felt overshadowed by the swarms of industry types who were constantly rushing to the next secret show or exclusive party. Local find . In spite of a few complaints from Austin residents, SXSW can provide an amazing opportunity for a lucky few whose acts get picked up by industry folks. The ""feel good"" story of SXSW 2009 might have been local, buzz-worthy band The Black and White Years, which recently took home five Austin Music Awards, including best new band, song of the year and best producer, the latter for former Talking Heads keyboardist-guitarist Jerry Harrison. Harrison stumbled across The Black and White Years at a small performance at SXSW in 2007. He liked their sound and decided to produce their debut album. ""People think when you play these South by Southwest things that nothing ever happens. Sometimes it does. You've got to be skilled at your instrument, but it takes a little luck. You just never know, it might happen,"" said drummer Billy Potts. Though dominated by music, SXSW also features a robust film festival and an innovative interactive gala, where techies from around the country showcase their latest software, gadgets and gaming technology. This year the film festival had 57 world premieres, 133 features and 127 short films screened, many of which fulfill SXSW's primary role of providing a platform for indie films and documentaries. Whereas the big studio movies have seen a boost in sales during the recession, the economic crisis has crippled many foundations that provide the funds for independent documentaries. Indeed, New York's Tribeca Film Festival announced last week that it would be making cuts to its line-up because of economic conditions. But producer Erin Essenmacher, whose film ""Mine"" premiered at SXSW and took home the documentary audience award, remains confident about the entertainment industry's future. ""I hate to say things are recession-proof because I don't even know what that means anymore, but there's always going to be a need for content, whether it's on the Web or on TV,"" she said. ""And as the economy gets worse, I think people want that outlet.""","SXSW is major music and film festival in Austin, Texas .

"(CNN) -- Nelson Mandela spent almost three decades in jail, but he wasn't alone -- he had two Indian goddesses and a 17th century playwright for company. Locked in solitary confinement on Robben Island, newspapers were banned and letters from loved ones a rare treat. Where did he find the inspiration to continue his long struggle for freedom? As the twittersphere explodes with quotes from the legendary leader, it's perhaps easy to forget there was a time when Mandela was in need of a few words of wisdom himself. He found them in the musings of another great thinker -- one born centuries before and on the other side of the world. A tattered book covered in luminous Hindu deities might have seemed like a strange choice for the South African political activist languishing in his cell. But the beatifically smiling women on the cover knew something the prison wardens didn't. Inside was the ""Complete Works of Shakespeare,"" and the historic text became a source of strength for Mandela and his fellow inmates during their darkest days. A bible by any other name . It became known as the ""Robben Island Bible,"" and today is one of the most remarkable artifacts from Mandela's 27 years in jail. ""What resonance does a white guy from England 400 years ago have to a group of South African political prisoners in the latter half of the 20th century?"" said Matthew Hahn, who wrote a play based on the ""Robben Island Bible,"" and interviewed many of the inmates who read it. ""There's this universality to Shakespeare -- including many lessons on good and bad leadership -- and I think Mandela found resonance in his words. He once said that 'To be taken seriously as a politician, one must always quote from Shakespeare,' and a lot of his speeches when he was president did just that."" The valiant . The book was smuggled into the jail by political prisoner Sonny Venkatrathnam, who disguised it in colorful Diwali cards celebrating the Hindu festival of lights, convincing the warden it was his bible. Between 1975 and 1978, the volume was passed between 33 of Venkatrathnam's fellow prisoners -- including Mandela. Many of the inmates signed and dated their names beside particularly poignant passages -- words of hardship, political unrest, or injustice. Mandela chose a passage from Julius Caesar -- just before the Roman statesman leaves for the senate on the Ides of March -- and his sweeping handwriting on the now-yellowing page is a haunting reminder of the activist's dedication to his cause. It includes the lines: ""Cowards die many times before their deaths/The valiant never taste of death but once."" ""I believe when Nelson Mandela signed this passage, he recognized this book would get out and be circulated in the liberation movement -- his would be the quote people looked to,"" said Hahn. ""It was an incredibly powerful quote -- he lived his entire life according to these two lines."" Lasting impression . The quote is all the more poignant considering Mandela's speech during the 1960s Rivonia Trial, where he said: ""If need be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die."" Mandela signed the passage December 16, 1977. He never could have imagined that December 16 would later be known as ""Reconciliation Day"" in South Africa -- a public holiday which only came into effect after the fall of apartheid. While Hahn believes the ""Robben Island Bible"" began as an attempt by Venkatrathnam to gain the autographs of the most famous political activists at the time, it has now become a powerful memento of their many years -- and sources of inspiration -- behind bars. ""It was amazing to see visitors from all over the world drawn to this book like a magnet,"" said Jonathan Bate, Professor of English Literature at Oxford University, who helped curate the British Museum's Shakespeare exhibition last year. ""It was a coming together of one of the greatest writers of humanity, and one of the greatest humans of the 20th century. With Mandela's death comes a particular poignancy in a passage referring to the death of the valiant.""","Nelson Mandela quotes flood social media. But what inspired man himself?

"(CNN) -- For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to be able to say, ""I've run a 5K."" Unfortunately, I was so out of shape, it was hard to imagine walking 5 kilometers, let alone running them. When I found out the distance of the triathlon that I was going to be competing in with Fit Nation come September -- a half-mile swim, an 18-mile bike ride and a 4-mile run -- I decided that somehow, I was going to run a 5K and then some ... and that was that. What I never imagined was that my first 5K would be held in my honor, organized by my friends and family as a surprise, right down Main Street in my hometown of Allegany, New York. The ""top secret"" planning all started right after my first Fit Nation trip to Atlanta in January. My girlfriend, Joy, enlisted the help of my children, my co-workers and my family. She picked the date, named the race, rented the space and worked out all of the major details, all without my knowledge. The day that I was told about the plans for ""Run4Wilbs,"" I had mixed emotions. I was shocked that so much had been planned without me finding out about it; there were more than 50 people at this point that knew and they were my close friends and my family. I was overwhelmed because I don't like to be the focus of attention, and this race was named after me so I had no choice. I was also scared that I wouldn't do well in the 5K itself -- there were going to be a lot of people watching if I failed. Facing your fears head on . In the beginning, the plan was to gather as many of my family, friends and community members as possible. The date of June 28 was picked because it was not only the day before my school's graduation, it was also the last day of Old Home Week/ Fireman's Carnival; everyone comes back to town that weekend. As race day got closer, the event got bigger and bigger. First, we found out that my former student-athlete, Maj. Pat Miller, was planning on attending. Pat was thrust into the public eye in April when he was wounded in the Fort Hood shooting. When I received his message saying that he would be walking in my race (he was still recovering from his third surgery), I was at the end of a long run. All of a sudden my exhausted legs felt lighter and stronger, and I finished with ease. The day before the big day, I was greeted by a local TV reporter from Buffalo, New York, asking for an interview. As soon as the interview was finished, we got a call from New York state Sen. Cathy Young's office. Young was not only going to be at the race, she was presenting me with a citation for making major changes to live a healthier lifestyle and inspiring not only my family and friends but my community to do the same. Senator Young at my race? Are you kidding?? We couldn't have asked for a better day for the race. We got to the course at 6 a.m. to begin setting up. My family and friends started arriving about an hour later. That is when I started to realize just how big this was going to be. By 8 a.m. we had more than 200 people, there to either participate or just to show their support. When Senator Young made her presentation, by her side was New York state Assemblyman Joe Giglio. What I didn't know was that he had his running gear with him. He changed right before the race and ran with us. That blew my mind! There were so many little details of that day that really meant a lot to me. For instance, my former high school track and field coach was contacted to be the starter of the race. So many of my colleagues came to work the race and help wherever they were needed; more came to run or walk. To think that they we all there to support me was unbelievably overwhelming, to say the least. Fit Nation may focus on the Sassy Six -- strangers who were selected to do a single triathlon. But it's also about making healthy changes, and inspiring our family and friends to do the same, and then taking that message to the community and beyond. I think we accomplished that with Run4Wilbs. At the end of the day, I said a lot of thank-you's, shook many hands and gave a lot of hugs. I beat my 5K goal by over 30 seconds and decided that, based on the feedback from everyone involved (and many who wished that they could have made it), Run4Wilbs is going to be an annual event. Same day, same time, same place. Save the date! You have more to lose than pounds . Why I gave up soda .","Mike Wilber's friends and family planned a 5K race honoring him .

"(CNN) -- The Emmy Awards will never be confused for the MTV Video Music Awards -- especially when they air on consecutive nights. It's status quo versus cutting-edge cool. Even when Hollywood lets its hair down, it's on the tame side. Still, host Seth Meyers did his best to liven up the proceedings. And the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards that aired Monday night did offer up some memorable moments. 1. Seth and Billy's crazy quiz . Meyers teamed up with ""Billy on the Street star"" Billy Eichner to dash around the streets of New York and bombard pedestrians with random pop culture questions. During a frenetic five minutes, the twosome tackled Emmy snubs, challenged people to name an Emmy nominee and generally terrorized unsuspecting New Yorkers. Then there's the collection they took up for the cast of the ""Big Bang Theory."" ""Why is the Emmys not just @billyeichner doing that for three hours?"" tweeted actress Anna Kendrick. 2. 'Weird Al''s plot parody parade . Remember when TV theme songs meant something? ""The Brady Bunch."" ""Gilligan's Island."" You got a catchy tune and the plot, all in 30 seconds. Nobody does that anymore. Nobody, except ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, who skewered everything from ""Mad Men"" to ""Game of Thrones"" in a medley with choice lines like, ""Jon Hamm's never won an Emmy/ Oh who cares? He's still Jon freaking Hamm."" 3. Gwen's 'Adele Dazeem' moment . Remember when John Travolta, for some inexplicable reason, mangled Idina Menzel's name as 'Adele Dazeem'? Gwen Stefani had one of those while presenting the Emmy for Outstanding Variety/Music/Comedy Series to ""The Colbert Report."" Or, as she put it, ""The Colbort Report."" Fortunately, Maroon 5's Adam Levine was there to quickly correct her. 4. Crystal's fond remembrance . Your heart had to break for Billy Crystal, the sometimes Oscar host who delivered a heartfelt tribute to his buddy, Robin Williams. ""It is very hard to talk about him in the past because he was so present in our lives,"" he said of the actor, who was found dead of an apparent suicide earlier this month. Crystal spoke fondly, touchingly for nearly five minutes. The night before, the VMAs paused to remember Williams ... for a mere 23 seconds. 5. Bryan breaking bad with the Veep . The gag that paid off big time last night was when ""Breaking Bad"" star Bryan Cranston planted a long, wet one on Julia Louis-Dreyfus as she headed to the stage to accept her Emmy award. When the stars were presenting an earlier award, they had a running gag that Louis-Dreyfus couldn't remember that Cranston was a guest star on ""Seinfeld,"" and that the pair even made out on camera. Not to be brushed aside, Cranston blocked her as she walked toward the stage to accept her trophy for best actress in a comedy series for ""Veep."" He swept Louis-Dreyfus into a passionate embrace until Jimmy Fallon forced them to separate. ""Yeah, yeah, he was on 'Seinfeld,'"" she quipped, while the camera panned to Cranston wiping the lipstick off his lips.

"(CNN) -- Federal investigators are urging collectors and museums in the United States to scrutinize their stock for stolen antiquities, particular those acquired from a New York dealer accused this week of stealing $20 million worth artifacts from India. The Manhattan District Attorney's office issued an arrest warrant for Subhash Kapoor, the owner of Art of the Past Gallery, who was already under arrest in India, for allegedly possessing stolen artifacts, including several sandstone and bronze statues. The items are believed to have been looted from temples in the Tamil Nadu region of India, according to a Thursday statement from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Federal investigators said Thursday that they searched Manhattan storage units allegedly leased by Kapoor and uncovered items ""displayed in major international museums worldwide"" and others that matched pieces listed as stolen. ""The statues and sculptures recovered today are worth millions in the antiquities business, but they are priceless to the nations that they were robbed from,"" said James T. Hayes Jr., special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in New York. Kapoor was arrested at Frankfort, Germany, and extradited to India on July 14 where he faces criminal charges. His attorney could not be immediately reached for comment. In February 2007, the Indian consulate reached out to federal authorities over concerns about the smuggling Indian antiquities into New York, official say. India's 1972 Antiquities and Art Treasures Act prohibits the removal of artifacts older than 100 years from the country. By late January, U.S. federal agents had seized dozens of antiquities worth millions of dollars believed to have been stolen from the region, including a five-foot-tall Buddha head and a ""life-sized stone figure weighing approximately 500 pounds,"" ICE reported. The agency boasts that since 2007, it has ""repatriated more than 2,500 items to more than 23 countries.""","Federal investigators are urging collectors and museums in the United States .

"Seattle (CNN) -- Carved out of the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest, Seattle started as an outpost for frontiersmen trying to strike it rich in the Gold Rush. Generations later, industries such as Boeing, Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks rose up, transforming this frontier town into a cutting edge city and tourist destination. But even in the midst of a modern metropolis you don't have to go far to find incredible natural beauty. Where can you get the best view of the city? Skip the Space Needle and its $18 ticket price and head to the viewpoint at Kerry Park, where you can enjoy the city's spectacular scenery free of charge. The park has great views of the needle, the spinning globe on top of the old Seattle Post-Intelligencer newspaper building and ferries busily bringing people across the water to and from downtown. On clear evenings, photographers line up to get a shot of the sun falling on Mount Rainier. It's stunning. Which restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion? Seattle has so much delicious food and so many terrific restaurants that there is no excuse for having a bad meal. My wife, Alex, and I always end up coming back to a tiny place we love called How to Cook a Wolf. The menu is eclectic with simple but fresh pasta dishes and small seafood plates that are meant to be shared. You get the feeling the cooks are serving what they feel like making. We keep coming back and are consistently blown away. What is your favorite neighborhood? A popular T-shirt I often see around Ballard describes the neighborhood as ""a sleepy drinking village with a condo problem."" While Ballard may have turned trendy, its blue-collar roots haven't altogether disappeared. You can still find salty fishermen occupying well-worn barstools along Ballard Avenue. At night, many of those same bars are filled with people soaking up the neighborhood's terrific music scene. Ballard's Sunday market is people-watching central as stands are set up to offer freshly caught salmon, pizza from a wood-burning oven on wheels and even advice, from one guy ready to peddle his. How do tourists stick out, and what's the best way to blend in? According to locals, only tourists use umbrellas. During Seattle's wet and gray winter, it is somewhat surreal to see people out and about jogging and riding their bikes. But as new arrivals quickly find out, if you wait for nice weather, you can wait here for a long time. What's the biggest misconception about your city? Seattle's bad weather is so notorious people believe it pours here nonstop. In reality, Seattle rain is more of a constant drizzle. That combined with the painfully short winter days can sometimes be tough to take. I have friends who buy sunlamps and take vitamin D to get through the winters. But the winters are soon forgotten when summer rolls around. A long summer day in Seattle with the backdrop of white mountaintops against the deep blue of the Puget Sound is one of the most beautiful sights in the world. Where do you go to relax? Just 15 minutes or so from downtown Seattle is Discovery Park, a 534-acre protected oasis of natural beauty. A well-worn path takes you through fern-covered trees to the water, where you might see bald eagles or even whales. That a place so natural and green is able to exist within a city is truly amazing. Don't miss it. For a weekend trip, there's no better outing than a visit to the Olympic Peninsula. A short ferry ride will take you over to the peninsula, where snow-capped mountains rise from the Pacific Ocean. There are still plenty of wild places to explore there, including the Hoh Rain Forest, where the thick tree cover can fool you into thinking you've wandered into Jurassic Park. One summer, my wife and I camped on the Olympic Peninsula's Rialto Beach. Just as the sun was setting, a fat seal swam out of the ocean right in front of us and looked as if he was about to come over and dry himself off at our camp fire. What's the biggest tourist trap? Is there a tourist trap that's actually worth seeing? Seattle is rightly famous for its Pike Place Market. In the summer when the cruise boats to Alaska are in full swing, it seems like the market is filled to the point of exploding with camera-toting, fanny pack-wearing out-of-towners. But the 103-year-old market survives not just from the tourists but also because legions of Seattle residents keep coming back for the amazingly fresh seafood and produce. My favorite stop is Pure Food Fish Market, celebrating its 100th year in the market. They may not throw your fish when you buy it, but with scallops the size of your fist, whole salmon and giant lobsters for sale, you'll hardly be complaining. Where was your most memorable meal? Just a seaplane or ferry ride away from Seattle are the San Juan Islands, which the U.S. and Canada almost went to war over 150 years ago. The first time I went there, I remember going kayaking and seeing killer whales hunting for salmon just off shore. At one point they swam so near to us, we grabbed onto floating kelp beds to keep out of their way. That night, still buzzed from the excitement of the seeing these amazing creatures up close, we went to Duck Soup Inn in Friday Harbor. The restaurant is tucked back in the woods. The food -- much of it picked or caught on the island -- is delicious. There were smoked oysters and huge panko-crusted calamari. The meal and the entire day were unforgettable. Are there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try? I tell any one who comes to visit me in Seattle that the one thing they have to try is the wild salmon that is readily available here. Friends who say they don't care for the fishy flavor of salmon do not recognize the taste of the fresh fish you eat in Seattle. You can find plenty of salmon on the menu in the city's fine restaurants, but for me there is no way to better prepare it than on my backyard grill with a little salt and pepper. What is a good local souvenir? In Seattle, good coffee is abundant. You don't have to go far to get a cup of it either. In fact, at the drive-through espresso booths, you don't even need to get out of your car! But then there are the specialty coffee places where the staff is into coffee in a way that borders on scary: holding coffee tastings, traveling around the world looking for the next java flavor and roasting their beans in store. Victrola Coffee Roasters is one of those places  working to elevate coffee-making into an art form. Bring a bag of local coffee back home with you to extend your visit to Seattle just a little longer.","Big industries transformed Seattle into a cutting-edge city and tourist destination .

"(CNN) -- The heavens will deliver a rare treat to moonstruck romantics and werewolves Sunday who rise before the sun. A feat of lunar synchronicity will create a Supermoon. This happens when the moon is full and at the same time reaches its perigee -- the closest point to Earth in its orbit, according to NASA. Share your 2013 Supermoon photographs . It makes for the biggest, brightest moon of the year. A Supermoon, sometimes called a Super Full Moon, is 14% larger and 30% brighter than most full moons, NASA says. Taken separately, neither a full moon nor the perigee is a big deal. The moon is full roughly once a month, and it reaches its perigee just as often, but the next time both will coincide will be August 2014. This year's magic moment occurs at 7:32 a.m. ET, but it would be wise to wager a gander earlier. In some parts of the United States the sun will rise beforehand, outshining the Supermoon's splendor. And the moon itself will dip below the horizon in parts of the country, just before it hits its perigee. The West Coast should get a great view of the perfect moment, when the moon is only 221,824 miles from Earth. There is nothing to fear from the moon being so close and bright, NASA says. It will have no more effect on tides or seismic activity than usual. Two weeks later, the moon will swing out to the farthest point in its orbit around Earth, when it will be 252,581 miles away, NASA says. Astronomers and swooners may have noticed the moon shining brightly early Saturday, when it put on a dress rehearsal. It was not quite full and not as close to the planet as it will be Sunday before dawn.","A Supermoon occurs about once a year .

"(CNN) -- We are still learning key details about Aaron Alexis, the man named as the shooter in this week's horrific mass killing at the Washington Navy Yard. So far there is a record of at least two prior incidents in which Alexis fired a gun under circumstances that should have brought criminal charges. His time as a Navy reservist was checkered with accounts of insubordination and disorderly conduct. He was reportedly seeking treatment for mental illness (he was hearing voices and having problems sleeping). More importantly from the perspective of risk for violence, a former roommate reported that Alexis was a heavy drinker. While much of the focus has been on how a person with this background obtained clearance to work at a military facility, a similar question could be asked about how he could legally buy a firearm in Virginia and allegedly obtain a permit to carry loaded firearms in Texas. Opinion: Gun control is not the answer . The gun lobby and other opponents to stronger gun laws like to talk about the rights of ""law-abiding gun owners,"" but the policies in place in most states allow individuals with backgrounds far worse than that of Alexis to own legally as many firearms as they can afford and carry loaded firearms most anywhere. To appease the gun lobby, lawmakers have created an environment where individuals with numerous convictions for misdemeanor crimes involving violence, firearm misuse, illegal drugs and alcohol abuse, and who have previously been subject to restraining orders for domestic violence, can legally arm themselves to the teeth. Several states have stricter standards for legal possession of handguns than federal law, and states such as New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts give law enforcement some discretion in determining who should legally be able to buy and carry handguns. My colleagues and I published a study last year where we found that in states with the weakest standards (similar to federal standards), nearly one-third of state prison inmates incarcerated for crimes committed with guns would have been prohibited from possessing firearms when committing their most recent offense if their states had standards for legal gun possession similar to those in place in high-standards states. With reasonable regulations such as background checks for all gun sales and proper regulation of gun dealers, many of these inmates would not have had guns to use in crime. Opinion: What could have prevented Navy Yard carnage? In order to reduce significantly the gun violence that occurs every day in communities across the United States, we must focus on the issues that matter the most where there is broad consensus. Public opinion surveys show large majorities of gun owners support stronger standards for legal gun ownership and policies designed to keep guns from prohibited persons, including universal background checks and stronger regulation and oversight of gun dealers. We can't say for sure whether such policies would have prevented the recent mass shootings that have gripped our nation, but they would reduce a significant number of shootings that don't receive national news attention, though they are no less devastating to the individuals, families and communities. Unfortunately, the gun debate in the United States has been just that -- a debate. Instead of engaging in the all too familiar, polarizing discussions that have characterized gun policy, let's act upon the things we all agree upon -- keeping guns from people who shouldn't have them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel W. Webster.","Washington Navy Yard shooter Aaron Alexis had background of violent incidents, misconduct .

"(CNN) -- A Rutgers University student commits suicide after being emotionally violated when his sexual encounter with another man is secretly streamed online. Tyler Clementi jumps in the Hudson River, and there is a general outcry accompanied by a superficial soul searching. Why is this happening? Where did this come from? Really? Seriously? Isn't it rather obvious that this cruel prank is but a reflection of a much larger social cancer? Just turn on the TV or check out a newspaper headline. ""Alarm Over Homosexual 'Brainwash' "" screamed Monday's New York Post. It was quoting Carl Paladino, a mainstream Republican candidate for governor of New York who said homosexuality is not an ""equally valid"" option and attacking his opponent for marching in a gay pride parade. A few articles in, another headline reads ""Anti-Gay Riot Hits Serbia Parade"" about Serbians who threw Molotov cocktails and stun grenades to disrupt a gay pride parade in Belgrade. I look up from the newspaper to see my TV broadcasting a perp walk of teenage men from the Bronx accused in a gay-bashing rampage. Cops say during the hate crime, two men suspected of being gay were sodomized with a wooden stick. All of this came on the heels of a homophobic attack, allegedly by two Staten Island men, in the restroom of the famed Stonewall Inn in the West Village of Manhattan. That's the very spot where the gay rights movement was born after a so-called ""morals raid"" by cops back in 1969 inspired gays to take to the streets in outrage. I have been to the Stonewall several times, and this attack gave me chills. They all do. It's easy to point in horror at these over-the-top expressions of hate. It's a lot harder to take an honest inventory of troubling attitudes toward gays, which some Americans reveal in more subtle ways such as the ubiquitous putdown ""that's so gay!"" I click on my BlackBerry, and a friend writes about her fears of revealing her sexual orientation while on a job interview. She writes, ""I paused right before I said the word 'gay.' Yes, I was scared. I want this job badly, I do. I need this job. I said to myself, though, if they aren't going to accept me for my truth, then it isn't for me. I said the word gay and felt good about it."" I don't know whether she got the job. But her fear is real, and sadly it is justified. I'm shocked at what's happening lately because I came out as gay late in life -- just a few years ago -- at a time when it seemed there was much more acceptance. I encountered no discrimination from any quarters as a result and was thrilled and filled with hope that human beings might actually be evolving to the point where they can apply that wonderful notion of ""don't tread on me"" to sexual orientation. Clearly this new wave of violence comes partly because equality for gays is a subject that's dominating the news. ""Don't ask, don't tell,"" gay marriage: These issues have put the situation in everyone's face and, therefore, biases that might have been uttered only behind closed doors are now surfacing with a vengeance. Paladino used anti-gay remarks for politics . The backlash may also be in response to the enormous strides the LGBT community has made in recent years. The success of Ellen DeGeneres, who came out more than 10 years ago and remains very popular, is one example. It's inspired a growing number of Americans to come out of the closet, too. Today, it seems almost everyone knows a friend or relative who is gay. Our former vice president, Dick Cheney, whose daughter is a lesbian. That has caused a lot of Americans to open their minds and hearts. But, for others, it's turned a hypothetical antagonism into something very personal and visceral. The philosopher John Stuart Mill said every great movement must experience three stages: ridicule, discussion, adoption. I would make that last one: acceptance. Clearly we are in the anger stage of the social justice movement for gays. I can't wait for us to move past it. To that end, I would urge everyone upset over Clementi's suicide or any of the recent violent attacks  to ask themselves: Do my attitudes also need an adjustment on this issue? Do I look askance if I see two people of the same sex holding hands? Would I feel uncomfortable if my child's teacher was gay? Would I be annoyed if my child's college roommate was gay? Would I be less likely to hire a person who is openly gay? Do I make jokes about people being gay? Have I talked to my child about the perils of intolerance? Why did Tyler Clementi die? If you've detected prejudice on your part after this self-analysis, you can do something about it. You can acknowledge it and perhaps realize that it's irrational. For example, the states that have approved gay marriage have not seen a social breakdown or any negative repercussions. Just because something makes one uncomfortable because it's different doesn't mean it's morally wrong. We can all learn to coexist. It's not those with extreme views, but rather those in the middle who will ultimately decide whether America's gays get to become first-class citizens or whether we will continue to be sidelined by prejudice. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jane Velez-Mitchell.","Jane Velez-Mitchell says recent anti-gay violence and remarks point up surge in homophobia .

"(CNN) -- Rwanda held solemn commemorations Monday to mark the 20th anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda, with many survivors overcome with emotion as they relived the trauma of the killings that left 800,000 people dead. Official mourning, which began three months ago with a flame of remembrance touring towns and villages across the small central African nation, culminated Monday with the arrival of the torch at the national genocide memorial. Wreaths were also laid in Kigali's soccer stadium, where U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, heads of state and European and U.S. diplomats gathered. President Paul Kagame lit a flame that will burn for 100 days, the length of time the killings lasted. At a ceremony at the national stadium, survivors of the genocide recounted their memories of the killings and of their survival. Some, sobbing and overcome with emotion, were carried outside. ""This should never happen in human history,"" Ban said of the massacre. Diplomatic dispute . The events also bore reminders of festering anger as a diplomatic dispute broke out over renewed allegations from Kigali of French complicity in the genocide. France said Monday that its ambassador to Rwanda had been barred from attending the events marking the anniversary. In a written statement, a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said Ambassador Michel Flesch, who was to represent France during the commemorative events in the Rwandan capital, had been informed Sunday night ""of the decision of the Rwandan authorities not to authorize him to take part in the ceremonies."" ""We regret this decision. However our embassies will take part today in the several ceremonies held across the world to pay tribute to the memory of the victims of the genocide,"" the spokesman added. France said over the weekend that it had canceled plans to attend the ceremony after Kagame's accusations of French involvement in the massacre. The weekly Jeune Afrique quoted Kagame as saying in an interview that both France and Belgium had played a ""direct role ... in the political preparation of genocide and participation in its execution."" The French Foreign Ministry said that France was ""surprised by the recent accusations made by the Rwandan president"" and that Justice Minister Christiane Taubira, who had been due to travel to Kigali on Monday, would no longer attend the commemoration. ""These accusations are in contradiction with the process of dialogue and reconciliation that has gone on for several years between our two countries,"" the ministry's statement said. Search for closure . As the 20 years are marked, many in Rwanda still are in search of closure. Niyonsenga Erick Rafiki, 24, says he can't remember the night his father was killed. But he searched for answers over the years and eventually found his father's killer. The killer, Sekamana Musa, served 10 years in prison for that murder and other crimes during the genocide. Musa said he was released after confessing. ""When I came out, I found the people we had committed crimes against, be it the mother of this boy (Rafiki) or this boy himself,"" Musa said. Musa has promised to help Rafiki find his father's body. Recently, the two men and others went to a spot where Musa believes Rafiki's father was buried. As Rafiki watched, Musa and other men dug, hoping to find the remains so that Rafiki can give him a proper burial. ""I never had a chance to bury my parent, as his child, in a decent way,"" Rafiki said. The body wasn't immediately found, but they said they would continue looking. Three-month killing spree . In 1994, Hutu extremists in Rwanda targeted minority ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus in a three-month killing spree that left an estimated 800,000 people dead. Hutu attackers burned down churches with hundreds or thousands of Tutsis inside. In some cases, wielding machetes, they entered homes and slaughtered children and grandparents. The violence was triggered by the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana, an ethnic Hutu, in a plane crash April 6, 1994. The armed forces of Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front eventually defeated the troops, stopping the wave of bloodletting. France, an ally of the Hutu nationalist government before the 1994 killings, has repeatedly denied any complicity in the genocide. Rwanda broke off diplomatic ties with France in 2006, and relations were restored only three years later. Rwanda was a Belgian colony until 1962. Last month, a Paris court sentenced former Rwandan spy chief Pascal Simbikangwa to 25 years in jail for his role in the genocide, the first such conviction in France.

"(CNN) -- A 10-nation group the Obama administration has gathered to fight ISIS could help, but more important will be the nations that surround the Islamist militant group's self-declared ""caliphate,"" experts say. After meetings at last week's NATO Summit, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke of a newly formed ""core coalition."" President Barack Obama said it would take on ISIS. The nations are Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Turkey, in addition to the United States. Turkey, a NATO member, is the only nation in that group located close to ISIS, which is also known as ISIL and calls itself the Islamic State. It has taken over parts of Iraq and Syria. This month the United States plans to ask the U.N. Security Council to support a resolution aimed at cracking down on foreign fighters in ISIS, a U.S. official said. And U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says he'll be heading to the Middle East on Tuesday to work on building a broader coalition to defeat the Islamist group. The key to winning the battle against ISIS, analysts say, could be courting countries in the region. ""The most important element of this coalition is the local and the regional,"" said Fawaz Gerges, chairman of Middle Eastern studies at the London School of Economics. ""The U.S. and allies won't put boots on the ground. ... The Iraqis, Kurds, and Syrians will basically be doing the fighting."" Analyst: Stop ISIS' 'social oxygen' Defeating the group known for horrific acts of terror -- seizing towns, slaughtering civilians, beheading many people including journalists -- will demand much more than military action, said Gerges. ""The most important element is to deny ISIS its social oxygen."" ISIS has blended in with local communities ""to portray itself as defender,"" he said. Members of the persecuted Yazidi community in Iraq told CNN that after ISIS came into town, Arab neighbors turned on the minorities and helped ISIS kill. Stopping ISIS means convincing Sunni Arabs -- who have felt disaffected by the Iraqi government -- that ISIS is an enemy. The goal is to ""drive a wedge between local Sunni communities and ISIS,"" Gerges said. To that end, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, which are Sunni states, can play a critical role, Gerges said. They're home to many Sunnis, including former Iraqi military officers who fled after the U.S. invasion in 2003. ""I bet you U.S., Saudi and Jordanian officials are working 24 hours a day to try to convince these leaders to join their alliance, and to in turn convince their counterparts to stand up against the Islamic State."" Analysts: It's up to the Saudis . ""Saudi Arabia is the only authority in the region with the power and legitimacy to bring ISIS down,"" two analysts write in The New York Times. The country ""effectively eradicated al Qaeda in the kingdom,"" write Nawaf Obaid of Harvard's Belfer Center and Saud al-Sarhan of the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies. It also ""has a unique form of religious credibility and legitimacy,"" since Saudi Arabia is the epicenter of Islam. Having Saudi Arabia ""in the lead can only add to the legitimacy of the campaign against ISIL,"" said Dennis Ross, a former U.S. ambassador who is now with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""The Arab states in this campaign must also provide military support -- involving forces, arms, training, subsidies for the tribes, intelligence, and diplomatic and even religious efforts to discredit ISIL."" Analyst: How to bring in Iran . These efforts could bring about an alignment between Saudi Arabia and Iran in fighting the militants, said Stephen Biddle, a political science professor at George Washington University. ""The Middle East is characterized by a welter of conflicting fault lines and interests,"" he said. When Muslim nations have aligned along Sunni and Shia lines, Saudi Arabia and Iran moved further apart, ""and in fact waged a proxy war against each other."" Now, Biddle said, new fault lines pit radical groups against authoritarian governments threatened by them -- and on that, the two nations could come together. Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, believes Iran is even better equipped to fight ISIS than Saudi Arabia is. ""The Iranians have far more battle experience, particularly with asymmetric warfare, as well as fighting against guerrilla forces,"" he said. But Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute cautions against the U.S. coordinating with Iran. ""Some diplomats might say because the United States and Iran have a mutual interest in seeing ISIS defeated, we should work together. That's like saying because arsonists and firefighters both have an interest in fires, they should work together,"" Rubin says. ""Iran seeks not to defeat terrorism, but swap one flavor for another."" Iran's and Syria's regimes are close, so Iranian involvement would create the ""awkward political problem of what you do with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,"" says Biddle. ""This is not unlike the problem of politics generally. When you build coalitions, not everybody likes every policy."" Analyst: Syria let ISIS grow . The dire situation reflects a success of al-Assad's regime, some analysts say. ""The Syrian regime, backed by Iran, allowed ISIS to proliferate so that they could present the U.S. and Europe with a 'devil you know' choice"" -- pushing against U.S. calls for al-Assad's ouster amid the nation's bloody civil war, argues Rebecca Abou-Chedid of the Truman Project. ""Each of the actors in the region has some kind of responsibility for the position we are in now,"" she adds. ""Ironically, each of those players, Iran included, is looking to the U.S. to fight the monster they created."" Obama's ""core coalition"" may be torn over just what role Syria should play in fighting ISIS, said Justin Logan of the Cato Institute. ""The Gulf Arabs would like very much for Assad to fall, but U.S. airstrikes on his most militarily significant enemy aren't going to help that end. So there's going to be a lot of disagreement about what to do with that problem."" Given U.S. tensions with both Iraq and Syria, incorporating them into a joint effort against ISIS will be ""very complicated diplomatically,"" notes Christopher Chivvis of Rand Corporation. ""The United States is extremely unlikely to cooperate directly with the Assad regime or Iran at this juncture."" The focus, Chivvis said, will be on working with the Peshmerga -- Kurdish forces in northern Iraq -- and with Iraq's own security forces. Analyst: Plan for post-ISIS . Obama has repeatedly called on the Iraqi government to build an inclusive government that brings together Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds. Whether the government does so will be a critical factor in determining whether the country stands up to ISIS and other militants looking to seize power. It's also important to think ahead to what happens if ISIS is defeated, said Abou-Chedid. ""Once ISIS is gone, what will local governance look like in these areas? How will federal governments reassert their presence?"" While ending ISIS' reign of terror is an immediate concern, a long series of problems with Islamist groups in the Middle East and North Africa stemmed from political vacuums in which extremists grabbed power. For governments to succeed after ISIS, particularly in Iraq, they'll have to include people in areas freed from ISIS' grip. ""If the Iraqi government remains dominated by Shia politicians and if Syria remains a failed state,"" said Abou-Chedid, ""this will be impossible."" MAPS: Where do jihadis come from?

"(CNN) -- Nine terror suspects were killed and another was captured in the volatile northwestern Chinese region of Xinjiang on Friday, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported, citing police. No details were immediately available about the deaths in Xinjiang's Hotan prefecture, who the suspects were or what they were accused of doing. Chinese authorities have stepped up security measures in Xinjiang following several recent attacks in the region, which has been the scene of ethnic strife between the indigenous Uyghurs, a mainly Turkic-speaking Muslim population, and Han Chinese. On Monday, a gang wielding knives and axes killed and injured dozens of people in southern Xinjiang, Xinhua reported. Police shot and killed dozens of suspects in that incident, according to Xinhua. A suicide bombing in May killed 39 people at a street market in the region's capital, Urumqi. Another apparent suicide bombing left three dead in April at an Urumqi train station. The Chinese government has blamed recent violent incidents in Xinjiang on Uyghur separatists seeking to establish an independent state. Waves of Han Chinese have flocked to the resource-rich region, fueling tensions with the Uyghurs, who regard themselves as culturally and ethnically closer the people of nations bordering western China, such as Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Xinjiang is now home to more than 8 million Han Chinese, up from 220,000 in 1949, and 10 million Uyghurs. Unemployment among Uyghurs is high, and they complain of discrimination and harsh treatment by security forces.

"(CNN) -- Donald Sterling has agreed to the sale of the Los Angeles Clippers to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, Sterling's attorneys told CNN on Wednesday. Last week, Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly, agreed to sell the franchise to Ballmer for an NBA record $2 billion. The Sterlings are co-owners of the team through a family trust. Donald Sterling initially indicated he would fight the sale and filed a lawsuit against the National Basketball Association. The suit has yet to be withdrawn, attorneys Bobby Samini and Maxwell Blecher, said, but that likely will happen this week. ""Donald Sterling officially announces today, the NBA and Donald Sterling and Shelly Sterling have agreed to sell the Los Angeles Clippers to Steve Ballmer for $2 billion and various additional benefits. All disputes and outstanding issues have been resolved,"" Samini said in a written statement. Blecher said he thought that Sterling worked out a resolution with the league or with Shelly Sterling. The NBA was expected to issue a news release commenting on Wednesday's developments. As of 8 p.m. ET, the NBA had not received a sale agreement with Donald Sterling's signature, a source with detailed knowledge of the negotiations said. The source said Sterling was in a room with his two attorneys, going through the deal. NBA owners still have to approve the sale to Ballmer, who has indicated he would keep the team in Los Angeles. Ballmer, according to Forbes magazine, is worth $20.3 billion. Ballmer has tried to buy a NBA team before. Last year, he and investor Chris Hansen were set to purchase the Sacramento Kings, but the NBA nixed the deal because the duo would have moved the franchise to Seattle. Who is Steve Ballmer? Donald Sterling bought the team in 1981 for $12 million. Sterling's recorded racist remarks to his companion, V. Stiviano, spawned outrage among NBA fans, players and executives. Chief among the latter was NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who banned Sterling from the league, fined him $2.5 million and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise. The recording was posted online by TMZ in late April. In the recording, Sterling argues with Stiviano about how she posted a photo of herself with NBA legend Magic Johnson to Instagram. ""In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" Sterling says. ""If it's white people, it's OK?"" the woman responds. ""If it was Larry Bird, would it make a difference?"" Bird was a Hall of Fame player who played with the Boston Celtics and was a storied rival of Johnson, who played for the Los Angeles Lakers. He also tells her not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos his friends could view. ""Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,"" he said. What to know about Steve Ballmer .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- If India and the United States were Facebook friends, the relationship between the world's two largest democracies would undoubtedly be ""complicated."" It is no secret the two countries have endured a rocky period. And yet, as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrives in India this week, there are clear signs of a rapprochement. In a speech Monday in Washington, Kerry previewed the message he is bringing to New Delhi, echoing President Barack Obama's famous words about India and the U.S. forming this century's ""defining partnership."" For an address that was played out on television screens across India, Kerry cleverly ticked off the key boxes: he praised new Prime Minister Narendra Modi and spoke repeatedly of two confident nations that were ""natural partners ... connected by core values."" Crucially, Kerry talked about boosting trade between the two nations from $100 billion to five times that amount -- a surge that would rank India as a bigger trading partner than France, the United Kingdom, Germany or Japan. Kerry said all the right things. Now it's New Delhi's turn. What will Modi say? World leaders tend to have a wonderful way of exaggerating friendships in public. Everyone is a best friend, a special relation, an age-old ally. Even so, in politics, rhetoric is important; it is certainly a first step toward repairing relations. In fact, one of the goals of Kerry's visit is to lay the groundwork for an even more important visit: when Modi visits the United States in September and meets Obama. There, too, one can expect all the rhetorical niceties of political getting-to-know-one-another. But very soon both sides will also want to see deliverables. That's where things might get tricky. The Carnegie Endowment's Milan Vaishnav says Indo-U.S. ties ""will improve or deteriorate based on the performance of India's economy."" As Vaishnav describes it, the U.S. -- unlike Japan, for example -- does not have a large pool of government money to invest in India; the real money needs to come from private investors, over which Washington has little control. The key, then, will be whether India can make itself an attractive destination to grow money. Can India become an easier place to do business? Can it truly open up the way many other Asian nations have? Can it finally live up to expectations? According to one survey by the networking site LinkedIn, no other country's business leaders are as positive about the global economy as India's. Some 71% of senior business leaders in India expect an improvement in the global economy, up from 51% before Modi was elected in May. By comparison, only 44% of American business leaders and 26% of French business leaders are positive about the world economy. India's business leaders smell opportunity and success. Modi's challenge will be to convert that bullishness into results. Some are wondering whether he's been too slow off the blocks. A Bloomberg View editorial says ""optimism over Modi is evaporating fast."" The Indian Express columnist Pratap Bhanu Mehta wonders whether Modi's government has already lost a sense of credible control. One particularly vexing example is India's handling of the World Trade Organization talks. While most economists agree on the need for speeding up global trade, India -- supported by the likes of Bolivia, Cuba and Venezuela -- emerged as an unlikely roadblock to a global deal last week, seeking instead to retain the ability to stockpile and subsidize grain. Analysts say it was likely a play by Modi to secure farmers' support in rural India. Behind the scenes, Kerry will no doubt pressure Modi to reverse his stance. It may turn out to be yet another hurdle in the relationship. Ultimately, however, Modi's No. 1 priority will be to grow India's economy, and that doesn't hinge solely on foreign investment. Great gains are to be made in cutting red tape, tackling corruption and creating jobs to tap the vast growth potential of India's youthful population. If Modi succeeds in that task, the greatest beneficiaries will of course be Indians but it will also create a rising tide, lifting the United States and the rest of the world. Kerry will know all too well that what is good for Modi and India, will likely be good for Washington as well. At a time when all the world seems like a mess, there are few losers -- and many winners -- if the world's two biggest democracies make nice and hit the reset button.","U.S. secretary of state is visiting India in hopes of improving relations .

"(CNN) -- The deal kind of sounds like a twisted plot line from ""Community"": The makers of a brilliant but canceled TV comedy strike a deal to revive the show with a dotcom business best known as a place to search the Web and check e-mail. But it's true: ""Community,"" canceled by NBC in May, will be revived by Yahoo for a 13-episode sixth season, much to the delight of its dedicated fans. ""I look forward to bringing our beloved NBC sitcom to a larger audience by moving it online,"" ""Community"" creator Dan Harmon said in a statement accompanying the news Monday afternoon. Earlier, he'd teased the announcement on Twitter with the words ""six seasons and a movie,"" a running gag on the series and a goal for it. Yahoo said the episodes would start to premiere -- probably more NBC-style, once a week, than Netflix-style, all at once -- in the fall. Co-star Joel McHale celebrated the news with a two-word tweet: ""Sixth season."" Ken Jeong was a bit wordier: ""It's all because of the fans. The love you have for Community knows no bounds. And we love you right back."" With ""Community,"" Yahoo is buying attention for its new original video efforts and affection from fans of the series. Yahoo has several other TV-style shows in development for the section of its sprawling site called Yahoo Screen. In a statement, Kathy Savitt, the chief marketing officer of Yahoo, praised the show's ""incredibly passionate and loyal fan base who have fought hard to keep this amazing show alive."" ""Community"" avoided cancellation in past years, but when NBC made the decision this time around, the studio that makes the series, Sony Pictures Television, sought other potential distributors and had serious discussions with several. Along with Yahoo, the streaming TV site Hulu and the new cable channel Esquire were interested in reviving the series. Now what about that movie? Jamie Erlicht, the Sony studio's president of programming and production, said ""You can't get to six seasons and a movie without a 6th season. Yahoo is the perfect home for the continuation of this journey."" Sony's other president of programming and production, Zack Van Amburg, told The Hollywood Reporter that a movie was ""not part of our Yahoo conversation."" That said, ""I'd be lying if I told you that we have not had some very early and preliminary conversations that are very exciting about what a potential movie could be and who might direct it. It's early, but it's completely in our thought process,"" he said.","Fan favorite TV show ""Community"" was canceled by NBC in May .

"(CNN) -- Pooping pigeons forced the Kings of Leon to abandon their St. Louis, Missouri, concert after just three songs Friday night, the rock band's management said Saturday. An infestation of the birds in the rafters of the Verizon Amphitheatre bombarded the musicians as soon as they took the stage, according to Andy Mendelsohn of Vector Management. ""Jared (Followill) was hit several times during the first two songs,"" Mendelsohn said of the band's bassist. ""It's not only disgusting -- it's a toxic health hazard. They really tried to hang in there,"" Mendelsohn added. Followill, who describes himself as a ""germophobe,"" said there was already poop on his pedal and carpet when he walked out on stage. The aerial attack began during the opening song -- ""Closer"" -- when he was bombed in the face. His bass tech wiped most of it off with a sanitary wipe, he said. Excrement struck each of his arms over the next two numbers, he said. ""I was hit by pigeons on each of the first three songs,"" he said. ""We had 20 songs on the set list. By the end of the show, I would have been covered from head to toe."" Followill said he couldn't see the pigeons above him and he had no idea how many there were. ""The last thing I was going to do was look up ... but if that was only a couple, we must have caught them right after a big Thanksgiving dinner,"" he quipped. The group was determined to play for St. Louis fans even though they had fair warning earlier about the pigeon problem. Opening bands The Postelles and The Stills came offstage complaining of getting riddled with large amounts of excrement, their publicist said. ""The Kings of Leon decided to carry on regardless,"" they said in a statement released Saturday. ""The band felt it would be unfair to the fans to cancel the show at that late moment."" ""We couldn't believe what The Postelles and The Stills looked like after their sets,"" Followill said. ""We didn't want to cancel the show, so we went for it. We tried to play. It was ridiculous."" Followill's mother called him when she heard from friends at the show that it had been abruptly ended. ""I was attacked, Mom, but not by humans,"" Followill said he told her. Venue managers told the band's representatives earlier Friday about ""a significant pigeon infestation problem with summer shows over the years, but they were doing all they could to fix it,"" the statement said. ""We want to apologize to our fans in St. Louis and will come back as soon as we can,"" Mendelsohn said. Concertgoers were apparently spared the aerial bombardment. ""No fans got pooped on as far as we know,"" the band's publicist said. Verizon Amphitheatre and concert promoter Live Nation did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. The band is set to perform at First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre in Chicago, Illinois, on Saturday night. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.","NEW: Excrement did not hit the fans .

"(CNN) -- Nothing gets conspiracy theorists going more than a passenger plane crashing under mysterious circumstances. In the absence of hard information to explain such disasters, people look for answers, and the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 early Saturday could prompt the same response. TWA Flight 800 fell out of the sky on July 17, 1996, shortly after leaving JFK International Airport, killing all 230 people on board. Recovery and investigative efforts were hampered because TWA 800 went down in the Atlantic. Some soon posited that terrorists armed with surface-to-air missiles had brought down the plane. This theory seemed to be bolstered by eyewitness accounts such as that provided by Naneen Levine, who said she saw something streaking up toward the doomed plane. ""I thought it was something on the beach going straight up."" Three months after the TWA crash, former ABC News correspondent Pierre Salinger, who had once been President John Kennedy's press secretary, weighed in at a news conference that a U.S. Navy ship had brought down TWA 800 with a missile. Salinger came to this conclusion because of a document on the Internet making this claim. Bob Francis, the former vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said of Salinger, ""He was an idiot. ... He didn't know what he was talking about, and he was totally irresponsible."" Opinion: Why so few clues about missing Malaysia flight? After a four-year investigation, the NTSB ruled that the TWA 800 crash was caused by ""an explosion of the center wing fuel tank, resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture in the tank."" Three years after TWA 800 went down, EgyptAir Flight 990 left JFK International and soon plunged into the Atlantic, killing more than 200 people on board. Two competing theories about what happened emerged. The NTSB, widely regarded around the world as the most authoritative investigator of plane crashes, concluded after a three-year investigation that one of the Egyptian pilots, Gameel al-Batouti, had intentionally downed the plane. NTSB pointed to the fact that the downward trajectory of the plane was inconsistent with mechanical failure. Based on the recovered cockpit voice recorder, NTSB also underlined al-Batouti's constant use of the phrase, ""I rely on God,"" and his lack of surprise when the passenger jet suddenly began descending. In Egypt, this was not a popular view, and Egyptian officials pointed to supposed mechanical failure as the cause of the crash. The conspiracy theories that developed around TWA 800 were caused by unreliable eyewitness accounts and Internet rumor-mongering. In the case of EgyptAir 900, Egyptian officials would not accept that an Egyptian pilot would commit suicide, killing many others, and came up with an alternative explanation for which there was scant evidence. In the case of the downing of Pan Am Flight 103, there was a deliberate effort to inject a conspiracy theory into the narrative of the events. Pan Am 103 blew up over Scotland on December 21, 1988, because of a bomb in the hold, which killed 270 on board and others on the ground. Juval Aviv, who presented himself as a former Israeli counterterrorism official, was hired by Pan Am to investigate what happened. In his report, Aviv claimed to have proof that the murder of the passengers on Pan Am 103 was the result of a CIA sting operation that went awry, an assertion for which there was not a shred of evidence. Yet a piece partly based on Aviv's fairy tale then ended up as a cover story in TIME magazine. The U.S. government later concluded that the attack was ordered by the Libyan government, something the Libyans would eventually concede was, in fact, true. The TWA 800, EgyptAir 990 and Pan Am 103 cases represent the likely range of reasons that brought down Malaysia Airlines Flight 370: mechanical failure, pilot actions or terrorism. Based on these past cases, we should be careful not to allow conspiracy theories about what happened to get too much play. The truth will come out only after a careful and lengthy investigation.","Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared early Saturday with more than 200 aboard .

"(CNN) -- They say that to succeed in politics, you need a thick skin, and nowhere is that more true than in Scotland in the run up to the country's long-awaited independence referendum. With just a week to go before Scots go to the polls to decide whether to break away from the rest of the UK, the debate is gearing up across the country -- in pubs and shops, on the street, TV and, of course, online. Most political campaigns become a little bad-tempered at times, but when the stakes are this high, and the discourse goes from sniping to downright nasty and even violent, things can get tough. Even hardened political heavyweights aren't immune: A televised debate between Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, of the ""Yes"" camp, and former UK finance minister Alistair Darling, of the ""Better Together"" campaign, descended into shrillness, name-calling and finger-pointing. And the bitterness isn't just confined to the airwaves, TV studios and newspapers. Pro-union Labour MP Jim Murphy found himself on the receiving end of some real-world nastiness when he was pelted with eggs during his ""100 Streets"" campaign trip. ""What started as individual passionate Nationalists having their say has changed into angry mobs coming along to make sure no one else has their say,"" he explained in a statement. ""This is not about someone throwing an egg -- that's part of the sometimes messy pantomime of politics,"" he said, accusing the ""Yes"" campaign of ""organizing a mob atmosphere at our street meetings. It's coordinated, determined and increasingly aggressive."" Concerned at the angry turn things had taken, Murphy temporarily suspended his tour around the country, insisting that his political opponents ""call off their mobs"" before restarting his campaign days later. Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond and the Yes Scotland campaign both condemned the egg attack. It is in cyberspace where things have really degenerated. John Chalmers, the Moderator of the Church of Scotland, said he was worried that not everyone was managing to keep their tempers under control, and bemoaned the actions of a disproportionate and rancorous ""tiny minority"" online which he said was drowning out the more moderate majority. ""I fear that something ugly may be beginning to permeate the independence debate,"" he said, echoing earlier comments to the BBC that he was ""disturbed by apparent increased aggression and bitterness"" as the referendum date approaches. In one of the most high-profile cases, Christopher Stevenson, a fire safety technician from Glasgow's East End, was convicted of ""behaving in a threatening manner"" towards Salmond on Twitter. Stevenson had posted ""Think I might assassinate Alex Salmond,"" while watching a TV program about the Scottish National Party leader and figurehead of the ""Yes"" campaign. After protesting in court that his outburst was meant as a joke, Stevenson had his sentence deferred for a year for good behavior. But it's not just politicians who've found themselves the target of online ""trolls"": Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling earned the wrath of ""Yes"" supporters in June this year after she donated Â£1 million ($1.61 million) to the ""Better Together"" campaign. John Linklater (@YestoScotland) tweeted: ""I've waited all my life for this. I don't want Scottish Freedom scuppered by a selfish narrow-minded little Englander #jkrowling #indyref"" Scotland's charity watchdog the OSCR launched an investigation into The Dignity Project after a message posted on its Twitter feed (since shut down) abusing the writer: ""What a #bitch after we gave her shelter in our city when she was a single mum."" The charity, which works with vulnerable children in Africa, later issued a statement insisting the account -- which it had thought to be ""obsolete and dormant"" had been hacked by someone ""to satisfy and externalize their own frustration and inner anger."" Rowling, who was born in England but has lived in Edinburgh since the mid-1990s, was well aware her decision to go public about how she planned to vote in the referendum could open her up to abuse. In a blog post announcing her decision, she admitted it could make her unpopular with the ""fringe of nationalists who like to demonize anyone who is not blindly and unquestionably pro-independence,"" and said she feared that some ""Death Eaterish"" voters ""might judge me 'insufficiently Scottish' to have a valid view."" Indeed, Twitter has been a hotbed for some of the worst of the trolling, particularly, some in the media assert, by so-called ""cybernats,"" the pejorative term for the ""Yes"" campaign's vociferous online commentariat. Outspoken Scottish comedian and ""Yes"" supporter Frankie Boyle has been ever-present on Twitter (crude language), adding a sometimes intelligent, sometimes surreal voice to the debate. ""Independence might be a step into the unknown but the known is foodbanks; Trident (The UK's nuclear submarine deterrent); a (privatized) NHS; bedroom tax and exploding AIDS badgers,"" he tweeted. The war for votes has seen tweeting and counter-tweeting flourish, as both sides scrap for every advantage. Online blogs, such as the pro-independence Wings over Scotland, have come under fire for divisive commentary. One piece which attacked Scottish Conservative Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) Alex Johnstone provoked outrage from the ""No"" camp. The politician told STV news: ""The kind of attack that was conducted on the Wings over Scotland site is the kind of thing that's designed to intimidate; it's designed to bully people into not expressing their genuinely held views. We can't allow that to happen."" The site's creator, Stuart Campbell, responded: ""It's the only time we've ever just insulted someone on the website. I think it was entirely justified."" As always, though, the insults can go both ways; a sarcastic piece from conservative news site Breitbart.com's London wing brought howls of outrage, not least in its own comment section. The article, which asserted that Scotland ""is more commonly associated with work-shy dole scroungers and skag-addled prostitutes than with the industriousness of Adam Smith or with its glorious pre-Reformation spirituality,"" suggested that independence might be a good thing, if only to rid the rest of the UK of their ""scrounging Caledonian neighbors."" But while some on both sides tear metaphorical strips off each other in the days leading up to the all-important poll, others have added a lighter note to the campaign, pillorying an ad from the ""Better Together"" campaign, which detractors saw as sexist. A #patronisingBTlady hashtag and attendant slew of memes, and even a reply video (containing some profanity) soon popped up. It's not all bad news though: Some campaigners have recruited animals -- the undisputed stars of the internet -- to their cause, hoping that cuteness, rather than insults, will be enough to win voters over by polling day. .","A week out from Scotland's independence vote, the debate getting heated .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- To the soundtrack of fingers banging on keyboards, a cluster of Internet users recently caught up on their e-mails, updated their statuses on Facebook and looked for love on Match.com. The activity would seem unremarkable in any other Internet cafe except there were no lattes for sale and no soft-rock music being piped over speakers, and the owner of ""the cafe"" is the Cuban government. Read more: 'Forbidden bloggers' The ""navigation hall"" as such establishments are called here, is one of 118 government-run Internet access points that Cuban authorities opened in June, marking a small step towards greater connectivity in a country with some of the lowest percentages of Internet penetration in the Western hemisphere. For high school student Arian Bacallao, the opening of the centers meant his first opportunity to see sites like Youtube, Twitter and Google. ""For a while now I have been trying to find a way to get online, which wasn't that easy to do,"" he said. ""Now that the government's done this, it's a convenient way to find information."" Report: Internet censorship on the up . Convenient, but at $4.50 an hour, hardly cheap. While Cubans who work in the island's small but growing private sector or receive remittances from abroad might be able to afford to go online in the navigation centers, it remains an unimaginable luxury for a state employee who typically makes about $20 a month. ""You have to get the money together, it's not easy,"" said Lisbet Rodriguez, a chef in training who said the high cost of going online meant she could only get online twice each month. ""If it could be just a little faster,"" Rodriguez said as she glanced back at the on-screen clock, which was slowly counting down the time she had left. ""But I'd rather pay four bucks here than $10 to get online in a hotel."" Before the navigation halls opened, Cubans had to enter -- often sneak -- into hotels to use expensive Internet outlets set aside for foreigners. Or they had to ask a favor of a friend who had access through his or her job. Or give a thumb drive full of e-mails to a tourist and hope they would send them once they left Cuba. 'Father of the internet': Why we must fight for its freedom . Even though there are the 118 new halls, there are only a total of 419 computers where people can go online. While that would appear to woefully insufficient for a country of 11 million people, Tania Velazquez Rodriguez, an assistant director with the state-run ETECSA telecommunications company, said so far government officials say they are meeting the relatively small demand for Internet access. Velazquez said currently about 1,000 people each day are using the new centers. But Velazquez said usage is expected to surge should the price drop, a possibility she said Cuban officials were ""studying."" ""Obviously its not enough, we understand that, we know that and we have plans to expand access,"" she said. ""We are working very hard so that by the end of the year we can have more locations."" More locations would more mean information -- a rarity in a country where for most of the last 54 years of the Cuban revolution the only media available was a state-run variety rendered bland and devoid of current events to the point of becoming a running joke in the same populace to which it was force-fed. But with increasing usage of cell phones by Cubans and information carried in to the country one newspaper and magazine a time by travelers from abroad, slowly gaps have appeared in the information wall. ""Today there is news in every direction,"" Miguel Diaz-Canel, Cuba's first vice president and presumptive successor to Raul Castro, said in May. ""People receive it, they know about it. So then the worst thing is to remain silent."" Cubans who use the navigation halls can access social media, foreign news publications and even blogs written by some of the island's dissidents who are highly critical of the government. But before they do, any user of the government Internet has to sign a contract promising not to engage in any subterfuge online that could harm Cuba's ""economy, sovereignty or national security."" ""Obviously, our government promotes certain conduct regarding ethical and moral behaviors,"" said state communications official Velazquez. Ted Henken, an associate professor at Baruch College who was written a book on the emergence of social media in Cuba, said the government is wrestling with the problem of giving greater access while not losing control. ""I thing it's significant in a kind of cat-and-mouse game between the government and the people of Cuba,"" he said, ""Regardless of their political ideology (they) really want to be connected to the 21st century and that means the Internet."" At a Havana navigation hall, retiree Raul Fernandez said he wasn't interested in politics or societal change but in keeping in touch with a brother living in Costa Rica and a son who had moved to Spain. ""You have to spend money but nowadays everything costs something,"" he said of the price tag of his new ability to e-mail with family. ""You have to make the sacrifice."" Still, he said, with his eyes lighting up, what would be even better than a cost reduction would be to one day have Internet service at his home. ""It would be more convenient,"" he explained. ""Then I could communicate whenever I feel like it.""","The Cuban government opened 118 ""navigation halls"" in June .

"Rabun County, Georgia (CNN) -- One look at the landscape and you know why people come here -- running white water, along a portion of the Appalachian Trail. This is Rabun County, Georgia. It was the residents' own best-kept secret until the world discovered it by way of a 1972 movie. The movie, ""Deliverance,"" made tourist dollars flow into the area, but there was one memorable, horrifying male rape scene that lasted a little more than four minutes, but has lasted 40 years inside the hearts and minds of the people who live here. Locals say the film painted the county's residents as deviant, uneducated mountain folk. ""We were portrayed as ignorant, backward, scary, deviant, redneck hillbillies,"" said Rabun County Commissioner Stanley ""Butch"" Darnell. ""That stuck with us through all these years and in fact that was probably furthest from the truth. These people up here are a very caring, lovely people."" This weekend, the film's 40th anniversary will be celebrated at the Chattooga River Festival. A re-release of the iconic film on Blu-ray by Warner Home Video will play at the local drive-in on Saturday. The film tells the story of four big-city guys who take a drive up to northern Georgia to canoe the white water of the Chattooga River that separates Georgia from South Carolina. It's remembered for the dueling banjo scene at the beginning of the film, where one man, played by Ronnie Cox, plays a duet with a local teen, who is portrayed as inbred and mentally challenged. ""Dueling banjos, of course, was iconic, but then there's the rape scene, too,"" Cox said. ""And for a lot of people it became a tough pill to swallow. ""Some people, I think they missed the artistic essence of it (the film), the value of it."" But it's the rape scene that seems to dominate any conversation about the film. ""You were in the middle of the Bible Belt, the biggest thing we had gong back then is we had square dancing at the Mountain City Playhouse,"" said Darnell, the county commissioner. But many people, like Billy Redden, say the local folks should put this behind them. The 40th anniversary means a lot to him. He's 56 now, but 40 years ago, he was a student who was asked to play the ""Banjo boy"" after the film's producers found him on a visit to his high school. ""I don't think it should bother them. I think they just need to start realizing that it's just a movie. It's not like it's real,"" said Redden, who still lives in Rabun County. But despite any negative stereotypes, the Rabun County Convention and Visitor's Bureau says more than a quarter-million people flock to the area each year to shoot the same rapids they saw come to life on the big screen. The South: Not all Bubbas and banjos . ""It essentially started the white-water rafting industry in the Southeast, "" said Larry Mashburn, who owns Southeastern Expeditions, a rafting company. County officials say tourism brings in $42 million a year in revenue, which makes for a huge surplus for a county whose operating budget is about $17 million. These days, the county has an 80% high school graduation rate, and its average home price is more than $300,000. ""It's allowed us to do things with our education system, with all these different services that we offer, we could not have offered,"" Darnell said. The area has become a playground for high-end homeowners with lakefront property in the multimillion-dollar range on places like Lake Burton, which has 62 miles of shoreline. ""Once people come to Rabun County, they don't want to leave,"" said Debra Butler, a real estate agent. ""This is a lifestyle that you have here. It's a way of life. 'Deliverance' depicts a backwoods, inbred kind of community. That is not Rabun County."" Indeed, downtown shops and art galleries convey an image far from anything portrayed in the 1972 film. Jeanne Kronsoble's Main Street Gallery in Clayton shows off a wide range of contemporary folk artists, many self-taught. She's been open for 28 years. ""I became interested in contemporary folk art because of the things I'd seen up here,"" she said. ""When people build houses and they come here, they need art on their walls."" Most believe ""Deliverance"" got it all started. But despite this prosperity, the 40-year pain has managed to hang on, because so many people saw a fictional film. ""There are lots of people in Rabun County that would be just as happy if they never heard the word, 'Deliverance' again,"" Darnell said.","The 1972 movie ""Deliverance"" was shot in Rabun County, Georgia .
The film spurred hard-to-shake stereotypes of ""ignorant"" and ""deviant"" mountain dwellers .

"(CNN) -- A newborn baby boy who was found alive inside a toilet pipe in Jinhua, China, has been released from a hospital and taken home by his maternal grandparents, police said. The child's mother is still being treated at the hospital, but has been cooperating with the investigation, Xiang Jiangsong, a police official, said Thursday. The police are labeling the case an ""accident"" at this time, and no charges have been filed against the mother. Dramatic video of the infant's rescue made global headlines and sparked reactions worldwide. Unable to pull the infant out, rescuers went to a floor below the toilet and sawed away a section of pipe to gain access from there. Still unable to extract the infant, rescuers detached the section of pipe with the infant inside and took it to the hospital. Working together, rescuers and doctors used pliers and gingerly tore away bits of the pipe. CCTV video showed the exact moment hands in white gloves gingerly pulled away a part of the pipe to reveal the newborn's face. The infant, a boy referred to as ""Baby 59,"" was drinking formula, doctors said. Police said firefighters and other rescuers involved visited the baby at the hospital and sent clothes, formula powder and diapers. The mother's account . The mother of the infant is not being identified, but local police say she is 22. Police say that, so far, they believe her account of how the baby ended up in the pipe. ""That day she felt stomachaches,"" said Jiang Song, the vice director of police. ""So she went to the toilet. It was actually close to her due date and the baby just slid out."" Police questioned the woman, who told them that she did not intend for the child to fall into the toilet, according to a local TV channel that was posted on the official police Weibo account. The police said she tried to retrieve the baby with a stick, then decided to flush the toilet to clear away the blood. Police: Young mother was embarrassed . A police officer in Pujiang County, in which the incident took place, told a journalist working for CNN that the unmarried woman broke up with her boyfriend six months ago. The officer refused to give his full name to the reporter, identifying himself only as Fang. According to Fang, the young woman was embarrassed to have a child as a single woman and felt nervous, so after the baby fell in the toilet, she called her landlord and told him that she'd heard crying, Fang said. The landlord saw the baby and called police, the officer said, adding that the woman later begged police not to tell her story to anyone, including her parents, because she didn't want public attention, according to the officer. The mother's parents have agreed to help the mother take care of the baby, and police have identified a man they believe is the father. The police are conducting blood tests to confirm paternity, the officer told CNN. Fang said that the mother has legal custody of the child and can decide if she wants help from the baby's father.

Jewel made the announcement herself on her blog on July 2, explaining that she and Murray, whom she calls her ""husband, friend and partner of 16 years,"" preferred for the world to hear about their impending divorce directly. ""Ty and I have always tried to live the most authentic life possible, and we wanted our separation as husband and wife to be nothing less loving than the way we came together,"" Jewel writes.

Jewel and Murray, a professional rodeo cowboy, married in 2008 after dating for 10 years. They welcomed their only child, son Kase, in 2011. ""Oddly the very thing that Ty and I sought in coming together is the very thing we seek in separating,"" Jewel says in her blog. ""We both value growth. And growth became tragically and undeniably stifled as a couple, and we believe we can find it again in setting each other free. We truly believe we can find greater happiness apart than together, and this is why we are taking the enormous and heartbreaking step of divorce."" As she shared her news, Jewel also thanked her fans for supporting her throughout her career -- flaws and all. ""I am forever grateful for the acceptance and compassion I found in my fan base as I shared my deepest hurts and shames along side my moments of inspiration and truth,"" the singer says. ""I have learned in these 20 years of living my life honestly in front of you to trust that you will all honor and have reverence for how difficult this journey is, and allow us our process as we not only grieve the loss of our marriage, but also as we recreate ourselves in the ashes."" While Jewel did most of the talking in the lengthy update, she and her husband did give a joint statement as well: . ""Our dedication to our son is unwavering and we are both committed to being the best partners in raising our son,"" the couple say. ""Due to the spirit in which we have gone about this separation, we trust we can remain dear friends who hold each other in high esteem, which is so important to us as parents, as we wish only what is best for our son.""","Jewel shares that she and husband Ty Murray are divorcing .

"(CNN) -- A road trip, Melissa McCarthy and a drunken Susan Sarandon. Sounds like a recipe for a summer blockbuster, right? That's what McCarthy and her husband, Ben Falcone, are hoping to pull off with their July 2 comedy, ""Tammy."" The pair co-wrote and co-produced the feature about an unhinged woman who's suffered a job loss and an unfaithful husband in too short a time span. McCarthy stars as the titular troubled Tammy, while Falcone took a seat in the director's chair for the first time. And according to the duo, they have a peculiar dream to thank for their inspiration. ""Apparently (Falcone) goes and has really strange dreams about alcoholic grandmothers, but it's working out great for us,"" McCarthy joked at the movie's June 30 premiere. ""I know it sounds a little bit creepy,"" Falcone added, ""but I came downstairs and I just told Melissa, 'Would you want to do a road trip movie?' And ""a mere seven years later,"" here they are, with ""Tammy"" having ridden McCarthy's reputation for perfectly executed physical comedy right to the top of this summer's ""must-see"" list. The only nightmare in the realization of their literal dream comedy is that the critics aren't laughing. Variety's called it ""a well-meaning personal project that never rises above the level of amiable mediocrity,"" and The San Francisco Chronicle wasn't any kinder. ""There's only one genuinely funny scene in 'Tammy,' and of course it's the first."" Rather than a production team, the Chronicle continues, ""Tammy"" needed ""an intervention."" IndieWire thought the marketing campaign's emphasis on just one scene -- you know the one, where she's robbing a fast-food restaurant of its pie -- was because if ""anyone understood what the actual movie consisted of, they'd probably stay away in droves. ... 'Tammy' is a boring, unfunny road movie that limps along idly, consisting of a string of nonsensical set pieces and halfhearted stabs at character development that come across as off-putting and odd. As soon as our screening ended, a woman behind us sighed and said, 'That was uncomfortable.' We couldn't agree more."" The Hollywood Reporter doesn't expect ""Tammy"" to have a long ride through the summer, suspecting that McCarthy's fans will show up initially before the title fizzles out. ""The film progresses from merely unfunny to unconvincing to dull,"" THR reviews. ""It's a waste of a good cast as well as a serious trip wire for McCarthy, who may know what's best for her talents but, on the evidence, needs a deft-handed outsider to make sure she's maximizing them."" No wonder Entertainment Weekly sympathetically acknowledges that ""it's hard out here for a Tammy."" The movie's script is ""lumpy"" and the supporting actors ""never quite get to tap into what they can do,"" EW observes, but at the very least, ""even when the material falls short, (McCarthy's) never not worth watching.""

"(EW.com) -- It's all part of the plan. The twerking. The tongue. The tattoos. Miley Cyrus is a ""strategic hot mess,"" and we love it. Chronicling her triumphs and struggles for four months, MTV took a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the life of Cyrus leading up to and after her controversial performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards for Wednesday's ""Miley: The Movement."" From the funny moments with her mom to catching up with Britney Spears, the documentary captured her most candid moments. Here are five things we learned from the ""Bangerz"" singer on her journey with MTV. Paula Patton reacts to Miley Cyrus' VMAs performance: 'I didn't get the big deal' 1. Miley's not transitioning, she's growing. Miley is still Miley. While critics have labeled her current phase as a ""transition,"" the former ""Hannah Montana"" star maintains it's always been her. ""I'm the same human, I've got the same heart I had five years ago,"" she says. ""All the things about me are the same — same skin, same human — so it's not a transition. It's a movement, it's a growth, it's a change."" 2. Miley has doubts too. Yes, Miley had some reservations along the way. After debuting her single ""We Can't Stop,"" there was a moment when she questioned whether her single was going to break through. ""You can never be sure when it comes to your first single,"" Cyrus said. ""You can always think, 'this is going to be the biggest song in the world,' and it's not going to happen."" However, Cyrus went into full promo for the song, and the rest is history, with ""We Can't Stop"" hitting No. 1. Miley Cyrus to 'Harper's Bazaar': 'I'm an adult and I'm acting like a kid' 3. Miley's mom is her homey. While it was questionable where then-fiancé Liam Hemsworth and dad Billy Ray Cyrus were in this documentary, the bond between Miley and Tish was evident. ""My Mom is my homey! If I win, then she wins — not because she's my manager, but because she's my mom,"" the singer explained. ""I think she keeps me, like, less anxious, because I do get so overwhelmed when I'm gonna perform, because everything has to be perfect."" As Miley's antics were examined with a fine-tooth comb, Tish maintained her spot as Miley's support system. ""Anyone that's ever said, 'Where's her mother?' the answer is 'right beside her,'"" Tish said. ""Through good, through bad, through arguments, through crying, through I don't care what — right there."" 4. Pharrell Williams is Miley's mentor. Supporting Miley throughout her career, Pharrell was the one who suggested the singer chop off her locks. ""You have to remember this a 20-year-old evolving,"" Williams said. ""Her dad is Billy Ray Cyrus, her godmother is Dolly Parton, and she's raised in the era of 'hip-hop is king.' So when people go and look and ask, 'Why is she twerking, why is she doing this?' It's because she's a by-product of America."" Miley Cyrus' VMA foam finger available for all your Halloween needs . 5. Miley is strategic and detail-oriented. Miley truly showcased her strong attention to detail as an artist when she grew frustrated after her plans for a grand entrance on the red carpet at the MTV VMAs fell apart. ""Everything we do has to be a moment,"" Cyrus said. ""If I'm going to do it, it has to be the best, so every detail seems much more magnified to me. I can easily let little things that don't matter to me that much shut me down completely.""\ . There were a few questions still left to ponder: Where was Billy? Where was Liam?

"(CNN) -- After the surprisingly harsh response from some conservatives to my statement honoring President Nelson Mandela, I replied last week with a question to his critics: What would you have done, in his place, faced with a crushing apartheid regime determined to eliminate all rights for your race? Mandela, I pointed out, was fighting for the same freedoms we in America defend most forcefully. Those who don't want to honor him seem to judge by a double standard. These critics on the right, however, are a relatively minor group. We heard no major conservative leaders or publications repeating their misguided claims. Compare that with the crass manner in which the mainstream left has seized on Mandela's death to smear Ronald Reagan as having somehow ""embraced"" apartheid. Many of the Mandela remembrances have noted Reagan's veto of economic sanctions against South Africa as well as the State Department's addition of the African National Congress to the terrorist list -- saying this proves Reagan supported apartheid. As someone who at the time was immersed in the debate over South Africa as a member of Congress, I can attest that this is a slanderous mischaracterization of the Reagan policy. Reagan's chief concern in South Africa was to prevent the country from falling to communism, a priority in line with his chief foreign policy goal worldwide. But Reagan was also part of a new generation of conservatives who were committed to confronting apartheid after decades of what was frankly a disappointing lack of courage on the American right. A few dozen Republicans in Congress, I among them, were some of the first conservatives to approach the problem seriously. The climax of our effort in the House was passing economic sanctions against South Africa. As many liberal commentators have noted in the past few days, Reagan vetoed that bill, only to have Congress override his veto. But Reagan's critics are wrong to say his opposition to economic sanctions made him pro-apartheid. He disagreed with our group of activist Republicans in Congress over tactics, not over the aim of ending the institution. The President was absolutely committed to that goal, even if some of our other conservative colleagues were not. Reagan ""detested"" apartheid, as he wrote in his diary and said publicly, but thought sanctions would be counterproductive to ending it. In particular, he believed punishing South Africa economically would only have ""hurt the very blacks we're trying to help."" This was a position Reagan shared with Gatsha Buthelezi, the head of the Zulus, among other black South Africans. Our disagreement over sanctions, as Reagan said in his remarks after the veto override, ""was not whether or not to oppose apartheid but, instead, how best to oppose it and how best to bring freedom to that troubled country."" Reagan's veto of that bill, moreover, was not the sum total of his record on the issue. For one thing, as his former speechwriter Peter Robinson recalled last week, ""Reagan himself imposed sanctions against the South African government, issuing an executive order that curtailed military and official relations between the U.S. and Pretoria."" These steps hurt the racist regime directly, not the poor majority. In addition to his own sanctions, one of the president's first foreign policy steps was to send a close aide, William Clark, to South Africa to oppose apartheid. There, as four Reagan biographers wrote recently in The Washington Post, ""an unsmiling Clark told Prime Minister Pieter W. Botha to his face that the new president and administration 'abhorred apartheid,' "" and ended up walking out on him. Reagan later appointed Edward Perkins as the first U.S. black ambassador to South Africa, a move that from the perspective of the apartheid regime was highly provocative. In fact, it infuriated Botha. Perkins later recounted that when he presented his credentials to the prime minister, the white South African was shaking in anger. The only modern equivalent might be appointing a woman ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Reagan was not silent about the imprisonment of Mandela, either. He argued in a 1986 speech that ""Nelson Mandela should be released to participate in the country's political process"" and counted this step as a ""necessary component of progress toward political peace."" This is not the record left-wing pundits looking to smear Reagan have been presenting. There were too many Republicans who were on the wrong side of the apartheid issue. Despite those who are abusing the death of a peacemaker to indulge their hatred of another former president, Ronald Reagan was not among them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Newt Gingrich.","Newt Gingrich: A few conservatives objected to my tribute to Nelson Mandela .
He replied asking what would they have done were they in Mandela's shoes .

"(CNN) -- It was about eight months into her fight with heart cancer that 24-year-old Maire Kent knew she was going to die. In November 2012, Kent was diagnosed with cardiac sarcoma, a rare and aggressive form of cancer. By the end of September 2013, she was gone. But it's what happened in the final weeks of her life that made her friends and family feel as if she's still around. ""I met her by chance, actually,"" filmmaker Keith Famie told CNN. ""I went to the hospital because I was having some chest pains and we ended up having the same doctor. Our conversations took off from there."" Famie happened to be working on a documentary about how people deal with the end of life. So he and Kent decided to document the last leg of her life and her final wishes. Inspired by her favorite children's book, ""Paddle to Sea,"" in which a boy carves a wooden boat and sets it free in the Great Lakes, Kent turned to her family and said, ""I want to do that. I want to go to the ocean. Cremate me and put my ashes in a boat. I want to go from Lake Michigan to the Atlantic Ocean."" ""She wanted to create a dialogue about cardiac sarcoma,"" her older brother Geoff Kent told CNN. ""Her dream was to be a nurse, because she loved helping people. She knew she wasn't going to live to achieve that, so this was her way of helping people after she died. We all know someone with cancer."" Sarcoma is a rare type of cancer, and cardiac sarcoma even rarer, according to Dr. Monika Leja, a cardiologist in Ann Arbor, Michigan, who treated Kent, a former Army private. ""It can grow from any part of the body, even connective tissues. It usually happens to very healthy, young, individuals,"" Leja told CNN. ""A purely genetic disease that's rapid growing. It's kind of like having a ticking time bomb in your body and no one is recognizing it."" Three weeks before Kent's life ended, the plans to get her ashes to the Atlantic Ocean began. And Famie was there to document the whole thing. ""It was just a little 3Â½-foot boat carved out of wood by a totally blind carpenter. That's what she wanted to have her ashes put in,"" Famie said. ""The hope was that, with the help of strangers, she would have her dream come true. As it turns out, it was kind of like the Olympic torch. People wanted to be part of this journey."" An unpredictable journey that -- keeping true to the story in ""Paddle to the Sea""-- would only work with the help of people Kent never met. To encourage the support, Kent had her family write a message on the small sail of the handcrafted wooden boat: . ""My name is Maire. I died of cardiac sarcoma cancer. My ashes are enclosed in this boat and I am on my way to the ocean. If you find me, please send me back on my path. I'll bless you from Heaven."" The boat set sail in Lake Michigan and in the weeks that followed, Kent's ashes would travel by water and over land, riding on everything from planes to trains to the sidecars of motorcycles. ""Cancer is really everybody's story,"" Famie told CNN. ""And Maire knew that. Once the journey started, it was incredible watching people engage the boat. It created a dialogue of life after death. We knew it would resonate with people but we had no idea it would be this strong."" People helped on a whim, like Burton Bogart, who jumped into the Erie Canal to rescue Kent's small boat, which had become stuck in the brush on the riverbank and was at risk of being lost. ""So he runs down the bank of a river, takes his clothes off, swims down the canal and releases her. And people are all clapping and cheering,"" Famie said, remembering the scene. ""But then the boat stops again, directly under this group of 40 people watching it all from a balcony above the river. And I can see this woman is really upset."" Along with Kent's written message on the boat's sail were 12 random names of people Famie had chosen from across the country who, like Kent, had died from cancer. One of the names was George Davis. ""The women turns to me and says, 'George Davis? That was my dad's name. He died 20 years ago from lung cancer,'"" Famie said. ""It turns out in life, chance encounters aren't so chance at all."" Before she died, Maire Kent said, ""You can't really predict your own future. There's always a road that's going to pop up out of nowhere. And that's why life is a journey."" On July 26, in New York harbor, her journey ended when her ashes made it to the Atlantic Ocean, just as the sun was setting. ""When Maire told me she wanted to do this, I promised her that we'd get her there. And we did,"" Famie said. ""In that little gleaming moment you just knew that you were doing something that was supposed to be done for somebody. It is a transcendental journey. Maire, who nobody knew, so many people will meet."" Mom sews a new dream after toddler's death . Teen who inspired many with 'Clouds' song passes .

"New York (CNN) -- It's not your imagination: Our dysfunctional divided Congress is the least productive and least popular in recent history. Some congressmen walk the halls like members of rival gangs. The simple job of reasoning together seems out of reach. A few good men and women -- like Sens. Joe Lieberman and Olympia Snowe -- have decided to retire rather than subject themselves to this disheartening Kabuki theater. The system is broken. But what can we do to fix it? The good news is that it doesn't have to be this way. In the past, divided government presided over ambitious accomplishments like the Marshall Plan and the creation of the interstate highway system. Ronald Reagan's accomplishments occurred while liberal Tip O'Neill ran the House of Representatives. President Bill Clinton and then-Speaker Newt Gingrich didn't get along at all personally, but together they achieved welfare reform and balanced the budget. We need to change the culture of Washington to encourage more constructive and more civil behavior -- and that means changing the way the game is played. Congressional reform might not sound all that sexy on the surface, but if you are frustrated with Washington's chronic dysfunction, you should care enough to help propose new solutions. That's why it was heartening to see a Senate hearing by the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee this week devoted to congressional reform. It had the overly officious name ""Raising the Bar for Congress: Reform Proposals for the 21st century."" But beneath the congressional-ese were some strikingly common sense ideas, some of which were first proposed by the organization No Labels, which I helped co-found in 2010. It is a group of Democrats, Republicans and independents united in the belief that hyper-partisanship is hurting our country because it is stopping us from solving the serious problems we face. Here are three of the ideas proposed that could help heal the hyper-partisan gridlock afflicting Washington. 1) No Budget, No Pay -- This proposal would provide some personal incentive for senators and representatives do to something basic: Pass a budget on time. But the sad fact is that it has been more than 1,000 days since Congress passed a joint budget resolution, which is why we keep playing chicken with a government shutdown over continuing resolutions. What's worse is that this failure has become standard operating procedure. Congress has passed a budget on time only four times since 1952 and, for the past decade and a half, annual budgets have been an average of four months late. Some members of Congress complain that having their $174,000-a-year salary docked until they pass a budget would unfairly penalize them. But we need to apply some reasonable pressure to focus Congress' collective mind. No Budget, No Pay is a good place to start. 2) Filibuster Reform -- Think back to the classic movie ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" and you'll remember the filibuster scene, the high drama of watching Jimmy Stewart stand alone on the Senate floor trying to alert the nation to a miscarriage of justice. But the filibuster has turned in recent years from an extraordinary event to a routine parliamentary maneuver, designed to block legislation from ever receiving an up or down vote without a supermajority in favor. Opinion: Imagine a Congress that can do great things . Here's a reality check. In the first 50 years of the convening of Congress, the filibuster was used 35 times. In the last two years, it has been used more than 100 times. The system is broken and being abused. ""Back in the 1960s, senators had to risk their bladder to filibuster,"" Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tennessee, once told me. ""Now no senator has skin in the game. They just ask a staffer to file paperwork."" A simple procedural rule change to return the filibuster to its roots would mean an end to gridlock. 3) Up or Down Vote in 90 Days -- Since the Clinton era, we've seen an increase in White House nominations getting blocked before they ever get a chance to have an up or down vote. In 2010, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, single-handedly blocked 70 nominations to get more spending for his state. In 2011, more than 200 presidential appointments were left open, including the directorship of FEMA and key positions at the Fed and Treasury as well as federal judgeships. Both parties do it. The Democrats disgracefully blocked President Bush's judicial nominees, including Miguel Estrada. Failing to confirm federal appointments leaves important offices unfilled and good people who want to serve their country stranded on the sidelines. The solution is a rule change that would give the Senate 90 days to advise and consent -- but if they can't get their act together, the nominee would be automatically approved so government work can go on. Opinion: What's wrong with Congress? It's not big enough . These are just a few congressional proposals that have been put forward. You should start proposing a few of your own. After all, no party, person or organization has a monopoly on good ideas. The key is to focus your frustration with Congress in a constructive direction. With their approval numbers at a historic low, who knows? They just might feel enough pressure to start taking citizens' advice. As Sen. Joe Lieberman said at the hearing: ""We can't just hope and pray for a miraculous political awakening. There's not going to be some spontaneous cultural change in Congress. It's got to be forced."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon says a Senate hearing on reforming Congress was a positive step .
He says members of Congress shouldn't be paid until they can pass a budget .
The Senate should have to vote presidential appointees up or down in 90 days, he says .
Avlon: The old practice of a filibuster requiring continuous talk should be brought back ."
"(CNN) -- ""You didn't build that."" That July comment by President Barack Obama was the cornerstone of this year's Republican National Convention. Republicans have seized on the phrase -- a seemingly stray clause in a line Obama delivered at a campaign stop in Virginia -- as a kind of Freudian slip that reveals the president's hostility to free enterprise. The statements: . The phrase ""We Built It"" was the backdrop for speaker after speaker during Tuesday night's convention proceedings, and speakers have invoked it to paint Obama as an out-of-touch, big-government liberal. ""That makes me think that Barack Obama has a problem with the American dream,"" GOP Chairman Reince Priebus said Tuesday. ""He said, 'You didn't build it.' Translation: 'It doesn't rightly belong to you,' "" former Arkansas governor and 2008 presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee chimed in Wednesday. House Speaker John Boehner delivered what may have been the most epic recounting of the line, putting it in the context of his family's Cincinnati tavern: ""Now, let's say a guy walked into our bar, and before he could say anything, he overheard a regular telling his story,"" Boehner said Tuesday night. ""Turns out this guy ran a small business, got involved in it while he was in school. Then, out of nowhere, his business partner died. They had just one customer. So he fought like hell through sleepless nights and close calls ... Now, if a guy walked into a bar and heard that story, and he said, 'Well, if you've got a business, you didn't build that,' well, you know what we'd do with him, don't you? We'd throw him out."" Vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan invoked it in his acceptance speech Wednesday, praising small business owners who show up ""to open the door at 5 in the morning."" ""Nobody did their thinking, and worrying, and sweating for them,"" Ryan said. ""After all that work, and in a bad economy, it sure doesn't help to hear from their president that government gets the credit. What they deserve to hear is the truth: Yes, you did build that."" The clips that ran between speakers at the GOP convention took things further, heavily editing Obama's remarks to set up television-ready vignettes with business owners who took umbrage at the comment. ""Look, if you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own. You didn't get there on your own. I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else ... If you've got a business -- you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen,"" was what delegates heard over the PA system. Fact Check: Trimming the Pentagon . The facts: . Obama's remark came at a July 13 speech at a firehouse in Roanoke, Virginia, where he attacked Republican opposition to his economic plans and defended the role of government in promoting economic growth. It is true that he used the phrase, ""you didn't build that."" Here is the full text: . ""Look, if you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own,"" he said. ""You didn't get there on your own. I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something -- there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there. ""If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. ""If you've got a business -- you didn't build that,"" he continued. ""Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn't get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the internet. The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together. There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don't do on our own."" So there it is. Everything before and after ""You didn't build that"" refers to infrastructure, education and public services. Obama released a rebuttal to the criticism within two weeks of his Roanoke appearance. In a television spot, the president tells viewers, ""Of course Americans build their own business. Everyday hardworking people sacrifice to meet a payroll, create jobs, and make our economy run. And what I said was that we need to stand behind them, as America always has. By investing in education, training, roads and bridges, research and technology."" He called ads that used the edited version of his remarks ""flat-out wrong."" Fact Check: Most Americans think today's kids will do worse? The conclusion: . It's a classic example of a remark being taken out of context. CNN's Matt Smith, Amy Roberts and Christine Brazill contributed to this report.","Obama's ""You didn't build that"" line was the heart of the GOP convention attack .
Republicans say the attack reveals Obama's disdain for entrepreneurs .

"Doha, Qatar (CNN) -- CNN's Nic Robertson had tough questions for Hamas's political leader. Khaleed Meshaal is known as Hamas' external deal-maker and a fund-raiser from supporters in the region, a role the 58-year-old has held since 2004. Robertson interviewed Meshaal over the weekend in Qatar, where he lives. Here are some highlights from the interview. Firing rockets from neighborhoods . Robertson asked Meshaal why Hamas is firing rockets from civilian neighborhoods. Meshaal answered with numbers. ""How many Israeli civilians have our rockets killed? Israel knows the number. Meanwhile, how many Palestinians has Israel killed? Up until now have been killed 1700 people, while we have killed 63 soldiers. We kill soldiers, while they kill civilians."" (The Palestinian death toll as of Monday was at least 1,856, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Sixty-four Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel had been killed, according to Israeli officials.) Robertson then asked Meshaal to respond to critics who say Hamas is using civilian deaths to gain international sympathy. Meshaal called that a lie and said Hamas is not seeking international sympathy through its own victims. ""It is unfortunate that the American administration and President Obama have adopted the Israeli narrative, which is a lie. Hamas sacrifices itself for its people and does not use its people as human shields to protect its soldiers. The fighter, just like the soldier in the army, his job is to protect the people, and not to sacrifice the people for himself."" Hamas' cause . Meshaal said Israel has a powerful military but the Palestinians will triumph. ""We are stronger than they are in the justness of our cause. We are the rightful owners of the land, and they are the thieves of the land. We are the victims and they are the murderers. But despite this, we might not win a battle or two completely, but at the end we will win the war. Our steadfastness is a victory. For us to kill their soldiers while they kill our civilians is also a victory for the Palestinian cause and Hamas."" Robertson pressed Meshaal on the point, asking how this can be a victory for Hamas and its cause when so many Palestinians are dying. ""Our people are convinced today that the only way to get rid of the occupation and establish their state is through resistance."" Cease-fire . Robertson wanted to know whether Hamas would ever accept Israel's right to exist and agree to a cease-fire. ""We're ready for a cease-fire. We want the war to end today, and we did not attack anyone. It was (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu who transferred the crisis of what happened in the West Bank to Gaza. He's the one responsible for this. We're ready to stop this war."" (The killing of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank triggered the current crisis.) Egyptian talks . Hamas has agreed to cease-fires through Egyptian mediators ""many times"" since 2003, Meshaal said. ""The Israelis, the Egyptians and the American administration know (this), otherwise John Kerry would not have intervened this time nor (former Secretary of State) Mrs. Hillary Clinton in 2012. They know that Hamas is very credible in that if its leadership promised something, it will fulfill its promise, and the fighters on the ground will follow that."" He said he is still willing to engage in talks with Egyptians acting as the go-betweens. ""Regardless what the others' positions (are), we stated that we are ready to go as a Palestinian delegation to Cairo in order to talk to the Egyptians so they can hold indirect talks between us and the Israelis, so we can reach an agreement that will address our Palestinian demands, headed by ending the siege of Gaza. Then cease-fire can take place. We announced this position before and we are still committed to it."" Peace negotiations . Hamas is not to blame for the lack of a solution, he said. ""We the Palestinian people have, since 1948, have listened to the international community and U.N. and international regulations, in the hope they end the aggression against us. But the international community failed in ending the Israeli occupation and failed in helping our people to have self-determination and have its own state. Even the latest (peace) negotiations, between (Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud) Abbas and Netanyahu with Kerry as the broker, were sabotaged by Netanyahu."" Calls for cease-fires .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A retired Libyan general whose movement launched an assault on Islamist militias in Benghazi and demanded the suspension of parliament has called for a new council to take over the running of the country. Khalifa Haftar said Wednesday that the General National Congress, the interim parliament, had failed the people and that its mismanagement of the country had turned Libya into ""a state sponsor of terror... and a hideout for terrorists."" He made his call for a new, civilian council to take its place during a televised news conference in Benghazi. On Sunday, armed men claiming allegiance to Haftar's newly formed movement, known as the Libyan National Army, stormed parliament and announced they had suspended it. Haftar said Wednesday that since the parliament had refused to ""fulfill the demands of the people,"" he was asking the Higher Judicial Council to appoint a civilian council to lead the country, in the interests of political stability and security. This council, he said, would have three main tasks: appointing a caretaker emergency government, overseeing the upcoming parliamentary elections and handing over power to the new parliament. The country's electoral commission announced that elections would be held next month, the state news agency LANA reported Tuesday, in what seemed to be a move to try to ease tensions that drove Libya to the brink in recent days. Haftar said his forces would secure the country during the transitional period and after that. The declared goal of the LNA is to eradicate Islamist militants from Libya, including Ansar al-Sharia -- the group blamed for the September 11, 2012 deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. Air force, navy chiefs back Haftar's movement . This week, Haftar's so-called ""Operation Dignity,"" which he has described as an open-ended war on terrorism in Libya, seemed to gain more support from military units, officials and armed groups across the country. Haftar's men last week launched a land and air offensive against the Benghazi bases of Ansar al-Sharia and other Islamist groups with ties to the government in Tripoli. The resulting battle killed 75 people and wounded 141 more. The chiefs of staff of the Libyan Air Force and the navy have announced they are endorsing Operation Dignity. According to LANA, the headquarters of the chief of staff of the air force came under attack by unknown gunmen on Tuesday night, a short while after the announcement was made. There were no reported casualties in the attack, but damage was caused and offices looted and ransacked. On Wednesday morning, the navy chief survived an assassination attempt in Tripoli when a car with unknown assailants opened fire on his convoy. Gen. Hasan Abushnaq, his two guards and driver sustained minor injuries in the attack. Those who oppose Haftar, including the government and members of the General National Congress, have accused him of a ""coup attempt."" His call for a ""civilian"" council to run the country appeared to be a response to these accusations, made amid much speculation about his political ambitions. Asked whether his movement was receiving support from Arab Gulf states or any other country, Haftar said they were depending only on ""God and the Libyan people."" Some see Haftar's campaign as an opportunistic strategy capitalizing on Libyans' growing discontent with a weak central government and the deteriorating security situation in the country. Haftar was once a general in the Libyan army under dictator Moammar Gadhafi but had a falling out with him and emigrated to the United States, where he lived for almost 20 years. He returned in 2011 to participate in the revolution to overthrow Gadhafi. He has since criticized the government for not getting a grip on violence, particularly from Islamist groups. Reflecting the continuing state of lawlessness and chaos, explosions and gunfire echoed across the capital in the early hours of Wednesday. Eyewitnesses said a number of rockets hit areas in southern and eastern Tripoli. However, it was not clear who was involved in the attacks or whether there were casualties in what appeared to be inter-militia fighting, something not uncommon in the city.","Retired Libyan general calls for new, civilian council to replace interim parliament .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Agriculture Department cited drought and heat on Wednesday in designating 597 counties in 14 states as primary natural disaster areas. ""As drought persists, USDA will continue to partner with producers to see them through longer-term recovery, while taking the swift actions needed to help farmers and ranchers prepare their land and operations for the upcoming planting season,"" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement. The designations make qualified farmers in the areas eligible for low-interest loans, the agency said. Affected counties have suffered severe drought for eight consecutive weeks, which qualified them for the automatic designation. Richard Oswald, a 62-year-old farmer in Missouri's Atchison County, said he has been hit hard by the drought but was not sure whether he would take advantage of the drought designation for his county by getting a low-interest loan. ""The hay situation is not good; the pastures burned up early because of the heat and lack of rain,"" said Oswald, who was born on a farm and has been farming since he was a teenager. ""This is the worst drought that I have ever seen. An emergency loan is great, but it's still borrowed money, and as a farmer, that's not good because you have to pay it back."" Chad Breiner of Wabaunsee County, Kansas, said the drought has affected his bull-selling business because he uses grass for feed and has to buy hay. ""The fact that it hasn't rained significantly since June is going to make 2013 look rather bleak because the ponds are low, the creeks are low, and without adequate moisture in the next few months when grazing comes up, our production is going to be significantly less than normal,"" he said. Last year, the USDA designated 2,245 counties in 39 states, or 71 percent of the United States, as disaster areas due to drought. Australians battle wildfires . Wednesday's announcement comes a day after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that 2012 had been the hottest year on record for the continental United States and the second-worst for ""extreme"" weather such as hurricanes, droughts or floods. The year's average temperature of 55.3 degrees Fahrenheit across the ""Lower 48"" was more than 3.2 degrees warmer than the average for the 20th century, NOAA reported. That topped the previous record, set in 1998, by a full degree. Drought shriveled crops across the farm belt, leading to an expected rise in food prices in 2013, according to USDA. It also turned forests of the mountain West into tinder stands that exploded into wildfires over the summer, scorching millions of acres and destroying hundreds of homes. Seven of the 10 hottest years on U.S. record, which date to 1895, and four of the hottest five have occurred since 1990, according to NOAA. Rough winter weather hits Middle East . The year also saw Arctic sea ice hit a record low in more than 30 years of satellite observations and studies that found the world's major ice sheets have been shrinking at an increasing rate. Scientists are quick to point out that no single storm can be blamed on climate change, but say a warming world raises the odds of extreme weather. ""I think, unfortunately, 2012 really may well be the new normal,"" said Daniel Lashof, director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a U.S. environmental group. ""It's the kind of year we expect, given the global warming trend is ongoing."" The science of global warming is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most researchers, who point to heat-trapping carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels as the major cause.

"(Travel + Leisure) -- Another New Year's Eve party? A Chinese New Year parade in Manhattan's Chinatown is scheduled for February 1. If you're still recovering from December 31, there's no need to worry about having to do it all over again. The Chinese New Year celebration for the Year of the Ox -- which begins on January 26, 2009 (year 4707 on the Chinese calendar) -- is more laid-back than the usual Dick Clark spectacle. Of course, there are parades. No matter where the celebration, there will be a decorated dragon winding its way through crowds, streaming a trail of men behind it. You can also count on seeing a lion that ""eats"" lettuce and oranges from local merchants, who give the lion red envelopes filled with money (in hopes of a prosperous year). But mostly, Chinese New Year is a time to enjoy food with family and friends. Dumplings and pineapples are served for their likeness to certain Chinese currency, as are spring rolls that resemble gold bars. Whole fish and chickens represent abundance, and a sticky rice pudding cake is said to help people prosper. Travel + Leisure: Your 2009 travel horoscope . ""I equate it to Thanksgiving,"" says Stephen Chen, President of Massachusetts-based Joyce Chen Foods (and the son of Joyce Chen, the first Asian chef to have a cooking show in the U.S.). Stephen recalls that his household was encouraged to stay up all night gambling into New Year's Day. His mother explained that the longer you stay up, the longer your life will be. So if New York is the city that never sleeps, its residents should have very long lives. One of them, Taipei-born Hsin Lin Lee, is celebrating her first Chinese New Year in the Big Apple, and she's excited. An assistant TV producer, Lee explains that President-elect Obama was born in the year of the Ox -- fitting, as the pronunciation of the Chinese character for ox sounds like the Chinese word for change. To join in the festivities, Lee has three Chinatowns to choose from: Flushing, Queens; Sunset Park, Brooklyn; and Manhattan (America's largest Chinatown). But Lee points out that American Chinatowns blend together people from many regions and countries, so traditions have been mixed together. ""It's less like Chinatown, and more like Asiantown,"" she says. ""But it's a good thing to see different cultures living together."" Here's where to celebrate that cultural melding: . New York: January 26, February 1. More than 400,000 fireworks will rain down over Manhattan's Roosevelt Park on January 26, while a parade is slated for February 1. On that day, some 500,000 spectators will watch martial arts performances, traditional dancers from Mexico and Bolivia and live bands playing from decorated floats -- all while a continual burst of confetti poppers fills the streets with brightly colored paper. The January 31 parade in Flushing, Queens, brings together all of that borough's East Asian groups, and Brooklyn's 8th Avenue Chinatown hosts the most homegrown parade in New York, with the whole neighborhood taking to the streets in celebration. Honolulu: January 23-24. A 150-foot dragon snakes its way through the ""Night in Chinatown"" parade, which features festival queens, dancing lions, and kung fu artists. The days prior host a bevy of events, including an all-day block party with holiday favorites like jai (vegetarian monk's food), gin doi (Chinese doughnut), and gau (New Year pudding). Singapore: January 30-31. Singapore hosts one of the world's largest, most elaborate, and most colorful Chinese New Year festivities: the annual Chingay Parade Singapore. The streets along Marina Bay are festooned with red lanterns, and nightly dance, song, and martial arts performances lead up to the New Year countdown. With 3,800 performers painted and preened with gold headdresses and silk costumes, mechanical dragon floats, a puppet parade, and an LED display, this celebration is a modern interpretation of ancient Chinese traditions. Hong Kong: January 26--28. The theme of Hong Kong's New Year parade, sponsored by Cathay Pacific, is the ""world's happiest party."" New Year's Day here takes on an international, carnival-like atmosphere, bringing together the Washington Redskins cheerleaders, a brass band from Russia, and stilt-wearing ballerinas from Spain. A fireworks show will launch over Victoria Harbour, and horseracing fans will head en masse to the Sha Tin racecourse for the popular first day of racing in the new year. London: February 1. Some 300,000 people are expected in London's Chinatown, Trafalgar Square, and Leicester Square for acrobatic performances, fireworks, and food stalls serving steamed dumplings and red bean cakes. Sydney: February 1. Sydney's Chinese New Year Twilight Parade features illuminated floats, along with 500 dancers, martial artists, and musicians, who make their way from City Hall to Chinatown. Fireworks will light up the nighttime sky over Cockle Bay. Then, on February 7 and 8 in Darling Harbour, 3,000 dragon-boat racers will entertain 200,000 visitors. Planning a beach getaway?

"(CNN) -- A prominent conservative judge expressed concerns Tuesday about whether Michigan's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage was constitutional, saying that given ""modern conceptions of marriage,"" the state's law seems ""harder to justify."" The remarks came during an unusual series of oral arguments played out over one afternoon at the federal appeals court in Cincinnati. A three-judge panel 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals heard lawyers from four states defend their same-sex marriage bans, in a dramatic series of consecutive cases from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. In the first petition from Michigan, Judge Jeffrey Sutton had tough questions for the state's solicitor general. ""What do we do about a reality that marriage -- it changes with social mores?"" asked Sutton from the bench. ""And maybe, originally, marriage was about encouraging procreation ... but modern conceptions of marriage are more about love, affection, and commitment. And when you think of that way, it does seem a little harder to justify, even on rational basis grounds,"" he said. A winning streak . Sutton, who was named to the court by President George W. Bush, added: ""If you think about marriage just through that at lens â€” love, affection, commitment-- it does start to get gets a little difficult to see the difference between the one group eligible (to marry) and the other group not."" The appeals panel could extend a remarkable winning streak for gay rights supporters, after state and federal judges in about two dozen cases have struck down same-sex marriage bans in the past year. This after the Supreme Court in June 2013 tossed out a key part of a federal law defining marriage as only between one man and one woman. Four separate rulings . The current intermediate review stage will produce four separate written rulings in coming weeks. Appeals of one or all of those state bans will likely end up at the Supreme Court. There the justices could finally answer whether same-sex couples have a constitutional equal protection right that must be applied in every state, including the 31 with current bans. Federal appeals courts have already struck down similar bans in Utah, Oklahoma, and Virginia in recent weeks. Two of the three judges on the panel this week were appointed by Republican presidents, leading to predictions they would uphold state bans. The judicial panel was tough on both sides, particularly Sutton, who ask probing questions of lawyers representing various gay and lesbian couples seeking the right to wed, or to have their home states recognize valid out-of-state marriages. ""If respect and dignity (for gay couples) are critical elements here, I would have thought the best way to get respect and dignity is through the democratic process,"" said Sutton, citing those states that have chosen to change the law in the past decade. Conservative argument . He suggested taking the challenge in the courts was not the best strategy. ""Don't you think you're more likely to change hearts and minds through the democratic process, than you are with the decision of five justices on the Supreme Court? Assuming you can win on this, why do you want that route?"" he asked. That has been the argument many conservative activists have made in preserving the marriage status quo. Michigan's Solicitor General Aaron Lindstrom defended the current ban, saying ""It's rational for the state to have an interest in promoting marriage, so it will be more likely a child will have both a mother and father, and will have the benefits of having both a mother and a father. But Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey, named to the bench by President Clinton, jumped in. ""But what is the rational basis of excluding everybody else? It doesn't interfere with the procreation of children just because you've got two people of the same sex marrying in and in some of those marriages, one of the partners is able to procreate."" Complete discretion . And when Lindstrom said the state had an interest ensuring ""procreation occurs in long-term committed relationships between opposite sex couples,"" the judge seemed unconvinced. ""Isn't that a little hypocritical,"" said Daughtrey, ""to allow people to marry who can't procreate, but prevent same sex partners from marrying, and in some of those marriages, one of the partners is able to procreate?"" The nine members of the high court have complete discretion to accept or deny any case presented to them. Their recent precedents however, give unbridled optimism to many in the gay rights and civil rights communities they will at least get their day in court. A sweeping judicial victory may be tantalizingly close. ""You never know how any Supreme Court case is going to be resolved, especially when the stakes are this high, but the challengers definitely have the upper hand,"" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a prominent Washington attorney. Also argued Tuesday was Kentucky's ban. The commonwealth's Democratic Gov. Steven Beshear hired outside lawyers to defend the ban on recognizing out-of-state same-sex marriages, after his attorney general tearfully refused in March to take part in any further legal challenges. More than 70 lawsuits . By CNN's count, there are more than 70 same-sex marriage lawsuits pending in every state with a current ban. North Dakota this spring becoming the latest, and last, to have one filed in court, on behalf of seven homosexual couples. The Supreme Court could historically alter how marriage is treated under a legal framework, potentially striking down every current same-sex marriage ban. Or the justices could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place, allowing state legislatures and state courts to sort it all out, for now. A CNN/ORC International poll released a year ago found an apparent cultural shift-- 53% of Americans now support same-sex marriage, up from 40% in 2007. And that survey showed 56% of the public feels the federal government should also legally recognize same-sex marriages. Virginia ban overturned . GOP on same-sex marriage .

"(CNN) -- Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar has gone from scapegoat to national hero in the space of two World Cups and is hoping that the wave of emotion which both he and his teammates rode to secure a penalty shootout triumph against Chile will see them past the stern test provided by Colombia in the quarterfinals Friday. Cesar, who was held responsible for a blunder in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa as his side went out to the Netherlands in the quarterfinals, made two superb saves in the shootout as Brazil won its last 16 clash in a nail biting finale in Belo Horizonte. Several players, captain Thiago Silva and star player Neymar included, showed outward signs of emotion during the course of the match against Chile but Cesar told CNN that it was a natural reaction given the pressure of hosting the competition. ""We were in a situation where we could have been eliminated from the round of 16 in a World Cup in Brazil, so not only did I get emotional, but so did some of the other members of the team,"" he said. ""We know the importance of winning this World Cup in Brazil, not only for ourselves, but for our families, and especially for the fans. ""We don't know when Brazil will have another opportunity to host a World Cup, so I think we need to take advantage of this opportunity,"" added the 34-year-old. Despite his 84 caps, Cesar has had his critics and in the buildup to the World Cup finals spent an unhappy spell at English second-flight team Queens Park Rangers, before being farmed out on loan to MLS side Toronto. His place in the Brazil team appeared at risk, but Cesar credits coach Luiz Felipe Scolari with sticking with him despite his difficulties. ""I think it's the primary reason why I'm here today. Eight months ago he gave an interview saying that regardless if I was playing or not, I would playing at the World Cup. So this is something that gives you peace of mind,"" he added. Whether that peace of mind extends to the clash with Colombia and the prospect of preventing their goalscoring sensation James Rodriguez from adding to his competition leading tally of five goals is another matter. Rodriquez scored twice -- his first probably the goal of the tournament -- in his side's 2-0 last 16 win over Uruguay and Cesar admits he will be difficult to stop. ""James is a player that has been amazing everyone. I think that the World Cup gives players the opportunity to showcase their work to the world and I think James is making the most of it,"" he said. ""For now, though, I hope that against Brazil, he can halt his continued progression as a player until after the tournament has ended, because Brazil has to win."" Brazil has its own trump card in Barcelona's Neymar, who has impressed Cesar with his mature performances despite carrying the hopes of a nation. ""You see a 22-year-old in his first World Cup in Brazil taking to the pitch as if he were playing with his friends in the street. In my opinion, that's his biggest strength,"" said Cesar. ""He's just like any other guy and I think his family is the main reason why he has accomplished so much, and yet remained humble. I think he's a fantastic kid."" The last eight clash in Fortaleza could well hinge on which of the young superstars can put their imprint on the proceedings, while Cesar will be hoping to avoid the sort of error that haunted him during his last appearance at this stage of the competition four years ago.","Julio Cesar was Brazil's hero in penalty shootout win over Chile .

"(CNN) -- Thirty-one-year old Jessica Copeland says she knew by the time she was in high school that she never wanted to be a parent. ""It is my decision, and the best decision for my life,"" said Copeland, a former veterinary technician from Chandler, Texas, now living in Dongducheon, South Korea, with her husband. ""I know who I am and what I want in life, and know without a doubt children do not fit into that equation,"" she said. ""I know that happiness does not have to include 2.5 children, a house in the suburbs and a white picket fence."" Nearly one in five American women now ends her childbearing years without having a child, compared with one in ten in the 1970s, according to recently released U.S. Census data. The most educated women, those with bachelor's degrees or higher, are among the most likely never to have given birth, according to the Pew Research Center. Women like Copeland are challenging  the idea that happy and fulfilled lives require children. In fact, other studies suggest that having children can have a negative impact on happiness. ""As a group, parents of all types and all socioeconomic levels in the United States report more symptoms of depression and emotional distress than their childless adult counterparts,"" said Robin Simon, a Wake Forest University sociology professor who researches the association between parenthood and emotional well-being. Her information is based on a nationally representative study sampling 11,473 Americans. They were picked from all races, socioeconomic backgrounds and educational levels. Harvard psychology professor Daniel Gilbert's book ""Stumbling on Happiness"" looked at several studies and found that children give adults many things, but an ""increase in daily happiness is probably not among them."" He says that psychologists have found parents are less happy interacting with their kids than doing activities such as eating, watching television or even exercising. ""It's such a counterintuitive finding, because we have these cultural beliefs that children are the key to happiness and a healthy life, and they're not,"" said Simon. ""From the outside you see the detrimental effects of what our cultural beliefs cause, yet there is this group of people telling you children are the best thing that will ever happen to you,"" said Copeland. Copeland, an army military wife for the past year and a half, said she never felt any pressure to have any kids, and her family has been supportive of her choice. Outside her inner circle, however, the reception has been different. ""The typical reaction I get is of dismay and pity,"" she noted. But Copeland, an only child, is far from feeling dismal and finds it ironic that people in her life with children often complain about their lifestyles. ""I always find it interesting how parents complain about their kids, yet follow it with a statement pertaining to how fulfilling their life is,"" she said. ""I have yet to meet a parent that does not have an almost daily story of how their child has stressed them in some way."" Simon says there are other challenges for parents, too. The sociology professor said marital satisfaction decreases after the birth of the first child and continually decreases over time. Employment retention and earnings suffer for women in the U.S. when they have kids, too, according to research, cited by Jennifer Glass, a professor at the University of Iowa. ""Research shows women in our country often lose out financially and in career advancement once they become a parent -- because the U.S. does not have the type of work policies to properly support families and child care, like other developed nations,"" said Glass. Raising a child is expensive, too. According to U.S. government figures, the average cost to raise a child from birth to age 17 is about $222,360 for a child born in 2009 (in 2009 dollars). That includes food, housing, transportation, clothing, health care, education, childcare, and other miscellaneous expenses. So what do current parents think of this research? It depends on whom you ask, says Simon. ""I've received hate mail in the past from some parents after they've read about the studies, but often find that many parents feel liberated by the research,"" she said. ""Parenting is a very difficult, stressful job, and many people who read the data discover they are not the only ones who feel overwhelmed by the tough work."" Despite these findings, Simon, who is the mother of two grown children, doesn't say Americans should stop having kids and does not have an agenda to stop procreation. ""The take-away from the research (is) that if you are a parent or want to become a parent, understand what you are getting yourself into and be prepared for a lot of hard work, sweat and tears -- even under the best of conditions,"" she said. Both Simon and Glass say parents in the U.S. often lack the proper support, child care and assistance to raise a child.  They say they'd like to see the government implement and subsidize more ""kid-friendly"" policies to help families thrive. Simon and Glass are working on a project to compare the ""emotional well-being"" of U.S. parents versus parents from 21 other developed countries. They expect parents from countries with greater support systems than the U.S. to fare better, but don't want to make that assumption until their research is complete. Studies abound on this topic, and a recent one might provide some cheer to parents. Research published in the March issue of the journal  Population and Development Review found the more children that parents over age 40 have, the happier they are. They used data from 86 countries for their research. The authors of this study say as children mature, they require less care and stress for parents -- and can become a source of support for moms and dads. In the meantime, Copeland says her marriage to her best friend and ""the man of my dreams"" is the only family she needs to create in her lifetime. She trusts her gut and her decision. She encourages others to make their own choices, and to respect hers, too.","A married woman tells CNN.com why she does not want to have children .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN) -- A series of Boko Haram raids on four villages in northeast Nigeria's Borno state has killed more than 50 people and destroyed more than 300 structures, including five churches, a government official said. On Sunday, gunmen on motorcycles stormed the Christian villages of Kwada, Ngurojina, Karagau and Kautikari near Chibok, the scene of the April 14 abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls, opening fire on residents and hurling explosives into homes and churches. Kwada was the worst affected. There, the attackers razed the village and its five churches during the attacks, which lasted five hours. ""We lost 54 people in the Sunday attacks on the four villages carried out by Boko Haram insurgents, who also destroyed over 300 homes,"" a senior Borno state government official said. The official asked not to be named because he was not authorized to give a death toll. ""In Kwada, 36 bodies were recovered, making it the worst hit,"" the official said. In the bush around the villages, which lie within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of Chibok, search teams looked for bodies late Sunday through Monday. The gunmen pursued fleeing residents into the bush and shot them dead, according to residents. A community leader in Chibok, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals from Boko Haram, said 47 bodies were recovered by Monday morning and search teams were still combing the bush for more. On Sunday, 30 bodies were recovered, according to a Christian priest in Chibok. Barnabas Tanko, a member of a local defense group in Kwada, said the attackers faced resistance in Kautikari, where six of them were killed. Residents said a slow military response was responsible for the high death toll and massive destruction to homes as the attackers wreaked havoc for five hours before a military jet arrived. The attacks started around 8 a.m. local time and continued until 1 p.m. without military intervention, Tanko said. When they saw the fighter jet, the attackers disappeared into the bush, Tanko said. A Nigerian government spokesman said the military and air force went to the area, though they were ""a bit late."" Residents dismissed the claim as untrue.","The raids target four villages in Borno state .

"(CNN) -- Jim Davis, the creator of the widely-syndicated ""Garfield"" comic has issued an apology for an ill-timed strip that ran on Veterans Day. The strip, which appeared in newspapers nationwide Thursday, shows a spider's thoughts as Garfield the cat is about to crush it with a rolled-up newspaper. ""If you squish me, I shall become famous!"" reads the thought bubble in the strip's first panel. ""They will hold an annual day of remembrance in my honor, you fat slob,"" the spider continues, referring to the pudgy orange cat. The last panel shows the spider dangling above a teacher's desk while he addresses a group of other spiders: ""Does anyone here know why we celebrate 'National Stupid Day?'"" Davis called the strip's appearance on Veterans Day ""the worst timing ever."" ""The strip that runs in today's paper seems to be making a statement about Veterans Day. It absolutely, positively has nothing to do with this important day of remembrance,"" he said in a letter Thursday, addressed to friends, fans and veterans. The cartoonist said the strip was created almost a year ago. ""I had no idea when writing it that it would appear today -- of all days,"" he said. ""I do not use a calendar that lists holidays and other notable days, so when this strip was put in the queue, I had no idea it would run on Veterans Day."" Davis said his brother served in Vietnam, and his son has performed tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""You'd have to go a long way to find someone who was more proud and grateful for what our veterans have done for all of us,"" he said. Garfield debuted in 41 U.S. newspapers in 1978. In 2002, the Guinness Book of World Records declared it the most widely syndicated comic strip in the world. Today, the cynical cat is a ubiquitous pop culture presence, with books and movies to his name. In his letter, Davis implied he did not intend to make the same mistake again: ""You can bet I'll have a calendar that lists EVERYTHING by my side in the future.""

"(CNN) -- Some cried and others cheered in emotional scenes as pro-democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi addressed thousands of Burmese migrants Wednesday on the outskirts of the Thai capital Bangkok. It's the first time the Myanmar opposition leader has been outside the country, also known as Burma, in more than two decades after a long period of detention by the ruling military junta. Burmese migrant workers dream of return home . Several thousand people gathered to hear her speak, many of whom had spent years living in exile to escape poverty and the country's oppressive regime. From a balcony high above the crowd, Suu Kyi said that the onus was on the government of Myanmar and Burmese people everywhere to build a new country to encourage their return. ""Everybody has a responsibility. They too [Burmese workers] have a responsibility and we too have a responsibility to create the kind of country to which all our people can return, whenever they wish too."" The peaceful freedom fighter . Suu Kyi addressed the inequalities experienced by Burmese migrants in Thailand, who rights workers say are treated as cheap labor and second class citizens. ""The laws of this land which do provide protection for workers are not always observed by everybody concerned. This is due to two things,"" Suu Kyi said. ""One, of course, we need to educate our workers as to their rights, by what kind of legal means there are for defending their rights because whatever we negotiate with our host government we want to do it in a harmonious way. Of course we will also be asking for help and support from the local authorities,"" she said. Onlookers waved flags and photos of the pro-democracy campaigner and her father General Aung San, a revolutionary who was assassinated six months before Myanmar's independence from British rule. Some climbed onto rooftops for clearer view of Suu Kyi, whose National League of Democracy party won a number of seats in Parliament in April in the country's first free and fair vote in decades. Before her arrival, Burmese migrants spoke of their desire for jobs within the country which has been ruled by a military junta since a bloodless coup in 1962. ""I want to hear good news from her. I want to hear about the independence of Burma and democracy and that there are jobs available,"" said San Nyo, a Burmese migrant from Daw who has been living in Thailand for three years. Another, Myint Swe, a vendor who has lived in Thailand with his wife and three children for 12 years, told CNN: ""I love Suu Kyi. This is a very happy moment. I want her to say we can come home and have jobs."" ""It is tough living in Thailand. We get a lot of pressure from Thai police and passport control,"" he added. Within the last two years, Myanmar's leadership has eased repressive controls on the country, allowing opposition parties to take part in the most recent elections. Suu Kyi's visit to Bangkok comes ahead of a longer trip to Europe next month during which she will make a series of key addresses, including the acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize that she was prevented from collecting in 1991 because she was in detention. CNN's Pamela Boykoff contributed to this report.","Aung San Suu Kyi addresses crowds outside a Burmese migrants' center in Thailand .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Relatives of vanished Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 passengers wailed and yelled in a Beijing hotel Thursday as the airline announced it was closing the assistance centers where they'd been gathered for weeks -- effectively telling the families to go home. The closures also will mean no more mass daily briefings for the relatives -- news that sparked a new wave of anguish and despair for the hundreds who heard it at Beijing's Lido Hotel. ""What can we do?"" a relative yelled, as others kneeled in front of police who had assembled in the hotel briefing room to keep order. ""Who will find our family members?"" another shouted. The airline said the center at the Lido Hotel, where the company has hosted families since March, would close Friday. Centers elsewhere will close by May 7, it said. ""Instead of staying in hotels, the families of MH370 are advised to receive information updates on the progress of the search and investigation and other support by Malaysia Airlines within the comfort of their own homes, with the support and care of their families and friends,"" the airline said in a news release. The briefing at the Lido Hotel came on the day that the Malaysian government released its preliminary report on the plane's March 8 disappearance. The hotel has been an important hub of information for relatives in China. More than 100 passengers on the plane are Chinese. The airline said it would open different ""family support centers"" in Beijing and Malaysia's capital; it wasn't immediately clear what those centers would do. 'People started to break down' Sarah Bajc, the American partner of Flight 370 passenger Philip Wood, said she was one of about 500 people at Thursday's Lido Hotel meeting. The briefing began with the airline's CEO making a seven-minute statement in English by video, Bajc said. Most of the relatives didn't understand the message until a Chinese translation was given afterward, she said. ""That's when people started to break down,"" she said. Bajc said she left the room, saying the scene started to feel tense. ""I could hear a lot of yelling. Some of the police officers that were outside went in, and they started to file family members out through a separate exit,"" she told CNN's ""New Day."" Calm was restored when Chinese officials continued the briefing and ensured the families that the search would continue, and that the relatives wouldn't be forgotten, a CNN crew outside the briefing room reported. Bajc said Chinese relatives previously told her they dreaded the day that the hotel centers would close, fearing they wouldn't get timely updates at their rural homes. ""They are very distraught, because the average Chinese family member will be sent home to mostly a very rural place with limited access to (the) Internet, and they just feel like all lines of communications will be cut,"" she said. Airline to begin compensation payments . The airline also said Thursday it would begin making advance compensation to the Flight 370 passengers' next of kin, to help with their immediate economic needs. Under an international treaty known as the Montreal Convention, the airline must pay relatives of each deceased passenger an initial sum of around $150,000 to $175,000. Relatives of victims can also sue for further damages. The airline didn't say how much of an advance the families would receive. ""Such advanced payments will not affect the rights of the next-of-kin to claim compensation according to the law at a later stage, and will be calculated as part of the final compensation,"" the airline's news release said. Report: Four-hour gap before official search began . The news of the hotel center closures came on the day the Malaysian government publicly released the initial report on the plane's disappearance -- the report that it initially sent to the to the International Civil Aviation Organization, the U.N. body for global aviation. The report said officials apparently didn't notice for 17 minutes that the flight had gone off radar -- and didn't activate an official rescue operation for four hours. Relatives told CNN that Malaysian authorities e-mailed the interim report -- which contained both text and audio -- late Thursday. Meanwhile, the Bluefin-21 undertook what was one of its longest, most extensive missions to search the depths of the southern Indian Ocean for signs of the missing aircraft. Michael Dean, deputy supervisor of salvage and diving for the U.S. Navy, said the submersible's 17th mission lasted 27 hours and descended to 5,000 meters. ""It was a pretty successful mission in terms of what they covered,"" Dean said. The Navy official noted that Australia's government has asked the U.S. Navy to extend its role in the search by a week or more -- a request that is under review. The Bluefin later moved onto its 18th mission, after which -- assuming no wreckage is found -- it should return to port on its host ship, the Ocean Shield, to refuel, according to Dean. GeoResonance defends Bay of Bengal claim . Meanwhile, the private company that says it may have found plane wreckage in the Bay of Bengal defended its claim, even though it wouldn't detail the technology it used. GeoResonance said it used spectral analysis from satellite and plane images to reach its conclusion about the Bay of Bengal site. The company said it conducted ""large scale remote sensing"" and detected the presence of aluminum, titanium and copper. Scientists went back to test for other elements that the company says make up a commercial jet. GeoResonance has faced questions about how it could have found wreckage deep underwater, thousands of miles from the official search area. ""What we say to those people is that that is not about technology, that is about the fact that an object or a combination of objects which produce exactly the same signal as materials used in a plane are detected,"" GeoResonance Managing Director Pavel Kursa told CNN's Anna Coren. The company said its search was self-funded and it wants to keep intellectual property private. ""Our technology comprises of 20 different technologies, and a lot of it is very valuable intellectual property,"" director David Pope said. ""And we are not in the business of just giving out intellectual property for nothing."" Analyst: Experts don't support claim . The company said its analysis was done by a team of its scientists in Europe. But GeoResonance declined to name the scientists or the country they worked in and declined to give a reason. CNN aviation expert Miles O'Brien said GeoResonance's claims are not supported by experts. ""My blood is boiling,"" he told CNN's ""New Day."" ""I've talked to the leading experts in satellite imaging capability at NASA, and they know of no technology that is capable of doing this. I am just horrified that a company would use this event to gain attention like this."" Nevertheless, the company got its wish Wednesday, when Bangladesh sent two navy vessels into the Bay of Bengal to the location cited by GeoResonance. The chief coordinator of the international search effort, Australian Angus Houston, held out little optimism that any such search would prove fruitful. He told Sky News International that the search area in the Indian Ocean had been set based on pings believed to have come from one or both of the plane's voice and data recorders. ""The advice from the experts is that's probably where the aircraft lost power and, somewhere close to that, it probably entered the water,"" he said. But some aviation experts said officials have little choice but to look into the company's claim. ""The investigators are going to be hard-pressed to blow this off,"" said Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. ""I think at this point, because of the lack of results where they've been searching for six weeks, they're almost stuck. They have to go look."" Searchers dispute company's claim that it may have found aircraft wreckage . Is GeoResonance on to something? Plane audio recording played for first time to Chinese families . CNN's David McKenzie reported from Beijing. CNN's Jason Hanna and Holly Yan wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Tom Watkins, Allen Shum and Dayu Zhang contributed to this report.","NEW: Submersible completes 27-hour search mission, starts next one .

"(CNN) -- Luis Suarez has promised never to bite a player again after the Uruguayan issued an apology to Italy's Giorgio Chiellini. In a carefully worded statement on his official Facebook page, Suarez, who has been hit by a four-month ban by world governing body FIFA for biting the Italian, said he ""deeply regretted what occurred."" The statement added: ""I apologize to Giorgio Chiellini and the entire football family. ""I vow to the public that there will never again be another incident."" The Liverpool star's punishment, which also includes a nine-match international ban, prohibits him from football-related activities, meaning he will be prevented from training with his teammates until late October. Suarez's statement on Facebook continued to insist that the bite resulted from a ""collision"" with Chiellini. The Italian defender accepted the apology via Twitter saying the incident was ""all forgotten"" before repeating his call for FIFA to reduce Suarez's suspension. In his defence to FIFA, Suarez reportedly said he had lost his balance and had fallen on ""top of his opponent."" In a Fifa disciplinary committee document, the Uruguayan explained: ""At that moment, I hit my face against the player, leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth. ""In no way did it happen the way you have described, as a bite or intent to bite."" Given the bite on Chiellini was the third such offense of Suarez's career, FIFA took an altogether dimmer view of the incident, handing down a tough punishment to the 27-year-old foward. When playing with Dutch club Ajax in 2007, Suarez was suspended for seven games for biting an opponent, while he was hit with a 10-match sanction for an identical offense while playing for Liverpool in April 2013. He also courted controversy in 2011, when he was handed an eight-match ban for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra. Following previous indiscretions, Suarez has enjoyed the backing of his club Liverpool. Suarez has been heavily linked with a move away from Liverpool and, with the 27-year-old set to miss the first nine games of the Premier League season, it remains to be seen whether the Anfield team will continue to stand by its man.","Luis Suarez apologizes to Giorgio Chiellini .

"(CNN) -- The federal government will provide additional aid to Chicago's efforts to battle gun violence. The Department of Justice will announce Thursday that it will send seven more agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to join the 45 already stationed in Chicago. In announcing the reinforcements, Attorney General Eric Holder says that his office ""will continue to do everything in its power to help the city of Chicago combat gun violence. These new agents are a sign of the federal government's ongoing commitment to helping local leaders ensure Chicago's streets are safe."" The move is among measures that federal and local agencies have taken in a city known for its crime problem, highlighted by an outbreak of shootings during the July Fourth weekend. The Department of Justice points to the cross-state component of gun crime in Chicago as one reason for the federal-local partnership: Sixty percent of the guns seized in Chicago crimes originate from out of state. The coordinated effort involves manpower; $6.6 million in Justice Department funds to address youth violence; and intelligence, with the Chicago Crime Gun Intelligence Center opening in June. The department has also partnered with grassroots organizations in Chicago to increase community-based crime prevention. 3 killed in Chicago weekend violence .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge Friday ruled in favor of a former UCLA college basketball star who sued to end the NCAA's control over the rights to college athletes' names, images and likenesses. In a landmark decision, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken sided with Ed O'Bannon in his lawsuit against the National Collegiate Athletic Association. O'Bannon argued athletes in the top tier of college basketball and football should be allowed to profit from their schools' use of their likenesses. In a 99-page ruling, Wilken wrote that current NCAA rules ""unreasonably restrain trade in the market for certain educational and athletic opportunities offered by NCAA Division I schools."" Wilken issued an injunction to block the NCAA from prohibiting its member schools and conferences from offering their Football Bowl Subdivision or Division I basketball recruits a limited share of the revenues generated from the use of their names, images, and likenesses. She did rule, however, that the NCAA could set a cap on the money paid to athletes, as long as it allows at least $5,000 per athlete per year. ""The NCAA's witnesses stated that their concerns about student-athlete compensation would be minimized or negated if compensation was capped at a few thousand dollars per year,"" the judge wrote. O'Bannon's suit alleged the waivers the athletes are required to sign are illegal and asked that players be able to collectively negotiate the terms of their likenesses in order to keep a share of those profits. ""Before the court in this case is only whether the NCAA violates antitrust law by agreeing with its member schools to restrain their ability to compensate Division I men's basketball and FBS football players any more than the current association rules allow,"" Wilken wrote. ""For the reasons set forth above, the court finds that this restraint does violate antitrust law."" The ruling could potentially change college sports drastically, eventually forcing the NCAA to restructure its amateur model and allow college athletes to be paid. NCAA chief legal officer Donald Remy said: ""We disagree with the court's decision that NCAA rules violate antitrust laws. We note that the court's decision sets limits on compensation, but are reviewing the full decision and will provide further comment later."" William Isaacson, an attorney for the plaintiffs, called the ruling ""a big step forward for common decency."" ""One of the things the judge is saying here ... is some sharing is OK,"" he said. ""It won't affect amateurism, won't affect the popularity of the sport. She made a very reasonable and significant and measured decision."" Ramogi Huma, president of the National College Players Association, said the ruling was ""a big win"" that signaled ""the time for college athletes to get their due,"" though he was critical of the $5,000 compensation cap. ""The ruling says the NCAA was operating illegally and college athletes do have rights,"" said Huma, who helped find players to join the case. ""Even if you label them student-athletes and want to call it amateurism, it doesn't give the NCAA the right to deny them the rights that other Americans deserve."" Sonny Vaccaro, who started the lawsuit by introducing O'Bannon and lead attorney Michael Hausfeld, said the decision was precedent-setting. ""The key is, they're allowed to get paid,"" said Vacarro, who helped pioneer branding athletes by putting Nike shoes on Michael Jordan. Vacarro called the decision his most important career accomplishment. ""It's more important to me that these kids won and this go forward and the principles are right,"" he said. ""To me, it's more important than the Jordan and Kobe and things I did in my professional life. ...This was just something that was wrong and I totally believed in it."" The judge wrote that the injunction will not affect student-athletes who enroll in college before July 1, 2016. When athletes commit to a university, players are required to sign a waiver that relinquishes their right to their own likenesses in every form. That means they can't make money off their television appearances, their jerseys, or in any other way. The universities get any revenues from selling sports paraphernalia or other material related to the players. The trial began June 9 in federal court in Oakland, California. The plaintiffs were 20 current and former student athletes who play or played for an FBS football or Division I men's basketball team starting in 1956. Legal appeals could delay a final outcome for years but the decision is in a position to be the first major NCAA reform effort to take hold. Already the issues brought up in the case have had an effect, even before the ruling was made. Texas A&M, the University of Arizona and Northwestern University have decided to stop selling jerseys with the numbers of specific players. Instead, Texas A&M will sell the number 12 jersey, in keeping with its 12th man tradition; and Arizona will sell jerseys with numbers that correspond to the year of competition -- 14 for this year, according to a school spokesman. Northwestern will sell only jersey number 51, in honor of its head coach, Pat Fitzgerald, and legendary Chicago linebacker Dick Butkus. The NCAA's argument in both the ongoing O'Bannon suit and another one filed by former quarterback Sam Keller, also in federal court in Oakland, is that it is trying to protect the amateur model of college sports.

Zmudowski State Beach . Monterey County, California . This tongue-twister of a beach (the Z is silent) has miles of dreamy sand and knock-out views of both sides of Monterey Bay, but because getting there is complicated, you often get the place to yourself. Slackers usually settle for its more accessible clones (Salinas River State Beach, Moss Landing State Beach and Marina State Beach also front Monterey Bay). What they don't realize is getting to Zmudowski is half the fun. It's about 20 miles northwest of Monterey, and the last two miles are along a narrow two-lane road. Not only will you be humming a particular Beatles tune as you wind through endless strawberry fields, but you'll make a big dent in your bird-watching aspirations. California brown pelicans, red-tailed hawks, American kestrels and western snowy plovers are just a few species that hang out with the playful sea otters in the adjoining Pajaro River estuary.

With a delicious lack of paved roads, grocery stores, restaurants and hotels, Carova has little but wide, sand-packed beaches and a scattering of rental homes ranging from modest bungalows to million-dollar mansions with heated pools and hot tubs.

Whatever you do, don't rely on Google maps, which has been known to send seekers astray. If you do find the unmarked, unpaved path, just know that it's steep, requires a good 10 to 15 minutes to traverse and when it rains, it gets slippery and the red clay is likely to permanently stain your beach shoes. Locals tend to go barefoot. But oh, is it worth it. Located between Kalihiwai Bay and the Kilauea Point National Wildlife Refuge, Kauapea Beach offers stellar views of Moku'ae'ae Island, Kilauea Lighthouse, a 15-foot waterfall and nude sunbathers who have taken up residence on the east end of the beach.

Granted, it's a long flight just for a beach, but why not combine a week at a Maasai Mara safari camp with one of the most interesting spits of sand on the continent? Watamu offers all the normal sandcastle building opportunities, but there are also other unique local attractions including Watamu Turtle Watch conservation programs and the 13th century Gede ruins. Excavations of the ruins of this ancient Swahili trading village have turned up beads from Venice, a Ming vase from China, lamps from India and scissors from Spain. And, if you're still jonesing for animals, Gede ruins are home to a troop of friendly Skye monkeys, and the Watamu Marine National Park boasts some of East Africa's best coral. The largest spitting cobra (Naja ashei) in the world was also discovered here in 2007. Good Harbor Bay . Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, Michigan . This long stretch of sand has everything you could ever ask for in a beach: spectacular views, soft white sand, an aquamarine paint palette of Lake Michigan blue. There's even a stream leading into the woods and a hiking trail. In fact, the only thing it really lacks is large populations of humans. Michael Norton, a PR guy who let the cat out of the bag, says locals ""who guard their secret beach rather fiercely"" guiltily prefer to send tourists to the beaches at Empire and Grand Haven. Once a bustling port with a sawmill, a hotel, a saloon and a 500-foot dock, Good Harbor Beach today has nothing but scenery, overlooking the Manitou Islands, Pyramid Point and Whaleback, a glacial moraine that looks exactly like it sounds. The marked access road to Good Harbor is just off Leelanau County Road 651. You'll pass through the villages of Cedar and Maple City on the way. nps.gov/slbe/index.htm . Keewaydin Beach . Florida . When developers set their sights on this 1,000-acre barrier island off Naples, locals put up their dukes and an impressive fight to keep their beloved weekend getaway free from cars, bridges, roads and high-rises. After all, this seven-mile, baby powder beach is where they go to get away from tourists. The result? There are a few private houses on the north end of the island, but there are no hotels or vacation rentals. That's what makes it special: You have to boat here to enjoy it. The homes on the scrub-covered island are solar powered, sit on stilts and use water caught in rain barrels. When vice-president Joe Biden rang in the New Year at his brother's newly purchased home on Keewaydin, he and wife Jill, like everybody else, came by boat. Pristine and populated with deer, eagles, boars, the occasional panther, sea turtle hatchlings and iguanas, Keewaydin is part of the Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. On weekends, a food boat docks on the south end to dish up icy drinks and freshly caught seafood. Godahl Beach . Canouan, The Grenadines . Unless you're a 2009 Sports Illustrated swimsuit model or in Bill Gates' income bracket, you've probably never heard of exclusive Canouan Island. As the UK's Telegraph recently reported, this hook-shaped island is where billionaires go to get away from millionaires. Two-thirds of the island is owned by wealthy Irish financier Dermot Desmond, who invested $120 million to spiff up his about-to-debut Pink Sands Club. The resort surrounds Godahl Beach, but the beaches on the other 600 acres of the island are just as beautiful and surprisingly welcoming to average Joes. So, if you can get by without a Jim Fazio-designed golf course, water spa treatments that require canoes to get there and mirrors that, with the touch of a button, turn into a TV, you can enjoy the nondeveloped part of this green hilly island that exudes a laid back Carib vibe. Isla Holbox . Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico . Only 100 miles from Cancun, this low-key island is a million miles away in temperament. There's nary a parasail boat or Jet Ski in sight at 26-mile-long Isla Holbox. For that matter, you won't see any cars or banks or ATM's. Just mile after mile of beautiful beaches, fishermen and a few palapas. Oh yeah, and a school of whale sharks that hang out here between June and September. The cool thing about these 30-plus foot monsters is they're harmless and, if you ask nicely, one of the island's 1,600 locals will take you out to swim with them. Without a cage. At the very least, you'll want to nod at the flocks of pelicans and flamingos you'll pass on the ferry from Chiquila. Samuel H. Boardman State Scenic Corridor . Oregon . Despite the lack of crowds on this string of beaches punctuating Oregon's rugged coastline, skinny dipping is probably out. Even though it has been nicknamed Oregon's ""banana belt"" and many a daredevil has been known to swim under the majestic Arch Rock, let's just say it's far from balmy and anyone who doesn't want to resemble a Smurf should probably stick with Gore-Tex. More than 27 miles of trails wind through 300-year-old Sitka spruces and seaside prairies in this park that was named for Oregon's first park superintendent. Should you go, it'll likely just be you, the seals, the whales and Mother Nature showing off her finest work on more than a dozen stretches of spectacular beach. www.oregonstateparks.org . Little St. Simons . Georgia . On a busy day, there could be 31 other peeps on this island's undeveloped 7-mile beach. But count it unlikely. There's so much to do on this 10,000-acre barrier island that those interlopers, the other 31 sharing the upscale resort's grand total of 16 rooms, are apt to be busy drooling over the food at a clam bake or stalking the more than 280 species of birds on the 20 miles of wilderness trails. Privately owned since 1760 when Swiss colonist Samuel Ougspourger bought it from King George II, Little St. Simons has been a rice plantation and, since 1908, the personal retreat of the Berolzheimer family. Today, it's owned by relatives of Philip Berolzheimer and Henry Paulson (yes, that Henry Paulson). Everything's included in the rather steep price of The Lodge on Little St. Simons Island (starting at $450 a day) from full moon beach picnics and cocktail cruises to face time with the on-island naturalist.

"Washington (CNN) -- Edna Griggs keenly remembers the anger and outrage she felt during the 2012 general election when she watched as African-American senior citizens were forced to wait in long lines in the Houston heat as they cued up to vote at the Acres Homes Multi-Service Center. A member of her local NAACP chapter, Griggs says she was told that she couldn't bring them water to drink or chairs to rest in. ""A poll watcher approached me and said, 'What are you doing?' He told me I couldn't do that. They thought we were trying to sway their votes by giving them water,"" she said. ""It was really sad to me because it was like a reflection of the stories I heard from my grandmother and mother when they had to pay to vote. It was a reflection of everything our people have gone through."" Griggs is one of the plaintiffs in a NAACP lawsuit about new Texas voting identification laws, regulations that are considered by some civil rights and liberties groups as among the nation's most restrictive. Civil rights groups in that state, and others, fear that election officials and poll watchers, empowered by those new laws will ratchet up the level of discrimination against minority voters. ""We've had a serious problem with elected officials discriminating against Latino and African-American voters. It's obvious that many officials cannot be expected to treat these voters fairly,"" said Gary Bledsoe, an attorney and president of the Texas NAACP. ""When you give them more power to reject black and Latino voters at the polls, that power will be exercised and the discrimination escalated."" Key races to watch in 2014 . Texas voting officials have said the state's new photo voter identification law will help tamp down fraud. ""The U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled that voter ID laws do not suppress legal votes, but do help prevent illegal votes,"" Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said last year, according to media reports. The hunt for fraud . When they head to the polls in this fall's midterm elections, some voters in nearly half of the country will find it a lot tougher to cast ballots due to new voting laws, according to a new report by the Brennan Center for Justice. It is a legal think tank at New York University School of Law that has criticized the increase in what it sees as prohibitive voting measures. Most of the laws were approved by Republican-dominated legislatures and in states that saw greater minority voter turnout in the 2008 and 2012 general elections, the report found. Civil rights groups and voting rights advocates see the spate of new laws as a way to disenfranchise and intimidate minority voters and suppress turnout during high-stakes elections. Others support the changes and see the laws as the best way to preserve integrity in the voting process. Such groups as the grassroots Voter Integrity Project in North Carolina and True the Vote, a conservative group in Texas, supports citizen enforcement of the new voter laws, acts that often mean sifting through voter rolls and pounding on doors in search of fraud. True the Vote announced this week that it is suing the Mississippi secretary of state and that state's Republican Party over the right to look at the poll books and ballots in order to ensure that Democratic primary voters didn't also illegally vote in last month's Republican primary runoff. In Mississippi, voters who don't cast ballots in a primary election can vote in either party's runoff. Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel, who lost a bitter runoff against incumbent Republican Sen. Thad Cochran last month, is citing what he sees as ""illegal"" and ""unethical"" behavior among African-American Democrats who cast ballots for the veteran lawmaker. McDaniel said many of those voters participated in the Democratic primary and shouldn't have been allowed to vote in the Republican runoff. ""True the Vote has been inundated with reports from voters across Mississippi who are outraged to see the integrity of this election being undermined so that politicos can get back to business as usual. Enough is enough,"" True the Vote President Catherine Engelbrecht said in statement. Vigilante or vindicator? One man's bid to root out voter fraud . Tough new laws . The nation's new crop of voting laws run the gamut from dialing back early voting hours to new requirements for photo identification to stricter rules for voter registration. A few examples: . And, in at least seven states, including Arizona, Arkansas and North Carolina, suits challenging new voting restrictions are wending their way through state and federal courts and could potentially impact the outcome of the 2014 elections. ""The rules of the game"" This all follows a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year striking down provisions of the Voting Rights Act, which required a number of states — many of them in the South — to get clearance from the Justice Department before changing their voting laws. Without that protection, voting rights advocates say, in states with a history of discriminatory voting practices against racial minorities those who seek to unduly influence elections will find it easier to suppress votes. 2012 increase in voting ID laws . ""We have seen a dramatic increase in politicians trying to manipulate the rules of the game in terms of making it harder for citizens to vote,"" said Myrna Perez, a senior counsel at NYU's Brennan Center for Justice. The flurry of new and more restrictive voter laws coincided with the 2010 elections and new Republican majorities that came into power, Perez said. In 2012, the increase in laws reached a fever pitch when 19 states put forth measures civil rights groups view as restrictive. Now, as the 2014 midterm elections loom, voting rights advocates point to scenarios in the 2000 and 2012 general elections in Florida, where there was confusion about voting methods, laws and long lines, as a model for what could happen elsewhere in the country. ""I guess you could say we're ahead of the curve on voter suppression,"" said Deirdre Macnab, president of the nonpartisan League of Women Voters of Florida adding that the state has since passed a series of election reform measures which have improved voting. ""When it comes to Florida, we first saw the impact of taking away days and times to vote. And the legislators were properly shamed and embarrassed. It's unfortunate that other states have to experience that."" 2014 Midterm Elections .","A slate of new voter laws could impact the 2014 elections, experts say .

"(CNN) -- England held off a late charge by Australia to top the Commonwealth Games medal table as the eleventh, and final, day of competition drew to a close. As many as 70,000 people attended the closing ceremony in Hampden Park after a day of action that began in a deluge and ended with Australia winning the final gold medal of the games as the baton was passed to the country's Gold Coast, who will be the next host in 2018. The highlight of the day was the grueling men's road race, a 168-kilometer test of endurance that started in horrendous conditions. Despite suffering two front wheel punctures Geraint Thomas, who only last week finished the Tour de France, won Wales' first ever cycling gold medal after finishing one minute and 21 second ahead of his nearest rival, New Zealand's Jack Bauer. Elsewhere Jamaica beat England in the bronze medal match in the netball whilst Australia thrashed New Zealand to clinch gold, destroying their rivals 58-40 in what was one of the Commonwealth Games' few truly world class fields. The final gold of the tournament was won by Australia in the men's squash doubles final. But it wasn't enough to overtake England, who won a whopping 174 medals, 58 of them gold. Yet the closing ceremony had an antipodean feel as Australia's Gold Coast were handed the honor of hosting the next tournament, before Kylie Minogue performed on stage. Apparently caught up in the excitement of the moment, Australian runner Genevieve LaCaze crashed the stage during Minogue's performance, dancing and waving an Australian flag before being removed by security. ""It was my 25th birthday,"" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""I just saw the opportunity to get on stage with Kylie."" After the chaos that had plagued the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, Glasgow ran a largely error free games that had been seen by many in Scotland as a chance to wave its flag on the international stage. In September Scotland votes in an independence referendum to decide whether it should leave the United Kingdom.

"(CNN) -- Even though the Internet has become a key tool for accessing services, getting an education, finding jobs, getting the news, keeping up with people you know and much more, one in five U.S. adults still does not use the Internet at all, according to a new Pew report. Why? Mostly they're just not interested -- not in the Web, e-mail, YouTube, Facebook or anything else that happens online. ""Among current non-internet users, almost half (48%) say the main reason they don't go online now is because they don't think the internet is relevant to them -- often saying they don't want to use the internet and don't need to use it to get the information they want or conduct the communication they want,"" said the report. The respondents' next-most common reasons were that they don't have a computer or that it's too expensive, too difficult, or a waste of time. Most Americans who don't currently go online have never gone online before -- and no one else in their household uses the Internet. Just over 20% of non-users say they know enough about technology to start going online if they wanted to, and only 10% said they're interested in using the internet or e-mail in the future. Who are these neo-Luddites? Mostly they're older -- 59% of U.S. seniors don't go online. Also, nearly 60% of U.S. adults who never completed high school don't use the Internet. And they're mostly poor -- nearly 40% of people with an annual household income under $30,000 don't go online. (Pew notes that people with an annual household income under $20,000 are especially unlikely to use the Internet.) People with disabilities also are more likely to not use the Internet. One- quarter of U.S. adults live with a disability that interferes with activities of daily life -- and only 54% of these people are Internet users, Pew found. But in terms of ethnicity, the U.S. digital divide has narrowed. According to Pew: ""The internet access gap closest to disappearing is that between whites and minorities. Differences in access persist, especially in terms of adults who have high-speed broadband at home, but they have become significantly less prominent over the years -- and have disappeared entirely when other demographic factors (including language proficiency) are controlled for."" Having broadband access at home is one of the best ways to get the most benefits (or at least the most use) from the web -- and Pew found that right now 40% of U.S. adults don't have broadband at home. In fact, after U.S. home broadband penetration peaked in May 2010 to cover 66% of U.S. adults, in the past year there's been a slight decline. As of August 2011, only 62% of U.S. adults had broadband at home -- a 4% drop. The people who lack home broadband access are -- not surprisingly -- from the same demographics as people who don't go online at all: mostly older, with lower educational attainment and income, or living with a disability. The racial aspect of the home broadband gap has narrowed, but not vanished. According to Pew: ""By 2010, while national home broadband adoption had slowed, growth in broadband adoption among African Americans jumped well above the national average, with 22% broadband adoption growth since the previous year. Even with these gains, however, minorities are still less likely than whites to have home broadband overall. And foreign-born and Spanish-dominant Latinos trail not only whites but also native and English-speaking Latinos."" Mobile devices are making a dent in the U.S. digital divide. ""Groups that have traditionally been on the other side of the digital divide in basic internet access are now using wireless connections to go online,"" said the report. ""Among smartphone owners, young adults, minorities, those with no college experience, and those with lower household income levels are more likely than other groups to say that their phone is their main source of Internet access."" Many of these ""cell mostly"" users have other ways to get online, such as a desktop or laptop computer. However, a third of these people don't have home broadband -- and their smartphone is the main way they access the internet. Mobile devices also tend to make people more avid Internet users. ""Once someone has a wireless device, she becomes much more active in how she uses the internet -- not just with wireless connectivity, but also with wired devices,"" said Pew. ""The same holds true for the impact of wireless connections and people's interest in using the internet to connect with others. These mobile users go online not just to find information but to share what they find and even create new content much more than they did before.""","Almost 48% say they don't go online because they don't think the Internet is relevant to them .

"(CNN) -- Over the past few weeks, about 18 Palestinians and three Israelis have been killed in the occupied Palestinian territories. Although President Barack Obama rightly condemned the tragic killing of three Israeli teenagers, the majority of Palestinian victims have been largely reduced to faceless, nameless statistics who do not elicit comparable reaction. Exceptions are the case of Tariq Abu Khdeir, an American high school sophomore and that of his cousin 16-year-old Mohammad Abu Khdair, who was abducted by Israelis and then burned to death. Tariq was visiting his relatives in Jerusalem and was captured on video being beaten unconscious by Israeli police. But his beating might only have become public because he is an American. While Tariq was released from detention after three days under a growing media spotlight, hundreds of Palestinians who have been rounded up remain detained with uncertain futures. [The Israeli army said eight Palestinians killed this week in a military operation were ""suspected militants,"" but there is no way to be certain. The rest were unarmed civilians.] . The inattention to other Palestinian deaths and suffering is the most recent reason I have a hard time reconciling the perspective of our politicians and media organizations with the experiences of my family, including the slaying of a young, promising son of my cousin Siam two months ago. My exposure to this conflict began when I was 11, visiting Palestine for only the second time. I was born and raised in the Boston area and my concerns at that point did not extend much beyond the success of my Little League baseball team. ""When we get older we will be in prison."" I was surprised to hear this statement from my 11-year-old cousin, Siam Nowarah, referring to himself and his 13-year-old brother, who nodded nonchalantly in agreement. I learned a lot from Siam and his brothers that summer. My cousins walked without fear, at least outwardly, past the armed Israeli soldiers who were scattered across the streets of their hometown. These cousins were nothing like the kids I was growing up with. Though they were my age, I marveled that they had the outlook and courage of men. Why has the violence flared up again? Even then, I realized their environment forced them to skip much of their childhood. Siam was just 5 years old when, around the time an Israeli military court sent one of his older brothers to prison, his grieving mother died of a heart attack. The fun of that summer ended when Siam's 17-year-old brother was targeted in a raid by an undercover Israeli military unit. We became consumed with trying to visit him in prison. I have never forgotten the sight of him. The young man I knew with the flowing hair was reduced to a captive with a shaved head in prison garb. Israel's military occupation continued to haunt the Nowarah family as it has so many Palestinians. While some of the brothers left Palestine to build lives elsewhere, most remained. In 1996, my family recounts, Siam's recently married older brother Tamam was killed by an Israeli military helicopter gunship while photographing clashes in his neighborhood.  [A U.N. report outlines the events, but does not mention the many victims by name.] . The failure of the peace process and the failure of the international community to uphold Palestinian rights has meant real pain and suffering for my extended family, but our tragedy is not unique or even extraordinary. These stories are the stories of life for most Palestinians caught up in Israel's long-running domination of us and our land. The last time I saw my cousin was during a visit to Palestine in 2006. Siam was a proud father of beautiful children, running his own hair salon, named affectionately after his son Nadeem, and finding a way to persevere through tough times. His infectious smile had not changed. That is, until recently. Nothing could prepare me for the images that came bursting through my social media feed. First, the images of a handsome boy, labeled ""R.I.P."" Then the images of his father, Siam. Just as he had no choice but to be thrown into the role of grieving son as a child, and grieving brother as a young man, he was now cast in the role of grieving parent -- the worst role imaginable. In TV interviews, he somehow maintained his composure, drawing upon all that had made him strong during his life, but in photographs, the anguish in his eyes was searing. His childhood expectation of imprisonment foreshadowed something even worse. His 17-year-old son Nadeem felt compelled to protest at the site of the dreaded Ofer prison, accused by human rights groups of torture and abuses of Palestinian children. The protest was on May 15, the day of Al-Nakba, which commemorates the 66-year dispossession of the Palestinian people from our homes and lands. Nadeem went to protest in support of political prisoners on a hunger strike. Imprisonment has featured prominently in the life of the Nowarah family and Palestinians as a whole. A stunning 800,000 Palestinians have been imprisoned since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza began in 1967, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Detainees. The released video footage proves Nadeem posed no threat to any Israeli soldier. The Israeli military denied responsibility, saying it used only ""non-violent means"" to disperse the crowd. The Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon claimed ""it was a life-threatening situation, so the officers acted accordingly."" The video and other evidence, however, tell a different story. They indicate live ammunition was used unlawfully to kill Nadeem and 16-year-old Mohammad Mahmoud Odeh Salameh, with execution-style accuracy. Human Rights Watch has since called the killings an ""apparent war crime."" Following repeated attempts by Israeli officials to obfuscate the truth, Siam made the agonizing decision to exhume his son's body and have an autopsy performed in front of international forensic pathologists who unanimously confirmed it was the use of live ammunition that killed Nadeem. Evading accountability for killing Palestinian children has become common practice for the Israeli military. In the past year alone, hidden beneath the headlines of a now-defunct peace process, more than 50 Palestinians have been quietly killed by the Israeli military, including children, according to the Institute for Middle East Understanding. Since the year 2000, more than 1,500 children have been killed, another 6,000 injured and more than 10,000 arrested, according to the Palestinian Authority and reported in Haaretz. The time has come for the United States and the international community to hold Israel responsible for its crimes and launch an independent investigation. Not only must the soldier who pulled the trigger be brought to justice, but the chain of command and ruling government that bears responsibility for his actions must be held accountable. The jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court should be sought, and the United States and European Union should institute travel restrictions on specific Israeli commanders who have overseen criminal violence in Palestine. The likelihood of these constructive actions, however, seems remote. Just last week, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to increase funding for Israel's military by $131 million beyond the $3.1 billion granted in the 2014 fiscal year. And upon discovery of the bodies of the three missing Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, President Obama spoke immediately and movingly about how as a father he could not imagine the ""indescribable pain that the parents of these teenage boys are experiencing,"" yet he never offered any such sympathy to Siam, his wife or any of the other Palestinian parents of murdered children. As a U.S. citizen whose tax dollars contribute to our annual military aid package to Israel, I can't help but feel complicit. Writing about this tragedy from the comfort of my suburban American home feels so trite, while my relatives, like so many in Palestine, are left to grieve as the world averts its eyes. I want to share the name Nadeem Siam Nowarah, so we can never again say we did not know. Only when we recognize that all victims, whether Palestinian or Israeli, deserve to have their story told can we have hope that in life, Palestinians and Israelis can be equals, too.","Naseem Tuffaha's cousins in Palestine were resigned to a tough life .

He stole jewelry, medication and a firearm from the home in Crossville on June 27, CNN affiliate WKRN reported. How it started . The couple, who live nearby, approached Stephen Amaral, with the wife asking if she could swim in his pool. The wife sent her husband to get her cigarettes, then asked Amaral if he would be bothered if she swam naked. Not a problem, Amaral said. ""I went and got her a towel, she dried off and all of a sudden she was soaking wet again,"" Amaral told the affiliate. ""I escorted her outside and invited her to church, but she said she didn't have time for that, she wasn't ready for that."" Sentimental value . Amaral said not only did he feel violated, he lost an item that had sentimental value. The gun was a service weapon, used while he was a Mississippi deputy. He had planned to pass it down to his grandchildren, he said. Two suspects have been identified, presumably clothed, but no arrests have been made. The estimated cost of the stolen items: $2,000.

"(CNN) -- For more than two decades, New Jersey investigators had not been able to solve the homicide of 5-year-old Timothy Wiltsey. His mother, Michelle Lodzinski, reported the boy missing on May 25, 1991, telling police he disappeared at a carnival. On Wednesday, 23 years after Timmy vanished, Lodzinski was arrested in Florida on a murder charge in connection with his death. His disappearance shook the South Amboy, New Jersey, community where his family lived. Dozens of volunteers searched nearby fields and marshes for clues, according to CNN affiliate WCBS. The case gained national attention after missing posters for the boy were distributed to thousands of rail employees in 13 states, WCBS reported. Timmy's picture was even displayed on a giant screen at Yankee Stadium. Less than a year after he was reported missing, Timmy's partial remains were found in a remote section of an industrial park in nearby Edison, New Jersey. In the end, a routine cold-case review sparked a new investigation into the death, according to prosecutors in Middlesex County. The findings were presented to a grand jury, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office. The grand jury charged that Lodzinski ""did purposely or knowingly kill Timothy Wiltsey, or did purposely or knowingly inflict serious bodily injury upon Timothy Wiltsey, resulting in his death,"" according to the prosecutor's office. Lodzinski was considered a suspect over the years but she was not charged because of a lack of evidence, according to The Star-Ledger newspaper. Days after she reported her son missing, Lodzinski told detectives that two men, one with a knife, kidnapped Timmy, the newspaper reported. She returned later that day and told authorities she had made up the story of the abduction. The next day, she gave police another account, according to the newspaper. In 1994, in another bizarre scenario, Lodzinski claimed she was kidnapped and driven to Detroit by FBI agents. She later admitted making that story up as well, according to The Star-Ledger. Speaking about the woman's fake kidnapping story, Alan Rockoff, the Middlesex County prosecutor at the time of Timmy's disappearance, told the newspaper, ""It confirmed to me what we already knew; she was the suspect."" Lodzinski was arrested Wednesday evening in Port St. Lucie, Florida, and charged with murder, the prosecutor's office said. She was being held without bond and faces extradition proceedings.

Start by limiting access to stringy items such as dental floss, shoelaces or yarn that can get caught in a cat's intestinal system. It also pays to remove toxic items from your home, particularly plants. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals operates a poison control hotline (1-888-426-4435) that handles more than 160,000 calls each year for accidental poisonings. Many of the calls involve consuming potentially toxic plants. According to the ASPCA, these are the most toxic plants to cats. (You can find a full list with photos here ASPCA.org). Lilies (Lilium sp.): Easter lilies, stargazers and Oriental varieties can cause vomiting, severe kidney failure and death. If your cat ingests any part of a plant from the Lilium family, call your veterinarian immediately. Daylilies (Hemerocallis): True to the name, these lovely plants bloom for only one day. While dayliliesÂ differ from members of the Lilium family, they still pose a health risk. Ingesting any part of the plant can cause kidney failure. Insoluble calcium oxalate plants: Needle-like calcium oxalate crystals dig into a cat's tongue and gums, causing drooling, swelling and vomiting. Unfortunately, a large group of hardy plants contains these crystals. Avoid dieffenbachia, devil's ivy (Epipremnum aureum), philodendrons,Â peace lilies (Spathiphyllum) and calla lilies (Zantedeschia). MNN: Hank the cat is running for U.S. Senate . Sago palm: This striking, cold-hardy plant features long feathery leaves that contain a toxin called cycasin, which causes liver damage. Desert rose: Native to tropical regions of Africa and Arabia, these succulents make great houseplants in the United States. But they contain toxic chemicals called glycosides that can affect a cat's heart rate and cause vomiting. Corn plants: Dracaena can tolerate extreme weather conditions, making them a popular indoors and outdoors. If your cat likes chomping on plants, this one goes on the ""do not purchase"" list. Corn plants contain toxic compounds called saponins that can cause dilated pupils, excessive salivation and vomiting. MNN: 10 fascinating facts about cats . Bulb plants: Daffodils and tulips add a pop of color to any landscape. Keep cats away during planting season because bulbs of these plants present the biggest threat. Toxins such as lycorine in daffodils and tulipalin A and B in tulips can cause convulsions, diarrhea and vomiting. Azaleas: With more than 250 species in the United States, azaleas can flourish from California to Georgia. But the presence of grayantoxin can be disastrous for cats, leading to coma, cardiovascular collapse and even death.","Easter lilies, stargazers and Oriental varieties can cause severe kidney failure and death .

"(CNN) -- The politically divided Palestinian territories took a major step toward reconciliation Wednesday when the rival movements of Hamas and Fatah announced a deal to form a unity government, officials from both groups said. The move comes amid international efforts for statehood advanced by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah. It could portend unity in the fractious Palestinian territories. The two political factions have been close to civil war, culminating in 2007 when Hamas took control of Gaza after deadly fighting with Fatah partisans. Fatah retained control of the other Palestinian territory, the West Bank. One expert described the announcement as a significant development -- occurring against the larger backdrop of uprisings throughout the Arab world. The threat of similar unrest in the Palestinian territories may have spurred the two factions to seek a deal, said James Gelvin, a history professor at the University of California at Los Angeles and a Middle East expert. ""If it goes through, it's a very big deal,"" Gelvin said of the agreement. ""From 1964 to 2007, the Palestinian national movement spoke with one voice. Beginning in 2007, the Palestinian national movement spoke with two voices. So if the Palestinians are going to attempt to move toward statehood, they're going to have to speak with one voice again."" Gelvin added that both factions fear ""that whatever is going on in the rest of the Arab world is going on in Palestine but underneath the surface."" On March 15, Palestinian demonstrators filled al Manara Square in Ramallah, but their demands were for an end to the split between Hamas and Fatah rather than the revolutionary themes in other Arab countries. Instead of occupying the square like the Cairo protesters in neighboring Egypt, the Palestinians called for change through unification and then dispersed, though lingering elements remain as part of what they proclaim as the March 15 movement. ""There is a concern that they are becoming increasingly irrelevant, both Hamas and Fatah. Fatah was a child of the '50s with their armed struggle and tactics and their level of corruption. Hamas was a child of the 1980s with the so-called Islamic wave,"" Gelvin said. Another expert, however, said any formal involvement of Hamas in a new government would doom its diplomatic relations with the United States because it has deemed Hamas a terrorist organization. ""It's essentially a great blow for American policy,"" said Nathan Brown, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University. ""If they can come up with a neutral government"" in which Hamas isn't formally involved with any ministries, Brown said, ""they might be able to get around the legal requirements but the political obstacles will be there. ""A lot depends on the fine print,"" Brown added. Azzam al-Ahmad, the head of Fatah's negotiating team, formally announced the deal in Cairo. ""Today, we signed a memorandum of understanding outlining points that we agree on regarding what the Egyptian proposal suggested,"" al-Ahmad said. ""We also added our agreement to form a government made up of independent figures. ""We agreed on a date for elections and talked about national participation and cooperation in the post-elections period,"" he added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that the authority must decide whether it wants ""peace with Israel or peace with Hamas."" ""It is impossible to have peace with both since Hamas is looking to destroy the state of Israel and says it openly,"" he said, emphasizing that projectiles have been fired on cities and children. ""I think that the mere idea of reconciliation shows the weakness of the Palestinian Authority and raises wonders whether Hamas will take over Judea and Samaria as it took over the Gaza Strip. I hope that the Palestinian Authority chooses right -- that it chooses peace with Israel. The choice is theirs,"" Netanyahu said. Many Israelis refer to the West Bank as Judea and Samaria. On Wednesday, U.S. officials continued to express concerns about Hamas. ""We have seen the press reports and are seeking more information,"" said Tommy Vietor, National Security Council spokesman. ""As we have said before, the United States supports Palestinian reconciliation on terms which promote the cause of peace,"" Vietor said. ""Hamas, however, is a terrorist organization which targets civilians. To play a constructive role in achieving peace, any Palestinian government must accept the quartet principles and renounce violence, abide by past agreements and recognize Israel's right to exist."" The Mideast Quartet -- the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations -- has called on the new government to renounce terror and recognize Israel. The deal would establish a new parliament and a date for general elections, Hamas officials said Wednesday. They've also reached an agreement over security issues that have kept the two sides apart, the Hamas officials said. Fatah officials said Hamas' reservations have been discussed and resolved and also confirmed that the two parties have agreed to hold parliamentary and presidential elections in a year's time. Fatah leader Abbas and Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal are going to meet soon in Egypt, a Hamas official said. For years, there has been a big divide between the hard-line and anti-Israel Hamas and Fatah, which has engaged in peace negotiations with Israel. In the recent past, both sides sought reconciliation, but those efforts failed. Israel and militants in Gaza have fought continually for years. Israel has retaliated against Gaza militants who have fired missiles into southern Israeli towns. CNN's Guy Azriel and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: A Palestinian protest last month sought Fatah-Hamas unity .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari met with the Indian prime minister in New Delhi on Sunday -- the first visit to India by a Pakistani head of state in seven years. Both leaders described their brief meeting as satisfactory, with Zardari extending an invitation to Prime Minister Manmohan Singhfor a reciprocal visit. ""I would be very happy to visit Pakistan on a mutually convenient date,"" Singh said after hosting Zardari at his official residence. Emerging out of their almost 30-minute meeting on Sunday, Singh and Zardari said their talks covered all bilateral issues between their countries. ""I am very satisfied with the outcome of talks,"" Singh remarked as the Pakistani leader stood beside him. He said both nations were willing to find ""practical and pragmatic"" solutions to issues between them. Zardari echoed Singh's comments, saying their talks were ""fruitful."" ""We would like to have better relations with India. Hoping to meet (prime minister Manmohan Singh) on Pakistani soil very soon,"" he added. Zardari's India visit came amid thawing relations between the two nuclear-armed nations. After his talks with Singh, the Pakistani leader travels to the shrine of a revered Sufi saint at Ajmer in Rajasthan state. The private tour comes in the wake of Pakistan's recent promise to grant India ""most favored nation"" trading status. The South Asian neighbors have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, since the 1947 partition of the subcontinent into Islamic Pakistan and Hindu-majority, secular India after independence from Britain. Last year, both nations pledged not to let their fragile peace process unravel again over the range of thorny issues that put them at odds. In 2004, the nations agreed to negotiations that cover eight issues, including Kashmir, terrorism and Pakistan's concerns over river dams on the Indian side of the border, which it sees as a threat to its water supplies. Since then, successive governments have held talks in an effort to end the historical acrimony. Singh and Zardari hailed results from the dialogue in September 2008 as the countries completed four rounds of diplomatic meetings. But engagements were suspended two months later in November 2008 after the terrorist assault on Mumbai, which left more than 160 people dead. Over the past two years, India and Pakistan have held a series of high-level meetings in their bid to put their peace dialogue back on track, a process considered crucial to regional stability ahead of the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. In 2011, New Delhi and Islamabad agreed to resume talks. ""It's a win-win situation when Pakistan and India are engaging in dialogue, are talking to each other, and are building better cooperation,"" Mark Toner, a deputy spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, said Thursday regarding Zardari's India visit. Observers say the Sunday lunch meeting between the Indian and Pakistani leaders was encouraging. ""The lunch being hosted by the prime minister for a Pakistani president on a private visit is a welcome step,"" said Uday Bhaskar, a strategic analyst.","Singh and Zardari discuss bilateral issues in New Delhi .

"(CNN) -- One of the most highly anticipated apps for Apple devices was made available on Wednesday. At least, until it wasn't. Google announced a Gmail app for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch that was designed to make it easier for the service's more than 190 million users to navigate their mail. ""We check email pretty much everywhere these days,"" Google content manager Matthew Izatt wrote on the Gmail blog. ""And when we do, we want easy access to our important messages so we can respond quickly and get back to life -- or slinging birds at thieving green pigs."" Users of Apple's operating system could already access Gmail through a mobile site or set it up as their default e-mail account. But the new app promised a smoother experience with a host of new features. The tech blogosphere was delighted. ""Go get the iPhone app for Gmail!"" popular blogger Robert Scoble wrote on his Google+ page. Then, a few minutes passed. ""UPDATE: DO NOT. The Gmail app is really a piece of crud,"" he wrote. ""Not worth loading. Very disappointed."" Google had obviously already noticed what Scoble did. Shortly after it was unveiled, the app was pulled from the Apple Store. ""The iOS app we launched today contained a bug with notifications,"" Google posted on its Gmail Twitter account. ""We have pulled the app to fix the problem. Sorry we messed up."" Later, a fuller explanation was added to the original blog post. ""Earlier today we launched a new Gmail app for iOS,"" Google posted. ""Unfortunately, it contained a bug which broke notifications and caused users to see an error message when first opening the app. We've removed the app while we correct the problem, and we're working to bring you a new version soon. Everyone who's already installed the app can continue to use it."" The app ... at least the fully working version of it ... will send push notifications and sound cues when new messages are received, search your inbox for an e-mail, autocomplete e-mail addresses and upload photos to messages. It will also feature the same Priority Inbox that Gmail's Web version has and add a new mobile interface that will allow users to navigate their inbox more quickly with touch controls. There was no word from Google Wednesday afternoon as to when the fixed app might be back up.","Gmail mobile app is released, then pulled, from Apple's online store .

"(CNN) -- The 850-square-kilometer swath of the Indian Ocean where officials have focused their hunt for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 probably isn't the right place, the joint search agency said Thursday. The area off the coast of western Australia is not the ""final resting place of MH370,"" the Australia-based Joint Agency Coordination Centre said. Officials zeroed in on that zone after acoustic pings originally thought to be from the black boxes of the missing plane were detected in early April. ""The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has advised that the search in the vicinity of the acoustic detections can now be considered complete and in its professional judgment, the area can now be discounted as the final resting place of MH370,"" a statement from the Joint Agency Coordination Centre said. But Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss defended the country's efforts in the southern Indian Ocean. ""We are still very confident that the resting place of the aircraft is in the southern ocean and along the seventh ping line,"" he told Parliament on Thursday. ""We concentrated the search in this area because the pings and the information we received was the best information we had available at the time. And that is all you can do in circumstances like this ... follow the very best leads."" Unlikely to be from Flight 370 . Hours earlier, a U.S. Navy official told CNN that the pings at the center of the search for the past seven weeks are no longer believed to have come from the plane's black boxes. The acknowledgment came Wednesday as searchers wrapped up the first phase of their effort in the southern Indian Ocean floor without finding any wreckage from the Boeing 777. Authorities now almost universally believe that the pings did not come from the onboard data or cockpit voice recorders but instead from some other manmade source unrelated to the jetliner that disappeared March 8, according to Michael Dean, the Navy's deputy director of ocean engineering. If the pings had come from the recorders, searchers would have found them, he said. When asked whether other countries involved in the search had reached the same conclusions, Dean said, ""yes."" Underwater search for MH370 postponed for at least 2 months . ""Our best theory at this point is that (the pings were) likely some sound produced by the ship ... or within the electronics of the Towed Pinger Locator,"" Dean said. The pinger locator was used by searchers to listen for underwater signals. Signals still being studied . ""Always your fear any time you put electronic equipment in the water is that if any water gets in and grounds or shorts something out, that you could start producing sound,"" Dean explained. He said it is not possible to absolutely exclude that the pings came from the black boxes, but there is no evidence now to suggest they did. However, U.S. Navy spokesman Chris Johnson called Dean's statement ""speculative and premature."" ""I am not saying that what Michael Dean said was inaccurate,"" Johnson said, ""but what we are saying is that it is not his place to say it."" The Navy is continuing ""to work with our partners to more thoroughly understand the data acquired by the Towed Pinger Locater,"" he said. ""As such, we would defer to the Australians, as the lead in the search effort, to make additional information known at the appropriate time,"" he said. Australian Transport Safety Bureau Chief Commissioner Martin Dolan, whose agency judged that the plane isn't in the area where the pings were detected, said the signals were still being analyzed. ""We are a cautious and evidence-based organization, and at this stage, we do not understand the signals sufficiently to understand their cause,"" he said, declining to comment specifically on Dean's statement. Here's what we do and don't know about new MH370 data . Disbelieving families . Sarah Bajc, whose partner Philip Wood was on the plane, dismissed the back-and-forth over the release of the latest information a public relations management. As far as she and some of the other families are concerned, they have not received the truth from officials since the get-go. ""The sequence of events is just a blatant coverup as far as I'm concerned,"" she told CNN. Bajc is among the family members calling for an independent investigation. Private investigators have been hired by relatives of those on the plane, but Malaysian and Australian officials have not been interested, she said. ""But they don't listen, and they don't respond,"" she said. Key role in search . The pings have played a key role in shaping the search for the plane, which disappeared on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people aboard. Search officials expressed ""cautious optimism"" in the pings when they were discovered April 5 and 8. Angus Houston, the man leading the hunt for the missing plane, said as recently as this month that the pulse signals remained ""the most promising lead"" in the search. The optimism stemmed from the fact the pings were detected near an arc where an Inmarsat satellite had last communicated with the plane. And it was bolstered by the pinger's steady one-ping-a-second cadence, matching that of equipment known to be on the plane. But caution stemmed from the ping's 33.3 kHz frequency, slightly lower than 37.5 kHz design frequency. There were also concerns because the four ping detection sites were miles apart. But experts said crash damage or deep ocean pressures could alter the pinger frequency. They said the plane's two black boxes could have been separated during an explosion or crash. And they noted that sounds can travel far, and even echo, in underwater environments. Dean said Wednesday that officials were also concerned because, after twice detecting pings April 5, searchers had difficulty reacquiring the pings the next day. One incident -- the loss of the pinger signal April 8 -- had the peculiar impact of both lowering and raising expectations. The signal loss made it harder to zero in on the black boxes. But it also boosted confidence that they had found the pingers, since the batteries were expected to die about that time. Truss, the Australian deputy prime minister, said the next stage of the search will begin in August and is expected to take up to 12 months. ""Hopefully, there will be a breakthrough earlier, and so it won't take that amount of time,"" he said. ""But unfortunately, this is a painstaking effort in a very large ocean."" What happens next?

"DONGGUAN, China (CNN) -- Whenever Deng Huidong sees a little boy around 3 years of age, she can't help but wonder if he's her son. Her son, Ye Ruicong, was snatched by human traffickers more than a year ago when he was just 9 months old. Parents outside the home of activist Deng Huidong in southeast China, hold banners with pictures of abducted children. ""I imagine how tall he would be, how fast he could run,"" Huidong said. ""I take photos of boys who are about the same age to see; this way I can recognize him if we ever meet one day."" Huidong believes Ruicong was sold, possibly within hours, to a family without a son looking for a male heir. Males come with a premium price tag in China. During a videotaped confession, a woman caught trafficking children two years ago told police that boys can sell for up to $1,200, girls for just more than $200. Ruicong was gone in an instant. Recalling the abduction, Huidong said a white van slowly drove by while she was just outside her home with her daughter and son. The van stopped and reversed to the Deng household. The doors opened and a man leaned out and grabbed Ruicong. The van then sped off. ""It all happened within seconds; they didn't even get out of the car.""  Watch how children are snatched » . Huidong gave chase on foot, screaming. A stranger on a motorcycle offered to help and together they chased the van until they reached a police car. ""I went in that damn police car but after a only a few seconds, they took a sudden turn down another road. I asked why but they just kept silent. I was crying and asking; they simply didn't reply. Later at the police station, I asked why and he told me he was off duty, so it was some one else's responsibility to catch the traffickers."" Despite repeated requests by CNN, the police involved refused to comment. ""We were really angry with the police,"" Huidong said. ""Our son was snatched and they simply did nothing. It was like my lost son is less important than a dog."" Other parents whose children were lost have also complained of police indifference. Like Zhang Chunxiang, whose son went missing five years ago. ""Nobody helped us. The police did not think it was a big deal; it was November. It was not until December when they started to investigate."" Chen Fengyi's 4-year-old son was abducted while playing outside the family shop. ""The local police said our child had strayed by himself. Our entire family looked for him until dawn, I went back to the police station and knelt down to them but they didn't care, they kept saying 'the child went astray, look for him yourself.' The reason why they wouldn't open a case file was because there was no one who saw the abduction, nor was there video surveillance of the child being taken."" Police again declined to be interviewed. But the man in charge of stopping human trafficking in China did agree to talk.  Watch his assessment of the problem » . Chen Shiqu, director of the Anti-Human Traffic Division of the Public Security Ministry, confirmed that in the past if there was no evidence a child had been abducted, then police did not have to open a case. But now the law has changed. ""Local police have been told to react as soon as they are alerted and these cases are now being treated as a criminal offense,"" Chen said. ""There were cases (in the past) with no witnesses, or security video available, police officers would help look for the missing child and investigate but the case wasn't treated as a crime. But now they're all treated as crimes."" Chen would not comment on specific cases, only saying the claims by parents in this report were the exception. ""The few cases you mentioned will be solved according to procedure."" Even when abduction has been caught on security camera video, there have been charges that the police have been slow to act. Lele was 3 years old when he was taken from a square in the city of Shenzhen, all caught by security camera video, but his father Peng Gaofeng says it took police eight days to watch this tape. ""They didn't say anything after they watched the video. They just copied it and said it was confidential. I thought they would try to find my kid with the video, but I never heard anything for two months. I asked the policemen and they said this case was confidential"" More than a year later, Lele remains missing, and his father says he is treated like a dissident. ""During sensitive times, like Children's Day, the government forces me to leave town ... they were afraid I would organize some activities like searching for kids. It's always like that."" Police in Lele's case did not respond to CNN's request for an interview. Chen did not say how many children and how many women are annually trafficked in China, saying only the total for last year was 2, 256 -- roughly divided evenly between children and women. He disputed -- without saying why -- the U.S. State Department estimate that between 10,000 and 20,000 women and children are trafficked each year in China; he disputes the view from the United Nations that anecdotal evidence suggests the official numbers are low. ""Police stations have recorded every case of kids missing and trafficked,"" Chen said, ""so we don't think your data are valid."" In 2005 the Committee on the Rights of Children said the Chinese government numbers almost exclusively refer to the number of rescues, not the number of kidnappings. Chen said police have launched regular nationwide crackdowns; rescued babies have been shown on state-run television. There's a new most-wanted list of the country's worst traffickers, he said, and 11 out of 20 have been arrested. Chen also cited something parents of missing children have been asking for: a new DNA database operating in parts of the country, matching rescued children with their parents. ""The appearance of children missing or stolen changes so that even their parents have difficulty in recognizing them,"" Chen said. The parents of the stolen children also have complained that the law does not punish the buyers, providing the child is not mistreated. As long as that doesn't change, they say, there will always be a market with traffickers eager to do business. As for Deng Huidong, the mother of Ruicong, she said thoughts of a family reunion are too painful. ""These days I just keep thinking that my boy is being taken care of by a kind-hearted family. I could give my son up as long as they really like him, and just tell me he is living a comfortable life.""","Distraught Chinese families expose problem of children believed stolen to order .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Two members of the female punk rock band Pussy Riot have fled Russia, the group said. ""In regard to the pursuit, two of our members have successfully fled the country! Recruiting foreign feminists to prepare new actions,"" the group said on Twitter. A Russian court this month sentenced three members of the band to two years in prison after they were found guilty of hooliganism for performing a song critical of President Vladimir Putin in a church. Five members had taken part in the performance, but authorities had managed to arrest only three. Russian police were searching for the other two participants. While Pussy Riot tweeted Sunday that two members fled the country ""because of the danger,"" Pyotr Verzilov, husband of jailed band member Nadezdha Tolokonnikova, would not say Monday whether the two who have fled took part in the February performance in Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral. ""Two girls have left the country to protect themselves. They are in the safe place. Talking about whether they will stay there forever, it's hard to say because nothing lasts forever. Probably they will return one day. But you must remember that there are 12 or even 14 members who are still in Russia and participate in the band's work now,"" he said. Verzilov would not say whether the two have formally applied for asylum in another country.

"(CNN) -- Singer-songwriter Jack Johnson released a new album on April 17 in honor of Earth Day called ""Jack Johnson and Friends: Best of Kokua Festival."" It's a collection of live highlights from the festival over the years featuring some legendary names in music: Willie Nelson, Jackson Browne, Eddie Vedder and Dave Matthews. But the album is about more than just music. The proceeds from both the festival and the album go back to Johnson's Kokua Hawaii Foundation to promote conservation efforts in Hawaii. Johnson and his wife, Kim, are natives of Hawaii, and for years they have been champions of conservation, environmental awareness and education both in their native state and around the world. ""We decided to create the foundation because I stole my wife away from teaching geometry and she became my first tour manager, and ... she wanted to be involved in education again."" Johnson said. Their foundation got them both back into Hawaiian classrooms. The Kokua Hawaii Foundation supports environmental education in schools and communities throughout Hawaii. The main programs the foundation has implemented since its creation in 2003 promote recycling and taking children out of the classroom and into the environment for hands-on learning experiences. Most recently, the foundation introduced the Plastic Free Schools program to reduce single-use plastic on the Hawaiian Islands. ""The Kokua Hawaii Foundation's programs are really hands-on and get kids out into nature. Usually, they are having so much fun that they don't realize how much they are learning,"" Johnson said. To raise money for the foundation, the Johnsons created the Kokua Festival in 2004. The festival is held every year on Earth Day weekend outdoors in Honolulu's Waikiki Shell. Johnson brings in friends in the music industry who share his passion for environmental preservation. ""All of the musicians who've played at the Kokua Festival have a connection to the cause and the work we are doing with the foundation,"" Johnson says. ""The musicians themselves were a big inspiration for the foundation from the start -- like how Willie Nelson runs his tour buses and trucks on biodiesel and how Eddie Vedder has been active in several environmental causes."" ""For me, it's wonderful to get the chance to play with these musicians I respect and have loved for years, to share some great music with them and use that music to help raise funds we need to keep Kokua Hawaii Foundation's programs going. Hopefully, that inspiration goes both ways, and the musicians who join us will implement some of the greening measures from the festival into their own tours."" In addition to the music, the festival also continues in the educational tradition of the foundation. More than 50 eco-friendly businesses and local environmental groups set up shop in the Kokua Village, which is much like what Johnson does on tour. Here, the fans can learn about sustainable products, watch alternative energy demonstrations and sample local food and beverages. Another element that mirrors Johnson's efforts on tour: There are free water refill stations to encourage the use of reusable water bottles.","Singer-songwriter Jack Johnson releases a new album in honor of Earth Day .

I liked to think of myself as someone who exercised every day by running on a giant motorized treadmill, read all the literary classics, and baked cookies for every special occasion. The reality? I am not a runner, I like to read pop fiction, and cookies aren't really my thing. The treadmill, the boxes of books, and some kitchen gadgets all found new homes. 4. Trust me: You won't fix it. Most of the broken things I had brought with me were shoes. Heels or straps had come off, and I was convinced I would someday have them repaired. My husband held the shoes up in front of me, pair by pair, and asked two questions: ""If you saw these shoes in a store today, would you buy them?"" and ""If you say yes, how much would you pay for them?"" In all but one case, I admitted that I wouldn't buy the shoes again. And those red kitten heels with the broken sole? The amount I was wiling to pay was less than the cost of having them fixed. Real Simple: How to Sell, Swap, or Donate Clothes . 5. Do look a gift horse in the mouth. My decorating tastes may change over time, but I am fairly certain I will never enjoy a home filled with a series of rhinestone-accented paintings of scary clowns. Yet I had hoarded these and other unattractive presents because I thought that was the decent thing to do. I also wasn't sure what I would say if someone noticed his gift missing and asked why. Well, you know what? No one has. Not even the bestower of scary clowns. 6. Adapt to your surroundings. I had a used Volvo 740 GLE that was the first car I had purchased after college. Before I moved Washington, I lived in the Midwest, where it was tough to get around without a car. In D.C., however, we lived next to a metro station, and there was a grocery store two blocks away. The price of parking -- $150 a month -- sealed it: The GLE was G-O-N-E. Real Simple: 5 Ways to Develop Thick Skin . 7. Just admit that you don't like it. As I sorted through my stuff, I became aware of the fact that I didn't even want some of it. There were things I didn't exactly like but didn't exactly hate -- and so lived with them out of pure apathy. This was the easiest clutter to set free. All it took was a little motivation to pack up a few boxes and drop them off at a local charity. 8. Know what you really need. Often what we need is only related to the thing we have. For instance, I had a huge popcorn maker but could easily pop the modest amount of corn we consumed in a small pot on the stove. Out it went. I also had thousands of documents in bulky filing cabinets. But I needed the information on the pages, not the paper itself. I kept just the documents I had to have in their original form, scanned and saved others as digital files, and tossed the rest-eliminating 300 pounds of paper. Real Simple: 7 Steps to Dealing With Sentimental Clutter . 9. Let go of the guilt. When my grandparents passed away, I inherited a collection of 27 rusty knives, a warped cookie sheet, and a copper bracelet my grandmother had loved to wear. I kept all these items for more than a decade. Eventually I realized that if my grandparents were alive, they would have replaced the cookie sheet and knife set (and been mortified that my aunts had passed on such dangerous accoutrements). I recycled the kitchen implements, but I kept the bracelet, which I wear and enjoy as much as my grandmother did. 10. Face it: ""One day"" almost never comes. I justified keeping half my wardrobe on the basis that I would use it one day. The hot pink bridesmaid dress from my cousin's first wedding took up space in my closet for four times the length of her marriage. I hate throwing out potentially useful things. But we couldn't afford a larger apartment; storing all those ""one day"" items would cost more than they were worth; and, an even simpler truth, I have yet to be invited to an event at which a fuchsia dress with taffeta bows might seem appropriate.

"Washington (CNN) -- Nine new graphic cigarette warning labels showing cancerous lesions and other impacts of smoking were unveiled Tuesday by the Food and Drug Administration, part of the agency's sweeping new powers to regulate tobacco and tobacco products. ""With these warnings, every person who picks up a pack of cigarettes is going to know exactly what risk they're taking,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters. Sebelius called smoking and other tobacco use the ""number one cause of preventable death"" in America, claiming more than 440,000 lives a year. Cigarette packages will now carry one vivid color image and one of these warnings about the consequences of smoking: ""Cigarettes are addictive""; ""Tobacco smoke can harm your children""; ""Cigarettes cause fatal lung disease""; ""Cigarettes cause cancer""; ""Cigarettes cause strokes and heart disease""; ""Smoking during pregnancy can harm your baby""; ""Smoking can kill you""; ""Tobacco smoke causes fatal lung disease in nonsmokers""; and ""Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health."" The warnings, which must be in place by September 2012, will cover the upper portion of the pack both front and back. At least 50% of the package will have to be covered. In addition, the warnings will have to cover at least 20% of a cigarette ad. Small ads less than 12 inches don't require the 20% coverage, but must still have a warning. Each warning will also have a phone number -- 1-800-QUIT-NOW -- that smokers can call to get help if they want to quit. According to Sebelius, a stall in the downward trend of smoking in America, particularly among young people, prompted President Barack Obama to renew the focus on getting Americans to kick the habit or never start smoking in the first place. It is the first government-mandated label change for cigarettes in 25 years, she said, adding that a major motivation was targeting young people from wanting to smoke. ""Somebody said when they first saw the warning, these are really gross, and they are,"" Sebelius said. ""We want kids to understand smoking is gross, not cool."" The new packaging and ads, which must be in place by September 2012, result from the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA), which mandates cigarette packs and advertisements have larger and ""more visible graphic health warnings"" as part of an effort to educate the public about the health risks associated with smoking. Margaret Hamburg, the commissioner of food and drugs at the federal Food and Drug Administration, said the nine images chosen for the new packaging requirements were tested for their impact on various target groups, such as teenagers and pregnant women. She noted that a pack-a-day smoker will confront the graphic photos more than 7,000 times a year. ""This will be a dramatic change in what a cigarette package looks like, no doubt about it,"" Hamburg said, later adding: ""It will change the consumer response to a package of cigarettes, but frankly, that's what we want."" Thomas Glynn, director of cancer science and trends for the American Cancer Society, said the old labels have been virtually invisible because they're small and have been around for so long. He said people have become immune and don't really ""see"" them any more, but the new labels will be hard to ignore and will help focus attention on the problem. ""This is going to be a very important element in the tobacco control tool box, but it's not a panacea,"" Glynn said. ""For smokers, it's a new and very visible reminder that smoking can harm them, harm people around them, including children. For nonsmokers, it's a reminder that smokers need their help and concern as far as quitting. The labels are not just for smokers, the labels are for anyone interested in public health."" Glynn says about 20% of the population still smokes, a number that has been pretty steady over the past five years. He hopes the new labels will jump-start a downward trend and reignite discussions about tobacco use. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 443,000 people in the U.S. die from smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke annually and more than 8 million are living with a disease that's directly tied to smoking. The CDC says smoking is responsible for 90% of all lung cancer deaths in men and 80% in women. It estimates smoking causes 90% of all chronic obstructive lung disease deaths such as bronchitis and emphysema. In January, both R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris, the two largest tobacco companies in the United States, opposed the required warnings in letters to the FDA. R.J. Reynolds, maker of some of the country's best-selling brands such as Camel, Kool, Winston and Salem, said the new requirements violate the First and Fifth Amendments. The company said, in part, ""The anti-smoking message is not intended to provide information that smokers and potential smokers can consider rationally in weighing the risks and perceived benefits from smoking. Rather, it plainly conveys -- through graphic images and designs intended to elicit loathing, disgust, and repulsion -- the government's viewpoint that the risks associated with smoking cigarettes outweigh the pleasure that smokers derive from them and, therefore, that no one should use these lawful products."" R.J. Reynolds said ""by confiscating"" the top 50% of the package and 20% of the ads, the government is not warning consumers about smoking risks -- it is telling consumers, 'Don't buy or use this product.' ""The company is asking the FDA to withdraw the new rule, which it says is flawed, and issue a new one. Philip Morris, the country's largest tobacco company, supported the FSPTCA legislation. But in its letter, the company raised questions about the constitutionality of the labels. ""Any government requirement that compels a private entity to carry a message not of its own choosing raises constitutional concerns ... To the extent that FDA were to select warnings based on their ability to evoke negative or cognitive reactions -- not their ability to objectively inform consumers about the health risks of smoking -- such warnings would not pass constitutional muster,"" the company wrote. It said the sheer size of the warnings violates the First Amendment. The tobacco companies are footing the bill for the new labels. However, Glynn noted that tobacco-related disease and health problems cost $95 billion a year. ""The cost of putting the pictures on is at the expense of the tobacco industry; there is no cost to the government,"" Glynn said. ""So this is not the government spending money, and yet what we are going to gain from it is less death and less disease -- and that's going to save the government money."" With this new move, the United States will be the 40th country to have picture warnings on our cigarette packs, making the country compliant with the World Health Organization's global treaty on tobacco. Under the treaty, 35% of a cigarette pack must have warnings and pictures. The treaty has already been ratified by 173 of 192 member nations of the United Nations. The United States is one of 19 countries that has not ratified the treaty, but with the new labels, will be compliant. Countries such as Canada, Brazil and Australia have long been leaders in tobacco control and have had very graphic art on their packaging for years. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: Top health official says the goal is lower death toll, health care costs from tobacco .

"(CNN) -- Fire officials in Orange County, California, ordered the evacuation of hundreds of homes while personnel work to control a wildfire that has charred roughly 1,500 acres in the Silverado Canyon area. The Silverado Fire began Friday in the mountains of Cleveland National Forest and is currently 10% contained, officials said. But with record-high, triple-digit temperatures expected to continue through the weekend, the chances of controlling the blaze in an area with heavy, tinder-dry brush and rugged terrain are worrisome. ""Because of the drought and high temperatures, it makes (fuel components) very receptive to ignition. We get any embers and we got a 95 percent chance of the thing igniting,"" said Chon Bribiescas, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service, told CNN affiliate KABC. A heat advisory was issued for all of Orange County until Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. The official cause for the fire is still unknown. But the Forest Service told KABC that the fire began in someone's backyard. More than 800 fire personnel are on site working to control the blaze, along with the aid of 15 aircraft vehicles. Three firefighters were hospitalized and released after suffering heat-related injuries, according to CNN affiliate KTLA. Approximately 217 homes were ordered to evacuate the area as a precaution.

"(Oprah.com) -- Save the heavy stuff for later: Keeping skin hydrated is key (especially when you're in the air), but slathering on your heaviest cream can leave your face looking oily. Try a gel-based moisturizer (celebrity makeup artist Daniel Martin likes aloe vera gel) that absorbs and dries quickly. To even your complexion when you're in a hurry, apply a stripe of stick concealer down the bridge of your nose and across your cheekbones, forehead and chin. Then blend all over with a bit of light lotion for sheer coverage. Tone down a breakout: You know what a few squirts of Visine can do after a red-eye, but it also works on that blemish on your forehead. Apply a couple of drops to a cotton swab or hold the tip of the bottle directly on the pimple for a few seconds to quickly cut redness, says Martin. Then dab the area with a tissue to absorb residual moisture. If you still need more coverage, apply a light layer of concealer and gently press with a clean tissue to set it. Oprah.com: 9 beauty treats under a buck . Stick to cream makeup: If you're putting on makeup in a dim airplane bathroom, stick with creams, which are more difficult to overdo because they melt into skin -- unlike powders, which require more blending and are less forgiving, says Martin. Plus, you don't need an arsenal of brushes to apply. CoverGirl NatureLuxe Gloss Balm, $6, is one of his favorites because the sheer, shea-butter formula can be used on lips and cheeks and the small size makes it easy to fit in your purse for quick touch-ups. If you can't part with your powder blush or bronzer, use a smaller brush to give you more control and prevent color from splattering on your shirt collar, says Rebecca Creer, who covered the globe from Nigeria to Japan doing everything from manicures to massages as an in-flight beauty therapist (and currently dispenses tips and picks up new ones from flight attendants and crew members as the spas and grooming manager for Virgin Atlantic Airways). Try BareMinerals Retractable Flawless Application Brush, $30, which comes with a protective cover so bristles don't get crushed in your carry-on. Oprah.com: Packing secrets from travel pros . Help makeup work overtime: Long-wear lipsticks are particularly enticing if you don't have time to constantly reapply, but Martin says these formulas leave little room for mistakes and can often be drying. To get staying power without sacrificing hydration, try Creer's go-to trick: Apply a light layer of foundation or concealer to lips, fill them in with lip liner, then swipe lipstick over the top. Extend the life of your blush and eyeshadow by dusting translucent powder over your face and lids first. ""It provides an adhesive surface for pigment and prevents streaks,"" says Martin. Oprah.com: The lazy woman's guide to fabulous hair . Hide dark circles in a hurry: Neutralize blue tones by applying an apricot colored concealer or primer (like Koh Gen Do Foundation Color Corrector in Dark Apricot, $34). And use a light eyeshadow that won't emphasize darkness or highlight fine lines, like a shimmer-free bone shade. But if puffiness is your problem, putting coverup on top can reflect light and make your undereye area look more pronounced. Martin says it's better to apply a concealer that matches your skin tone to the inner corners of your eyes and buff it out along the sockets with your ring finger. To look more awake, add a coat of mascara to your top lashes only, wiggling it into the roots and rolling out to the ends. Be careful not to pump the wand in the tube -- this causes mascara to dry out more quickly, says Creer. Fix a smudge -- fast: Martin says applying a creamy concealer with your finger will break down the pigment and blend it out -- so much easier than washing off a mascara flub and starting over.

To get frizz under control, massage a pea-size drop of hand cream into your palms and lightly run them over your hair.

"(CNN) -- Overprotective sister? Underprotective husband? No one knows what was said amongst Solange Knowles, Jay Z and Beyonce in that elevator in the Standard Hotel in Manhattan or even what led up to the video that appears to show Solange kicking and hitting her brother-in-law. But here is what we do know: the Internet is on fire with theories. Earlier this week, an elevator surveillance video surfaced that showed Solange appearing to berate Jay Z before she becomes physical. Her sister, Beyonce, is present and witnesses the attack. The incident has inspired a hashtag, #WhatJaySaidToSolange, countless memes and tons of speculation. Quoting an anonymous source, Us Weekly reported that Solange Knowles had an earlier run-in with designer Rachel Roy. (Roy is the ex-wife of Damon Dash, Jay Z's former friend and business partner.) The New York Daily News, also using an unnamed source, took it one step further. In addition to the alleged argument with Roy, the paper threw in Jay Z's supposed desire to head solo to a party being given by Rihanna. This, according to the Daily News, did not sit well with Beyonce's younger sister. Talk show host Wendy Williams also offered her own observations, including what appears to be the removal of a tattoo on Beyonce's finger of the roman numeral ""IV."" It was reportedly her wedding ring tattoo, meant to symbolize both her wedding date (April 4) as well as her and Jay Z's birthdays (September 4 and December 4, respectively). So far, some of the principal characters seem to be letting Instagram speak for them. Beyonce has posted happy pictures of her and her sister, while Solange participated in ""Throwback Thursday"" with a picture of the two siblings as kids. Even Dash has gotten in on the photo game, posting an old picture of Solange with a group and the caption: ""Forgot about this one @ava_dash @atrak and solange ... I am actually impressed with her independent spirit... She seems like a fighter #festivallife."" The mystery continues.","Theories are buzzing on the Internet about what sparked the hotel elevator incident .

"(CNN) -- Going against his personal views, Pennsylvania's governor won't challenge a federal judge's ruling striking his state's same-sex marriage ban, paving the way for gay and lesbian couples to marry there. Gov. Tom Corbett announced his decision in a statement Wednesday, a day after U.S. District Judge John E. Jones became the latest federal judge to declare a state's restriction of marriage to one man and one woman to be unconstitutional. Pennsylvania officials will ""follow ... the provisions of Judge Jones' order with respect for all parties,"" the governor said. State Attorney General Kathleen Kane has also announced that she will not defend Pennsylvania's same-sex marriage ban because of what she believes is ""the unconstitutionality of this law."" That means that while other entities could file appeals of their own, they are unlikely to have legal standing and therefore affect what happens in Pennsylvania. Corbett -- a Republican who just won his party's primary in pursuit of a re-election bid and, as he points out, a Roman Catholic -- said in his statement Wednesday that he still personally believes ""that marriage is between one man and one woman."" His decision not to stand by that belief in court comes after ""a judgment as to the likelihood of a successful appeal."" ""Given the high legal threshold set forth by Judge Jones in this case, the case is extremely unlikely to succeed on appeal,"" Corbett said. ""Therefore, after review of the opinion and on the advice of my Commonwealth legal team, I have decided not appeal."" State-by-state: Developments on same-sex marriage . Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, slammed Corbett for opting ""to defend himself and his political aspirations"" rather than the traditional definition of marriage. ""Governor Corbett is abandoning marriage with this choice,"" Brown said on his organization's blog. ""He is also turning his back on the people of Pennsylvania and selling out his principles precisely when it is most necessary that he stand by them!"" Yet others applauded Corbett's decision. Those supportive voices include Jeff Cook-McCormac, a senior adviser with the American Unity Fund, a PAC dedicated to making a conservative case for ""the cause of freedom for gay and lesbian Americans."" Cook-McCormac said Corbett ""did the right thing today, preventing a prolonged, divisive debate and providing much needed certainty for loving Pennsylvania families."" ""Like Republican Governors Christie, Martinez and Sandoval before him, Governor Corbett recognizes there are thoughtful people with sincerely held beliefs on both sides of this issue and his decision allows his state to move forward and focus on the priorities citizens are concerned most about,"" Cook-McCormac added. Jones' decision was the latest in a wave of rulings against state prohibitions on same-sex marriage in the 11 months since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. That 5-4 opinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, did not directly affect individual states' laws restricting marriage based on sexual orientation. But many federal judges have cited his decision on United States v. Windsor in their judgments, as well as the argument that same-sex marriage bans violate the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Most of these court rulings have been stayed -- meaning that, for now, marriage prohibitions remain in place -- until appeals courts, and possibly the Supreme Court, weigh in. Already, judges in the 10th Circuit out of Denver and 4th Circuit out of Richmond, Virginia, have heard appeals. All this movement in legal circles comes amid a significant shift in public opinion in recent years. Several states moved to allow gay and lesbian marriages last year on their own volition. A Gallup survey released Wednesday showed that 55% of respondents support laws granting same-sex couples equal rights to traditional marriages, the highest such number since Gallup began polling on this question in 1996.

"United Nations (CNN) -- Three more regions of Somalia have now been struck by famine, including the capital, Mogadishu, the United Nations announced Wednesday. Mogadishu, the Afgooye corridor and the Shabelle regions west of the capital are the latest that ""have slipped into famine,"" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters Wednesday afternoon. The declaration ""reflects the massive influx of people into the city in the last two months,"" he said. ""This latest information also confirms the seriousness of the problem facing internally displaced people in Mogadishu, who require our immediate and concerted response,"" he said. The United Nations issued a famine declaration for two districts of southern Somalia in June. The entire Horn of Africa region is facing an extensive drought that has left more than 12 million in need of assistance. Relief efforts in Somalia have been hindered by the ongoing battle between Islamist rebels and Somalia's transitional government, which holds little sway beyond Mogadishu. The rate of malnutrition in Somalia's rebel-held south is the highest in the world, approaching half the population, U.N. officials report. About 100,000 people displaced by the fighting have flocked to Mogadishu in recent weeks, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. More than 3.7 million Somalis are in need of aid, including about 1.3 million children ""in urgent need of life-saving interventions."" Of those, about 640,000 are acutely malnourished, the office reports. The rebel movement Al-Shabaab launched a Ramadan offensive Monday amid the spreading famine with heavy fighting reported in the northeastern part of the city, according to African Union officials. Two soldiers from the AU peacekeeping mission in Mogadishu were killed during a gunfight with the rebels, during which troops killed two apparent suicide bombers dressed in Somali uniforms before they were able to detonate bombs strapped to their bodies. ""In the midst of a famine seizing Somalia, the extremists are choosing to focus on killing, not saving life,"" said Lt. Col. Paddy Ankunda, a spokesman for the peacekeeping mission. ""The extremists are using desperate measures to achieve their ends through their willingness to use brutal violence during the holy month of Ramadan."" Amid the crisis, a senior U.N. official urged Somali expatriates to support peace efforts and contribute to relief efforts Wednesday. ""This is a time of great crisis, but also of rare opportunity. It is a time for everyone to pull together to help those suffering and to work towards a better future for all,"" Augustine Mahiga, the U.N. special representative for Somalia, said in a letter addressed to Somalis abroad.","NEW: About 100,000 people recently arrive in Mogadishu in need of help, the U.N. says .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder is most afraid of a terrorist attack on the United States from a so-called ""lone wolf,"" such as the attackers involved in the Washington Navy Yard and Los Angeles International Airport shootings. ""I'm very concerned about individuals who get radicalized in a variety of ways, sometimes self-radicalized,"" the nation's top law enforcement officer told CNN's Justice reporter Evan Perez in an exclusive interview. Just days after a shooter entered LAX airport and killed one Transportation Security Administration worker, Holder rejected the idea to arm those officers. ""Now, that doesn't mean that we shouldn't review the measures that are in place to keep people safe from the time that they get out of their cars and go into the terminals,"" he said. In the wide-ranging conversation Tuesday, he also said that he rejected demands from supporters that NSA leaker Edward Snowden be offered clemency. Holder: New strategies needed for 'active shooter' situations . As President Barack Obama's top legal expert, the attorney general deflected a question about whether he has gotten a free pass for approving many of the surveillance tactics at the National Security Agency. He responded: ""We have to ask some very legitimate questions."" Holder spoke to CNN during a visit to a federal courthouse Tuesday to highlight a program that helps ex-offenders reintegrate into their communities. Holder said he didn't support clemency for Snowden, the national security contractor who leaked the classified information about surveillance programs. He said ""the mechanisms that he used"" to publicize his concerns with the government's surveillance aren't ""worthy of clemency."" ""I think that he has clearly broken the law and harmed the nation that he claims to have loved,"" Holder said. While Holder said Snowden deserved to be punished for his crime, in nearly the same breath he said that Snowden sparked a necessary conversation. ""The conversation that we are engaged in is one that I think is certainly worthwhile, to try to determine how do we safeguard privacy and keep the American people safe,"" Holder said. Holder says the administration needs to ask itself if the surveillance net had ""gone to far,"" but it wouldn't go as far as saying if it was a concern he had before the Snowden incident. ""I didn't say that,"" Holder responded, adding that the administration was already having ""conversations"" about the collection of metadata. ""It was a conversation that, frankly, was going on, certainly within the administration,"" Holder said. ""Now the conversation is a .. is a more public one."" Holder isn't going anywhere soon . The reach of the NSA's surveillance has caused a fiery response overseas and domestically since Snowden leaked documents to The Washington Post and The Guardian newspapers. Holder said Snowden could have addressed his concerns with government surveillance in other ways, such as through the court system. Throughout his tenure, Holder has come under fire from Republican critics who held him in contempt of Congress. He has been under investigation, and subsequently cleared by the inspector general, in the botched gun-trafficking program ""Fast and Furious."" He has also taken fire for his role in defending the Voting Rights Act and reviewing cases of detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Despite the turmoil, Holder has refused calls for his resignation. As instances of mass gun violence continue to spark conversations about gun control, Holder said Tuesday that politicians in Washington failed to pass meaningful gun safety legislation. ""Yes, we've failed. We've failed,"" Holder said, referring to Congress' refusal to pass stricter background checks of gun purchasers after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, last year. ""It can't be the new normal. It cannot be something that we accept. Uh, there is too much gun violence,"" he added. As two states have legalized marijuana and voters in one of those state, Colorado, head to the polls today to vote on a marijuana tax, Holder said he doesn't anticipate any change to federal laws outlawing the drug. Instead, he said he is looking at how marijuana laws are enforced. While Holder plans to stay on the job, he admits that times haven't always been easy. ""I've had some days that have been better than others,"" he said.","Eric Holder tells CNN he is worried about an individual terrorist attack on the U.S.

"(CNN) -- Winning a pageant title is life-changing, especially during the year of your reign. If it's a big crown, like a state title, it can be like a full-time gig as you prepare for the national event and make appearances. Elizabeth Fechtel set right to work after getting her tiara on June 21, when she was named Miss Florida. She reportedly had even dropped out of the University of Florida so she could prepare for the Miss America contest in September. But now, she won't be going to the premier beauty contest. Pageant officials announced Friday there had been a mistake in tabulating what must have been very close final scores. And days after getting her crown, Fechtel was giving it back, so the Miss Florida organization could give it to Victoria Cowen, originally announced as first runner-up. The executive director of the pageant said on Facebook that the organization had to make things right. ""Integrity means doing the right thing at all times and in all circumstances. It takes having the courage to do the right thing, no matter what the consequences will be,"" Mary Sullivan wrote. Fechtel's mother, Dixie, told the Orlando Sentinel she was told that one judge changed his mind in the last 15 seconds and tried to indicate it on his ballot. ""It was a human error,"" Sullivan told the paper. ""We have two auditors ... but they unfortunately missed one of the markings on the ballot."" Cowen, a student at Florida State, said on her Facebook page that she had bonded with Fechtel during their week at the competition. ""I know our friendship will remain strong,"" she wrote, before going on to thank pageant officials for their honesty and integrity. In a blog linked off her Twitter page, Fechtel said: . ""There is one big idea that I would like to emphasize: I was Miss Florida for a glimpse, but more importantly, I have been Elizabeth Fechtel since day one. A title does not define me. It opens doors, but it does not dictate who I am and where I am going. I would like to think of opportunities like this as stepping stones to my future. I cannot deny that this was one of the biggest ""steps"" I have come across, and I had become very comfortable and excited about the growth it would bring."" The Florida mix-up is similar to one in 2013 where the announced winner of Miss Universe Canada, Denise Garrido, gave up her crown after 24 hours when officials discovered a typographical error. And it comes just after Miss Delaware Amanda Longacre had her Miss America dreams squashed when officials ruled her out because she is too old under pageant rules.","Officials say there was a tabulation mistake .

Michael Holmes vividly remembers the 2004 attack that killed two of his colleagues in Iraq. (CNN) -- There has been some disturbing video out of Georgia the past few days, some of which brought back pretty awful memories for me personally. Journalists are being shot at, and not by accident. Let's be clear: There's no comparing what the media's been going through to what Georgian civilians have endured since the conflict with Russia began. For a start, we choose to be there. But the apparent targeting of people who are clearly journalists is always galling. First, there was video of a reporter for Georgian public television getting shot in the forearm while preparing to go live. She was pretty lucky, actually; I heard at least four shots on the video, and her reaction time after getting hit wasn't great. Also, she wasn't wearing a flak jacket (no, it wouldn't have helped her forearm, but if one of those other three shots had been slightly more accurate, it may have saved her life). She donned the body armor only after the incident was over, and none of her crew appeared to be wearing protection. Not smart. Granted, not every media outlet can afford top-level protection, but I can't imagine a CNN crew being in that position without flak jackets on and without a security presence of our own. The one positive was I could see her wound being treated with a pressure bandage, so at least the crew was carrying some medical equipment. The other incident was far more dramatic and potentially deadly. Turkish journalists came under sustained fire as they drive near Tshinvali. Multiple rounds struck the windshield and sunroof. One of the journalists was shot in the eye but survived. The others -- incredibly -- were unharmed. How more weren't hurt or killed seems amazing when you watch the video.  Watch the journalists come under fire » . Having traveled in some dodgy places over the years (Rwanda in '94, Afghanistan in '02, Northern Ireland, the West Bank and Gaza multiple times and nine trips to Iraq), I can empathize with those men. In fact, I admit to a physical reaction to that video: a pang in my guts. The sounds, the sight of glass breaking and holes ""appearing"" in the windshield, the yelling, the almost tangible fear you could sense inside that vehicle. I've no doubt they thought they were going to die. No doubt it's because I've been where they were. Back in the earlier stages of the Iraq war, the media could still be ""unilateral"" -- that is, travel independently of the military. On January 27, 2004, our two-car convoy was returning to Baghdad from an assignment in Hillah, in the south of the country. I was in the front vehicle, right rear seat, talking to my cameraman Scotty McWhinnie seated next to me, when we heard a thud and a whistle and saw a hole appear in the windshield. A bullet had just traveled through the rear, between our heads, and out the front of the car. Our two vehicles were under attack, at high speed, by two other vehicles. We both swung our heads around and saw several things at once. First, our second vehicle, containing driver and friend Yasser Khatab and my translator Duraid Issa Mohammad, swerving off the road, the windshield red with their blood. They'd been hit by the second attack vehicle. As we later learned, they were already dead. In that same few seconds, we saw the man who wanted us dead, too. He was standing through the sunroof of another vehicle, firing an AK-47 with armor-piercing rounds. Bang. Bang. Bang. Glass smashing, yells, our security man screaming for us to ""get down"" in far more colorful language than I can say here. Laying across the seat, trying to be ""small,"" pulling Scotty down on my lap, realizing he'd been shot in the head and bleeding profusely. Watching our security man half out the window, firing back. The noise. I'll never forget the noise level. I've been in numerous firefights, heard plenty of bombs and bangs. This was different. We weren't ""caught in the middle"" of something. These guys wanted us dead. It was personal. Until a situation like that, you accept the risks of war reporting. You feel you're doing a worthwhile job, and I still feel that way. But at that precise moment, I remember thinking, ""What the HELL am I doing here?"" And then laying there, listening to the cacophony, watching our security guy still firing, wondering what it would feel like when a bullet eventually hit my body. It lasted perhaps 30 seconds, maybe a little more. It felt like two hours. Don't ever debate with me the ""ethics"" of journalists having armed guards in war zones. I have some pretty strong views on it. CNN has always taken seriously security and, equally important, medical training for its staff. Ours kicked in in the moments after the shooting stopped. I had immediate access to a fully stocked medical kit. After examining Scotty and confirming that the bullet hadn't entered his skull, and with the help of producer Shirley Hung, I applied a pressure bandage to stem the bleeding as we raced to a U.S. military base for more treatment. Our security man was still on high alert. He couldn't help, so we had to do it ourselves. Before leaving for a conflict region, all CNN staff members go through pretty rigorous training and are equipped with personal medical packs, body armor, helmets, etc. In addition, our security personnel are trained medics and carry full backpack of medical equipment. If the unthinkable happens, we stand a chance. My thoughts are with those Turkish colleagues today. I know how they feel. And I still think of Duraid and Yasser. Every single day.","The targeting of people who are there to observe is galling, Holmes writes .

"(CNN) -- A new study dispels the widely accepted theory that the Komodo dragon kills by infecting its prey with toxic bacteria. Researchers say the Komodo dragon has venom that keeps blood from clotting around its prey's wounds. Instead, the world's largest lizard delivers a powerful bite with its serrated teeth and uses a powerful venom to bring down its victims. Komodo dragons are native to the islands of Indonesia. They can weigh more than 220 pounds (100 kilograms) and grow up to 10 feet (3 meters) in length. But their bites are not as strong as that of a crocodile, for example. And they cannot hold down their prey. So, researchers wondered, what lay behind the dragons' hunting success? Until now, scientists thought the dragons infected their prey with bacteria that lurked in the bits of meat stuck between their teeth. The explanation made sense, because many victims would not immediately fall. They'd wander off and collapse later, allowing the dragon to feast on the corpse at leisure. The new study upends that theory. It was conducted by a team of scientists led by Dr. Bryan Fry from the University of Melbourne in Australia. According to their research, the dragon's bite weakens and immobilizes the prey. It then injects venom from special glands in the mouth. The venom keeps blood from clotting around the prey's wound. And it causes a drop in the blood pressure. The blood loss and the blood pressure drop combine to weaken the animal. The theory is consistent with what happens to the prey soon after it's bitten, the scientists said. The prey becomes still and unusually quiet, and it bleeds profusely. ""The combination of this specialized bite and venom seem to minimize the dragon's contact with its prey, and this allows it to take large animals,"" Fry said in a statement released by the University of Melbourne. Komodo attacks on humans are rare, but some have been reported. In March, an Indonesian fisherman was killed when he trespassed on a remote island in search of fruit. A month earlier, a ranger in the same park survived after a Komodo dragon climbed the ladder into his hut and bit his hand and foot. And in 2007, an 8-year-old boy died after being mauled. The latest findings will be published in the next issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.","Scientists had thought lizards infected prey with bacteria from meat between teeth .

"Ramallah, West Bank (CNN) -- Israel released 26 Palestinian prisoners Monday in a gesture of goodwill between the two sides, days before a visit to the region by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. The release was a step aimed at ""resuming the diplomatic process,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement Saturday announcing the move. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas greeted 18 of the freed prisoners in Ramallah, West Bank. The prisoners ""perpetrated offenses prior to the Oslo accords and have served sentences of 19-28 years,"" Netanyahu's office statement said. Kerry travels to Jerusalem and Ramallah on Wednesday in his ongoing attempt to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Monday's release was part of a pledge made by Israel at the start of the talks last summer. The two sides are four months into a nine-month deadline set by Kerry to reach a peace deal, with little visible progress. Kerry will meet with both Abbas and Netanyahu during his trip -- his ninth visit to the region.

"(CNN) -- Kickstarter campaigns have allowed people to fund diverse projects like video games, smartwatches and the restoration of historic locations. And now? Make way for potato salad. Zack Brown of Columbus, Ohio, posted his Kickstarter project with a goal of $10 and a desire to make potato salad for the first time. As of Monday morning, more than 1,545 backers had pledged $11,000 for a chance to taste Brown's creation. ""I am a somewhat risk-averse person,"" Brown told CNN. ""I like potato salad but had never made it before and wasn't sure it would be any good. Kickstarter helps people to realize their dreams, so it seemed like a perfect fit."" Kickstarter is an online donation site where people can pledge money toward a project and get rewards for doing so. Often, the final project is shared with the donors, along with extra benefits for reaching specific monetary goals. Brown's stretch goals were blown through quickly, meaning he'll be making different recipes. He'll be using mayonnaise from the natural food section of his grocery store and consulting with a chef to make his potato salad better. Also? He'll host a potato-salad party in Columbus. Brown said he was blown away by the incredible generosity of backers for his somewhat random project. And he acknowledges a basic culinary truth: Since this is his first time, it might not be any good. ""It has always been my dream to do something that would connect people all over the world,"" Brown said. ""Did I think that would happen with potato salad? No. But Kickstarter has made my dreams come true."" One of the rewards for pledging $3 or more was to receive a bit of the potato salad. With the massive response, Brown knows he's going to need some logistical help in pulling that off, but he's undeterred. ""I could come to you. You could come to me,"" he wrote in response to a question on his Kickstarter page. ""Or maybe we could get a restaurant chain to make the recipe and offer free samples as a promotion."" Brown's exploits have garnered support from the United Kingdom, France, Romania and other countries outside the U.S. He's working with a print designer to create a recipe book with one potato salad recipe inspired by each backer's country. ""I'm inviting the whole Internet to a party in Columbus, Ohio. I hope some people will bring potato salad or potato salad recipes."" Brown hopes to start making his potato salad recipes some time after his Kickstarter closes in August. He won't reveal any details about his recipes other than that he will be using potatoes from his local grocery store, vinegar will be involved in one recipe, and there will be a vegan option available. The making of the potato salad will be recorded and put on the Internet since he plans on saying the name of every backer out loud while he cooks. If the number of backers continues to grow, he may end up losing his voice by the end.","A Kickstarter to make potato salad has raised $11,000 .

"Long Beach, California (CNN) -- It seems simple: Walk to the refrigerator and grab a drink. But Brett Larsen, 37, opens the door gingerly -- peeks in -- closes it, opens it, closes it and opens it again. This goes on for several minutes. When he finally gets out a bottle of soda, he places his thumb and index finger on the cap, just so. Twists it open. Twists it closed. Twists it open. ""Just think about any movement that you have during the course of a day -- closing a door or flushing the toilet -- over and over and over,"" said Michele Larsen, Brett's mother. ""I cannot tell you the number of things we've had to replace for being broken because they've been used so many times."" At 12, Larsen was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD. It causes anxiety, which grips him so tightly that his only relief is repetition. It manifests in the smallest of tasks: taking a shower, putting on his shoes, walking through a doorway. There are days when Larsen cannot leave the house. ""I can only imagine how difficult that is to live with that every single living waking moment of your life,"" said Dr. Gerald Maguire, Larsen's psychiatrist. In a last-ditch effort to relieve his symptoms, Larsen decided to undergo deep brain stimulation. Electrodes were implanted in his brain, nestled near the striatum, an area thought to be responsible for deep, primitive emotions such as anxiety and fear. Brett's OCD trigger . Brett says his obsessions and compulsions began when he was 10, after his father died. ""I started worrying a lot about my family and loved ones dying or something bad happening to them,"" he said. ""I just got the thought in my head that if I switch the light off a certain amount of times, maybe I could control it somehow. ""Then I just kept doing it, and it got worse and worse."" ""Being OCD"" has become a cultural catchphrase, but for people with the actual disorder, life can feel like a broken record. With OCD, the normal impulse to go back and check if you turned off the stove, or whether you left the lights on, becomes part of a crippling ritual. The disease hijacked Larsen's life (he cannot hold down a job and rarely sees friends); his personality (he can be stone-faced, with only glimpses of a slight smile); and his speech (a stuttering-like condition causes his speaking to be halting and labored.) He spent the past two decades trying everything: multiple medication combinations, cognitive behavioral therapy, cross-country visits to specialists, even hospitalization. Nothing could quell the anxiety churning inside him. ""This is not something that you consider first line for patients because this is invasive,"" said Maguire, chair of psychiatry and neuroscience at the University of California Riverside medical school, and part of the team evaluating whether Larsen was a good candidate for deep brain stimulation. ""It's reserved for those patients when the standard therapies, the talk therapies, the medication therapies have failed."" Deep brain stimulation is an experimental intervention, most commonly used among patients with nervous system disorders such as essential tremor, dystonia or Parkinson's disease. In rare cases, it has been used for patients with intractable depression and OCD. The electrodes alter the electrical field around regions of the brain thought to influence disease -- in some cases amplifying it, in others dampening it -- in hopes of relieving symptoms, said Dr. Frank Hsu, professor and chair of the department of neurosurgery at University of California, Irvine. Hsu says stimulating the brain has worked with several OCD patients, but that the precise mechanism is not well understood. The procedure is not innocuous: It involves a small risk of bleeding in the brain, stroke and infection. A battery pack embedded under the skin keeps the electrical current coursing to the brain, but each time the batteries run out, another surgical procedure is required. 'I feel like laughing' As doctors navigated Larsen's brain tissue in the operating room -- stimulating different areas to determine where to focus the electrical current -- Larsen began to feel his fear fade. At one point he began beaming, then giggling. It was an uncharacteristic light moment for someone usually gripped by anxiety. In response to Larsen's laughter, a staff member in the operating room asked him what he was feeling. Larsen said, ""I don't know why, but I feel happy. I feel like laughing."" Doctors continued probing his brain for hours, figuring out what areas -- and what level of stimulation -- might work weeks later, when Larsen would have his device turned on for good. In the weeks after surgery, the residual swelling in his brain kept those good feelings going. For the first time in years, Larsen and his mother had hope for normalcy. ""I know that Brett has a lot of normal in him, even though this disease eats him up at times,"" said Michele Larsen. ""There are moments when he's free enough of anxiety that he can express that. But it's only moments. It's not days. It's not hours. It's not enough."" Turning it on . In January, Larsen had his device activated. Almost immediately, he felt a swell of happiness reminiscent of what he had felt in the OR weeks earlier. But that feeling would be fleeting -- the process for getting him to an optimal level would take months. Every few weeks doctors increased the electrical current. ""Each time I go back it feels better,"" Larsen said. ""I'm more calm every time they turn it up."" With time, some of his compulsive behaviors became less pronounced. In May, several weeks after his device was activated, he could put on his shoes with ease. He no longer spun them around in an incessant circle to allay his anxiety. But other behaviors -- such as turning on and shutting off the faucet -- continued. Today, things are better, but not completely normal. Normal, by society's definition, is not the outcome Larsen should expect, experts say. Patients with an intractable disease who undergo deep brain stimulation should expect to have manageable OCD. Lately, Larsen feels less trapped by his mind. He is able to make the once interminable trek outside his home within minutes, not hours. He has been to Disneyland with friends twice. He takes long rides along the beach to relax. In his mind, the future looks bright. ""I feel like I'm getting better every day,"" said Larsen, adding that things like going back to school or working now feel within his grasp. ""I feel like I'm more able to achieve the things I want to do since I had the surgery.""

"(CNN) -- Eating ethically is no easy task these days. One problem is deciding which ethic is more important. Keeping third-world farmers in fair trade jobs by purchasing their produce? Or assuaging your concerns over the environmental impact of getting that produce to your kitchen by shopping locally instead? A farmer at work in California. The UN says the food cultivation stage is the most damaging in the food chain. Up until recently it has been the latter concern -- how food is transported -- that has hogged the limelight when it comes to looking at the role the food chain plays in climate change. Statistics such as the fact that the average American meal travels on average 1,500 miles before it gets to the diner's plate, have led to stronger backing for ""grow locally"" movements. But the local food movement has been greeted with dismay by the developing world -- and for good reason. According to the UK-based Food Climate Research Network (FCRN), as many as 1.5 million people in the developing world, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa, depend on the export horticulture market. Agricultural exports, meanwhile, have been partly to thank for Africa's economic growth rates of around 5 per cent a year, according to the UK Department for International Development (DFID). British shoppers alone spend more than $2 million every single day on fruit and vegetables imported from Africa. Encouraging them to shop locally instead of buying imported produce from the developing world could obviously have disastrous consequences for third-world farmers. Domestic not international food miles can leave bigger footprint . Doing away with food imports could be seen as understandable if international transport played a dominant role in the food chain's greenhouse gas emissions. But in the UK 's case -- where much of the research into the ""food miles"" concept has taken place -- that doesn't seem to be the case. A sturdy 85 percent of UK food transport-related emissions actually derive from domestic road deliveries according to the DFID. Road freight traffic in the UK grew by 67 percent between 1980 and 2001, with the average journey length also increasing by 40 percent. By comparison, international freight contributes 11 percent of UK food transport-related emissions -- that's less than one-tenth of one percent of the UK 's overall emissions, the DFID says. Transportation as a whole contributes 2.5 percent of the food chain's emissions, says FCRN. Food refrigeration, on the other hand, accounts for as much as 18 percent (and notably 3.5 percent of the UK 's entire greenhouse gas emissions). The whole transport issue initially came to the fore after the ""food miles"" concept was coined in Europe to illustrate how fossil fuel-intensive the global food distribution network had become. But the relative blame that the transport sector should be taking for this is debatable. In the U.S., up to 20 percent of the country's fossil fuel consumption goes into the food chain, according to the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), which points out that fossil fuel use by the food systems in the developed world ""often rivals that of automobiles"". To feed an average family of four in the developed world uses up the equivalent of 930 gallons of gasoline a year -- just shy of the 1,070 gallons that same family would use up each year to power their cars. The average developed world diet uses 1,600 liters of fossil fuels each year, according to the U.S. based Organic Consumers Association (OCA). Only 256 of those liters come from transporting the food, says OCA. By contrast, a whopping 496 liters goes into the chemical fertilizers used during the food growing stage, representing well over one third of the food chain's entire fossil fuel consumption. Food production responsible for much of greenhouse gas emissions . According to the FAO, the food and agricultural sector is responsible for more than one third of global greenhouse gas emissions, with ""by far the most important"" aspect of that sector's environmental impact, it says, lying in the initial production process -- not in transportation. Within that initial stage, the most harmful activities are deforestation and cultivation. Deforestation, which clears the way for food to be grown, accounts for 18 percent of the food and agriculture sector's emissions.  Cultivation, including ""intensive livestock operations, irrigated rice paddies and application of synthetic fertilizers on cultivated land"" releases enough methane and nitrous oxide to account for 13.5 percent of the sector's greenhouse gas contribution. Quoting the UK-based Soil Association, the FAO says in conventional agriculture (i.e. non-organic) the largest amount of energy used -- 37 percent -- goes towards ""synthetic pesticides and mineral fertilizers, particularly nitrogen, and to a lesser extent, phosphorous, and potassium."" Nitrogen fertilizer in particular is extremely fossil fuel-intensive, requiring 1.5 tons of oil equivalents to make 1 ton of fertilizer. Meat and methane: climate killers? There is, of course, one other major source of greenhouse gas emissions in the food chain: Meat. Back in 2006, the FAO revealed that rearing livestock produced more greenhouse gas emissions than the transportation sector -- 18 percent of the world's entire greenhouse gas emissions. Notably, livestock production generates 37 percent of human-induced methane and 65 percent of human-related nitrous oxide emissions. Methane has 23 times the global warming potential of CO2; the impact of nitrous oxide meanwhile is a staggering 296 times more powerful. Meat and dairy represent 50 percent of ""total food related impacts"", according to the Climate Action Program. And in terms of the fossil fuel bill meat runs up, for that family of four who is using up 930 gallons of fossil fuel a year on food, 265 gallons of it goes towards putting meat on their table. Going vegetarian, or vegan, therefore is being increasingly suggested as one of the best ways to slash our carbon contributions. A University of Chicago study found, for example that meat-eaters individually emit 1.5 more tons of emissions a year than vegetarians or vegans; and according to the OCA, it takes 8 times as many fossil fuels to produce animal protein than their plant equivalent. Being vegetarian is by no means a panacea, however, as even the OCA concedes that eating a 2 kg box of vegetarian-friendly cereal is the equivalent of burning half a gallon of gasoline. But perhaps banking on everyone going vegetarian fails to take into account one simple fact: 1.4 billion people work in the global livestock sector and rely on meat-eaters for their livelihoods. How one would go about telling 1.4 billion people to shut up shop is anyone's guess. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Twitter has officially banned pornographic content on Vine, its year-old social-video service. The company announced the changes to its rules and terms of service on Thursday and will begin enforcing them immediately. Just days after Vine's official launch in January of last year, reports surfaced about the presence of porn on Vine, a service for sharing 6-second long videos on Twitter and with other Vine users. It quickly became a popular spot for short clips of sexually explicit content, some posted by well-known porn stars. For the past year, there have been no official rules against pornographic videos, though the company worked to keep them out of the public eye by suppressing them in highly visible places like its Editor's Picks and most popular lists. It did raise the minimum age for using Vine from 12 years old to 17 years old. The new rating in Apple's App Store meant Vine carried a disclaimer that warned of ""frequent/intense sexual content or nudity."" After the initial flurry of concern, the dark corner of Vine was mostly forgotten about by people who weren't actively seeking out salacious content, at least until last month, when a young man rose to temporary Internet fame when he filmed himself being intimate with a Pop Tart and then a Hot Pocket. He posted the videos to Vine, though they were quickly taken down. The timing is likely a coincidence. Twitter said the change in policy is just a matter of the type of content that fits with the Vine community. ""As we've watched the community and your creativity grow and evolve, we've found that there's a very small percentage of videos that are not a good fit for our community,"" the company said in a post announcing the new rules. The new rules forbid videos of sex acts, whether they're alone, with other people or with objects. Sexually explicit animations and nudity are also forbidden. However, Twitter is not blocking all nudity. It makes exceptions for any nudity that is documentary, artistic or educational. For example, breastfeeding photos will still be allowed, as will shots of ""nude protesters."" Sexually suggestive content is also still welcome, as long as it's clothed. Twitter is not assembling a full-time Vine porn enforcement task force. The content will largely be flagged by other Vine members using the ""Report this post"" option. Anyone who violates the new rules will have their account suspended until they delete the offending Vine. Repeat posters might have their account permanently suspended. Twitter will contact the users who have already uploaded large volumes of naughty Vines and ask them to remove the old content. ""We're notifying users who have posted explicit sexual content in the past that they have a period to either take down or download their existing content using a new tool we've created,"" a Twitter spokesperson said. That tool is only available for past porn posters for now.","Twitter is banning sexually explicit content on its Vine social-video tool .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A Michael Jackson duet with Akon recorded in 2007 will be released Monday morning as the first official single from the late pop star's next album, Epic Records announced Friday. ""Michael,"" Jackson's first album of new music in nine years, also includes duets with rapper 50 Cent and rocker Lenny Kravitz, according to Epic. It will be released on December 14. ""Hold My Hand"" featuring Akon was chosen to be the first single because the estate found a handwritten note from Jackson that indicated his desire that it be the first single on his next project, the company said. The song is familiar to Jackson fans because an unfinished version of the song leaked onto the Internet in 2008, but Akon returned to the studio to complete a new version, Epic said. ""The world was not ready to hear 'Hold My Hand' when it leaked a couple years ago,"" Akon said. ""We were devastated about it."" The song is now in ""its final state,"" Akon said.

"(CNN) -- The Pentagon's most expensive weapons program ever, the F-35 warplane, is grounded again. Developed at a cost of nearly $400 billion so far and beset for years by cost overruns and delays, the so-called Joint Strike Fighter was put down temporarily this week following a runway fire at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. No one was hurt. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said the cause of the June 23 incident remains under investigation, and the timing of when they might take off again is unclear. ""Additional inspections of F-35 engines have been ordered, and return to flight will be determined based on inspection results and analysis of engineering data,"" Kirby said. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney said in a statement that it was working with Air Force investigators to inspect all engines in the fleet. It declined further comment. Lead contractor Lockheed Martin also said it was working with investigators. It is producing variants of the plane for the U.S. Navy, Marines and Air Force. The Pentagon wants more than 2,400 ultimately, while hundreds more are expected over time to go to allies such as South Korea, Japan and Australia. More than 100 planes have been built so far, most for testing, but the program is still in its development and training phases. The military says the stealthy fighter will be ""the most affordable, lethal, supportable and survivable aircraft ever to be used"" by so many services worldwide. But its production has been controversial for its soaring cost history -- the price tag has nearly doubled from early estimates, to $135 million per unit as of last year, according to a U.S. Government Accountability Office report in March -- as well as its schedule, software and other setbacks. Test flights began in 2007. While all models have been grounded in the past for various problems, the version for the Marines, the F-35B, has had more issues. Experts say that's mainly due to its design for shorter takeoffs and vertical landings. Richard Aboulafia, a Teal Group analyst, said every component of the F-35 overall ""is pushing the frontiers of technology"" as engineers combine extraordinary engine power with a lighter weight design. He said the program has made gradual progress in recent years where glitches get resolved pretty quickly compared with 18 to 24 months ago, when setbacks seemed to come one right after another. ""It's a tremendously complex project,"" he said, adding that cost issues remain a concern. The F-35 is due to make a much-anticipated appearance at the international air show at Farnborough airport in Hampshire, England, in coming weeks. Aboulafia said a no-show could indicate a more serious problem with the engine. U.S. sends B-2 stealth bombers to Europe .

"(CNN) -- The Navy has suspended search and rescue efforts for a pilot who was involved in a plane crash over the western Pacific Ocean. Two U.S. fighter jets collided on Thursday while operating at sea. The missing and unidentified pilot is presumed dead, the Navy said in a press release on Saturday. One pilot was rescued, treated and has been released from the ship's medical facilities. ""This is an exceptionally difficult time for the friends and family of the missing pilot and the Navy community,"" said Rear Adm. Christopher Grady, commander of the Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by this tragedy."" The cause of the crash is under investigation, the Navy said. The jets have not been recovered. The two jets crashed about 290 miles (470 kilometers) west of Wake Island, Navy 7th Fleet spokeswoman Lt. Lauren Cole told CNN. Wake Island is more than 2,400 miles west of Hawaii. A Navy cruiser, destroyer, carrier and helicopters took part in what the Navy called an ""extensive"" search for the missing pilot that lasted more than 36 hours. The two F/A-18 Hornets were operating from the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, the Navy said. The collision occurred about seven miles away, the Navy said. Both jets are from Carrier Air Wing 17, the Navy said, assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron 94 and Strike Fighter Squadron 113. Pilot found dead after F-15 crash in Virginia .

"ST. PAUL, Minnesota (CNN)  -- Gov. Sarah Palin will need to flesh out the image of the ""hockey mom"" she presented to the Republican National Convention and start to educate voters on what she believes about the issues they care about. Gov. Sarah Palin will need to expand on her ""hockey mom"" image. Socially conservative, blue-collar voters in the critical swing states of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan are likely to find a lot to like in the moose-hunting, gun-toting, hard-talking mother of five. But the Alaska governor is still largely an unknown figure, and many voters - particularly independents - will have questions about her views on a range of policy issues. ""The biggest question hanging over Palin: Is she ready to take over as president,"" CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said. ""She has two months to convince voters she is. She can talk about her experience, but what will count is how she handles herself under the pressure of the campaign."" In her speech to the Republican National Convention, she didn't get into details on the economy, education or higher energy prices, except to call for more drilling offshore and in the North Slope of Alaska. A CNN Poll conducted August 29-31, the weekend after John McCain picked  Palin as a running mate, found that 38 percent of those polled had a favorable opinion of the Alaska governor while 21 percent had an unfavorable view. But 41 percent said they were unfamiliar with Palin. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 3 percent. Voters will want to know more about Palin's social views, particularly her views on abortion, which are to the right of public opinion. Palin's decision not to abort her child after she learned that he had Down syndrome made her a favorite of anti-abortion advocates, but her opposition to abortion rights, including in the cases of rape and incest, may turn off suburban women, particularly those who supported Hillary Clinton.  Watch what Palin believes on the issues » . Palin, despite her statement Wednesday night that she was not going to Washington to ""seek the good opinion"" of Washington's elite, will also have to face the media. She has not had any one-on-one interviews since she was tapped as McCain's running mate. ""After the convention, Sarah Palin will face a tough news conference, just as Geraldine Ferraro did in 1984 and Dan Quayle did in 1988,"" Schneider said. ""Ferraro handled her news conference so skillfully, the press effectively declared her innocent even though she really didn't answer all their questions. ""Ferraro provides Palin a model for how to handle the press,"" he said. ""Quayle, not so much."" And Palin will face more questions about her role in the evolving ""trooper-gate"" scandal in which a former public safety commissioner says he was terminated because he did not fire an Alaska state trooper who was going through a divorce from Palin's sister. Furthermore, Palin must prepare for her debate with the Democrat's vice presidential nominee, Sen. Joe Biden. Biden, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Policy Committee, has been in the Senate for more than three decades and is considered one of the foremost foreign policy experts in the Capitol.  Watch Biden say he was impressed by Palin » . He is also known as a skilled debater, but his direct, slashing style may backfire if it appears he is beating up on the Republican's first female vice presidential pick. Palin will need to show a command of crucial economic and foreign policy challenges facing the country and demonstrate how her experience as an elected official has prepared her to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Palin has served less then two years as Alaska's governor. Before winning her state's stop office, she served on Alaska's oil and gas board and was mayor of her hometown of Wasillia. She gave a strong speech Wednesday night in her primetime debut, and she has accomplished something that had eluded McCain before the Republican convention: She has fired up the conservative base. ""I did not want that to end last night. ... I didn't want the night to end,"" conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh said Thursday. ""This lady has turned it all around. ... From now on, on this program, John McCain will be known as 'John McBrilliant.'"" Palin appeared completely comfortable with the ""attack dog"" role often played by vice presidential nominees. In fact, she opened her speech Wednesday night by joking that the only difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull is lipstick.  Watch Palin slam Obama » . Palin then went on to relentlessly attack the Democratic ticket, including mocking the Barack Obama's time as a community organizer in Chicago. ""I guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a community organizer, except that you have actual responsibilities,"" Palin said. The Republican delegates in the hall enthusiastically received the line, but many independent voters may be turned away by Palin's biting, sarcastic tone.  Watch Paul Begala call Palin's sarcasm unappealing » . ""It is clear from tonight's national debut that Sarah Palin may connect extremely well in rural, small-town America, and, no doubt, Republicans will be sending her there in key states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and the like."" David Gergen, a CNN senior political analyst, said after Palin's speech. ""Her pit bull style -- combined with her humor and presence along with her roots -- will likely draw people to her. Lots of people there will look forward to hearing her in person. ""The question for me is whether she will also appeal in suburban America,"" he said. ""I am not at all certain that she will. Her combative, anti-elitist style along with her staunch conservatism on issues like abortion may just leave a lot of voters cool, if not cold.""

"(CNN) -- Angry protesters forced three buses carrying undocumented immigrants to turn around Tuesday in Southern California. The immigrants had arrived in San Diego from south Texas and were on their way to be processed at the Murrieta Border Patrol station. Protesters chanting ""USA!"" ""Impeach Obama!"" and ""Deport, Deport!"" blocked their route. A heated yelling match ensued between the demonstrators and a group of counterprotesters. As the buses were forced to retreat, the roughly 140 people on board were taken to a border station in San Ysidro, according to Ron Zermeno with the National Border Patrol Council. It was not immediately clear whether they would stay there or what would happen next. The U.S. government is struggling to process and accommodate an influx of undocumented immigrants, and specifically a spike in immigrant children. The government doesn't have enough beds, food or sanitary facilities. To help relieve crowded facilities in Texas, undocumented immigrants are now being sent elsewhere to be processed. Murrieta Police Chief Sean Hadden said that police there had been told to expect 140 immigrants every 72 hours, with the next group scheduled to arrive on Friday. Authorities estimate 60,000 to 80,000 children without parents will cross the border this year in what the White House has called an ""immediate humanitarian crisis."" The mayor of Murrieta, Alan Long, had urged residents Monday to protest the decision to move undocumented immigrants to the area, the Los Angeles Times reported. He spoke again Tuesday at a Murrieta City Council meeting, thanking police and others. ""Please remember these are human beings that are fleeing the violence in their home countries.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has backed an Arizona law that punishes businesses hiring illegal immigrants, a law that opponents, including the Obama administration, say steps on traditional federal oversight over immigration matters. The 5-3 ruling Thursday is a victory for supporters of immigration reform on the state level. It was the first high court challenge to a variety of recent state laws cracking down on illegal immigrants, an issue that has become a political lightning rod. The outcome could serve as a judicial warmup for a separate high-profile challenge to a more controversial Arizona immigration reform law working its way through lower courts. That statute would, among other things, give local police a greater role in arresting suspected illegal immigrants. The hiring case turned on whether state law tramples on federal authority. ""Arizona has taken the route least likely to cause tension with federal law,"" wrote Chief Justice John Roberts. ""It relies solely on the federal government's own determination of who is an unauthorized alien, and it requires Arizona employers to use the federal government's own system for checking employee status."" Arizona passed the Legal Arizona Workers Act in 2007, allowing the state to suspend the licenses of businesses that ""intentionally or knowingly"" violate work-eligibility verification requirements. Companies would be required under that law to use E-Verify, a federal database to check the documentation of current and prospective employees. That database had been created by Congress as a voluntary, discretionary resource. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit against the state, arguing that federal law prohibits Arizona and other states from making E-Verify use mandatory. The group was supported by a variety of civil rights and immigration rights groups. The state countered that its broad licensing authority gives it the right to monitor businesses within its jurisdiction. The Obama administration recommended a judicial review and sided with businesses and civil rights groups. A 1986 federal act significantly limited state power to separately regulate the hiring and employment of ""unauthorized"" workers. An exception was made for local ""licensing and similar laws."" Under the law, employees are required to review documentation to confirm someone's right to work in the United States, including checking the familiar I-9 immigration form. Civil and criminal penalties were strengthened, but businesses making a ""good faith"" effort to comply with I-9 procedures were generally immune from prosecution. Roberts, backed by his four conservative colleagues, said, ""Arizona went the extra mile in ensuring that its law tracks (the federal law's) provisions in all material aspects."" In dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted E-Verify is a voluntary program and said criticism that the federal government is not doing enough to enforce the law is irrelevant. ""Permitting states to make use of E-Verify mandatory improperly puts states in the position of making decisions ... that directly affect expenditure and depletion of federal resources,"" she wrote. Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg also dissented. Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in the case, since she had been the administration's solicitor general last year when the case was being appealed to the high court. Gov. Jan Brewer had backed the law, saying in December when the case was argued, ""The bottom line is that we believe that if the (federal) government isn't going to do the job, then Arizona is going to do the job. We are faced with a crisis."" This case could serve as a bellwether to how the court will view a larger, more controversial state immigration law from Arizona. Much of that statute was tossed out by a federal judge in August and is pending at a federal appeals court. It would, among other things, give police authority to check a person's immigration status if officers have a ""reasonable suspicion"" that the individual is in the country illegally. One human rights group, the Border Action Network of Tucson, called the ruling dangerous because it could promote anti-immigrant atmosphere. ""Arizona's residents and businesses have suffered enough in the wake of unnecessary immigration enforcement legislation,"" Jennifer Allen, executive director of Border Action Network, said. ""This decision will only exacerbate those struggles, as it could be misinterpreted by Arizona politicians with unwarranted anti-immigrant agendas as a license to enact measures that increase bureaucracy, slow down business operations and erode the civil rights of job seekers, who could now be denied an employment opportunity because of their last name,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- The World Cup's focus on attacking football has won global praise but a cloud scurried across the tournament Tuesday as match fixing claims surrounding Cameroon's participation in the event emerged. The Cameroon Football Association (Fecafoot) has confirmed it's investigating allegations made in the German media that seven of its players were involved in match fixing during the group stages of the World Cup finals in Brazil. While previous investigations centered on trying to fix international friendlies or low-profile qualifiers, this is the first time since 1982 that World Cup group stage games have come under scrutiny. The ""Indomitable Lions"" were drawn in the same pool as Croatia, Mexico and host nation Brazil, losing all three games. A convicted match fixer spoke to German magazine Der Spiegel correctly predicting one of the results of the African nation. ""We wish to inform the general public that, though not yet contacted by FIFA in regards to this affair, our administration has already instructed its Ethics Committee, to further investigate these accusations,"" said a Fecafoot statement. Wilson Raj Perumal, who was detained by police in Finland earlier this year on an international arrest warrant, told Der Spiegel that Cameroon would lose to Croatia while also having a player sent off. CNN has not been able to independently verify the Der Spiegel report. Midfielder Alex Song was red carded during the game for lashing out at Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic, while goals from Ivica Olic, Ivan Perisic and a brace from Mandzukic without reply secured a 4-0 victory. The match also saw Cameroon players Benoit Assou-Ekotto and Benjamin Moukandjo aggressively confront each other, with television pictures appearing to show Assou-Ekotto attempting to head-butt Moukandjo. CNN contacted Song's agent although he was not immediately available for comment. The Fecafoot statement continued: ""Recent allegations of fraud around Cameroon 2014 FIFA World Cup three preliminary games, especially Cameroon vs. Croatia, as well of the 'existence of seven bad apples (in our national team)' do not reflect the values and principles promoted by our administration, in line with FIFA Code of Conduct and the ethics of our nation."" In the Der Spiegel interview, Perumal, who CNN is trying to contact, used the expression ""seven bad apples."" A FIFA spokesperson told reporters Tuesday that they could not comment on whether an investigation was underway on the manipulation of games. Fecafoot meanwhile added in its statement that ""in 55 years of existence, it has never been sanctioned for, involved in, or even linked to match fixing or any fraud of any kind."" The investigation marks an uncomfortable end to Cameroon's disastrous World Cup campaign. Players initially refused to board the plane to Brazil until a dispute with Fecafoot over bonus payments was resolved. Although an agreement was eventually reached, the team's departure was delayed by a day. An opening game 1-0 loss to Mexico was followed up by the 4-0 thrashing by Croatia. Hosts Brazil then completed the misery by defeating the four-time African Cup of Nations champion 4-1. In the aftermath of the Croatia defeat, coach Volker Finke described the behavior of some of his players as ""unacceptable."" ""Some players behaved very badly, and that's why we have conceded four goals,"" Finke said to L'Equipe. ""I know that it is difficult to play with 10 men, but that is not a reason to lose it to this point. ""The game was balanced until the red card. The Croatians were more clinical in front of goal, but Cameroon also had chances to score. ""The behavior of some of the players is really not satisfactory. Even when we were 11-a-side, it was not acceptable."" In 1982, Algeria, despite having beaten then West Germany, went out after a seemingly contrived 1-0 win over Austria.","Cameroon to investigate allegations of match fixing by its players at the World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Imagine the top three things that might make you happier and more productive at the office. I bet larger lunch tables didn't make your list. But that and a few other small but concrete steps like overlapping lunch breaks and moving coffee stations can improve workplace morale and productivity by as much as 25%, according to Ben Waber, a research scientist and CEO of Sociometric Solutions, a management consulting firm. ""If you go to a company and tell them you will increase their productivity by 25%, they will expect that they have to completely reorganize,"" Waber told me last week at the Aspen Ideas Festival. But a total reorganization isn't necessary, according to Waber's research, which first began in 2006 when he was a doctoral student at MIT Media Lab's Human Dynamics Laboratory. Scientists at the MIT Media Lab consider ways in which technology might enhance the human experience. (Though Waber co-founded his company last year, he continues his research at MIT and Harvard.) Waber and his team use a method they call ""reality mining"" to come up with insights about work productivity and satisfaction. Reality mining may appear to be more science fiction than fact, but from our cell phones to e-mail to work ID badges, we leave behind constant trails of information about ourselves. Stand up and live longer . Analyzing raw data derived from specially designed social sensing ID badges that collect quantitative data on human behavior, Waber began drawing out patterns to help predict outcomes in a variety of situations. His early experiments involved observing speed dating sessions and pitches to venture capitalists. ""We found in our studies that we had incredible predictive power,"" says Waber. ""In the speed dating experiment, with five minutes of data we could predict with 85% accuracy whether people were going to go out on a date."" Waber went on to combine the data from the social sensing ID badges with other data sources -- e-mail and instant messaging patterns, phone logs, and meeting informationâ€”and selected data features that related to job performance and satisfaction, and how people communicate and collaborate. He then began to test those features across dozens of companies in different industries. ""Eventually we found the same trends recurring over and over again, making it highly unlikely that our findings were a coincidence."" Waber's research revealed that the key to transformation in the workplace is ""social levers"" -- small changes that people respond to in dramatic ways. Act on these social levers in the right way and you will get big results. Author: Don't check your emotions at the workplace door . What are some important social levers? Having a tight-knit group that you can commiserate with is a critical one, says Waber. It is evident across companies and cultures: A tight group enables employees to vent and gain support. It also allows for the exchange of complex information and tips. The size of your network matters as well. In one project, Waber and his team observed workers in a lunchroom with tables of varying sizes -- some with four seats and others with 10 to 12 seats. The lunch groups remained fairly stable over time. ""We found that the people who sat at the larger tables had substantially higher performance,"" observes Waber. This is because they had created a much bigger network to tap into. Over the course of the week, they saw the same people again and again. Consequently, they often knew what these colleagues were working on and could go to them if they had a problem. The employees at the smaller tables, on the other hand, had smaller networks and less opportunity to interact. The diversity within your network also matters, the team discovered. Waber finds that people tend to spend time with those who are similar to them. ""Whether it's gender, race or the school you went to, there are many different ways we break ourselves into groups."" For a healthier work life, get off your duff! But it's important to break out of your comfort zone, expand your network and connect with broader groups. What makes people more innovative and productive is having different connections in a variety of social groups, according to their research. If all your friends are similar and have the same opinions, preferences and habits, there aren't many new ideas coming in. Branch out and talk to people in groups you wouldn't normally talk to, suggests Waber. It doesn't have to be through a formal mechanism. ""It can be through bumping into people by the coffee machine. Just standing there and chatting gives you new perspective. Our research shows that chance encounters make people more effective."" Waber recommends taking time every day to walk around, check in with people and say hello. Workers who are more physically active are more excited, emotive and engaged in their work. This drives up energy levels and makes people more productive and happy, he says. The physical environment is also a huge social lever. Waber finds that companies often don't think strategically about the people they want interacting with each other. ""If you are stuck in an office far away from everyone you work with, it's unlikely that you will be talking to anyone else."" Your location can affect morale and productivity, as can a workplace where everyone sits in their offices with the doors closed. You need to have the right groups bumping into and talking to each other. One final social lever: Reduce e-mail! ""The more e-mail you engage in, the less effective you are,"" says Waber. ""People think being on the computer is the same as being face to face. That's a fallacy."" E-mail and instant messaging are not universally bad, he says, but if we rely on them too much and don't take the time to interact with people on a personal level, we will pay the price. There is a pervasive belief in our society that in order to be productive, we need to be chained to our desks with our heads down. But Waber's research begs to differ. As it turns out, the secret to effectiveness and happiness at work might just be communication, friendship and social interaction. Go figure. What would make you happier at work? Are you more productive when lots of people are around, or when you're on your own?

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday, an Afghan soldier killed a U.S. major general and wounded a German brigadier general, as well as up to 15 others, in an attack at the Marshal Fahim National Defense University in the Afghan capital, Kabul. The attack is an ominous sign regarding the potential risks to American service members as the majority of U.S. forces withdraw from Afghanistan. If a Bilateral Security Agreement between the United States and Afghanistan is signed in coming months, the United States is likely to keep a residual force of around 9,800 troops in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of all U.S. combat troops at the end of 2014. This residual force would serve in an advisory role to Afghan troops, which could further expose American forces to insider attacks. Officials identified the American who was killed as Maj. Gen. Harold Greene. Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said the Afghan soldier who carried out the attack was shot and killed. Although directed at high-ranking officers, it was far from the first insider attack on coalition troops in Afghanistan. According to a count by the New America Foundation, there have been 82 such attacks on coalition personnel over the course of the Afghan War. The numbers refer to Afghan police and army members attacking NATO troops. During the early years of the war, there were very few insider attacks. But they took off in 2011. That year, the number rose to 14, followed by a peak of 40 in 2012. At least 145 U.S. and other NATO soldiers have been killed by Afghan soldiers, according to New America's data. So far, in 2014 there have been only three such attacks, including Tuesday's in Kabul, and an attack on June 23 in Gardez, Paktia, where two American military advisers were injured in a shooting by an Afghan police officer. Before that, on February 12, two American Special Forces members were killed in Afghanistan's Kapisa province by gunmen wearing Afghan National Security Force uniforms. In April 2011, in an attack that killed the most coalition personnel, an Afghan military pilot killed eight American soldiers and a military contractor during a meeting in the operations room of the Afghan Air Corps at Kabul Airport. Insider attacks have taken their largest toll on troops from the United States, which contributes the largest contingent of forces to operations in Afghanistan . Military members from Albania, Australia, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom have also been targets. Still, the number of deaths in insider attacks on foreign forces has been declining -- although they spiked in 2012, when 59 coalition members were killed. In 2011, there were 36; in 2013, there were 18. The United States took several steps after insider attacks became a large-scale problem, including improving vetting of Afghan security personnel and putting more counterintelligence assets into the field to try to detect threats. Kirby downplayed the significance of Tuesday's attacks, asserting that he has ""seen no indication that there's a degradation of trust between coalition members and their Afghan counterparts."" Maintaining that trust as U.S. combat troops withdraw will be key.","On Tuesday, an Afghan soldier killed a U.S. major general in an insider attack .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- With thousands of Americans looking for jobs, many businesses are saying: Sorry, we're not hiring. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is sending out another message: Come right this way. Donna Gil Lumpkin is one of 270,000 people who has applied for about 2,100 jobs at the FBI. After years of being outgunned in the battle for job applicants by corporations who could pay bigger salaries, hundreds of thousands of job seekers are applying for FBI positions. The FBI announced a hiring blitz in January to fill more than 2,100 professional staff positions. The job postings run the gamut from scientists to accountants to auto mechanics. In addition, the bureau said it wants to hire 850 FBI agents. What happened next caught many at the FBI by surprise. More than 270,000 people applied over about six weeks. The FBI said about 70,000 people seek positions in a normal year.  Watch the applications pile up at the FBI » . But this isn't a normal year. Just ask Donna Gil Lumpkin, a divorced mother of two who lives in Maryland. Gil Lumpkin lost her job selling radio ad time in November. ""The competition is really stiff,"" she said. ""There's a lot of people out of work. A lot of people looking for a job."" Gil Lumpkin has applied for a job as an FBI recruiter. If the FBI thinks she has the skills for the post, that's just one step toward a job. She'll have to undergo an FBI background check and take polygraph and drug tests. The FBI official in charge of human resources concedes the FBI is benefiting a bit from the sour economy and getting a flood of applications this year. ""In years past it was often difficult to find people with the science and technology background or chemistry background or a biology background because we were competing with the private sector,"" said FBI Assistant Director John Raucci. Raucci said during the dotcom explosion, the FBI had a difficult time competing with dotcom start-up salaries. ""Now, what we offer is stability, we offer a job and I think a very exciting environment in which to work,"" said Raucci. Raucci said the average starting salary at the FBI is about $35,000 per year. But he adds those with extraordinary academic credentials and prior job experience start at a much higher rate. Donna Gil Lumpkin said the stability of a job with the federal government and the good benefits such as health insurance attracted her to apply. ""In this tough economic climate right now the federal government, I think, is one of the most steady and stable places anyone could be."" The stakes are high for Gil Lumpkin, who has a 12-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son. She said her children are covered under her ex-husband's health insurance. But she needs coverage for herself. And she is not able to put any money away right now for her children's college years. ""Right now the college fund is on pause,"" said Gil Lumpkin. ""It's the survival fund. We are trying to survive.""","Hundreds of thousands of job seekers are applying for FBI positions .

"(CNN) -- It wasn't too long ago when the image of Africa was plagued by photographs of starving children, war, wildlife photography and portraits of African tribes exoticizing the ""dark continent."" But Africa for the past few years has been immersed in digital technology and culture and the digital age in Africa can now be witnessed through art and photography. In the past the most notable photographers who captured images from Africa were those from Europe and and the United States -- photojournalists who came to bring more exposure to the daily lives of those living in this diverse continent. But as the cost of digital technology significantly drops and more artists gain access to digital technology, African photographers are gaining exposure, giving voice to their own experiences of their neighborhoods and communities. This list is a small example of new and up-and-coming photographers who are engaging their audiences in the visual representation of Africa, developing and nurturing the art of photography.

"(CNN) -- Whisper it quietly in France but a trio of English-speaking riders is set to dominate the 99th edition of its most famous sports event, a bike race that represents the Gallic nation's very essence. Winding across the flatlands of northern France and over the cols of the Pyrenees and the Alps, before finishing on the Champs Elysees in Paris on July 22, the Tour de France is watched by millions of spectators during its three weeks and literally brings the country to a standstill. The possible success of Britain's ""Rosbifs"" cyclists, and that their main challengers will come from Australia and Canada, is a further sign of the globalization of a sport once dominated by riders from France and northern European neighbors such as Belgium and the Netherlands, plus Italy and Spain. Between 1999 and 2005 seven straight wins for American Lance Armstrong threw a spanner in the spokes of the Tour's traditional powerbrokers, and the trend has continued apace. Lance Armstrong banned from world Ironman events over doping probe . A 32-year-old Londoner, Bradley Wiggins is the favorite for overall victory in 2012, with his main opposition likely to come from Australian Cadel Evans, who triumphed last year, while Canadian Ryder Hesjedal has a good chance of a podium place. ""I think it's great because cycling used to be a European sport and now we see Australian riders, North Americans and the British coming forward,"" Gilles Simon, the cycling editor of L'Equipe, the French sports newspaper so closely associated with the Tour, told CNN ahead of the race's start on Saturday. ""Within a few more years I believe we will even see a rider from Asia challenging for major jerseys. But for us the favorite is Bradley Wiggins."" Impeccable credentials . Wiggins, a surprising fourth in the 2009 Tour, will start with impeccable credentials. He is the first man to win the Paris-Nice, Tour de Romandie and Criterium du Dauphine stage races in the same season. An in-form Wiggins crashed out early in the 2011 Tour de France and is thus doubly determined to seize the chance to cement his place in cycling's hall of fame. ""I've been waiting for this moment for a long time and I'll do everything I can to win the Tour de France,"" Wiggins told Team Sky's official website. ""The team's preparation has been perfectly managed and our form this season gives us a great chance of being successful."" Evans became the first Australian to win the Tour de France in 2011 and the 36-year-old BMC leader will not give up his crown without an almighty fight. ""We're bringing an even stronger team to the Tour this year and the route would seem to favor me,"" he told his team's official website. Modal shift . Throw into the mix Hesjedal, who won last month's Giro d'Italia, and it is clear there has been a modal shift in cycling supremacy. ""We could have a Tour podium with three native English-speaking riders,"" Hesjedal's team boss at Garmin-Sharp, Jonathan Vaughters, told CNN. American Vaughters is talking up the chances of his 31-year-old star rider, despite recent Giro winners flopping in the Tour de France just a few weeks later. ""Ryder will break that historical trend. Whether he can win the Tour is hard to say, but he will be a contender,"" said Vaughters. The cause of the English speakers has been helped by the absence from the 2012 Tour of two riders who may well have had a say in the eventual outcome. Luxembourg's Andy Schleck and Alberto Contador of Spain fought a classic duel on the slopes of the Col du Tourmalet in the 2010 edition. Contador emerged a narrow victor overall, but was later stripped of the title after failing a doping test during the race. Schleck was awarded the race retrospectively, but his hopes of winning a second Tour were dashed when he withdrew after suffering injuries in a fall at the Dauphine race won by Wiggins earlier this year. Contador ban . Contador is still serving a ban as a result of his 2010 misdemeanors and will return in August. The specter of drugs still casts a shadow over cycling, and in the buildup to the Tour the United States Anti Doping Agency (USADA) formally charged Armstrong over allegations of doping. Vaughters, whose team adopts a strict anti-doping stance, is hoping that the increased globalization of the sport -- and with it the opportunity for more sponsorship revenue to boost its coffers -- will play a part in eradicating doping. ""We need all our cyclists to be properly compensated for the incredible physical risks they take every day,"" he said. A glimpse at the route for this year's Tour shows just how exacting a test the 21-stage race really is for the 198 starters from 22 teams. The 3,497-kilometer race will take in 25 categorized climbs in the Alps and Pyrenees, but with 100 km of individual racing against the clock, starting with 6.4 km in the prologue in Liege in Belgium, it favors Wiggins and Evans. Away from the battle for yellow, Mark Cavendish, who joined Wiggins at the powerful and well-funded Team Sky for 2012, will be defending the maillot vert (green jersey) of the points winner as he bids to add to his fast mounting tally of 20 stage victories in the Tour. Dangerous finishes . On the nine flat stages, Cavendish and his sprinter colleagues will get their opportunity to cross the line first in the usual hell for leather and often dangerous finishes. Reigning world champion Cavendish is the leader of that pack and warmed up with three more victories in the Giro. But given his Olympic aspirations -- the road race at the London Games is just a week after the finish of the Tour -- Simon believes he will not seriously defend his green jersey. ""He will win perhaps three or four stages, but not green,"" said Simon. The team principal at Sky, Dave Brailsford, admits they have split loyalties. ""Our priority this year is the General Classification with Bradley but that doesn't mean we'll neglect the sprint stages, or Mark's bid for green jersey,"" said Brailsford. If the main contenders for yellow slip up, Italian Vincenzo Nibali of Liquigas, who won the 2010 Tour of Spain, and Belgian Jurgen van den Broeck of Lotto -- a top-five finisher at Le Tour that same year -- are ready to step up. Home hopes . And what of French chances in their home Tour? Last year Thomas Voeckler held on to the yellow jersey for 10 days, won the admiration of cycling fans everywhere and finished fourth overall behind Evans. ""The biggest hope for us is that another rider can do the same as Voeckler,"" admitted Simon, who singled out Pierre Rolland, winner of the white jersey last year for best under-25 rider, for a possible high finish. But all the momentum seems to be with Wiggins, the first genuine British contender for overall victory since Tom Simpson in the 1960s. Simpson became the first British rider to claim the race leader's yellow jersey in 1962 and his achievements paved the way for English-speaking competitors in a sport entirely dominated by Europeans. But five years later he died on Mont Ventoux on the 13th stage of the Tour -- the victim of heat exhaustion and a deadly cocktail of drugs and alcohol --- in a doomed and tragic bid for cycling's ultimate prize. Simpson was a childhood idol for Wiggins and it would appear fitting if he could ride into Paris in three weeks' time in yellow and make cycling history.","Bradley Wiggins pre-race favorite to win the Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- Fast growing Abu Dhabi carrier Etihad is spreading its wings again by agreeing to a 49% stake in Italian loss-making airline Alitalia. The two parties put out a brief, joint statement which said they agreed to ""principal terms,"" although the financial details were not disclosed. When the Alitalia board gave a green light to the offer on June 15, Italy's Transport Minister Maurizio Lupi said that Etihad would make an upfront investment of $760 million and would commit to another $700 million by 2018. There are reports this could be even higher. This represents the biggest foreign stake of a European carrier, taking it to the 49% limit set by European Commission. Etihad becomes the biggest shareholder. Etihad is expected to cut up to 2,200 jobs as part of the agreement. The company also want to ensure Etihad will not carry an unfair burden of Alitalia's $1.3 billion in debt. Alitalia's unionized staff have resisted deep cuts over the past decade even though losses continued to mount for the flag carrier. The Italian government along with two major banks, Intesa Saopaolo and UniCredit, stepped in with a $680 million recapitalization in 2013. This reduced the stake of Air France-KLM, which had no desire to pump more money into the operation, to 7%. Italian officials have indicated that Alitalia is losing about $1.6 million a day, well over a half billion dollars a year. In April, Italy's Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan told me it was important for the government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to consummate this transaction as a signal the country is open for business. This deal represents the latest move by the Abu Dhabi carrier and its CEO James Hogan to build its network to more than 400 destinations. It has taken positions in seven carriers including Air Berlin, Air Serbia and Aer Lingus in Europe. It has also looked East, with stakes in stakes in Jet Airways of India and Virgin Australia. Etihad would not comment beyond its joint-statement, but Hogan spelled out his strategy during our interview at the Dubai Air Show last November. ""Having that network offering is key. But why do we all have to duplicate our overhead?"" Hogan said. He pointed to the need for ""centers of excellence"" with the ""lowest unit cost, whether it's reservations, whether it's part of training. Cost reduction is as important as exceeding customer expectation."" The challenge for Hogan is proving his team can turn around loss-makers like Air Berlin and Alitalia, while also picking up passengers for Etihad.

"(CNN) -- A New Hampshire police chief was cited Friday for improperly storing his service firearm after a teenager used the weapon to commit suicide in the chief's home in March, according to the local prosecutor. Danville Police Chief Wade Parsons allegedly left his firearm, a .40-caliber Glock 22 pistol, on top of a safe in his bedroom closet on March 11, said Rockingham County Attorney Jim Reams. Parsons left the house to run errands, while the boy -- the 15-year-old son of the chief's girlfriend -- remained in the home. ""The service weapon was used by a juvenile to shoot himself while no one else was home,"" Reams said in a news release. When Parsons returned, he discovered the boy's body, Reams said. ""There is no clear explanation (for the suicide),"" Reams told CNN Friday. There had been no previous signs that the youth was troubled, Reams added. Parsons was not charged in the youth's death, Reams said. The chief was charged with violating a New Hampshire statute that requires any person to securely store a firearm when a child is likely to gain access to it without parental or guardian permission. A court date has not yet been set. The maximum fine under the statute is $1,000, according to Reams' news release. This is the first time Reams has cited anyone with the violation in his 15 years as county attorney, he said. Parsons did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment. Danville is located in southeastern New Hampshire and is about 10 miles north of the Massachusetts line. Reams said he hopes the tragedy will remind people of the importance of storing weapons properly. ""Nobody feels worse about this than the police chief,"" said Reams. ""But I hope it's a reminder to people in New Hampshire to make sure that children don't have unsupervised access to firearms. That's the statement our legislature has made. We expect people to live up to it.""","New Hampshire police chief is cited after his fiream is used by a teenager for suicide .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Indirect talks between Palestinians and Israelis, aimed at ending the hostilities in Gaza, have resumed in Cairo, Egyptian state-run EgyNews reported Monday. The talks are taking place amid a three-day cease-fire brokered by Egypt. Israel wants Hamas, the militant Islamic group that runs Gaza, to disarm as part of a demilitarization of the territory. The Palestinian delegation's demands include the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza; a commitment to the 2012 memorandum of understanding, which called for an end to Israel's blockade on Gaza; an extension of fishing rights off the coast; and the reopening of air and seaports. Israeli authorities restrict the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza, saying they need to prevent weapons being imported. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN on Monday that ""if nonviolence is maintained,"" the talks could be ongoing. Israel would be willing to ease sanctions ""if all aggression from Gaza stops,"" he said on CNN's ""New Day."" ""I believe if the Palestinians -- if Hamas -- ceases violence, ceases to target Israeli citizens, then anything is possible,"" Regev said. ""We see nonviolence and demilitarization as the keys as we move forward now."" The Palestinian delegation includes representatives from several factions, including Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Fatah, the group that governs the West Bank. Senior Hamas official Izzat Risheq told CNN that this would be the last time Palestinians would be willing to participate in negotiations. Before the latest truce was announced, Hamas officials had threatened to walk away from the talks. ""We will not stay long in the absence of serious negotiations,"" Mousa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official in Cairo, said in a statement Sunday. ""The coming 24 hours will determine the fate of the negotiations as a whole."" Humanitarian aid . The latest truce also helps humanitarian aid reach some of the victims of the Gaza conflict, which has been raging for more than a month. ""The humanitarian needs are very, very big right now"" in Gaza, said Erika Tovar, a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross. ""Now we are able to move around better because of the cease-fire."" A spokeswoman for Israel's Coordination and Liaison Administration for Gaza, which coordinates the crossings from Israel into Gaza, said the Kerem Shalom and Erez crossings were open Monday. ""Today, 369 truckloads of goods were scheduled to be sent into Gaza, including 212 truckloads of food, 33 of animal feed, and 25 of medical supplies,"" 2nd Lt. Adina Horesh said Monday. ""There have not been any particular issues today that have hindered the operation of the crossing."" A previous cease-fire ended Friday when militant groups in Gaza resumed rocket attacks on Israel, provoking renewed airstrikes from the Israeli military. The return to violence stalled the Egyptian-mediated negotiations between the two sides in Cairo, with Israeli officials leaving the city. On Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said the delegation would not return until the rocket fire from Gaza stopped. ""We will not negotiate under fire,"" he said. The Israeli military said Monday morning that no rocket fire had been reported since the truce came into effect just after midnight local time (Sunday at 9 p.m. GMT and 5 p.m. ET), and a senior Egyptian official later told CNN that an Israeli delegation had arrived in Cairo for talks. 'The operation will continue' The Israeli military pulled its ground forces out of Gaza last week, saying it had achieved the goal of destroying Hamas' network of tunnels, some of which ran under the border and were used by militants to launch attacks. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the broader operation is still under way. ""At no stage did we announce its end,"" he said. ""The operation will continue until we complete its aims -- the return of quiet for a continuous period of time."" On Sunday, before the new truce began, militants had kept firing rockets into Israel, and airstrikes continued to pound Gaza, killing a number of Palestinians. The United Nations said Sunday that 1,948 Palestinians had been killed during the conflict, estimating that around 72% of them were civilians. The fighting has wounded thousands of people and displaced hundreds of thousands. Many Gaza residents are struggling to get access to basic necessities like shelter, water and power. Aid workers are taking advantage of the lull to try to address some of those issues. ""We can get disposable items to the hospitals, more health practitioners to the hospitals,"" said Tovar of the Red Cross. ""We are bringing more technicians to repair the power lines, and we can go farther to assess the needs of people who have been displaced."" Israeli officials say 64 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the conflict, and three civilians were killed in Israel. Man killed in the West Bank . In the West Bank, where the Gaza conflict has raised tensions, Israeli security forces killed a Palestinian man early Monday, the Israeli military said in a statement. The man, who was wanted for questioning over a shooting incident against Israeli forces two weeks ago, barricaded himself in a building in the town of Qabalan, the Israel Defense Forces said. He refused repeated calls to turn himself in and fired a gun, it said. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported that the Israeli forces targeted the 24-year-old man in his home and that eight other people were injured. The IDF said it wasn't aware if anyone else was injured in the clash. It said further searches revealed weapons at the scene. On Sunday, a 10-year-old Palestinian boy was shot and killed in front of his house in the West Bank city of Hebron during clashes between Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers, Palestinian medical officials said. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports of the boy's death. CNN's Saima Mohsin reported from Jerusalem, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Samira Said, Ashley Fantz, Ali Younes, Salma Abdelaziz, Martin Savidge, Claudia Rebaza and Tal Heinrich also contributed to this report.","Indirect talks between Israelis and Palestinians resume, Egyptian news service says .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama is asking for more than $230 million in the 2011 budget to buy and prepare an idle Illinois prison to house terrorism suspects now detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The Justice Department budget for 2011 unveiled Monday calls for about $172 million for the federal government to acquire and renovate the state-owned prison in Thomson, Illinois, and another $66 million to eventually staff and equip it. The budget requires congressional approval, and several lawmakers in both the House and Senate have vowed to block the funds, potentially preventing the transfer of many of the 192 remaining Guantanamo detainees to U.S. soil. ""Even though Americans are facing tremendous economic challenges, the administration has chosen to spend $237 million dollars in taxpayer money to provide free travel, room and board in Thomson, Illinois for some of the most dangerous Guantanamo detainees,"" said a statement Monday by Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""It is time for the president to focus on the security and economic needs of the American people, rather than on the needs of those dangerous extremists who seek to do us harm."" Even if the funds are approved by the start of the 2011 budget year in October 2010, Justice Department officials said Monday the transfer of any detainees was unlikely to start until several months later. In addition to the cost of the Illinois prison, the Justice Department budget seeks another $73 million dollars for the transfer, prosecution and incarceration of five Guantanamo Bay detainees currently slated to stand trial in criminal court for their alleged roles in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Justice Department officials told reporters that includes about $23 million for security, $15 million for transportation, $15 million for litigation, $7 million for detainee housing and another $12 million for related expenses. Gary Grindler, the acting deputy attorney general, said the Justice Department is committed to a civilian trial for Khaled Sheik Mohammed and four others charged in the September 11, 2001, terrorism case. Grindler said no decision has been made on whether the trial would be moved from New York City. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs also said Monday that the government was still examining whether to hold the trial in New York City or somewhere else. Federal officials informed New York authorities that the cost of a long-running trial in New York City could approach $1 billion. New York officials including Mayor Michael Bloomberg are increasingly opposed to conducting the trial in Manhattan due to the high cost and disruptions it would cause. Julie Menin, chairwoman of a city community advisory agency, proposed four alternative locations for the trial within the Southern District of Manhattan: Governors Island, Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and the Bureau of Prisons jail complex at FCI Otisville. The latter three are all in Orange County, New York, a county less than an hour away from New York City, county executive Edward Diana told CNN. Diana opposes holding the trial in Orange County, and warned he would mount a legal challenge to try to stop it. A West Point spokesman said last week that no one has officially requested a review of demands for such a trial, which would require in-depth study of legal and security concerns.","Obama asks for $230 million to buy, prepare Illinois prison for Guantanamo detainees .

"(CNN) -- Tractor-trailer drivers, if you text while driving in the middle of the freeway, then the future may belong to you. If you can afford a Mercedes truck, that is. The German vehicle maker sent an 18-wheeler barreling down the Autobahn recently, while the driver surfed the Internet for food recipes on tablet computer -- at least that's how media photos told the story. Its test drive was brief, covering about three miles, German media reported. The trucker's hands didn't touch the wheel and his eyes were fixed on pork cutlets. But that could be the way some drive in the future, perhaps in the next decade or so. That's the message of the prototype ""Future Truck 2025,"" which Mercedes says is the first self-driven freight vehicle. It may seem illogical right now, but the hands-off idea is aimed at eliminating human error. Special cameras and multiple radar systems watch the road, the sides of the road, and cars and trucks behind the vehicle. Future Truck is also envisioned to communicate with other vehicles and connect to growing sources of online information as Big Data balloons on the road. Its computerized controls will also make it more fuel efficient, Mercedes boasts. Once the truck merges into traffic, it won't accelerate to clichÃ©d Autobahn breakneck speeds. The system will throttle it to a meek 50 mph, Mercedes says. Many of the component parts to put a vehicle like this into production are already available in trucks on the market: Systems that help drivers keep their distance from other drivers, active braking assistance, guidance and mapping systems, and fine-tuned cruise control and tons of other hi-tech tchotchke. If a puttering slowpoke pulls out in front of Future Truck 2025, it will slow down automatically to keep off of its bumper, but the 18-wheeler won't pass it by itself. That's when the driver will have to turn off the ball game, put down the iPad or lay away the knife and fork, then take the wheel. But he'd be ill advised to goof off too much, because two cameras and a sensor under his seat will monitor his activities. Mercedes says that the trucker will still be expected to be responsible for controlling the vehicle. But by then they won't be called that anymore. In 2025, they'll be promoted to ""transport managers."" Holographic staff and no lost luggage: How you'll travel in 2024 .

"(CNN) -- She's been called ""the nightmare nanny"" for refusing to leave the home of the family that hired -- then fired -- her, but now Diane Stretton is speaking out for the first time. And she says she's not a con-artist squatter, she's a victim. ""I didn't get lunch breaks, I didn't get coffee breaks, I didn't get any holidays. Basically, I was working 24/7,"" she told Los Angeles' KNX 1070 news radio. ""They were the ones that were trying to exploit me, as if I was some poor migrant worker from a foreign country that they could just exploit and work 24/7."" The saga began back in March when Marcella Bracamonte hired Stretton as a nanny to take care of her three children and to help out with household chores. But the relationship soured after a few months, and what happened next depends on who you ask. Bracamonte says she fired Stretton, but Stretton says she quit. ""I wasn't fired, unless you can be fired after you quit,"" she said in the radio interview. ""I quit two days before they fired me. And I gave 30 days of notice, which we had agreed to."" CNN reached out to Bracamonte for reaction to Stretton's radio interview but had not heard back Monday evening. However it went down, a California judge sided with Stretton, ruling that the Bracamontes did not terminate the nanny's employment in a legal manner. Stretton refused to leave the Bracamonte home in Upland, about 35 miles east of Los Angeles, and police told the family they couldn't force her out without an eviction notice. Even the Bracamontes' attorney says the ruling was correct by law. ""She has absolutely every right to stay in the house at this time,"" Marc Cohen told CNN. ""Under the law in California (eviction) can take 30 to 45 days."" The family said Stretton threatened to sue if they tried to force her out. CNN discovered that Stretton is on the California's Vexatious Litigant List, a list of people who continually bring legal action, regardless of merit, against others with the sole intention of harassment. CNN found dozens of lawsuits filed by Stretton in California over the years. There were signs Monday night that the impasse was nearing an end. Marcella Bracamonte told CNN's Sara Sidner that Stretton -- who is currently sleeping in her car, while all of her belongings remain inside Bracamontes' home -- offered to move out over the July Fourth weekend. But Bracamonte said that can't happen. ""We're going to a wedding, it has been planned for a year,"" she said. ""My sister is getting married on a cruise ship and we're going.""

"(CNN) -- It was one of the most disturbing sights Wimbledon has witnessed. Serena Williams, a 17-time grand slam champion, disorientated, unsteady on her feet and unable to serve properly on Court No. 1. Her doubles match alongside sister Venus lasted just three games, with Serena unable to get the ball over the net when it was her turn to serve. But now, as she prepares to return to action at the WTA's Stanford tournament, the 32-year-old says the commotion caused by her viral illness had taken her by surprise. ""They just said I was really ill, and really under the weather and I just wasn't doing very well,"" Williams told reporters prior to the Bank Of The West Classic in California about her turn at Wimbledon. ""I was really scared after because I didn't realize how I felt until later and it's just, you know, 'Serena, keep your time, you will have the rest of your life to keep playing tennis hopefully.' ""I heard a lot of the response weeks and weeks later because I didn't leave my house or my bed for a few days. ""But by the time that happened when I read or heard about it from other people I was just like, 'Oh really, I already moved on.' I was working out and starting to try to play again."" Williams will take on the Czech Republic's Karolina Pliskova on Wednesday saying she feels ""very good"" but that she will have more medical tests once the season has finished. Her sister Venus suffers from Sjogren's syndrome, a poorly understood autoimmune disorder that causes joint pain and can deplete energy levels. Serena skipped a tournament in Sweden after her Wimbledon illness but is now focusing on preparation ahead of the U.S. Open. She has won the title at Flushing Meadows two years in a row and needs to claim a hat-trick next month to avoid a first season without a slam title since 2011. ""After Wimbledon I stayed around in Europe because I was going play in Bastad, and I feel so bad about not being able to play there,"" she said. ""I ended up going on what I called 'vacation,' which is like when you have fun in the sun but you practice in the day, in the morning. I tried to practice very early so I can have fun later.""

A stop in a robotics lab included a look at a station holding a metal, snowflake-shaped, remote-controlled robot. ""It can go over obstacles,"" a student said, demonstrating as it moved along a white strip over cardboard and plastic yellow bricks. 'Bad Boy' robot 'is really naughty' When the robot got stuck, its student operator said something to the effect that it was nervous. ""Don't be nervous,"" Obama said. ""It's pretty impressive,"" she added as the robot was operating. At another station, a young man showed Obama ""Bad Boy,"" so named because the robot ""is really naughty,"" he said, according to a pool reporter. Obama agreed to try it, but could not get the remote control to work and handed it to Malia, who had better luck. The first lady spoke with a number of students, asking a 16-year-old what she wanted to do after high school. ""I want to turn mathematics into reality,"" the student answered. When they arrived at a pingpong practice room containing six tables, an instructor asked Obama if she wanted to try her hand at it, and she quickly assumed the role of student. ""All right, wait,"" she said, taking off her vest. ""How do I hold the paddle properly?"" ""This is the angle,"" the instructor responded, holding it vertically. ""OK, we're going to get this,"" Obama said. ""Let's go."" Armed with a paddle, she volleyed for about five minutes -- first with the instructor, then with a young woman, as students looked on. ""Nice,"" she said occasionally after her opponent returned her shot. But Obama acknowledged that she had little experience with the game. ""My husband plays,"" she said. ""He thinks he's better than he really is. I could stay here all day."" 1971 pingpong match proved key . The 50-year-old first lady was in grade school when a chance meeting by a Chinese pingpong player with a U.S. player led to Beijing's decision to invite the American table tennis team for an exhibition match in 1971. That match laid the groundwork for the visit of U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1972 and paved the way for the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1979, ending China's isolation from the outside world. As the members of the first family departed the school, 33 American exchange students -- one of them from Sidwell Friends, the Washington school attended by Malia -- lined up in front of the red carpet and across from their Chinese counterparts to shake hands with the family before they left for their next stop, the Forbidden City. Michelle Obama's schedule does not include a news conference, and she is not expected to answer questions from professional reporters during the trip. But on Saturday, she is planning to answer several of the more than 300 questions filed by CNN iReporters about studying abroad and international travel. And on Tuesday, she will answer questions submitted by U.S. classrooms as part of a webinar series by Discovery Education and the White House. The three generations of girls and women flew from Washington on Wednesday for what is to be a weeklong trip to three Chinese cities, where Obama is expected to speak with children at schools about education and youth empowerment. Official: U.S.-China relationship is 'between peoples' ""Her visit and her agenda sends a message that the relationship between the United States and China is not just between leaders, it's a relationship between peoples,"" said Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes. ""That's critically important, given the roles that our two countries are going to play in the 21st century, that we maintain the very regular contacts that we have at the leader-to-leader level, but that we're also reaching out and building relationships with people, particularly young people."" U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at next week's Nuclear Security Summit at The Hague, Netherlands. White House officials told reporters this week that the two leaders will discuss issues on which the United States and China differ, such as human rights and trade. ""We don't expect the people of China to agree with all of our policy positions at any given moment, but the more they understand the United States -- the more they understand the President and the first lady and their values and their priorities -- we think the better it is for both of our countries,"" Rhodes added. China is the fifth most popular country for U.S. students studying abroad, and more students from China study in the United States than from any other country.

"Kabul (CNN) -- The ordeal of Gulnaz did not simply begin and end with the physical attack of her rape. The rape began a years-long nightmare of further pain, culminating in an awful choice she must now make. Even two years later, Gulnaz remembers the smell and state of her rapist's clothes when he came into the house when her mother left for a brief visit to the hospital. ""He had filthy clothes on as he does metal and construction work. When my mother went out, he came into my house and he closed doors and windows. I started screaming, but he shut me up by putting his hands on my mouth,"" she said. The rapist was her cousin's husband. After the attack, she hid what happened as long as she could. But soon she began vomiting in the mornings and showing signs of pregnancy. It was her attacker's child. In Afghanistan, this brought her not sympathy, but prosecution. Aged just 19, she was found guilty by the courts of sex outside of marriage -- adultery -- and sentenced to twelve years in jail. Now inside Kabul's Badam Bagh jail, she and her child are serving her sentence together. Sitting with the baby in her lap, her face carefully covered, she explains the only choice she has that would end her incarceration. The only way around the dishonor of rape, or adultery in the eyes of Afghans, is to marry her attacker. This will, in the eyes of some, give her child a family and restore her honor. Incredibly, this is something that Gulnaz is willing to do. ""I was asked if I wanted to start a new life by getting released, by marrying this man"", she told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""My answer was that one man dishonored me, and I want to stay with that man."" Tending to her daughter in the jail's cold, she added: ""My daughter is a little innocent child. Who knew I would have a child in this way. A lot of people told me that after your daughter's born give it to someone else, but my aunt told me to keep her as proof of my innocence."" Gulnaz's choice is stark. Women in her situation are often killed for the shame their ordeal has brought the community. She is at risk, some say, from her attacker's family. We found Gulnaz's convicted rapist in a jail across town. While he denied raping her, he agreed that she would likely be killed if she gets out of jail. But he insists that it will be her family, not his, that will kill her, ""out of shame."" Whether threatened by his family or hers, for now, jail may be the safest place for her. Shockingly, Gulnaz's case is common in Afghanistan. CNN asked a spokesman for the prosecutor to comment on the case. The reply was that there were hundreds such cases and the office would need time to look into it. But Gulnaz's plight has found international attention because of a dispute between the European Union and a team of documentary makers hired to report on women's rights in Afghanistan. The documentary makers filmed a lengthy report on Gulnaz and other women, showing her talking openly about her fate. They showed the film to the EU, who were paying for it as part of a project on female rights here. After viewing it, the EU decided to spike the project. The EU said it was concerned about the safety of the women in the film: they could be identified and might face reprisals. The filmmakers however suspect -- citing an email leaked from the EU delegation -- that the EU might also be motivated by its sensitive relationship with Afghan justice institutions, since he film shows the Afghan justice system in a very unflattering light. The leaked email says: ""The delegation also has to consider its relations with [Afghan] Justice institutions in connection with the other work that it is doing in the sector."" The EU Ambassador to Afghanistan, Vygaudas Usackas, rejected any political motivation in asking for the film not to be shown. ""What I am concerned about is that situation of the women. About the security and well being, that's of paramount importance, the key criteria according to which I, as representative of the European Union will judge,"" said the ambassdor. Under Afghan law, Gulnaz has been judged an adulterer. Despite the ongoing dispute over her story, her predicament has not changed. She faces the hideous choice of 12 years in jail or marriage to her rapist and risk death. It's a marriage she says she'll accept, so her child can continue to have a mother.","Afghan rape victim Gulnaz found guilty by courts of adultery and jailed for 12 years .

"(CNN) -- When Saher Shaikh first moved to Dubai, the rights of the city's labor population was the furthest thing from her mind. That changed soon after her arrival, when she spotted one of the UAE's five million migrant workers in line at the local grocery store. ""I had my chubby baby in my arms, and this guy in front was trying to pay for a tiny bread roll and a small bottle of yoghurt. He didn't have enough coins to pay for it. I was looking at him, and looking at my groceries and feeling bad about it, and I thought, 'how can I make this better?'"" says Shaikh, a British citizen with Pakistani and Afghan roots. ""It's my son's birthday today, and to celebrate, I was wondering if you'd do the honor of letting us treat you?"" she asked him in Urdu, instructing him to choose anything he wanted from the store. He left the line and came back with a diminutive bottle of strawberry milk. ""He didn't try to take advantage. He was so humble and sweet,"" she recalls. Nine years later, and Shaikh heads up Adopt-a-Camp, a charity she started that offers up support services to a handful of the country's laborers. At any given time, she helps a roster of 53,000 men spread across 52 camps throughout the UAE. ""I have four kids and 53,000 adopted kids. It's not easy,"" she says. Spreading the knowledge bug . For the most part, Adopt-a-Camp is a one-woman show (aside from an assistant and a Facebook army of volunteers, Shaikh runs the charity primarily on her own). An impressive feat, given the range of services she offers. She gives the men counseling, organizes events to get them out of the camps, distributes care packages, and on occasion pays for the men's medical fees and school fees for their children back home. She also prioritizes hygiene. ""Every camp we adopt we make bed bug-free, cockroach-free and lice-free. We physically shampoo the men's hair ourselves,"" she says. She also gives them hygiene workshops with the understanding that they pass on what they learn to their families and communities back home. ""A lot of these men come from villages where they aren't taught the concept of germs -- these microscopic organisms that exist and can make you sick. We've had great feedback from the men that have returned home; in their villages, dysentery levels are down and deaths in childbirth are down."" Knowledge's infectious potential is a major tenet of the charity. Shaikh has also arranged English lessons for some of the men though American University in Dubai with the similar understanding that they'll spread their learning. Workers' rights . Adopt-a-Camp has a couple of unexpected sponsors, in the form of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of Labor. Shaikh works with the latter to help ensure the country's laborers are made aware of their rights when they need to impose them -- particularly in the event that their employers stop signing their checks. ""It was a common problem during the recession, but it still happens now and again. We'd hear from the men that they hadn't been paid for months, or even a year, and that their families were starving and they were starving. We worked with the Ministry of Labor to help them get home, or find a better job,"" she says. Shaikh, who is careful to lay the blame on unscrupulous employers and not the government, notes that there are labor laws in the UAE designed to protect migrant workers from such an eventuality. ""The law is that if a man is not paid, even for one month, he is entitled to receive his salary, a plane ticket home, and any extraneous costs incurred,"" she says. While Nicholas McGeehan, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, concedes that conditions have improved for workers in the UAE over the last few years (mainly in the form of better housing), he also notes that the laws designed to protect laborers aren't always enforced. ""Theoretically, workers can take complaints to the labor courts. Theoretically, they should be able to get their salaries back, but justice is dispensed in a very ad hoc manner, if it is dispensed at all"" he says,"" he says. ""The issue is: what happens to the employer after they're found guilty? Are they prosecuted? It seems the worse that happens to them is the government forces them to pay workers their salaries. But if employers are not prosecuted, what message does that send?"" Further complicating the issue, suggests McGeehan, is the lack of separation between the government and the construction companies. ""The line between public and private in the UAE is so fine as to be almost non-existent. The people that own and run some of the biggest construction firms are people in government,"" he says. The issue is not unique to the UAE. Other Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, have also been criticized for their treatment of guest workers. McGeehan (who is currently blacklisted from the UAE) says that better transparency in the region would be a step in the right direction. ""It's obviously admirable that there are people on the ground to assist workers, but it's also important that NGOs are allowed to criticize the government for their actions when necessary. She's carrying one part of the equation, and that's important, but we need the other side as well."" CNN contacted the UAE's Ministry of Labor for comment but did not receive a reply.","Dubai-based charity Adopt-a-Camp offers support to the UAE's laborer population .

"(CNN) -- It's a beautiful afternoon on the beach. The sun is shining, you're rolling in the waves, showing off the toned torso you worked on at the gym all winter. Suddenly a sharp, burning sensation hits your skin. You've just been stung by a jellyfish. If experts' warnings are true, swimmers around the world can expect to experience these unwanted love taps in greater numbers than ever before. ""Jellyfish and tourism are not happy bedfellows,"" says Dr. Lisa-Ann Gershwin, author of the recently published book, ""Stung! On Jellyfish Blooms and the Future of the Ocean."" Gershwin says popular beach resorts around the world are seeing huge increases in jellyfish ""bloom"" activity, a result of overfishing and changing water temperatures. ""The French and Spanish Rivieras, Chesapeake Bay, the Great Barrier Reef, Hawaii ... some of the numbers are staggering,"" says the American scientist who's now based in Australia. ""In Hawaii there have been times that 800 or 1,000 people have been stung in a day. In Spain or Florida, it's not uncommon in recent years for a half a million people to be stung during an outbreak. These numbers are simply astonishing."" At the beginning of October, a large amount of jellyfish inhabiting a cooling-water intake at a Swedish nuclear plant caused operators to manually shut down production at its largest reactor. Jellyfish prompt nuclear shutdown . In Ireland, a jellyfish bloom reportedly killed thousands of farmed salmon, according to the Irish Times. This past summer, southern Europe experienced one of its worst jellyfish infestations ever. Experts there have been reporting a steady increase in the number of jellyfish in the Mediterranean Sea for years. According to a report titled ""Review of Jellyfish Blooms in the Mediterranean and Black Sea,"" written by Fernando Borea for the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean and the United Nations, scientists are catching up to what travelers in the Med have been experiencing for years. ""In the last decade ... the media are reporting on an increasingly high number of gelatinous plankton blooms,"" reads the report. ""The reason for these reports is that thousands of tourists are stung, fisheries are harmed and even impaired by jellyfish."" Although noting that significant jellyfish blooms ""have been known since ancient times and are part of the normal functioning of the oceans,"" the report cites global warming and global overfishing (which removes jellyfish predators) as causes for exploding jellyfish populations in recent years. The situation in the Mediterranean was dire enough to prompt Britain's foreign office to issue a warning to its citizens vacationing along Europe's southern coast to watch out for jellyfish. The world's deadliest jellyfish . There are more than 2,000 species of jellyfish swimming through the world's waters. Most stings are completely harmless. Some will leave you in excruciating pain. Then there are the killers. Many of the world's deadliest jellyfish are box jellyfish, which refers to the species' cube-shaped meduae. ""There are several species of big box jellyfish that have caused many deaths -- these include chironex fleckeri in Australia, chironex quadrigatus in Japan and related species in Thailand, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia,"" says associate professor Jamie Seymour, a venom biologist at Australia's James Cook University. Also known as the sea wasp and the northern Australian box jellyfish, the chironex fleckeri is possibly the worlds most venomous animal. Its tentacles can reach lengths of up to three meters long, while its bell is about the size of a human head. It can be found throughout the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific. A close cousin and fellow contender for the ""world's most venomous"" cup is the Irukandji, which is the size of a thimble. Good luck scanning the waters for that one before you leap in. ""How toxic they are is just phenomenally frightening and equally fascinating,"" says Gershwin. ""Just the lightest brush -- you don't even feel it -- and then, whammo, you're in more pain than you ever could have imagined, and you are struggling to breathe and you can't move your limbs and you can't stop vomiting and your blood pressure just keeps going up and up. ""It is really surprising how many places they occur around the world -- places you would never expect: Hawaii, Caribbean, Florida, Wales, New Caledonia, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, India ... as well as Australia."" Asian giant hornets and other terrifying creatures . Is any place safe? ""More and more, places around the world that are suffering from jellyfish problems with tourists are developing prediction systems so that tourists can know when it is safe,"" says Gershwin. The irony, she says, is that tourists who avoid an area because of the known risk may alter their plans to hit a ""safe"" beach whose officials are merely less up front about the jellyfish situation, putting themselves more at risk. A common misconception is that places such as Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines are free of dangerous jellyfish. ""Jellyfish occur in all marine waters from pole to pole and at all depths,"" says Gershwin. ""The life threatening ones are found from about 40 degrees north to 40 degrees south latitude. ""Australia is upfront about its jellyfish dangers, and also assertive in safety management, whereas other places have them, but may understand less about them or, in some cases, just don't want to say. I think tourists need to be very aware of local hazards and not expect to necessarily be provided with information."" What to do when you're stung . Thanks to that infamous ""Friends"" episode that aired in 1997, millions of people think it's smart to treat a jellyfish sting with urine. In reality, peeing on a jellyfish sting isn't a good idea. A report in the Scientific American says urine can actually aggravate the jellyfish's stingers into releasing more venom. Meanwhile, there's debate over what actually works on a jellyfish sting. Many doctors say it all depends on whether the sting occurs place in tropical or nontropical waters. If stung in tropical waters, one should rinse the area with vinegar to deactivate any nematocysts -- the parts of the stinger -- that are still hanging on. ""A freshwater rinse will have the opposite effect,"" says the Scientific American report. ""Any change to the balance of solutes, such as the concentration of salts inside and outside of the cnidocyte [a venomous cell], sets off stinging."" In North America, doctors recommend using hot water and topical pain killers on a sting. Can we turn this around? Gershwin says the explosion in jellyfish populations is a visible indicator that life in the oceans is out of balance. ""If we somehow managed to eradicate all jellyfish, then something else -- some other weedy thing -- would find a perfect situation,"" she says. ""So the reason we should care is because they act as a flashing red light."" She says there's no one single factor to blame for the rise in jellyfish populations, but rather places blame on a combination of overfishing, warming water, low oxygen and pollution. By fishing out jellyfish predators and competitors, humans are creating perfect conditions for jellyfish to multiply. ""Sadly, I am one of a growing chorus of people who believe that, yes, it is too late to turn things around,"" says Gershwin. ""So many species are in such low numbers, and habitats are so badly damaged, that restoring them to their original splendor is simply no longer possible. ""I believe that our only option now is to decide how much we value what we currently have, and to decide what we are willing to do to maintain it -- or at least slow down its disappearance. But honestly, can you really see all 7 billion of us agreeing on that?""","Scientists say jellyfish are proliferating faster than ever before .

"Washington (CNN) -- Taj Magruder has never voted for Hillary Clinton. He has no connection to her paid staff. And he is not collecting a paycheck from a cadre of groups anticipating a Clinton presidential run in 2016. All of this bothers him. Magruder, a 23-year-old ""Clinton-ologist"" from Pennsylvania, devotes much of his online life to supporting, defending and responding to her every move. In what he calls his ""own little war room"" -- his computer and Twitter account -- the Pennsylvania state Senate employee has carved out a space as one of Clinton's most ardent unpaid supporters. ""I have yet to vote for Hillary,"" said Magruder, who was too young to cast a ballot the last time she was on one. ""I am really looking forward to fixing that in the coming years."" Magruder is an unsalaried Clinton warrior. And he isn't alone. All over the Internet, bloggers and their circles of friends with no backing from the Clinton orbit defend the former first lady from attacks. While their defenses don't have the weight of a Clinton spokesperson or a former top aide, they are influential in their small community of friends and family. And they are standing up for the person they hope becomes the next President. ""I am very, very passionate obviously about Hillary,"" Magruder said, if that wasn't already clear. ""I just want to make sure that Hillary has, if she does run, a kind of presence on social media that she hasn't always had."" Magruder is dogged and devout. He regularly tussles with reporters. ""I don't know if Maggie Haberman still hates me or not,"" he said referring to a Politico reporter he sparred with over a story. And he touts Clinton's many appearances. ""She was so good last night,"" he tweeted after Clinton's sit-down on the Colbert Report. Why does he do this? ""When I see a story that is like, 'yuck,' I feel like I should just stick up for my girl,"" he said with a laugh. Since May 2012, Magruder has tweeted nearly 30,000 times. Most of them -- especially recently -- have been about Clinton. And while he only has 780 followers, many of those include reporters following Clinton and representatives from the groups looking to help her if she runs again. Clinton's unpaid army does far more than tweet. Some, like Still 4 Hill, have devoted years to blogging about her every move. Since 2008, Still 4 Hill -- who keeps her identity private because of her paid employment -- has kept detailed records of Clinton's comings and goings, including nearly every speech she delivered as secretary of state. The process, is admittedly, consuming. ""You have to find ways to squeeze it in,"" she said. ""I cheat a little bit (and blog) during a lunch hour or something like that. But most of the time I do it at night."" Still 4 Hill started her blog after Clinton ended her presidential campaign in 2008. She began to write about Clinton's events at the State Department and once Clinton stepped down as America's top diplomat in 2013, Still 4 Hill began writing about Clinton on the paid speaking circuit. ""I see it as documentation,"" Still 4 Hill said about her blog. ""I want to be able to go back and look at this speech or look at that speech."" Amid all the glow for Clinton, there is also pushback against her critics. When the Washington Post's conservative blogger Jennifer Rubin wrote a lengthy critique of Clinton's time at State, Still 4 Hill responded to what she called ""repetitive and tiresome... empty bloviating"" from Rubin. There is more to the online response, though: People like Magruder and Still 4 Hill have received a little notoriety for their persistence. Ask people within the Clinton universe about Magruder and they laugh about his exuberance. Though he was never paid, Ready for Hillary sent the Clinton devotee to a finance meeting earlier this year to act as an example of a ""grassroots supporter."" Still 4 Hill's blog receives upwards of 10,000 hits a week. As of late -- given Clinton's book tour and regular appearances -- the blog can gets as many as of 2,500 clicks a day. And when Still 4 Hill met Clinton at a New Jersey book singing this year, she was sure to mention her blog. According to blogger, Clinton responded, ""Still 4 Hill! I love it. Yeah, I love it."" There is a downside to all of this, too. Both Magruder and Still 4 Hill are building a online record of their thoughts and feelings about Clinton and that record -- at some point -- could come back to haunt them. What's more, in the anything goes nature of a campaign, comments made by Clinton followers and fans can blow up into bigger stories. What happens when those fans have years of logs and comments that opposition groups could cull? ""To the extent that the actors join Hillary's campaign or official groups that support Hillary's campaign, their views and statements online become relevant,"" Tim Miller, executive director of America Rising, an anti-Clinton super PAC, told CNN. Still 4 Hill's post-2008 actions seemed to recognize this. Shortly after Clinton conceded defeat to Barack Obama after a bitter primary battle, the blog took a negative, sometimes anti-Obama turn, Still 4 Hill told CNN. After giving it some thought -- and after Clinton patched up her relationship with him -- the blogger decided to delete some of those posts. ""I am reading her book now and when I read the first chapter it was like tearing a scab off a wound of something,"" Still 4 Hill said, capturing how she is still hurt over that campaign. ""That primary season was so brutal. ... I removed a lot of the pages from June 2008 to the general election campaign."" But Clinton's previous run might not be her last. So what if she runs again, how much work are these devotees willing to commit? And is all of their Internet devotion an audition for something bigger? ""I would love it if a role is available for me. If there is one, I would love it,"" Magruder said. ""But whether or not I get an official role won't stop me from doing work on social media.""","Clinton followers devote online presence to supporting and defending Hillary Clinton .
Many have jobs, but they use downtime to tussle with reporters and tout Hillary .

"(CNN) -- The situation along the U.S. southern border is complicated. There are no easy answers to the problem of thousands of desperate children, many unaccompanied minors, fleeing chaos, violence and governmental collapse in Central America. Yet seeing some of my fellow Americans jeering busloads of frightened children and hearing commentators dismiss these children as someone else's problem has left me wondering exactly what kind of country we have turned into, and how quickly we forget our own history. My grandfather arrived on Ellis Island in 1907 as an unaccompanied 9-year-old from an impoverished small town in what is now Belarus. The situation he fled was probably less dire than that of many of the Central Americans arriving today. But it was bad enough. His father had died. His widowed mother's only alternative to destitution was a quick remarriage, but the presence of the strong-willed boy was a serious impediment to her prospects. So little Chaim was farmed out to his elderly grandmother, for whom he was clearly too much to handle. He continually ran away from home and school, sometimes for days at time. Chaim became a kind of unlikely Jewish mascot of a local gang of non-Jewish teens. With a child's unerring instinct of how to get under the skin of his new, strictly observant stepfather, he began to eat pork with his rough companions. Decades later he would recall his days as a freedom-loving village hooligan with a mischievous grin, but it does not take much historical imagination to understand why the adults around him were terrified. Political violence, anti-Semitic pogroms, criminal gangs and violent state repression were all on the rise in the waning days of the Russian empire. In this dangerous, chaotic time, Chaim must have seemed headed for certain disaster. The local rabbi was consulted and a course of action was recommended: Send the incorrigible little delinquent off to live with his late father's cousins in America — a land so full of incorrigible delinquents that one more would scarcely be noticed. Chaim arrived at Ellis Island penniless and alone. Social workers kept him there until they found a cousin willing to claim him. It didn't take, however. Sixty years later he told me this cousin had a big beard and reminded him of the teachers and rabbis back in the shtetl that he had run away from in the first place. Whatever the real reason, by age 11 he had run away from the cousin, too, and was more or less on his own for good. Early days in America were not auspicious. He wandered the streets of New York's Lower East Side and Brownsville, sleeping in a stable and working for pennies by helping out teamsters on their wagons. In his late teens he became a boxer — never very good — and a bouncer at a saloon. Only 5-foot-2, he acquired the nickname of ""Little Frenchy"" a tribute to a street brawler named Frenchy whose fighting style he emulated. The name stuck for the rest of his life. He did stints in orphanages and reformatories and a short one in adult jail, when he lied about his age to avoid the juvenile authorities. And yet, from this unpromising beginning, an American family sprang. After this rocky start -- Frenchy, like many thousands of other one time ""unaccompanied minors"" — eventually became a very solid American. He volunteered for the U.S. Army during World War I and became an American citizen. After the war he started a small moving business that grew to be modestly successful, employing about a dozen men. He married a U.S.-born girl whose family came from his hometown. Together they ran the business, raised two sons who later served in the U.S. military and went on to successful careers. Frenchy and his wife lived to see their grandchildren, who eventually became reasonably decent and productive Americans. And, much to the annoyance of those grandchildren, my grandparents also became knee-jerk patriots, loudly supporting all things American even at the height of the Vietnam War. Not knowing his real birthday, Frenchy always listed July 4 as his date of birth. He voted, joined civic groups and paid taxes. Indeed, one of my father's favorite stories about my grandfather concerned a year in the late 1940s when his accountant told him that after depreciation on his trucks and various other deductions, he owed no federal tax. Frenchy would have none of it. To the accountant's horror, he insisted on writing a check for the same amount he had paid the previous year. America had taken him in when he was a hungry, frightened child. Whatever his shortcomings, America had allowed him to prosper by the sweat of his brow. Now a successful man, he was not going to hide behind some accountant's tricks and shirk his duty to pay his fair share. Paying his share was what a man did. It was what an American did. While he never lost his youthful distaste for organized religion, he had an almost religious belief in the essential goodness of his adopted homeland. And yes, Frenchy broke the rules and occasionally some laws to get here and survive here. If that is a contradiction, it is the kind of contradiction that animates many American lives. That is the kind of country we are, and for the most part, it's worked out pretty well. I wonder how many people screaming at frightened children in Murrieta, California, have an ancestor with a similar story. I wonder why so many Americans have forgotten their history. And I wonder, if they are allowed to stay, what sort of Americans will the brave, resilient children on those buses someday become?","Philip Kasinitz: Children at border a complicated problem; some fellow Americans uncharitable .

"(CNN) -- Brazil is into the World Cup semifinals. But its brightest star is out. Neymar fractured his vertebra Friday night during his team's World Cup quarterfinal win over Colombia and will miss the remainder of the football tournament, team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar told reporters after the game. The 22-year-old got kneed in the back during a second-half collision with a Colombian player. He rolled on the ground afterward, then cried in apparent pain while being taken off the field on a stretcher. ""It's not serious in the sense that it doesn't need surgery, but he'll need to immobilize it to recover,"" said Lasmar, according to a story on the official website of FIFA, which runs the World Cup. ""Unfortunately, he's not going to be able to play."" His loss is a huge blow for Brazil, which entered the World Cup with steep expectations given its traditional excellence in the sport -- it has won more championships than any other country -- and the fact it is hosting the tourney for the first time since 1950. As one woman dressed in a Brazilian national team jersey told CNN on Friday night in Rio de Janeiro, ""It's like we have lost today."" ""It's terrible, terrible. I'm so sad,"" she added regarding Neymar's injury. ""But let's go on."" Many in Brazil still have a bitter taste from that World Cup decades ago, when the host lost in the finals to Uruguay. It's not like the next game would have been easy regardless. In the semifinal Tuesday, Brazil will face Germany, which is undefeated in the tournament and handily toppled France earlier Friday. The final game will take place July 13. Neymar is not the only one unavailable for the semifinal: Thiago Silva, the squad's captain, will also miss the game after getting his second yellow card on Friday -- which automatically rules him out of his next game. Neymar has been the face of his team in his native Brazil and around the world. He has scored four goals, more than anyone else on his team and anyone in the tournament besides Colombia's James Rodriguez. (Argentina's Lionel Messi and Germany's Thomas Mueller also have four goals, like Neymar.) A standout with the Brazilian club Santos, Neymar moved last summer to one of the world's richest, most successful clubs in FC Barcelona. Messi, his teammate there, was among those who offered their regrets that Neymar is out of the World Cup and their best wishes for a speedy recovery. The legendary Argentinian posted Friday night on his Facebook page: ""Neymar, I hope you recover very soon, friend!""

"(CNN) -- Mexican officials have launched an investigation into allegations that a reputed Mexican drug cartel ""queen"" received a beauty treatment while in prison. The Mexico City District Attorney's Office alleges that Sandra Avila Beltran, who faces charges of drug trafficking, money laundering and conspiracy, got a Botox injection on January 10 at the Santa Martha Acatitla prison in the Mexican capital. Prosecutors said they are investigating medical personnel at the prison who might have provided access to a doctor who applied the Botox injection to Avila, also known as ""The Queen of the Pacific."" Avila, who according to Mexican media reports is 50 years old, was allegedly tied to the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the most powerful Mexican criminal organizations. Mexico City District Attorney Miguel Angel Mancera said the investigation into the prison incident was prompted by a tip from prison personnel. Mancera also said prison employees who have not yet been identified ""falsified"" an access request form saying the doctor was going to perform an electrocardiogram, but instead applied the injection. ""The investigation will focus on the possibility that a public servant committed a crime, according to the complaint made by the prison authorities,"" Mancera said. He also said Avila and the prison director will be questioned in the next few days, but he didn't elaborate on what kind of disciplinary action those allegedly involved in the incident may face. So far, the doctor who gained access to the prison -- and who was not identified by authorities -- faces no charges. Sandra Avila Beltran was arrested on September 28, 2007, in Mexico City. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, she was suspected of conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the U.S. along with Juan Diego Espinosa, a.k.a. ""The Tiger,"" a Colombian national who, sources say, was his lover. They were arrested together. The DEA said that in November 2001, Espinosa, Avila and others ""allegedly arranged the shipment of cocaine from Colombia to the United States by ship."" The ship, loaded with 9,291 kilograms of cocaine, was boarded by U.S. agents near Manzanillo, on Mexico's Pacific coast. Avila's fame grew in Mexico and Latin America after inspiring a song by the popular Mexican folk band known as ""Los Tigres del Norte"" (The Northern Tigers).","District attorney's office: Sandra Avila Beltran got Botox in prison on January 10 .

"(CNN) -- Jameel Algibhah lives in the Bronx, but his wife and three daughters are in Yemen. He has not been able to see them for seven years. Awais Sajjad lives in New Jersey, but his grandmother, who raised him after his mother passed away, lives in Pakistan. He has not been able to see her for more than two years. Both long to visit their loved ones, but they cannot -- they were placed on the no-fly list years ago. Algibhah and Sajjad don't pose, have never posed and have never been accused of posing any threat to an airplane's safety. Unfortunately their stories are not uncommon. Since 9/11, the U.S. government has placed thousands of individuals on the no-fly list. They have tried to pull themselves out of this Kafkaesque web. The government has created a so-called TRIP process for challenging one's placement on the no-fly List. You fill out an online form with basic information such as your name, birthday and flight number, and wait for the standard response: The agency has completed its review, and ""no changes are warranted at this time."" But there is hope for change for people who are stuck on the list without reason: A federal court in Oregon ruled this summer that the TRIP process was unconstitutional and criticized the government for failing to provide people with a meaningful opportunity to contest their no-fly list designation. In response to the court decision, the government stated this month that it would reform the process in an ""endeavor to increase transparency."" These changes are long overdue. The no-fly list has existed for more than a decade in a shroud of secrecy with little accountability and even less oversight. And as Sajjad's and Algibhah's stories illustrate, the lack of an effective redress mechanism has had a devastating impact on individuals and their loved ones. But improving the redress process is only the first step. It is imperative also to look at the way watch listing authority is being abused. According to Algibhah and Sajjad, FBI agents privately offered an alternative option to get off the list. The FBI -- which in the post 9/11-era measures success by the number of informants it can list -- told them if they were to spy on their neighbors and community, they might get off the no-fly List. As the CLEAR project and the Center for Constitutional Rights alleged in a recent lawsuit, FBI agents repeatedly pressured Algibhah, Sajjad and two other men in this manner. ""I do not want to become an informant, but the government says I must in order to be taken off the no-fly List,"" Sajjad told us. ""How can the government tell me that the only way I can see my family again is if I turn my back on my community?"" The FBI's response to the lawsuit has been, among other things, that its agents should be immune from suit. But that agents might be able to abuse the no-fly list in this manner is no surprise. Recently, the government's internal guidelines for placing someone on the no-fly list and other watch lists were leaked to the public, revealing for the first time just how prone to abuse the secretive list can be. Two things are clear from the 166-page document: First, nearly anyone can end up on the no-fly list, as the criteria for placement are shockingly broad and ill-defined. Second, the decisions of agents who nominate people to the list are accorded a significant amount of deference. The government recently admitted in a court filing that the screening center rejected just 1% of nominations last year. The no-fly list has expanded exponentially under such permissive rules. According to documents obtained by the digital magazine The Intercept, under the Obama administration, the number of people placed on the no-fly list has shot up to 47,000 people, a tenfold increase since the President took office. No one questions the need to secure aviation safety -- but stories such as Algibhah's and Sajjad's should give us all pause. There is a need to examine seriously the way in which law enforcement agencies are so easily able to abuse a powerful tool such as the no-fly list. While creating a more robust redress mechanism is an important first step, until the rules governing placement on the no-fly list are reviewed, and officers held accountable for unlawful tactics, we will all remain vulnerable to the whims of law enforcement agents.","Writers: Two men find themselves on U.S. no-fly list for no apparent reason .

"(CNN) -- With up to 300 rainy days per year, the Faroe Islands aren't set to become the next big summer vacation spot. But the unscathed landscape, idiosyncratic architecture and a calming simplicity is attracting tourists more than ever. Situated in the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic, midway between Norway and Iceland, the 18 islands that make up the Faroes have 600 miles (965 kilometers) of roads and a population of sheep that significantly outnumbers the people. Many arrive, just like I did, with a limited knowledge of this remote archipelago. Travel guides mention the Faroe Islands only in passing. But the islands, a territory of Denmark with a total area smaller than London and just 49,000 inhabitants (and 70,000 sheep), are becoming more than a refreshment stop for travelers on their way to Iceland. As soon as I arrive, I meet Barour, an intern with the local tourist board. Over one of the most expensive beers in my life ($10 for half a pint) in a hotel bar in the capital Torshavn, he briefs me on the local must-sees. Tjornuvik is the northernmost village on the main island of Streymoy. ""From there, you'll see where the Icelandic giants hurled a rope to tow the Faroes toward their island,"" says Barour. Mythological creation . According to local myth, creatures from Iceland were so jealous of the raw beauty of the Faroes that they wanted to have the islands for themselves. But two giants that swam during the night across the ocean struggled to move the islands. When the sun rose, they turned to stone. That's how Risin and Kellingin (""The Giant"" and ""The Witch""), two sea stacks north of Eysturoy island, each about 230 feet (70 meters) tall, were created, the legend goes. Despite the comparatively small size of the Faroes, distances here appear surprisingly large and public buses run infrequently. A camper van brought across via ferry or a rental car hired locally makes traveling the islands much easier. Driving around the Faroe Islands is a thrilling experience. Smooth, often narrow, one-lane roads wind through the Middle-earth-like surroundings, making for a perfectly picturesque road trip. Such is the case with the road to Tjornuvik -- a patch carved in rock on top of a nearly vertical cliff with narrow passing bays and sheep wandering the roads. The road to Saksun, just few miles south of Tjornuvik, is less demanding, but equally unforgettable. Seven miles of gentle bends in a juicy green valley lead to a lonely church overlooking a fjord and surrounded by waterfalls. Green roofs . Scattered along these roads are many grass-roofed houses. These started life as a pragmatic solution for dwellings (see gallery), but have since become a symbol for the islands. Houses have been built like this for more than a thousand years, providing protection from rain and thermal insulation. Long hours of daylight (though rarely direct sunshine) in the summer allow for a thorough exploration of the northern Faroes. The main islands are connected by underwater tunnels and one bridge: ""The only bridge over the Atlantic Ocean,"" jokes Barour. Driving on another otherworldly road from Gjogv, known for its natural harbor in a gorge, it becomes clear that while the Faroes are a wonder for a fleeting visit, life here is difficult. As I await the never-coming dusk of the almost polar day, the beautiful islands start to feel monotonous. Lack of perspectives, loneliness and remoteness are problems for young Faroese and many leave to study abroad. But not all is bad, say those who return. ""You have close family and people to help you here, and the environment is very anti-stressful,"" says Bodil, a Faroese woman from the island of Eysturoy. Despite weather so volatile that, according to a local saying, Vivaldi could have composed ""The Four Seasons"" in one day here, the Faroes can easily enchant a tourist with their unusual beauty. Getting there . The sole carrier offering regular flights to the only Faroese airport, Atlantic Airways connects the archipelago mostly with Copenhagen and Billund in Denmark. Some flights depart to Norway and Iceland. In summer there are also rare connections to London, Barcelona and Milan. A weekly ferry is another option for those willing to endure three days on the typically rough North Sea. Dominik Sipinski is a Polish freelance writer publishing both in Polish and in English.","Faroe Islands have up to 300 rainy days a year, but the landscape gives them special appeal .

"(CNN) -- Google is jumping into its next futuristic hardware project. This time it's a modular smartphone dubbed Project Ara that can be customized by swapping out individual pieces, such as the battery and the camera. The company previewed the very early-stage project at a developer event in Santa Clara, California, this week. Google said the first version of the phone will likely be available in early 2015. Though the company didn't mention a sale price, it said the devices would cost anywhere from $50 to $500 to manufacture, depending on the model. The phone will come in three sizes, ranging from mini to ""phablet,"" and it will run on a future version of the Android mobile operating system. A frame called the Endo will hold the interchangeable components together with magnets. The idea is to allow smartphone owners to customize and update their phones on their own -- say, popping out an old battery or broken display for a new version, and thereby creating a device that lasts longer than current smartphones. Because the Ara project is open-source, the fun will be adding third-party modules or even printing your own with a 3D printer. Instead of relying on a single hardware manufacturer, people could shop around and add unusual elements made by startups, cameras produced by camera companies, or custom hardware for highly specialized work phones. The modules will be sold much like apps are now, through a custom Google online store and possibly even physical pop-up stores. An Ara device could be used for five to six years. That lengthy lifespan (for a smartphone) could cut down on electronic waste and shake up the planned obsolescence that seems common with current mobile gadgets. Instead of dropping a still-working Galaxy S4 for the S5, you could just upgrade the parts you care about, like adding a fingerprint sensor or a better camera. Project Ara is the brainchild of Google's Advanced Technology and Projects group (ATAP). When Google bought Motorola's mobile division for $2.9 billion, it also picked up ATAP, its experimental lab where employees work on futuristic projects. Google is already selling Motorola Mobility to Lenovo, but it's hanging on to ATAP and its leader, former DARPA director Regina Dugan.","Google's Project Ara is a modular smartphone that allows you to swap out pieces .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Dozens of recording stars converged on a Hollywood studio on Monday evening to add their voices to a song they hope will raise millions of dollars for Haitian earthquake relief. The lyrics and music are an updated version of ""We Are the World,"" a song that raised at least $30 millions for African humanitarian programs 25 years ago. Music legends -- including crooner Tony Bennett and Barbra Streisand -- stood with newcomers -- including 15-year-old Justin Bieber and country artist Zac Brown -- in the crowded studio Monday night. Lionel Richie and the original producer, Quincy Jones, gathered ""a diverse group of contemporary superstar artists"" at the same studio used for the 1985 recording session,"" organizers said in a news release. Richie co-wrote the first song with Michael Jackson. The production team includes producer-musician Wyclef Jean, producer RedOne and producer-musical director Ricky Minor, the statement said. The world premiere of the new ""We Are the World"" will take place during the NBC network's coverage of the Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Vancouver, Canada, on February 12, it said. Paparazzi and security surrounded Henson Studios, just off Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard, as limousines delivered the stars Monday for what was expected to be a marathon overnight recording session. Smokey Robinson, who sang on the original, said the roster of 100 singers asked to take part does not include any of the 45 stars from the previous version. Legendary crooner Tony Bennett and Beach Boy original Brian Wilson were among those seen entering the studio Monday evening. Many of the stars were already in Los Angeles to attend Sunday's Grammy Awards show. The original 1985 roster of artists was packed with such superstars that Jones placed a sign above the studio door that read: ""Check your egos at the door.""

"Kirkuk, Iraq (CNN) -- The American military footprint in the volatile northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk has all but disappeared ahead of a year-end deadline to withdraw, raising questions about the security of a small contingent of State Department employees and contractors staying behind. The questions come as Iraqi and U.S. officials welcomed what they have called in recent weeks a new phase in the American-Iraqi partnership. ""We are absolutely committed to be your partner to the extent you want us to be,"" Vice President Joe Biden told Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki during a visit last week to Iraq. ""We stand read to provide assistance."" The State Department mission in Kirkuk is one of a handful of operations that takes over where the U.S. military leaves off, and the missions together are considered one of the largest rollouts of manpower by the United States since the rebuilding efforts in Europe and Japan following World War II. The Office of Security Cooperation-Iraq, as the State Department mission is known, is taking over in some case where the military left off by providing assistance to the Iraqi government and training for the Iraqi military. At Kirkuk, the questions about security come in the wake of routine insurgent rocket attacks in the days leading up to the departure of U.S. troops. One attack resulted in the death of an American soldier and the wounding of at least four others, military officials have said. iReport: Share your stories from Iraq . During a recent town hall meeting held at the base, contractors and security personnel asked about security measures. ""Are we going to be safe?"" one woman asked Army Lt. Gen. Robert L. Caslen via a video-teleconference, which was attended by a CNN reporter and producer. She also asked Caslen if he could assure them they wouldn't be overrun. Caslen, who has been charged with overseeing OSC-I and military sales to Iraq, told the woman -- and the larger audience -- that U.S. officials will not be leaving the workers unprotected. A large private security force has been hired as part of the effort to protect the thousands of State Department workers and contractors staying behind after the January 1, 2012, withdrawal deadline. While violence has fallen off across much of Iraq, bombings and shootings remain a near-daily occurrence in Kirkuk, which is home to nearly a third of the country's oil reserves. Kirkuk is populated by ethnic Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen. Tensions among the groups run high in the city, to which the Iraqi government in Baghdad and the semi-autonomous Kurdish region have both laid claim. The meeting, held in November just days before the last U.S. troops left the compound, came as the base was undergoing a transformation. ""There is no more operations center. There are no battle captains. There are no more commanders. There are no more military titles on the base,"" Army Col. Angelo ""Tony"" Riddick told CNN during a recent interview at Camp Warrior. In fact, Riddick -- who is the military liaison for the base -- is not referred to by his rank, but rather his title, site lead for the Office of Security Cooperation-Iraq, Kirkuk. ""At any given time, a few weeks ago you would see a couple hundred soldiers moving in and out"" of the base housing area, Riddick said during the tour. ""Right now, we barely see one."" Even the name of the base is in transition. Camp Warrior, once a bustling foothold for the U.S. military, is currently known as Contingency Operating Site Kirkuk, said Frank Lands, the installation manager. The idea is to remove the U.S. military association that Iraqis and others have with the base, Lands said. ""Our mission is to support the Iraqi operations. Period. We do not have a combat mission. Period,"" Riddick told CNN. During a tour of the base, there were numerous signs that the American mission in Kirkuk -- and in Iraq, as a whole -- was changing almost overnight. The size of the base had been reduced, and the State Department mission there now refers to itself as a ""tenant of Iraq."" ""We are going to be a small tenant, a small operating cell,"" Lands said. The Iraqi air force was taking over a large portion of the base, including the air field. Civilian contractors were taking over where the military left off and training Iraqi air traffic controllers. While much of the American military presence has been wiped away at the base, a salute to fallen American troops will remain. At the center of the compound, more than a dozen giant concrete blast walls ring an area that will be used as a public gathering spot. The walls, painted black, bear the names -- in yellow paint -- of every American service member killed in Iraq. Home and Away: Coalition casualties in Afghanistan, Iraq . The name of the last American soldier killed in Kirkuk, 1st Lt. Dustin Vincent, was added to the walls just days before the troops left. ""These walls were actually located around different parts of the base,"" Riddick said, surveying the memorial that is reminiscent of the Vietnam War memorial in Washington. ""When we had a mission to close the footprint of Kirkuk, we decided to bring these walls in,"" he said. ""We are going to maintain this memorial until our mission is terminated."" CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","The U.S. State Department is taking over where the American military leaves off as it withdraws from Iraq .

"(CNN) -- They think it's all over... it is now. Britain's Queen Elizabeth II's filly Estimate came tantalizing close to defending her Gold Cup title at Ascot only to be edged out by a neck by a fast-finishing Leading Light in one of the most thrilling finishes in Gold Cup history. A superb ride by Joseph O'Brien on Leading Light ensured that Estimate's jockey, Ryan Moore, did not have things all his own way as they rounded the final bend. The two-and-half mile race came down to a sprint finish between Leading Light, Estimate, and Irish raider Missunited, who clung on to finish third, having made all the running. Also bidding to spoil to the royal party was Brown Panther, owned by former England footballer Michael Owen. He held on gamely to finish fourth. It's not often you see two national treasures go head-to-head at Royal Ascot, but Owen himself is popular figure in the paddock these days, having enjoyed a successful second career as an owner and breeder. Day three of Ascot is also Ladies' Day, which is always guaranteed to provide a glittering array of frocks and hats. The Queen herself, who was wearing blue, was gracious in defeat, presenting the trophy to the winning owners. ""It was tremendous and the Queen got such pleasure out of it.,"" said John Warren, her racing manager, of Estimate's performance. ""To see her put in such a brave effort like that was tremendous. It was a career best. She ran as good as you could ever hope."" Estimate's trainer Sir Michael Stoute added: ""It was a great run and I'm very proud of her."" Missunited's trainer Michael Winters was also pleased with his runner: ""She's run her heart out and jockey Jim Crowley has given her a peach of a ride,"" he told reporters. ""There was a moment down the back straight when I thought she might have given them the slip but it was a super run and a great ride."" Leading Light's victory made it a double on the day for the O'Brien camp, as the trainer and his son had earlier opened their account with Bracelet in the Ribblesdale Stakes. Unusually, the 10/1 shot was the pair's first winner of the week. ""We're delighted to get a winner,"" conceded her trainer. ""She's traveled and quickened well off a nice even pace,"" added her jockey. Earlier in the day, Baitha Alga struck in the Norfolk Stakes to give Frankie Dettori his 49th winner at the Royal Meeting. ""I'm nearly there,"" exclaimed Dettori of his looming half century. ""It was a great performance. He's hard as nails and uncomplicated - everything you want in a two-year-old. ""I just had to do the right thing, get into the race and use his turn of foot,"" added Dettori, who celebrated the win with his trademark flying dismount. There was another milestone for Stoute as victory for Cannock Chase in the Tercentenary Stakes gave the trainer his 70th Royal Ascot victory, making him the most successful living trainer at the meeting.","Leading Light wins thrilling Gold Cup .

"(CNN) -- As a business decision, America Online's recent announcement that it was planning to pull back its employee 401(k) matching program to save money was not a surprise. It is common practice for U.S. companies to lay off workers, reduce hours, and cut benefits to look more attractive to shareholders, even while posting record profits. Last year's decisions by ESPN, Kellogg, and General Electric illustrate how layoffs are part of corporate growth strategies. Usually, layoffs are blamed on uncertainty, the need for efficiency, or the sluggish economy. The surprise was when he announced the change, AOL's chief executive Tim Armstrong had placed blame for the cuts on Obamacare, which he says would cost the company $7 million, and two female employees with ""distressed babies"" that cost $2 million in 2012. However, after staff and public outcry, Armstrong saw the light and said his company would reverse its decision to dole out its matching funds to employees' contributions in one lump sum at the end of the year, rather than match contributions in each paycheck. Here's why two newborns and the costs of Obamacare were very unlikely reasons that AOL would have to change its 401(k) program to save money: . Health care costs are unpredictable for everyone, not just new moms. After all, a healthy, single man can break his leg or be diagnosed with cancer at any time. Patients with expensive health care needs one year are not guaranteed to spend a lot on health care in the following year -- and anyone could have a health emergency at some point. That's why we buy health insurance: to protect ourselves against an unpredictable and potentially devastating event. A large company like AOL is better able to spread the risk across all employees because it has many workers, most of whom are in good health. Rather than allow employees to sign up for various insurance plans through multiple companies, AOL is self-funded. That means it pays all claims directly, with a third-party administrator managing the business processes. Companies like AOL that self-fund their health benefits typically buy reinsurance policies to protect them from any exorbitant, unexpected claims. In addition, AOL employees are required to pay both a share of their insurance premiums and up to $6,000 per family in out-of-pocket costs, which means they are already paying a significant share of health-care spending increases. So two new moms and their newborns are merely a convenient excuse that companies like AOL can use to cut costs to benefit their shareholders and executives' wallets. And why did Armstrong blame ObamaCare? The Affordable Care Act does include fees for insurers and third-party administrators to help fund efforts to stabilize the individual and small group insurance markets. In 2014, AOL may need to pay just up to $63 per year per insured employee. But because AOL offers comprehensive coverage to its employees, it would not be subject to the penalties that apply to larger employers that do not provide affordable coverage to their full-time employees, starting in 2015. Employers cannot blame the president for unpredictable health care costs either. In the past four years, the rate of national health care spending growth slowed substantially to less than 4% per year -- half the growth rate of the previous four decades. Although it's convenient for employers to blame Obamacare for any instability or changes to health-care spending, the fact remains that the cost of maternity or other benefits spread over a large insured population is minimal. In a 2011 report, the California Health Benefits Review Program found that adding a requirement to cover maternity services to individual insurance plans would result in just a 0.52% increase in spending. Blaming two new mothers for these sweeping benefit cuts was an awful way to treat employees who are already facing the worst of all possible scenarios: a very sick child. It's a mistake Armstrong should never make again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dylan Roby .","AOL blamed 401(k) changes on cost of Obamacare and two sick newborns .

"(CNN) -- A polo handicap, it has been said, is a passport to the world -- and this has certainly proved true in my case. I first took up polo eight years ago on a trip to Argentina. It has long been my philosophy that no hour of life is wasted that is spent in the saddle, and I have dabbled in equestrian sports ranging from eventing to flat racing. But few sports can match the all-consuming thrill of galloping up and down a 300 by 160 yard field waving a big stick. From my very first chukka I was, as the pun goes, 'hooked'. Argentina has been polo's spiritual home since British and Irish engineers introduced the sport in the late 19th century. There, it found fertile soil among the gauchos (Argentinian cowboys) and their brave, nimble horses. Today, several estancia (private estates) throughout Argentina offer fully-immersive polo holidays, to which new entrants to the sport flock like pilgrims to the holy land. There, beginners can learn how to ride one-handed, swing a mallet and swear in Spanish. The attraction of polo is easy to understand. From Jilly Cooper to Pretty Woman, polo has been used as shorthand to suggest a glamorous, dangerous world of sleek horses and brooding players. Traveling at speeds of up to 60 kilometers-per-hour (37 mph), teams of four aim to drive the ball through a set of vertical posts to score a goal. Like all equestrian sports, men and women compete side-by-side, making it the only mixed sport which is also a contact sport: players can 'ride off' opponents by using their mount to barge the other player out of the way. Around 3,000 people in the UK currently play polo, of which fewer than 10% are professionals, according to the Hurlingham Polo Association, the governing body for polo in the UK. I am firmly in the amateur camp, brandishing a -1 handicap which has shown no signs of budging off its mark for several years. Polo players are rated on a scale of -2 to 10 according to their skill, where 10 is the highest rating possible. Although expressed in 'goals', a player's handicap is not an estimate of the number of goals a player might score in a given match, but rather an overall measure of his or her horsemanship, skill and strategy. It is so difficult to reach 10 there have never been more than a dozen or so 10-goalers in the world at any time. Almost all 10-goalers, past and present, have hailed from Argentina. One of these highly acclaimed individuals is 28-year-old Facundo Pieres. Having held the ultimate ranking since the age of 19, Pieres is now ranked inside the top two in the world (he disputes the number one spot with fellow Argentinian Adolfo Cambiaso). During the English high-goal season, Pieres plays for the all-conquering Zacara team (which won the coveted Queen's Cup this weekend). He gamely agreed to coach me and give me some pointers. The venue is Zacara's private training facility, on a pitch so immaculate it would not look out of place at the Chelsea Flower Show. As I prepare to take to the field I ask Pieres what he thinks is the most important quality in a player. Unsurprisingly, he cites horsemanship: ""It's all about feeling comfortable,"" he says. ""If you don't feel comfortable on the horse you will not be able to hit the ball."" So far, so good. Magnifica, the 8-year-old mare Pieres has lent me, is a dream to ride, with a canter as smooth as silk and the ability to turn on a sixpence. ""She is one of the best ponies I have,"" says Pieres. ""Anyone can play her."" Subtext: even me! (Polo horses are still referred to as ponies, an alliterative hangover from the days when height limits applied). ""The next most important thing to have is a straight, fluid swing,"" continues Pieres. He can loft the ball in excess of 100 yards while traveling at a flat-out gallop. My shots have a tendency to dribble weakly for 10 or so yards before coming to rest in a divot. Pieres and I do have something in common, however. We both like to play in attack. ""My first instinct is always to attack and not to defend,"" he explains. Polo teams are divided into four positions on the field, designated by numbers. Players 1 and 2 are attackers, 3 is a playmaker and 4, or Back, is a defender. Pieres and I both play at Number 1. ""I play forward. I am always working out how to get the ball and attack all the time."" Here the similarities end, because my strategy is usually to hang out by the goal and wait for the ball to land in front of me. The final piece of the puzzle is, of course, practice. ""When you practice, you will get better and you will feel more confident with every shot.,"" he explains. As a plucky amateur, finding time to practice is certainly my biggest challenge, even without the English weather conspiring against me. So how does my instructor rate my performance? ""You're a -1 but you're getting close to 0,"" he enthuses, almost convincingly. Pieres is, of course, being far too generous. We both know that I won't be pulling on the famous black and white of Zacara any time soon. But I have polished my boots just in case.","Polo is often considered a past time of the rich and famous .

"Washington (CNN) -- Is bipartisanship in Washington really dead? Not for a pair of junior senators from different parties who flew to the other side of the world to see whether they could experience across-the-aisle cooperation by living for a week on a deserted island with almost no provisions. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, and Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-New Mexico, came back to the Capitol from their survivalist adventure in the Marshall Islands last month -- which was shot for an upcoming Discovery channel special -- poking fun at each other like best friends and finishing each others' sentences like brothers. ""All of a sudden he thought he was part of the Screen Actors Guild,"" Flake joshed. ""Five o'clock. No more fishing."" ""20 hour limit to the day,"" Heinrich deadpanned. They stood for an impromptu session with a small group of reporters Thursday, after stepping off the Senate floor where they had voted, perhaps not surprisingly, opposite one another on a campaign finance bill. They said the idea for the trip was sparked a year ago during a late-night series of floor votes where they compared past trips each had taken to spear fish. ""Jeff had his iPad and showed me some pictures of the last trip he did with his kids. Then I started to show him pictures of fish I had speared on various trips,"" said Heinrich. ""He speared bigger fish than I had,"" Flake said. ""So I thought ..."" ""Hey, there might be some value here,"" Heinrich interjected, completing Flake's thought. Flake knew what he needed because he has some previous survivalist experience. A year ago, he and his sons spent a week on a similar deserted island. Discovery allowed them to take only three provisions on the sandy atoll but the senators refused to say what they were -- ""tune in,"" they responded in unison. But they had clothes. ""That was a nonstarter,"" Flake said. ""We were afraid but not naked."" Asked what skill the other person had for which they were grateful, Flake said, ""I'm glad Martin's the engineer type. Because I wouldn't have known how to put together a shelter."" ""He opens coconuts with a machete faster than anyone I've ever seen,"" Heinrich responded. ""That came in handy because that's all we had to drink for a long time,"" Flake replied. They were asked whether they think the trip will open doors for them to work together in the future, and they seemed upbeat. ""I think what's missing most around here is trust, and that's mostly because people don't know each other very well,"" Heinrich said. ""I think you need to know each other before you can figure out where you can work together."" Flake said they considered bringing their own GoPro cameras and documenting the trips themselves but then thought Discovery might do a better job. Discovery ""convinced us that if this is to have some value in terms of promoting bipartisanship and trust, it's better for people to see and hear the dialogue between us,"" he explained. Asked whether there were any tensions between the men, Heinrich acknowledged ""it was pretty stressful."" ""This was not a resort experience,"" he said. ""It was competitive,"" Flake said.","Sen.

"(CNN) -- The first time, it happened almost by accident. Just hours after delivery, a baby born with HIV in Mississippi was given high doses of three antiretroviral drugs. More than three years later, doctors say the little girl has no evidence of the life-threatening disease in her blood, despite being off medication for nearly two years. Now doctors say another child born with the virus appears to be free of HIV after receiving similar treatment. The case report was presented at the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Boston this week. The girl was delivered at Miller Children's Hospital in Long Beach, California, last summer to a mother with HIV who had not received antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy. Doctors gave the baby high doses of three drugs -- AZT, 3TC and Nevirapine -- four hours after birth. Eleven days later, the virus was undetectable in her body and remained undetectable eight months later. The California baby is still on antiretroviral treatment, so it's too soon to tell if the child is actually in remission. ""Taking kids off antiretroviral therapy intentionally is not standard of care,"" said Dr. Deborah Persaud, a virologist with Johns Hopkins Children's Center who has been involved in both cases. ""At this time, there is no plan to stop treatment."" While doctors around the world are trying to duplicate the Mississippi case, more research needs to be done before new standards are implemented for treating babies born with HIV. ""This has to be done in a clinical trial setting, because really the only way we can prove that we've accomplished remission in these cases is by taking them off treatment, and that's not without risks,"" Persaud said during her presentation at the conference. A clinical trial designed to test the effectiveness of early treatment on infants born to HIV-positive mothers is set to begin in the next couple of months, she said. Infants will be started on a combination of antiretroviral therapy within 48 hours of birth and followed ""for an extended period of time to determine if the virus can be eradicated from their bodies,"" according to the National Institutes of Health. The results could be a game changer in the fight against AIDS. Timeline: AIDS moments to remember . The Mississippi baby . The child in Mississippi was born to a mother who received no prenatal care and was not diagnosed as HIV-positive herself until just before delivery, according to a case report published in October in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers: Toddler cured of HIV . ""We didn't have the opportunity to treat the mom during the pregnancy as we would like to be able to do, to prevent transmission to the baby,"" said Dr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Doctors administered the antiretroviral drugs 30 hours after the girl was born in hopes of controlling the virus. Within a couple of days, Gay confirmed the child was HIV-positive. She said the baby had probably been infected in the womb. The child remained on antiretroviral drugs for approximately 15 months. Her mother then stopped administering the drug for some reason, Gay said. In March 2013, researchers announced that the girl was the first child to be ""functionally cured"" of HIV. A ""functional cure"" is when the presence of the virus is so small, lifelong treatment is not necessary and standard clinical tests cannot detect the virus in the blood. Gay told CNN the timing of intervention -- before the baby's HIV diagnosis -- may deserve ""more emphasis than the particular drugs or number of drugs used."" The researchers believe ""the very early therapy is blocking the spread of HIV into viral reservoirs that hold the virus for a lifetime,"" Persaud explained. High-risk exposure . Researchers have long known that treating HIV-positive mothers early on is important, because they pass antibodies on to their babies. All HIV-positive moms will pass on those antibodies, but only 30% will transmit the actual virus, said Dr. Katherine Luzuriaga, an immunologist at the University of Massachusetts who worked closely with Gay. And HIV-positive mothers who are given appropriate treatment pass on the virus in less than 2% of cases. ""So all babies are born antibody-positive, but only a fraction of babies born to HIV-positive women will actually get the virus, and that fraction depends on whether the mom and baby are getting antiviral prophylaxis (preventive treatment) or not."" Newborns are considered high-risk if their mothers' HIV infections are not under control or if the mothers are found to be HIV-positive when they're close to delivering. Usually, these infants would get antiviral drugs at preventive doses for six weeks to prevent infection, then start antiretroviral therapy, or ART, if HIV is diagnosed. ART is a combination of at least three drugs used to suppress the virus and stop the progression of the disease. But they do not kill the virus. Tests showed the virus in the Mississippi baby's blood continued to decrease and reached undetectable levels within 29 days of the initial treatment. HIV may be 'functionally cured' in some . The 'Berlin patient' Researchers say the only other documented case of an HIV cure is that of Timothy Brown, known as the ""Berlin patient."" In 2007, Brown, an HIV-positive American living in Germany, was battling both leukemia and HIV when he underwent a bone marrow transplant that cured not only his cancer but his HIV. In an interview last year, Brown told Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, that he was still HIV-free. ""I've been tested everywhere possible,"" said Brown, who now lives in San Francisco. ""My blood's been tested by many, many agencies. I've had two colonoscopies to test to see if they could find HIV in my colon, and they haven't been able to find any."" But Brown's case is apparently unique. And the procedure, which is extremely dangerous, won't work in most patients because the bone marrow he received had a special genetic mutation that made the stem cells in it naturally resistant to the virus. Researchers tell CNN only 1% of Caucasians -- mostly Northern Europeans -- and no African-Americans or Asians have this particular mutation. In June, five years after he was ""cured,"" reports surfaced that ""traces"" of the virus had been found in Brown's blood. Even then, some HIV experts said that doesn't matter, that he's been cured. In fact, many AIDS experts said they believe Brown has experienced what's called a ""sterilizing"" cure, meaning the virus has been eliminated from the body entirely. In July, Boston researchers said two HIV patients showed no sign of the virus in their blood following bone marrow transplants. However, researcher Dr. Timothy Henrich said in December that the virus had returned.","Baby born with HIV in California appears to be free of the virus .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- At its worst, Melissa Miller's blood pressure measured 153 over 95, dangerously high for anyone, never mind a woman who is 36 weeks pregnant. Melissa Miller, put on bed rest because of preeclampsia, prepares for a doctor-ordered Caesarean section. Miller, 29 of Atlanta, Georgia, had preeclampsia, otherwise known as pregnancy-induced hypertension. It occurs in up to 8 percent of all pregnancies in the United States during the second and third trimesters. The only cure is delivery of the baby. As Miller was prepped for a doctor-ordered Caesarean section, she explained this wasn't the first time she has battled the disease. ""In my first pregnancy, I had preeclampsia too,"" Miller said. ""I delivered at 23 weeks."" The child is fine now, but Miller learned about the disease the hard way. ""Preeclampsia is one of the most serious pregnancy complications,"" said Dr. Lillian Schapiro, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Atlanta's Piedmont Hospital. ""It can lead to maternal death if we don't catch it early enough."" Doctors usually catch the symptoms during regular prenatal checkups. They include blood pressure higher than 140 over 90, severe headaches usually in the back of the head, swelling in the hands and face, upper abdominal pain, nausea and sudden weight gain.  Watch more on the dangerous condition preeclampsia. » . Some of the symptoms such as swelling and nausea occur in normal pregnancies, but Schapiro said a doctor can tell the difference by checking a patient's blood pressure and measuring protein in the urine. She warns pregnant women, ""If you start having an unusual headache, call your doctor. If you're concerned about swelling, call your doctor."" Doctors report most women with preeclampsia, which used to be called toxemia, go on to deliver healthy babies and recover just fine. Left untreated, preeclampsia can lead to eclampsia. Women can develop seizures, which can result in strokes. The condition can often be managed by placing a pregnant woman on bed rest. For many patients, it's an effective treatment that lowers the blood pressure and increases blood flow to the placenta, allowing the fetus to further develop. Schapiro ordered Miller to bed about a week before her delivery. ""Bed rest helps tremendously,"" the doctor said. ""It's really the only thing we have to treat early preeclampsia."" The exact cause of preeclampsia is unknown, but doctors do know what increases a woman's risk -- including both extremes of the age range. ""Typically it is patients who are young, and patients who are older,"" according to Atlanta-based obstetrician-gynecologist Michael Randell. He also said the risk of developing preeclampsia is highest during a first pregnancy and among those carrying twins, triplets or other multiples. Women with a history of high blood pressure and diabetes are also at risk, as are those moms-to-be who are obese. Miller described herself as overweight during her first pregnancy three years ago. She developed preeclampsia early on and was forced to deliver her son a little over halfway through her pregnancy. The experience was frightening, but Miller learned some lessons that she has applied to her second pregnancy. ""I was more cautious because I knew what to look for and I knew that the doctors were monitoring me very closely."" Melissa delivered her baby a month early at the end of February. While she went home after a couple of days, the baby remained in the hospital. E-mail to a friend . Judy Fortin is a correspondent with CNN Medical News.

"(CNN) -- Sigh. For the last month, I've been telling you about politics in Hawaii, the state that had the lowest voter turnout rate in the nation four years ago. The goal of me typing and typing and typing about the state's voters was the hope that CNN could start a conversation that maybe -- just maybe -- would lead to the state magically bouncing out of last place. It's now the morning after Election Day. And while it's still unclear whether Hawaii will finish last place for voting, preliminary estimates do offer a ray of hope. According to Michael McDonald, an election results guru at George Mason University, Hawaii likely will slip past West Virginia, handing over the title of the ""state that doesn't vote."" It feels too early and too odd to celebrate, though, especially given the calamity that ensued in Hawaii on Tuesday. I'll get to that soon. First, let's look at the numbers. Nationally, voter turnout was down compared to the 2008 presidential election -- with something like 60% of the nation's eligible voters casting ballots for president this year, McDonald said, compared to 62% four years ago. You could argue several reasons why that's the case, from Superstorm Sandy, which depressed turnout in the northeast, to lower-than-expected enthusiasm among Republicans. Not all of the ballots have been counted, but based on projections from McDonald, Hawaii's turnout rate may land in the ballpark of 46.9%. He expects West Virginia's turnout to be slightly lower, at 46.1%. ""It really is a race to the bottom right now,"" he said. ""We would be in a recount situation if this were a presidential election,"" he said by phone on Wednesday morning. ""It's close enough we need to wait to see what the final reports are, but in this case Hawaii has sort of staked out a lead here and it would be unlikely for West Virginia to come from behind. But it's possible."" Voter turnout rates in both states sunk compared to 2008, when 48.8% of eligible people in Hawaii voted in the presidential race, and 49.9% of people in West Virginia did. It's too easy to strike up those low turnout rates to apathy. A story headlined ""Hawaii voter turnout drops even lower"" on the Honolulu news site Civil Beat suggested that voters in the Aloha State are too checked-out to care. ""Hot races including a tight contest involving our own homegrown presidential contender couldn't shake Hawaii voters' continued apathy toward elections,"" wrote Alia Wong. I can see where she's coming from. But I think the assessment that Hawaii's (or West Virginia's) voter turnout rate is attributable simply to apathy is at best, reductive. At worst, offensive. Superstorm Sandy pummeled West Virginia one week ago, no doubt decreasing the likelihood that people would trudge out to the polls. And in Hawaii, as Wong goes on to explain, several polling places ran out of ballots, leaving long lines of voters to wait for elections officials to bring in electronic voting machines. Wong references an official from Hawaii's Green Party who says, in her words, the ballot shortage ""deterred hundreds of people from casting their ballots."" That should infuriate any American, especially since similar issues reportedly plagued voters in other states on Tuesday. ""We can appreciate that people lose patience with the process, and we're very sorry it occurred,"" a spokesman for Hawaii's election office told Civil Beat. I'm going to pretend it's Election Day 2000 and settle into a wait-and-see mode before I give any kind of final-seeming assessment of voter turnout in Hawaii. For one, ballots are still being counted, particularly those sent by mail. I also want to talk to people in the state about what happened at the polls -- why, exactly, some precincts ran out of ballots, and what people there think about the situation. McDonald, the voting guru, expects Hawaii to hop out of last place despite the fact that its turnout, like that for the rest of the country, declined. ""Woohoo,"" he said, sarcastically. Given polling place issues in the state and the fact that there are potentially hundreds of disenfranchised voters on the island of Oahu, it's hard for me to summon much enthusiasm, either. Still, and no matter the outcome, I'm immensely proud of nonpartisan groups like Kanu Hawaii that go door to door in low-voting areas and encourage people to cast ballots. They're the ones who are going to change attitudes toward voting in Hawaii. And in the long term, they're the ones who will change the list.","Hawaii may rank 49th for voter turnout this year; instead of 50th .

"(Health.com) -- You've been told a trillion times not to buy produce out of season. But that doesn't mean you have to skip the fruits you love this time of year. It's just a matter of knowing which version is the healthiest and tastiest. ""In the winter, frozen or dried options may have a leg up over fresh when it comes to flavor and nutrition,"" says Elizabeth Somer, R.D., author of ""Eat Your Way Sexy"". In other cases, fresh is still the way to go. Here's your guide to making the best picks now. Blueberries . Buy 'em: Frozen . Frozen blueberries are typically the petite wild version, which have been found by scientists to contain more disease-thwarting antioxidants than their traditionally cultivated counterparts (the type you're most likely to find fresh right now). Also, fresh blueberries are pricey in winter and, if trucked in from afar, can go moldy fast. Health.com: The best superfoods for weight loss . Apples . Buy 'em: Fresh . Apples are a top-notch source of quercetin, an antioxidant shown to slash the risk for certain cancers. And quercetin levels in a fresh apple hold up even if it was picked months ago and put into cold storage until the winter, a ""Nutrition Journal"" study suggests. Nearly all of the fruit's quercetin and half its fiber is found in the peel -- which you'll get with fresh apples but usually not with dried. (Opt for certified organic, if possible, to avoid pesticides on the fruit's exterior.) Health.com: 10 healthy apple pie and cake recipes . Peaches . Buy 'em: Frozen . When it comes to juicy goodness, winter peaches from South America are mere shadows of the fresh, locally sourced summer version. They're also about twice the price. They're not as good for you, either: ""Peaches can lose a considerable amount of their nutrients, including potassium, during multi-country shipping,"" says Cynthia Sass, R.D., author of ""Cinch! Conquer Cravings, Drop Pounds and Lose Inches"". Frozen peaches, on the other hand, are harvested at peak ripeness and quickly flash-frozen to lock in vitamins, antioxidants, and flavor. Health.com: Vitamins: what to take, what to skip . Strawberries . Buy 'em: Fresh . Fresh or frozen, strawberries are a leading source of vitamin C, but let's face it: The texture of frozen strawberries leaves something to be desired. What's more, compared to other berries, fresh strawberries remain reasonably priced throughout the winter. Consider splurging on organic, though, since conventionally grown strawberries contain some of the highest pesticide levels of any fruit, according to the Environmental Working Group. Health.com: 11 things it's best to buy organic . Plums . Buy 'em: Dried . By the time winter plums find their way to the U.S. (from as far away as South America) and potentially sit on store shelves for days, they often have yucky soft spots. Meanwhile, ounce for ounce, dried plums (you know them as prunes) pack five times the fiber and vitamin K -- a nutrient necessary for proper blood clotting -- as the fresh kind. Eating prunes can also bolster bone strength, researchers at Florida State University have found. Health.com: Foods for healthy bones . Cherries . Buy 'em: Dried . Sweet Bing cherries are highly susceptible to bruising during international winter shipping, and your wallet may be bruised by their high winter price. They also lag behind tart cherries -- the version most often found dried -- in levels of vitamin C and beta-carotene. ""Beta-carotene is a building block for vitamin A, so it helps maintain healthy skin, bones, and immunity,"" Somer says. Removing the moisture also makes dried tart cherries particularly concentrated in anthocyanins, which are potent antioxidants, she adds.

"(CNN) -- Each summer, more than 50,000 people pour into a cobblestone square in Tuscany for a gut-wrenching 90-seconds. That's all it takes for the flamboyantly dressed jockeys of Italy's legendary horse race -- Palio di Siena -- to race bareback around the medieval square. It's been called the ""most dangerous horse race in the world"" -- about as far away as you can get from the genteel green lawns of Britain's Royal Ascot or the multimillion prize money bestowed on America's Kentucky Derby. Now as the dust settles on this year's colorful Palio di Siena, CNN takes a look at five weird and wonderful horse festivals from across the world. Palio di Siena, Italy . On two days each year, the pretty town of Siena in northern Tuscany is transformed into an elaborate medieval race track, with 10 riders careering around the iconic city square three times. Dating back to the 17th century, each rider represents their local neighborhood, competing not just for the coveted victory banner -- but good luck for the coming year. Luminarias Festival, Spain . Fire and horses may seem like an unlikely combination, but that's exactly the dramatic scene which takes place in a small town in central Spain each year. Horse are ridden over blazing tree branches as part of the Luminaries Festival in San Bartolome de Pinares, in an effort to purify and protect the animals. The controversial tradition, which has been criticized by animal welfare groups, dates back 500 years and is held on the eve of Saint Anthony's Day. Watch: From camel racing to prized jockey . White Turf, Switzerland . From fiery Spain to snowy Switzerland -- there's not a bonfire in sight at the glitzy White Turf racing carnival, held on the frozen Lake St Moritz. The remarkable competition includes skijoring, where horses thunder around the icy track while their riders hold on for dear life to a harness at the back, trailing behind on skis. In such extreme weather -- around -20C -- fur coats are the order of the day for the champagne-sipping spectators who are perhaps better known for their luxury lifestyles than racing tips. Pasola Festival, Indonesia . The glitz and glam of snow-capped St Moritz couldn't be further from the spear-wielding horsemen of Indonesia's annual Pasola Festival. The fierce festival -- held on the island of Sumba -- sees two teams go head-to-head on elaborately decorated horses, throwing blunt spears at each other as part of an ancient ritual battle. It is believed that every drop of blood spilled will bring a good harvest. Soma-Nomaoi Festival, Japan . If you like your ancient festivals a little less violent, there's the 1,000-year-old Soma-Nomaoi wild horse chase in central Japan. The three-day festival sees samurai horsemen compete in different challenges -- from racing over a one kilometer track to battling over sacred flags. Dressed in extravagant armor, helmets, and carrying swords, the fantastical warriors appear to have stepped straight out from the 10th Century.","As the dust settles on Italy's Palio de Siena, CNN looks at wild horse festivals .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A number of atheists and non-religious organizations want Barack Obama's inauguration ceremony to leave out all references to God and religion. President-elect Barack Obama will use the Bible Abraham Lincoln used for his inauguration. In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Washington, the plaintiffs demand that the words ""so help me God"" not be added to the end of the president's oath of office. In addition, the lawsuit objects to plans for ministers to deliver an invocation and a benediction in which they may discuss God and religion. An advance copy of the lawsuit was posted online by Michael Newdow, a California doctor and lawyer who has filed similar and unsuccessful suits over inauguration ceremonies in 2001 and 2005. Joining Newdow in the suit are groups advocating religious freedom or atheism, including the American Humanist Association, the Freedom from Religion Foundation and atheist groups from Minnesota; Seattle, Washington; and Florida. The new lawsuit says in part, ""There can be no purpose for placing 'so help me God' in an oath or sponsoring prayers to God, other than promoting the particular point of view that God exists."" Newdow said references to God during inauguration ceremonies violate the Constitution's ban on the establishment of religion. Newdow and other plaintiffs say they want to watch the inaugural either in person or on television. As atheists, they contend, having to watch a ceremony with religious components will make them feel excluded and stigmatized. ""Plaintiffs are placed in the untenable position of having to choose between not watching the presidential inauguration or being forced to countenance endorsements of purely religious notions that they expressly deny,"" according to the lawsuit. Among those named in the lawsuit are Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts, who is expected to swear in the new president; the Presidential Inauguration Committee; the Joint Congressional Committee on Inauguration Ceremonies and its chairwoman, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California; and the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee and its commander, Maj. Gen.

The document includes a quotation from Warren on atheists: ""I could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says, 'I don't need God.' "" Newdow told CNN that he didn't name President-elect Barack Obama in the suit because in addition to participating as a government official at the ceremony, he possesses rights as an individual that allow him to express religious beliefs. ""If he chooses to ask for God's help, I'm not going to challenge him,"" Newdow said. ""I think it's unwise."" Newdow said that as a member of a racial minority, Obama should have respect for atheists, who also are members of a minority. Newdow said religious references in the inauguration ceremony send a message to non-believers. ""The message here is, we who believe in God are the righteous, the real Americans,"" he said. Newdow said it's unconstitutional to imply that atheists and others are not as good. He acknowledged that his suit is unlikely to be successful. ""I have no doubt I'll lose,"" he said, adding that he hoped to eventually succeed through appeals and hoped future inauguration ceremonies would exclude religious references.","Atheists want references to religion removed from inaugural ceremony .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Robert Plant and Alison Krauss. Once upon a time, the iconic lead singer of Led Zeppelin and the golden girl of bluegrass would never have been mentioned in the same sentence. Alison Krauss and Robert Plant's ""Raising Sand"" was an unlikely collaboration that won five Grammys. But since they won five Grammy awards -- including album of the year for their surprising collaboration, ""Raising Sand"" -- their names have been inextricably linked: RobertPlantandAlisonKrauss. If they were 20 years old and ran in Hollywood circles, tabloids might be calling them Robekrauss or Aliplant. Plant, however, is 60 -- in fantastic shape, and with a full head of the golden ringlets that became his trademark during the 1970s. At 37, Krauss is elegant and ethereal. And while both are dead serious when talking about their craft, the rest of the time, they're like two silly junior high kids -- he, the charming prankster with a secret crush, and she, the beautiful prom queen who pretends not to be amused. Clearly, they're both having the time of their lives, and are excited about their current musical journey -- which pushes each out of their respective comfort zones and into new territory. Now, he's a little bit country and she's a little bit rock 'n' roll.  Watch Plant and Krauss rib each other » . I compliment Krauss on her hair as a stylist touches her up. ""It's not mine,"" she whispers. Two feet away, Plant clears his throat loudly and points to his own golden locks. ""Why, your hair looks lovely, too, Robert,"" I say. ""Well, you know who I am,"" he replies. We are in Coldplay's vacated dressing room, two nights before Plant and Krauss swept the evening at the 51st annual Grammy Awards. This is an excerpt from our conversation in the basement of Staples Center in Los Angeles the night of their rehearsal. CNN: First of all, this is the screwiest collaboration I had ever heard of. How did this happen? Robert Plant: It's just sheer luck, really. I never sang with anybody before, you know -- only once ever in my life, on ""Led Zep IV"" with Sandy Denny [the late English folk singer, in 1971]. So this is a whole new thing. I've also been coming to the United States for 40 years -- you wouldn't believe it looking at me -- and I've never worked with Americans! This is all brand new for me. Alison Krauss: Were we both nervous? We both were. We thought, ""What are we going to do in there?"" We went into the studio originally saying, ""We'll give it three days and see what it's like."" Plant: Alison's reputation is 24 karat, and I'm an old rock 'n' roll singer. Even the band was kind of going, ""Oh wow, how is this going to work?"" It was great when we kicked in together, and I could just feel the room -- I don't want to say it, but the room lifted! CNN: Musically, you're polar opposites. How did you blend your different perspectives? Plant: As we got started, it was Alison's world. She knew how she wanted to proceed, and we exchanged a lot of ideas musically. And then we both agreed that because we both produced records ourselves, that we needed an intermediary to guide -- somebody to separate us, or to make the journey more clear. And Alison knew T Bone Burnett from ""O Brother, Where Art Thou,"" and he kindly enlisted for the gig, and he brought a lot of great songs to the show. CNN: You challenged one another to sing in different ways than you're used to. Plant: When she goes up for these wailing notes on stage, that's where I want her to go with this new project -- occasionally visit these places where she lets rip, and just lets it really come out. Krauss (melodramatically): It's just reckless abandon! It's just crazy! Plant: I don't know why I'm being so serious. She just kicks ass and nobody knew it! CNN: Now this is all making sense. With Alison, it's letting go, and with you, Robert, it's kind of containing things. Plant: I'm being bullied, basically. Pushed around. CNN: But you like it. Admit it, you love it. Plant: Oh, I do! I haven't even gotten off to being bullied enough yet. CNN: Did you have this much fun working with Zeppelin? Plant: I can't remember. Honestly, I haven't got a clue. I was a totally different guy then. It was 28 years ago. I didn't look as good as I do now, and I didn't share the couch with another Leo. CNN: Alison, did you listen to Led Zeppelin growing up? Krauss: We all have, yeah. (Plant is shaking his head and mouthing the word ""No."") My brother was and is such a huge fan of the band, and I remember growing up and he would be in his bedroom yelling about the records and how great they were. CNN: Robert, were you familiar with Alison's work? Plant: Yeah, to some degree, but not as intensely as I became. And also, I didn't understand the history of where Alison's from [bluegrass], and has been since she was a child. In fact, both of us can sit there talking about music, and neither of us can recognize the artists we're referring to. It's amazing. I mean, all the rock 'n' roll, and black Mississippi and Chicago stuff that I go raving on about, she's going, ""Hmm."" Krauss: I didn't grow up on that, yeah. CNN: Has he made you listen to his music collection? Plant: We share. Krauss: I bring bluegrass. It's the same people. Same blue-collar people. Just one was south of the Delta, and one was Virginia and Tennessee and North Carolina. So we've got lots in common -- but it's the presentation and the whole musicality of it that's different. CNN: Your collaboration has worked out so well that you're back in the studio in Nashville, working on a second album together. Plant: We'd like to keep it going. CNN: Do you think there's going to be an album No. 3, and an album No. 4? Plant: I'd have to move to Nashville, wouldn't I? CNN: Or she moves to England. Plant (to Krauss): Could you stand the climate? Krauss: I'll get a heating pad. Plant: And a season ticket for Wolverhampton Wanderers football club. That's important. CNN: You gained a lot of fans with this project, but there are those Led Zeppelin diehards who've been holding their breath for a reunion tour -- especially since you reunited for the Ahmet Ertegun tribute concert at Wembley in 2007. Plant: Well, we had a really good night, and we had great rehearsals, and it was very emotional -- and if you like, quite elevating. But it was the right thing to do to do it that way. There's no bandwagon. We've already been around the world, and did what we did when we were young men. CNN: That sounds like a man who's looking forward, and not back. Plant: Only last week, I was being grilled again by Alison to get into shape and get it right. And that's fantastic! I really want that. I don't want to go around, everybody thinking, ""That's what he did."" Because this is what I do, and every day, it should be more interesting. CNN: And in the meantime, you've been recognized by the Grammys. Plant: We've already won by doing this. We've brought our gifts, and we've shared them, and the whole surrounding musically is so beautiful, that that's our reward. The fact that it worked. The fact that it wasn't some embarrassing moment of two people trying something out, and saying goodbye, and then meeting at a party years later and saying, ""Oh, Christ, there's Alison Krauss! Oh, no!""","Robert Plant, Alison Krauss collaborated on ""Raising Sand""

"(CNN) -- Through English-language propaganda and a vibrant social media presence, ISIS is actively encouraging young Americans to join its cause to take up arms in Syria and Iraq. Some Americans have joined the militant group, according to officials. Intelligence officials fear the number will grow higher since ISIS has been successful with recruitment in some European countries. Americans need to wake up to the frightening reality of this threat taking root in our communities. While President Barack Obama searches for a strategy to confront ISIS in Syria and Iraq, federal, state and local governmental organizations (including law enforcement agencies) and communities are already working together to confront the problem with this group now calling itself the Islamic State. The situation of young people acquiring radicalized beliefs without yet committing crimes is worrisome. The question is: How do we prevent violent ideologies from taking hold of people in the first place, and how to intervene and dissuade them from crossing the line towards actual violence? Colorado teen pleads guilty in plan to join ISIS . The term used to describe this effort is ""countering violent extremism,"" or CVE. Similar to community-oriented policing methods, CVE focuses on engagement and partnership with communities. CVE stems from the White House's national security strategy and has the active support of multiple federal agencies, but it is highly dependent on cities, counties and states to devise solutions. Consider what is happening in Los Angeles. In 2008, the Los Angeles Police Department established a Liaison Section of its Counter-Terrorism and Special Operations Bureau. Its mission is ""to improve the quality of life and public safety within diverse communities by building mutual partnerships and trust through coordination and collaboration of all department entities, government stakeholders, public/private/faith-based organizations, nongovernmental organizations with local communities."" For example, the LAPD began holding a quarterly Muslim Forum. Each forum is held in a mosque and hosts about two dozen representatives from Muslim organizations throughout the greater Los Angeles area where they join for dialogues. Police officers and Muslim-American community advocates in Los Angeles believe that the program has been successful. They report that the LAPD has been able to engage multiple, key organizations and leaders in the communities and to form partnerships that build trust, challenge misinformation, educate people, promote transparency, defuse conflicts, open communication channels and solve daily problems. Community advocates said they are being regarded as part of the solution, not part of the problem. Deputy Chief Michael Downing, the commanding officer of the Counter-Terrorism and Special Operations Bureau, stipulates that law enforcement-community partnerships are essential to the objective of ""making the environment hostile to violent extremism."" One of the department's key partners is the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC), whose director, Salam al-Marayati, believes that law enforcement and community leaders must play distinct roles in the collaborative fight against violent extremism. He sees prevention as primarily the responsibility of communities, and many community members readily agree. MPAC is rolling out ""Safe Spaces,""  an innovative community-led CVE initiative in mosques across the United States. Safe Spaces aims to increase Muslim-American communities' resilience against violent extremism through community-led prevention and intervention activities. Safe Spaces works in part through getting families and communities to talk together about difficult topics. It tells parents about the threats of recruitment and radicalization to violence. According to its facilitator's guide, ""We're not sharing this story to scare you; only to highlight the serious need for communities to build healthy and safe spaces."" The initiative teaches helpful strategies to increase parental involvement and supportive adult mentorship for youth. Another key component of Safe Spaces is helping communities form ""crisis inquiry teams"" that can identify individuals believed to be at risk of engaging in violent beliefs and help them turn away from that path. Communities learn that if those efforts fail, and the risk of violent behavior becomes real, then they are obligated to notify law enforcement. Across the United States, new strategies are being developed. In Montgomery Country, Maryland, the effort is not being led by the police but rather through a public-private partnership involving the faith-based community and law enforcement. In Dearborn, Michigan, initiatives aim to promote public safety without singling out terrorism or any one ethnic community. What most efforts have in common is establishing innovative public-private partnerships that increase mutual trust, build capacities, strengthen resilience and then develop and evaluate community-delivered prevention and intervention activities. Opinion: When Americans leave for jihad . Most communities don't have such experiences, so there is a need for expanding training and technical assistance that draws on community policing practices and on the lessons learned from implementing programs such as Safe Spaces. With the growing threat of recruitment to ISIS, the U.S. government needs to build on the successes in these and other cities, as well learn from the successes of countries such as Australia, Canada and Britain. We have to figure out how to increase knowledge of CVE strategies; how to accelerate implementation efforts throughout the United States; and how to measure the relative effectiveness of different CVE initiatives.","ISIS is encouraging Americans to join its cause to take up arms in Syria and Iraq .

"(CNN) -- In the face of several tough upcoming Senate races, many Democratic candidates have found a multitude of ways to separate themselves from the President's most recent speech on ISIS. Alaska Sen. Mark Begich said he opposes arming Syrian rebels. ""We must have greater assurance that we aren't arming extremists who will eventually use the weapons against us,"" he said. Begich has been working to distance himself from the President on a multitude of issues in a tight Senate race. 5 takeaways from Obama's speech . After the speech, Colorado Sen. Mark Udall challenged the President's suggestion that he has unilateral authority to expand military operations. He said Obama must receive authorization from Congress to do some of the things outlined in the speech. ""I will not give this president -- or any other president -- a blank check to begin another land war in Iraq,"" Udall said in a statement. Udall's demand that Congress go on the record is contrary to conventional wisdom that campaigning lawmakers don't want to go on record before a war-weary electorate weeks before an election. But he's running against a member of Congress, Rep. Cory Gardner, so if Udall has to take a vote, Gardner does too -- and both will be held accountable. After the President spoke, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire attempted to look tough against the President of the same party. ""I will continue to press the President to use all of the tools at his disposal, short of ground troops, to defeat ISIS,"" she said. Shaheen's challenger, Scott Brown, has been making ISIS and terrorism an issue on the campaign trail in the tightening race. Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina took an approach similar to Shaheen's. ""I pressed the administration to arm and empower moderate Syrian rebels and I am glad that effort will be accelerated."" Hagan presented an image of someone who was standing up to the President, responding to attacks made by her challenger in an upcoming Senate race, Thom Tillis, who has argued that Hagan is a puppet of Obama. Tillis said after Obama's speech: ""The job of a senator is to stand up to the President when they are wrong, something Sen. Hagan has repeatedly refused to do.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Washington souvenirs worth $100,000 -- including images of the Capitol dome and printings of the U.S. Constitution -- are locked in storage, blocked from sale in the new U.S. Capitol Visitors Center because the items are made in China. Political-themed souvenirs such as this Obama bobblehead doll are for sale across Washington. Rep. Bob Brady, D-Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Administration Committee, said he warned operators of the visitors center not to purchase merchandise made outside the United States, but they did it anyway. Although the center has the goods in hand, Brady said, ""I'm not allowing them to sell those products."" His Administration Committee oversees operations in the House of Representatives, including the House restaurant, parking facilities and the Capitol Visitors Center.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods, who quit a recent PGA Tour event because of back spasms, withdrew Wednesday from consideration for the United States Ryder Cup team, the golfer announced on his website. ""I've been told by my doctors and trainer that my back muscles need to be rehabilitated and healed. They've advised me not to play or practice now,"" Woods wrote. Woods, 38, was a potential selection by U.S. captain Tom Watson for the team, but the 14-time major tournament winner said the match play event against Europe's best golfers meant too much and he shouldn't play if he couldn't give it his best effort. ""Of course, I'm disappointed that Tiger Woods has asked not to be considered for the U.S. Ryder Cup team, and that his health is not where he would like it to be,"" Watson said, according to the PGA's website. ""However, I think we can all agree that we need Tiger Woods in this great sport, and he has taken the high road by informing me early on in the selection process."" Nine golfers have automatically qualified for the team: Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Zach Johnson, Matt Kuchar, Phil Mickelson, Patrick Reed, Jordan Spieth, Jimmy Walker and Bubba Watson. Tom Watson will pick three other golfers for the team and announce their selections on September 2. The Ryder Cup will be held September 26-28 in Perthshire, Scotland. The European team is the defending champion. Woods has been been on the Ryder Cup team seven times and has a record of 13-17-2. On August 3, Woods withdrew from the Bridgestone Invitational midway through the final round. He described the injury as spasms through his lower back. Woods played in but didn't make the cut for the PGA Championship in Kentucky after shooting consecutive rounds of 74.

"(CNN) -- South Carolina social workers were familiar with Timothy Jones Jr. long before police accused him of killing his five children and dumping them off a dirt road in Alabama, according to documents from the state Department of Social Services. Police also had contact with him the day his children disappeared, when he allegedly admitted to a Lexington County sheriff's deputy that he ""forced"" his five kids, all between the ages of 1 and 8, out of a vehicle at a Walmart on August 28, according to an affidavit. Jones was transferred Thursday from a Mississippi jail to Lexington County, where he was served with arrest warrants in connection with his children's deaths. Jones, who faces five murder counts, was scheduled to have a first-appearance hearing Friday morning but waived his right to appear. He is now scheduled for a hearing on November 13, the judge said. Jones, 32, was arrested Saturday in Smith County, Mississippi, and charged with driving under the influence, possession of synthetic marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, the Lexington County Sheriff's Department in South Carolina said. Three days later, Jones led Lexington County and federal authorities to five sets of remains near Oak Hill, Alabama. Police announced this week that Jones drove 700 miles with his kids' bodies wrapped in garbage bags in the back of his SUV. Jones and the children were listed as missing persons last week after Jones failed to drop off the children with his ex-wife. A long Department of Social Services file . According to reports from the state Department of Social Services, case workers had expressed concerns about the children in the past, as early as 2011, but the most recurring complaint was that the Jones' house was a mess. The first DSS visit came in September 2011, a report says, when a caseworker visited the home because of allegations that the kids -- at the time, only three -- were dirty and not attending school. The mother, who was pregnant, said that the children were 3, 4 and 5 and too young to start school, but that when they were of age, they would be home-schooled, the report says. The caseworker expressed concern that the kids were barefoot and that there were tools and construction items lying in the living room, the report says. On a followup inspection, the house was clean, the report says, but the following month, the caseworker visited and spoke to Jones on the phone. During the conversation, ""he became very hostile"" and told the caseworker ""she was ruining people's lives."" The caseworker called police, but when Jones arrived, he'd calmed down, the report states. The caseworker told Jones the home wasn't safe for the kids, and Jones took them to a hotel, it said. In May 2012, after the couple had separated, the caseworker visited and the mother gave the caseworker documents indicating some domestic abuse issues. The caseworker advised the mother to go to a shelter, but she said ""she did not want to do that and she would be okay."" In June of that year, the mother told DSS that Jones had taken the kids -- now four of them -- to live with his grandparents in Mississippi. The mother, who was pregnant with the couple's fifth child, went to visit her mother in Ohio in August 2012, and DSS submitted the case for closure. The case was closed in October 2012. Renewed DSS interest . Four months ago, a South Carolina DSS case manager spoke to one of the children, who said Jones made them do exercises for punishment. There was a mark on the child's neck, and the child said Jones spanked his kids with a belt. ""Child did not indicate any verbal fear of father,"" the report says. The child's sister confirmed that they did pushups and other exercises for punishment and that their ""father will slam them around playing."" ""She stated that is not afraid of her dad,"" the report states. DSS determined the children should not be removed from the home, and there wasn't cause to arrest the father. Jones admitted to the case manager that he had spanked his son, and the case manager told Jones to refrain from physical discipline. Ten days later, the case manager arrived on one of the kids' birthdays. Cupcakes were out. Jones said his ex-wife had left him for a younger man and she hadn't seen her kids in four months, the report says. The case was closed in July, but a case manager was called on August 13 after allegations that Jones beat his son, leaving bruising, and that he was not feeding them properly, at times making all five kids split a 20-piece chicken nugget dinner, the DSS report states. Once interviewed, the children denied any abuse or neglect and told the case manager what meals they'd eaten the night before. ""Dad appears to be overwhelmed as he is unable to maintain the home, but the children appear to be clean, groomed and appropriately dressed,"" the report states. Of that encounter, Jackie Swindler, a representative of the South Carolina Department of Social Services, said, ""DSS did not see any visible signs of abuse. ... At the time, there was nothing to alarm them."" Jones and the children disappear . The next calls to DSS came on September 3 and 4. The sheriff's department was seeking Jones and the children, whom Jones' ex-wife had reported missing. Jones, a computer tech and Mississippi State University graduate, told neighbors last week that he was moving his children from their home near Lexington to another state. It's unclear how or why Jones allegedly killed his children, but acting Sheriff Lewis McCarty of Lexington County told reporters that Jones drove for several days with their decomposing bodies in the back of his SUV. It is believed he killed all the children at the same time, and that the crime happened in Lexington County, McCarty said. ""I don't understand why he did it but, yes, these children were in the car, deceased, in garbage bags for some period of time,"" McCarty said. When Jones was picked up Saturday at a police checkpoint in Mississippi, he seemed ""very strange, maybe somewhat disoriented, a little bit on the violent side,"" McCarty said. In the car, police later found ""cleaning material. They saw blood. They saw children's clothing but no children."" The remains found in Alabama have been returned to South Carolina, where autopsies will be performed. ""I'm a father and I'm a grandfather, and in all of my years of law enforcement, I have never seen a case like this,"" McCarty said. Standing before television cameras with his wife sobbing by his side, Jones' father spoke to reporters Wednesday. ""We know that the angels are with us, but your prayers are helping us cope,"" Tim Jones Sr. said. ""We do not have all the answers and we may never have all of them, but anyone who knows little Tim will agree that he is not the animal that he will be portrayed through the media."" He described his son as ""a very loving father, brother and son"" and said the family was heartbroken. Missing nursing student's remains found in Tennessee .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Defense lawyers in the trial of Michael Jackson's doctor want to shield jurors from commentary by Nancy Grace, the former prosecutor who now hosts a daily show on the HLN network. Daily commentary by Grace and others during the Casey Anthony trial this summer was ""like a final argument by the prosecution,"" Dr. Conrad Murray's lawyer, Michael Flanagan, said Wednesday. While the defense has not decided whether to ask that the jury in the Murray trial be sequestered, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor hinted at a hearing Wednesday he does not think it would be necessary. Flanagan predicted media coverage of the trial of Murray, charged with involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, will be bigger than the wall-to-wall coverage of the Anthony case that just ended in Florida. ""How many final arguments do we have to face in this case?"" Flanagan asked.  ""Are we going to face the one in the courtroom and the one when they go home?"" Grace addressed the issue Wednesday during her eponymous show. ""The doctor charged in the death of music superstar Michael Jackson, killing him allegedly with a powerful propofol anesthesia, wants the jury sequestered, from me! From US!"" she said. ""Claiming watching 'Nancy Grace' will prevent a fair trial; that the jury will be biased. So I guess that makes us, umm ... the good guys!"" Keeping jurors in a hotel, with deputies watching over them, for two months would be expensive for the Los Angeles court system, which is already suffering under tight budget constraints. HLN, which carries Grace's nightly show, is owned by Turner Broadcasting, which also owns CNN. Pastor announced Wednesday that jury selection will begin September 8, despite prosecutors' request for another three weeks to prepare their case because of ""scheduling issues."" Jury selection was underway in May when the defense requested a delay so its expert witnesses could have more time to prepare for new experts hired by the prosecution. Pastor then dismissed hundreds of prospective jurors and rescheduled the trial to start in September. The judge will visit Sony Studios soon to review more than a dozen hours of raw video of Jackson's last rehearsals for his ""This Is It"" tour to decide which clips, if any, will be shown to the jury. Lawyers for each side spent the past two weeks viewing more than 100 hours of video, narrowing down what they thought was relevant to the case.  The prosecution selected 12 hours of video, while the defense identified four. Flanagan said the video showed him that Jackson was ""very talented, that he's pretty good; even on his bad days, he's good."" The defense was looking for clues in the video to show that Jackson was in ill health in his final days, but Flanagan said it was not detectable in his performance video.  Jackson also did not appear to be depressed in his final days, he said. The defense will argue that none of the ""This Is It"" video is relevant to the criminal trial and would be ""a big waste of time."" ""It shows him onstage performing,"" Flanagan said.  ""I don't know why that's relevant as to what happened the night that he died when he couldn't sleep."" Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, was from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, combined with other drugs, the Los Angeles coroner ruled. Murray, whom Jackson hired to care for him as he prepared for his comeback concerts in London, allegedly administered the fatal dose.","NEW: Nancy Grace reaction: ""I guess that makes us, ummm, the good guys!""

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic will go into the U.S. Open without the match practice he was seeking after suffering his second straight third round defeat in a Masters 1000 tournament. The world number one exited at this stage in Cincinnati Thursday to Spain's Tommy Robredo, beaten in straight sets, 7-6 7-5. Fresh off his honeymoon and with his first child due, Djokovic went out to eventual winner Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in Toronto last week. He had hoped to improve in this week's tournament, particularly as it's the only one of nine Masters 1000 events to elude him. Djokovic has been a four-time runner up on the hard courts in Ohio and lost to John Isner in the quarterfinals last year. This time around he did not even get to that stage, losing control of his match against Robredo after losing a tight first set tiebreak 8-6. Djokovic had actually retrieved an early break to level at 4-4 but could not take full advantage. A single break of service in the second set was enough for Robredo to close out a memorable win. ""Just many, many, many things are not clicking these two weeks on hard courts,"" Djokovic told the official ATP Tour website. ""It's unfortunate, but it's more than obvious I'm not playing even close to what I'm supposed to play. I have to keep on working and trying to get better for U.S.Open,"" added the Serbian. Earlier, Isner had two match points against former Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion Andy Murray before the Briton emerged the winner in three sets. Murray, who has slipped to eighth in the world rankings after having back surgery in 2013, eventually prevailed 6-7 6-4 7-6. America giant Isner had the match points on Murray's service as he trailed 5-6 in the deciding set, but could not capitalize on his opportunities. Murray took control of the subsequent tiebreaker and won it for the loss of just two points to go into the last eight. ""I played very well,"" Murray told Sky Sports. ""This is a big win for me as he (Isner) plays extremely well here."" In the women's tournament at the same venue, world number one Serena Williams maintained her hopes of a first Cincinnati title with a straight sets win over Italy's Flavia Pennetta 6-2 6-2 to reach the quarterfinals. ""I got an early break and just didn't let go,"" Williams told the official WTA Tour website. She will face Serbia's Jelena Jankovic for a place in the semifinals after the eighth seed later beat Sloane Stephens of America 7-6 6-4.","Top seed Novak Djokovic loses to Tommy Robredo in Cincinnati .

"(CNN) -- Church of England leaders have voted to allow women to become bishops, the church announced Monday. The measure required a two-thirds majority in all three voting bodies of the church: the House of Bishops, the House of Clergy and the House of Laity. The legislation was passed at the church's General Synod, the three-times-a-year meeting that sets policies for the church, which is being held in the city of York. The first female bishop could be appointed by the end of the year, the church said. The head of the Church of England, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, said he was ""delighted"" with the result. ""Today marks the start of a great adventure of seeking mutual flourishing while still, in some cases disagreeing,"" he said in a statement. ""The challenge for us will be for the church to model good disagreement and to continue to demonstrate love for those who disagree on theological grounds."" The measure is subject to approval by Britain's Parliament. This is seen as a legal formality. The Church of England first began ordaining women as priests in 1994 and has been debating whether they should become bishops since 2005. ""To those who ask 'What took you so long?' my answer is that every decision has a cost and there will be those within our body who will be hurting as a result of this decision, the archbishop of York, John Sentamu, said. ""Our answer to the hurting should not be 'Get over it' but rather 'We will not let go until you have blessed us.' ""We move slowly because we move together. But in moving together we achieve not only what is just but also model what is right."" The Rev. Sally Hitchiner tweeted that she told her 8-year-old niece that she can be a bishop now. The niece said she didn't want to be a bishop. ""Yes but you CAN,"" Hitchiner tweeted, who earlier called the decision ""wonderful news."" Two lay members of the church told the BBC that they were upset with the vote. Lorna Ashworth told the network there is ""not going to be a smooth road ahead,"" and Susie Leafe said the decision fails 25% of those in the church who don't believe women should be bishops. Previous votes . At its General Synod meeting in 2012, draft legislation that would have allowed women to become bishops failed by six votes to get a two-thirds majority in the House of Laity. In 2010, the church's governing body narrowly rejected a measure, aimed at satisfying conservatives, that would have allowed parishes that opposed women bishops to have an additional male bishop. The Church of England is the largest church of the Anglican Communion, with more than 26 million baptized members. The communion represents more than 85 million people in 165 countries, including the U.S. Episcopal Church. The Anglican Communion News Service lists church districts that already have serving women bishops as New Zealand and Polynesia, Australia, Canada, The Episcopal Church, Cuba, Southern Africa, Ireland and South India. The Church of England broke from the Catholic church in the 16th century during the Reformation, which saw the establishment of Protestant churches. On its website, the Church of England says it ""consciously retained a large amount of continuity with the Church of the Patristic and Medieval periods in terms of its use of the catholic creeds, its pattern of ministry, its buildings and aspects of its liturgy, but which also embodied Protestant insights in its theology and in the overall shape of its liturgical practice.""","NEW: Anglican priest says she thinks the decision is ""wonderful news""

"(CNN) -- It all seemed in place for Eugenie Bouchard in Saturday's Wimbledon final. She was the people's favorite, surged to semifinals at the Australian Open and French Open, and Britain's Princess Eugenie -- who the tennis player was named after -- looked on from the Royal Box. Ten years ago, Bouchard's idol, Maria Sharapova, won Wimbledon as the 13th seed. Bouchard, who shares the Russian's enormous appetite for titles and competitiveness, happened to be seeded 13th this fortnight. But Bouchard's coronation will have to wait, since none of the above mattered to Petra Kvitova. Canada, too, will have to wait for a maiden grand slam singles champion. Kvitova became the Queen of Wimbledon once again when the powerful, left-handed Czech crushed Bouchard 6-3 6-0 in a mere 55 minutes for a second crown at tennis' most prestigious tournament, claiming the $3 million first prize. It was the most lopsided Wimbledon women's final since Steffi Graf routed Monica Seles 6-2 6-1 in 1992, not what anyone expected given Bouchard's battling qualities -- and the fact she hadn't dropped a set before the final. ""I thought Bouchard was going to win,"" Britain's 1977 Australian Open finalist John Lloyd, a longtime tennis analyst at Wimbledon, told CNN. ""I was thinking that Bouchard, who is just an animal -- and I mean that in a form of flattery, sort of in your face, confident, poised -- would get enough balls back and rush Petra. ""Petra was just seeing the ball like a football."" Closing the roof for the trophy presentation with rain on the way took almost as long as the second set. No matter what happens in the months leading into Wimbledon, former world No. 2 Kvitova -- who will rise to fourth in the new rankings -- appears to instantly feel at home at the All England Club. Whereas she hasn't reached a grand slam quarterfinal outside Wimbledon since the 2012 French Open, she's progressed to at least the last eight at tennis' most famous postcode of SW19 five straight times. Her flat, booming ground strokes thrive on the grass, and the lower bounces are to her liking. With rallies generally shorter, she doesn't have to hit as many balls -- so can limit her unforced errors. Bouchard, at 20 the youngest female grand slam finalist in five years, simply didn't face anyone of Kvitova's caliber this tournament. Nerves weren't a factor, as they were for Sabine Lisicki in last year's final against Marion Bartoli. ""She has weapons,"" Bouchard, who took home $1.5 million for her efforts, told reporters. ""We know that when she's on, she's very tough to beat, especially on this surface."" An aggressive player, even Bouchard took a backseat in that department to Kvitova, but that was little surprise since the latter always does the dictating. Kvitova's focus, crucially, never wavered. She finished with glittering statistics of 28 winners and only 12 unforced errors. Bouchard's figures weren't bad, though: Eight winners and four unforced errors. Kvitova won 82% of her first-serve points and broke six times. ""There might have been some players who could have been able to keep her off balance a bit with a bigger serve, like a Serena (Williams), but I would have to say her display was one of the best I've ever seen from a woman at Wimbledon in terms of ball striking,"" said Lloyd. Not known for her scampering, Kvitova for good measure won the point of the final when she retrieved like Rafael Nadal and struck a slice-backhand passing-shot winner to hold for 3-1 in the first set. ""Really for the first time I said, 'Oh, my God, this is good,'"" Kvitova, who cried as she addressed the crowd, told reporters. ""I can really run and put everything back. I was there. I was 100% ready for everything."" Her running forehand cross-court pass deep in the second was almost as good, and Kvitova ended matters with a sizzling cross-court backhand winner prior to raising her arms and falling to the grass. On this form, it won't be the last time Kvitova celebrates on Centre Court. One of her tasks now is to land a grand slam title outside London. ""I hope it's now going to be easier for me,"" Kvitova said. Once she broke for 2-1 in the first set, the 24-year-old was never threatened. Bouchard saved three break points to hold for 2-3 -- but it was her last hold. The second set took 23 minutes, with Bouchard claiming 10 points total. At least Bouchard -- who will become the highest-ranked Canadian woman in tennis history at No. 7 when the new list is released on Monday -- can say the fans were heavily behind her. ""Even on court today I felt some special support from the crowd,"" she said. ""It's humbling to receive all this support. It's special to hear that people want me to do well and believe in me."" In Sunday's men's final, Roger Federer tries for an eighth Wimbledon title against top seed Novak Djokovic. But the duo will have a difficult job of matching Kvitova's impeccable outing.

"(CNN) -- Voters in three states head to the polls Tuesday, and in one of those states history might be made: . South Carolina . South Carolina Republicans could make state Rep. Nikki Haley their first female gubernatorial nominee. She's in a runoff against U.S. Rep. Gresham Barrett. Haley just missed out on winning the nomination outright in the June 8 primary, capturing 49 percent of the vote in a four-candidate field. She was short of the 50 percent plus one needed to take the nomination. Once facing long odds for the GOP nomination, Haley rose in the polls thanks in part to endorsements by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. And unsubstantiated allegations by two other Republicans that they had affairs with Haley, who is married with children, most likely helped rather than hurt her campaign. So did a racial slur by a Republican state lawmaker at Haley, who is Indian-American and was raised Sikh, but became a Methodist at age 24. ""The unproven allegations and attacks against Haley actually played right into her message as a new kind of conservative,"" said CNN political producer Peter Hamby, who is in South Carolina reporting on the campaign. ""In fighting back, she was able to argue that establishment figures in the GOP were playing politics as usual and trying to stop a real reformer from taking charge in Columbia."" If Haley wins Tuesday's runoff, she'll be considered the favorite in the general election against state Sen. Vincent Sheheen, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee. Haley would become the Palmetto state's first woman governor if elected in November. There are also runoffs in South Carolina in contests for the House of Representatives and for the state Legislature. State Rep. Tim Scott hopes to become the first black Republican to win election to Congress from South Carolina in a century. He faces off against Paul Thurmond, the son of the late Sen. Strom Thurmond, in a GOP House primary runoff. Republican Rep. Bob Inglis is hoping he won't become the third House incumbent to lose a bid for re-election so far this primary season. He grabbed 27 percent of the vote in the primary and now faces a runoff against Spartanburg prosecutor Trey Gowdy. Inglis is facing criticism for his vote in favor of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, better known as the Wall Street bailout. North Carolina . In neighboring North Carolina, Secretary of State Elaine Marshall faces off in a Democratic Senate primary runoff against former state Sen. Cal Cunningham, who was recruited by national Democrats. The winner will challenge Republican Sen. Richard Burr in November's general election. ""Richard Burr doesn't have the strongest poll numbers, but that may not matter,"" said Stuart Rothenberg, publisher and editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. Rothenberg said neither of the Democratic candidates ""seems likely to put together the kind of campaign that would defeat Burr."" Voters in three congressional districts and one state Senate district also will cast ballots in runoff contests. Utah . The fight for the GOP Senate nomination is capturing the spotlight in Utah, and the contest will be another test of the political strength of the Tea Party Express. The national Tea Party group, which is based in California, is backing and assisting lawyer Mike Lee in the battle to succeed fellow Republican Bob Bennett, who is supporting the other candidate on the ballot, businessman Tim Bridgewater. Bridgewater and Lee finished first and second, respectively last month at the Utah Republican Party convention, advancing to Tuesday's primary. Bridgewater and Lee touted themselves as more reliable conservatives than Bennett, who finished third in the voting by delegates, eliminating him from advancing to the primary and ending his chances of re-election for a fourth term. Bennett became the first sitting senator to go down to defeat in a primary season marked by strong anti-incumbent sentiment. The Tea Party Express, best known for its three national bus tours, is running radio ads supporting Lee. The group recently pumped more than $500,000 into the recent fight for the Republican Senate nomination in Nevada, helping transform ex-state lawmaker Sharron Angle, once considered a long shot, into an easy winner in this month's primary election. FreedomWorks also has endorsed Lee, and its volunteers are assisting in get-out-the-vote efforts in Utah. FreedomWorks is a nonprofit conservative organization that helps train volunteer activists and has provided much of the organizational heft behind the Tea Party movement. Bennett upset many conservatives with his 2007 vote for President Bush's plan for a pathway to citizenship for some illegal immigrants and his 2008 vote for the federal bailout of banks and financial institutions. The fiscally conservative Club for Growth actively worked to defeat Bennett, as did local Tea Party organizations and Tea Party Express. The GOP dominates statewide elections in Utah, and the winner of the Republican primary will be considered the overwhelming favorite to win the general election in November.","South Carolina Republicans will vote in gubernatorial runoff Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney says that after more than three years of a Barack Obama presidency, the United States is uncharacteristically pessimistic about the future of its children. The GOP presidential nominee said Thursday at the Republican National Convention that America's immigrants would always arrive confident that they could build a better life, and ""that in America their children would be more blessed than they."" ""But today, four years from the excitement of the last election, for the first time, the majority of Americans now doubt that our children will have a better future,"" Romney said. Fact Check: Trimming the Pentagon . The facts: . Polls do appear to show a recent, downward trend in optimism for kids' futures, and four polls from two different organizations since 2009 indeed had a majority of adult respondents saying they don't expect today's children to be better off than their parents. But these results aren't unheard of. A poll also showed this type of result some 16 years ago. Let's start with the more recent surveys. Consider this set of four Rasmussen Reports polls, from January 2009 to this year. January 2009: 47% said today's children wouldn't be better off than their parents. October 2009: 62% said so. March 2011: 60% . July 2012: 65% . The question for the July 2012 Rasmussen poll was: ""Will today's children be better off than their parents?"" The national survey of 1,000 adults had an error margin of +/- 3%. Similarly, an April 2011 Gallup/USA Today poll had the pessimists in the majority, with 55% saying it was either somewhat unlikely or very unlikely that ""today's youth"" will have a better life than their parents. Here's how those Gallup/USA Today numbers looked from 2008 to 2011 (sample of 1,013 adults, with a +/ 4% margin of error): . February 2008: 33% somewhat/very unlikely . December 2008: 42% . March 2009: 40% . January 2010: 38% . October 2010: 48% . April 2011: 55% . Gallup also keeps a collection of older, CBS News/New York Times poll results that used the same question: . October 1996: 42% . January 1998: 34% . December 2001: 27% . January 2003: 31% . Reports of majority pessimism, however, are not unique to the last three years. The Pew Research Center reported it in 1996, and near-majority pessimism in 2002 and 2006. Here are some Pew results: . 1996: 55% said children will be worse off. 1999: 36% . 2002: 50% . 2006: 50% . The 2002/2006 Pew surveys asked: ""When children today in the U.S. grow up, do you think they will be better off or worse off than people are now?"" The 2006 survey polled 2,250 people and had a margin error of +/- 2%. The 1996 and 1999 surveys asked: ""Looking to the future, do you think most children in this country will grow up to be better off or worse off than their parents."" Conclusion: . Surveys in the past three years, from two different organizations, show the majority of respondents don't expect today's children to be better off than their parents. But a poll from a third organization also showed this level of attitude back in 1996. Fact Check: 'You didn't build that' -- A theme out of context . CNN's Jason Hanna and Emily Smith contributed to this report.","Mitt Romney says most Americans ""for the first time"" doubt that children will have better future than them .

"(CNN) -- In Masai culture, it is traditional to open a conversation with ""Casserian engeri,"" which means ""And how are the children?"" The prominent value that the Masai place on the well-being of their children has me thinking about the well-being of our own children here in America. We rejoice with those who crossed the stage to receive their high school diplomas last spring, and look forward to the accomplishments of those who start school soon. Indeed, our children are doing well. For the first time in our nation's history, 80% of young Americans graduated from high school on time, according to the 2014 Building a GradNation. This is a significant achievement for those young graduates and our country as a whole. At that rate of increase, we can and should push forward to the goal of 90% on-time high school graduation by 2020. Four successive presidents have set forth this goal, and at last we are on track. But this statistic tells only a piece of the story about the well-being of our children. It disregards too quickly the remaining 20% -- about 800,000 young people per year -- who don't graduate on time. What happens to them? Why are these young people not progressing, despite all of our best efforts? Who are they? And what must we do to help them stay on track and thrive as contributors to the economy of our country? Over the past year, America's Promise Alliance has been seeking those answers, right from the source. Our Center for Promise at Tufts University interviewed hundreds of young people who did not graduate on time or at all. And then we surveyed thousands of young people from all 50 states. So, how are our children? Their responses, compiled and analyzed in the report ""Don't Call Them Dropouts,"" are heartbreaking, humbling and ultimately hopeful. So many young people described the circumstances in which they grew up, environments made toxic by physical and emotional abuse, exposure to extreme violence, family stress and caretaking responsibilities. Young people have many reasons for leaving school, not all of them related to boredom or lack of motivation. Many leave because of complex and challenging life circumstances that, without proper adult support, make leaving school look like the only option. In the wake of leaving school without graduating, many showed tremendous optimism and a drive to achieve adult success. They want for themselves what we want for them: more education, a solid job, a strong family, a stable place to live. With this backdrop, it's no surprise that many of the people we interviewed took exception to the term ""dropout."" They don't feel that they ""dropped out"" or, worse, quit. They simply made a decision to change the course of their lives. Nothing will be easy about increasing our national high school graduation rates. However, for the sake of our nation's future, we must not forget about the potential that exists in 20% of our nation's students. Yes, all students need high quality schools with strong teachers and strong curricula, but they also need environments where they are heard. Set preconceptions and assumptions aside, and just listen hard. Try to understand their experiences and perspective, however challenging. Show them, in some way, that you care about their future. For our young adults with the highest needs, more schools should incorporate an early warning system to identify students whose attendance, behavior and course performance suggest that they need extra support to stay in school. Communities should consider how to create similar early-warning supports and systems beyond the school building for young adults affected by risk factors like a death in the family, an incarcerated parent or housing instability. As good stewards of our communities, we must help provide the support that our young people need for success, and that means learning from one another. With proven and promising examples of success happening all across the country, in and out of the classroom, we must create more opportunities for school systems and communities to collaborate with one another. It's in that sharing, that great progress can be made. The question ""How are our children?"" is the right one to be asking. But, let's not be afraid of the challenging and complex answers that comes with it. At graduation season, and every day, let's celebrate our high achievers while giving equal care to those young people taking the less common road.","For the first time, 80% of young Americans graduated from high school on time .

"(CNN) -- Major League Baseball player Ryan Braun has been suspended without pay for the rest of the 2013 season for violating the league's drug policy, Commissioner Bud Selig announced Monday. The Brewers have 65 games remaining this season, so Braun's punishment amounts to a 65-game suspension. Braun, 29, an outfielder for the Milwaukee Brewers, admitted to wrongdoing and apologized for his actions in a statement, saying ""I am not perfect."" An ESPN report last month named Braun as one of 20 players facing suspension due to a scandal involving performance-enhancing drugs. Michael Weiner, the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, said he was pleased by Braun's admission. Twitter explodes with reactions . ""I am deeply gratified to see Ryan taking this bold step,"" Weiner said in a statement. ""It vindicates the rights of all players under the Joint Drug Program. It is good for the game that Ryan will return soon to continue his great work both on and off the field."" The 2011 National League MVP and five-time All-Star had faced a 50-game suspension last year. A drug test showed high levels of testosterone in his body, but Braun successfully disputed the testing process, and the suspension was overturned in February. Major league players can appeal any possible suspensions, as Braun did in 2012. Performance enhancing drugs in sports . ""As I have acknowledged in the past, I am not perfect,"" Braun said in his statement. ""I realize now that I have made some mistakes. I am willing to accept the consequences of those actions. ""This situation has taken a toll on me and my entire family, and it has been a distraction to my teammates and the Brewers organization. I am very grateful for the support I have received from players, ownership and the fans in Milwaukee and around the country. Finally, I wish to apologize to anyone I may have disappointed -- all of the baseball fans especially those in Milwaukee, the great Brewers organization, and my teammates. I am glad to have this matter behind me once and for all, and I cannot wait to get back to the game I love."" Rob Manfred, MLB's executive vice president for economics and league affairs, also commended Braun for taking responsibility for his actions. ""We all agree that it is in the best interests of the game to resolve this matter. When Ryan returns, we look forward to him making positive contributions to Major League Baseball, both on and off the field,"" Manfred said in a statement. Braun was the 2007 National League Rookie of the Year and by the 2011 season, he was considered the cornerstone of the Brewers franchise. He signed a five-year, $105 million contract extension and went on to help lead the Brewers to the playoffs for the only the fourth time in team history. His performance earned him that year's National League MVP award. Shortly after his amazing season, however, a urine sample taken during the playoffs tested positive for an elevated level of testosterone. Faced with a 50-game suspension, Braun appealed the decision, and an arbitrator overturned the suspension on what some, including the chief executive of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, said was a technicality. CNN's David Close contributed to this report.","Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun admits to wrongdoing and apologizes .
