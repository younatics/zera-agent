"(CNN) -- His name means ""traveler"" and Somali-born poet, rapper and musician K'naan has certainly come a long way. The hip-hop sensation, who's been compared by critics to both reggae hero Bob Marley and rap star Eminem, fled war-torn Somalia as a teenager to eventually settle down with his family in Canada. Strongly influenced by his native country, his socially conscious lyrics stem from life as a refugee and memories of civil war. Yet, the talented rhymesmith says today that he is more interested in emotional journeys, penning songs about the battles of the heart instead of street ones. ""In some ways, love can be harder than war -- it's a very difficult thing when human beings acknowledge their vulnerability,"" he says. ""War has a way of making life painfully factual and love has a way of making life completely painfully dreamy, and I wanted to try to be honest about where I'm at in life,"" adds K'naan, whose latest album, ""Country, God or the Girl"" is expected to be released early next month.

In 2010, his upbeat tune ""Wavin' Flag"" became a global hit after it was chosen as the official Coca-Cola anthem for the 2010 South Africa World Cup, the first time that football's biggest tournament was held on African soil. For K'naan, the selection of his song was a ""surreal"" and ""magic"" moment. ""That perspective is not lost on me, you know that I was someone who was raised and born in that continent,"" he says. ""That moment of the continent's recognition and glory, that my music is the soundtrack for that, is a pretty huge privilege and that something to this day I'm still trying to kind of get a hold of."" With two full length albums already under his belt, his impressive roster of collaborations features a wide array of high-profile names, including rapper Nas and Mos Def, singer Nelly Furtado and Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett. In his latest offering, he also joins forces with Rolling Stones legend Keith Richards and rapper Will.i.am. It's a long journey from where K'naan imagined he would be when he and his family boarded one of the last commercial flights to leave Somalia in 1991, at a time when the East African country was descending into chaos, mired in the grip of a long civil war. ""I think I felt quiet a bit of guilt,"" he recalls. ""Leaving was both a privilege and a burden because you saw the people around you who also deserved the chance to leave but weren't going to get that chance and you were getting that chance."" Read more: Ladysmith Black Mambazo: How we inspired Mandela . K'naan first spent some time in New York before relocating to Toronto. Without speaking a word of English, he turned to music to learn how to express himself in his new environment. ""I picked up rap records because rappers seemed to me like they ... could be great orators, so I would listen to them,"" he says. ""Luckily I did come upon people who were great poets like Naz and Rakim and people who use similes, imagery, metaphors, things that could teach me something."" In the end, he says he learned the new language very quickly ""because it was like a survivor's manual -- it wasn't a leisurely activity for me, it was what I needed to live because language is so important in my culture."" K'naan released his first full-length album -- dubbed ""Dusty Foot Philosopher"" -- in 2005 to critical acclaim. Yet, his first outing to a truly global stage came a few years earlier, in front of a rather unusual audience for hip-hop standards. A relatively unknown artist, K'naan was invited in early 2000s to perform at a United Nations' event marking the 50th anniversary of the organization's refugee agency. Standing in front of some of the world's most powerful men, K'naan stopped his performance to recite a politically-charged poem, blasting the U.N. for its failed relief mission in Somalia. ""At this time I said what do I have to do, I have no career, nobody cares, I can't live with myself if I don't say something now that I have the opportunity to address all these people of stature and political clout. ""It was like honest in the moment. It was something that was about what's happened over there and how it was treated how it was ignored, how it was undervalued by leadership and all of that.""

The crowd's initial silence quickly gave its place to a standing ovation, prompting Senegalese singer Youssou N'Dour to storm up on stage and congratulate him. Passionate about the country he was born, K'naan says Somalia is a country with an incredible amount of potential. ""If you're ever around Somali people you know how enterprising they can be, how sophisticated and intelligent they can be and you have only circumstances which enhance the negativity of such wealthy people,"" he says. ""So I would say that while all this is happening the truth about it is that Somalia is untapped in its potential. And so, as long as there is potential, there is hope.""","K'naan is a rap star who's achieved fame around the world with his Africa-influenced songs .

"(CNN) -- Need to get somewhere on time? Don't book a connecting flight through China. According to FlightStats, a U.S.-based air travel information service, mainland China airports are the world's worst when it comes to on-time departures and arrivals. Worse still, according to the report, which covers airport and airline activity in the month of June, the overall performance of Chinese airports has become worse in the past half year. At the bottom of the list of major world airports is Beijing Capital International Airport. In June, just 18.3% of flights from the airport left on time. Around 42% of flights from Beijing suffered delays of 45 minutes or longer. Second worst on the list is Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. Just 24% of its June flights departed on time, compared with a 38.9% on-time departure rate six months ago. ""None of China's provincial airports surveyed by FlightStats -- including Guangzhou, Kunming, Nanjing, Chengdu, Changsha and Urumqi -- could manage to get half of their flights on time,"" according to a story in the South China Morning Post. Osaka Airport (95.88%) and Tokyo's Haneda Airport (95%) led Asian airports for on-time performance. Top performing large North American airports were in Honolulu (86.29%), Vancouver (86.18%) and Salt Lake City (85.55%). Top performing large European airports were in Amsterdam (83.52%), Munich (83.35%) and Vienna (82.15%). China's major airlines also fared poorly compared with regional and global counterparts. ""Major international airlines on average delivered 75.85% of their flights to the arrival gate within 15 minutes of schedule in June, down from May's 80.70%,"" according to the FlightStats report summary. Map: The best and worst for airport delays . ""Six major international carriers, South African, Gulf Air, ANA, Japan Airlines, Finnair, and Tyrolean Airways, delivered over 90% of their flights on time."" Meanwhile, China United Airlines brought in only 27% of its flights on time, while large national carriers Air China and China Southern also reported a considerable number of delayed flights. The top on-time performing carrier in North America was Hawaiian Airlines (92.2%). Top major carriers were Alaska Airlines (86.8%), Air Canada (81.28%) and Delta Air Lines (76.39%). Top overall European performers were Binter Canarias (99.41%), Malmo Aviation (95.56%) and KLM Cityhopper (93.6%). Top overall Asian performers were Air Busan (96.77%) and J-Air (95.64%). According to the South China Morning Post, the poor performance of Chinese airports and airlines is blamed on ""excessive military control of airspace and poor urban planning."" ""Nearly 80% of China's airspace has been reserved for military use. In other countries, such as the U.S., the situation is exactly the opposite,"" according to a Hainan Airlines official quoted by the SCMP.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- It's a safe bet that every time you fly, you show a photo ID to an official at the airport checkpoint. A TSA officer checks a passenger's ID at Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Every time Nick Kloiber flies, he doesn't. Kloiber, 23, a University of Kentucky Law School student and privacy advocate, knows something that you probably don't -- contrary to popular belief, and contrary to some airport signs, travelers are not required to present identification at airport checkpoints. Under current Transportation Security Administration policy, passengers can refuse to show identification and can still fly -- as long as they agree to secondary screening, meaning a search of their carry-on bags and a pat down. But all that is about to change. Beginning Saturday, June 21, travelers like Kloiber who ""willfully refuse"" to show IDs won't be allowed through checkpoints or onto planes. Only passengers who show IDs, and ""cooperative"" passengers, who explain why their IDs are missing and help police confirm their identities, will get through.  Watch a report on the policy change » . The TSA says it is changing the policy ""to facilitate travel for legitimate passengers"" while helping its security work force focus on ""people, not things."" ""It's a prudent security measure to know who it is who's flying in the planes,"" said Kip Hawley, head of the TSA. ""It's not too much to ask, to say, just tell us who you are."" Raising ire . But the change in policy, announced this month on the TSA Web site, has raised the ire of privacy advocates who believe the TSA is setting a dangerous precedent, in essence requiring U.S. citizens to carry documentation when traveling in the United States, even if only by air. The right to free travel -- unencumbered by government officials demanding identity documents -- is ""something that distinguishes ourselves from others not living in the free world,"" said Jim Harrison, an attorney who has fought document requirements. ""History will judge,"" Harrison said. ""What's going on here is the TSA is incrementally chipping away at the freedoms that Americans have. And the freedoms that we're talking about are the fundamental right to travel, the freedom to be free of search without reasonable suspicion and your First Amendment freedoms to assemble and associate freely without government interference."" That's not the way TSA chief Hawley sees it. ""To us, it's not a philosophical argument,"" he said. ""There are people trying to do harm, take down planes, and we can't let them [exploit] a vulnerability."" 300 people a day . By all accounts, the number of people who show up at airports without government-issued photo IDs is small. Of the 2 million people who fly every day, only about 300 do not show IDs, according to TSA spokesman Christopher White. The TSA does not keep statistics on the reasons people don't have IDs, but it is presumed that most people report them lost, stolen or simply forgotten. But a handful of people, like Kloiber, tell TSA document checkers that they do not believe the government has the right to require an ID. Kloiber said most TSA document screeners he has encountered do not know the policy, so he requests that they call a supervisor. If the supervisor is also unfamiliar with the TSA policy, Kloiber pulls out a letter TSA wrote to his senator explaining the policy. Or he pulls out a copy of a federal court ruling in the case of ""John Gilmore v. Alberto Gonzales,"" which involved TSA security protocols. Often, he says, that is enough to get him through the checkpoint -- with a patdown, but without showing his driver's license. On July 4, 2002, John Gilmore, the plaintiff in the federal case, challenged the TSA's pat-down and search policies. Gilmore tried to board planes at two San Francisco-area airports without showing an ID or submitting to a pat-down. Both times, he was rebuffed. The TSA also refused to show Gilmore or his lawyers the checkpoint ID and search policies, saying they were sensitive security information, or SSI, a classification that prevents them from public disclosure. Gilmore filed suit in federal court. His lawyers fought unsuccessfully for the TSA checkpoint procedures, arguing that the public had the right to know laws they are expected to obey, and that lawyers have a right to review laws they are challenging. The court declined to order the TSA to reveal the regulations. And, after viewing the regulations privately, out of public view, the judge ruled against Gilmore, saying his constitutional right to travel was not violated because other forms of transportation remained open to him. And, the court ruled, the TSA's identification policy didn't violate Gilmore's rights because Gilmore had the option of declining to show an ID and submitting to a legal search. But now, the new TSA policy removes that option, privacy advocates said, making the new policy ripe for another court challenge. ""I anticipate that this will be litigated,"" said Harrison, who represented Gilmore in the California case. ""Many people are upset about this change in policy."" Privacy advocates also question a second recent TSA policy change.  In the Gilmore ruling, the judge noted that if Gilmore wanted to avoid a search he thought was unconstitutional, he could have merely walked away.  But the TSA now says passengers cannot refuse a search once they have entered the checkpoint area. Aside from questions of law, Harrison and others say the new policy will not improve security.  They say that it affects only travelers who flatly refuse to provide identification, and that terrorists are unlikely to draw attention to themselves by doing that. But the TSA says that under the new policy, all people without IDs will face varying security measures, from pat-downs to interviews with behavior detection officers. ""By increasing our options, people with bad intentions don't know what exactly to plan against,"" the TSA said. Privacy advocates say the TSA already uses those techniques, and say the policy change will only hurt those who assert their rights. TSA officials say the need to change the policy couldn't be more clear. The government ID checkers are trained to spot false IDs, and the change provides another layer of security needed to keep the skies safe.  Without the change, they say, people could ""game the system,"" using a fake name and a fake boarding pass to bypass screeners. Hawley said agency lawyers have reviewed the new regulation and are ""comfortable"" with it. CNN's Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","Current TSA policy allows passengers to fly without an ID .
New policy effective June 21 will require passengers to show IDs .
Privacy advocates say the new policy violates the U.S. Constitution .
TSA says it is ""comfortable"" the new policy can withstand a legal challenge ."
"(CNN) -- Despite recent wobbles in the BRICS economies, most economists agree that the majority of world economic growth in the coming years will come from emerging markets. The story of their rise to date has been one in which women have played a large and often unreported role. I believe that as the story unfolds, women's influence will rise further and emerging markets' path to gender equality may follow a very different route to that of most developed countries. Let's consider the facts. More women now attend university than men in Brazil, China and Russia. And in those countries where they are not yet the majority like India, Indonesia and Mexico, they are catching up fast, according to last year's WEF Global Gender Gap report. More women than men are now also entering the labor force, helping fuel the growth in emerging economies. In relative terms, they're more economically active in China and Russia than in the United States already, while in Mexico and Brazil they are entering the labor force faster than in the U.S. And women are increasingly providing the skills that emerging market companies need to compete on a global stage. Like the U.S., Russia, Brazil, China and South Africa have more women than men in professional and technical positions such as teaching, medicine and finance. Even higher up the career ladder, in most major emerging markets, with the exception of China, women hold now more than a third of managerial roles. So, what does this mean for the future of the more than 1 billion women living in these emerging markets? Will we see a world where these countries become world leaders on gender equality in the economy? The economic, political and social trends we are witnessing suggest this may be the case. For one thing, the dynamism of emerging economies is helping tip the scale in favor of women. Fast-growth companies are much more likely to change the gender ratio than slow-growth ones: they're simply less beholden to the traditional hierarchies of today's Fortune 500 companies and, frankly, cannot afford to discriminate as they scale up fast. While the rich world is trying to figure out how to create a more women-friendly culture in business, these countries are growing their own corporate cultures organically. And it's having an impact on wages. According to the World Economic Forum, women earn wages that are closer to those of men (for similar work) in Malaysia, the UAE, Nigeria, Indonesia and China in comparison to the United States. It's also about political will. Emerging economies seem more able to embrace bold, progressive policies to integrate women into leadership roles than their counterparts in the developed world. For example, proposals to increase women on boards remain unpopular in the UK and unthinkable in the U.S. while India, the UAE and Malaysia have all recently proactively introduced quotas. These policies reflect the growing public acceptance of the need for visible female leadership -- something that took the developed world decades to achieve. Perhaps most importantly, women's own expectations are changing, reminiscent of the transformations in 1960s America. A 2010 Harvard Kennedy School report found in Latin America, skilled women show a preference for work over marriage. In China, many high-skilled women are choosing to delay marriage and motherhood. In India, women's own aspirations have been transformed, as evident in the national conversation about respect that was sparked by the horrific 2012 rape of a Delhi physiotherapy intern. Women's changing aspirations are transforming the social fabric around them. For example, the lack of formal childcare systems is substituted by other solutions, such as domestic workers or relying on family members, often grandparents. The rapid rise of luminary businesswomen in these nations could also create a virtuous circle by providing homegrown role models for younger generations. Maria das Gracas Silva Foster of Petrobras in Brazil and Karen Agustiawan of Pertamina in Indonesia run some of the largest state-owned enterprises in the world. Zhang Xin, CEO of SOHO, the Chinese real estate developer, is a feted role model with millions of followers on social media. Emerging market women leaders are vocal on gender issues, too. Guler Sabanci of Sabanci Holdings, for example, is one of the most powerful women in Turkey and is publicly committed to addressing gender parity in her country. Emerging markets' ability to couple growth with unprecedented numbers of women in the workforce is good for women, good for their countries' economy and good for the world. While much still remains to be done to ensure that women's safety, rights, political empowerment and health are more fully secured in these countries, their economic progress to date indicates that change is possible and that economic empowerment can contribute to that change. Ten years from now, rankings of the most economically competitive -- and the most gender equal -- countries in the world may look very different than they do today. Only time will tell, but closer competition on gender equality means that there are more winners all around. For CNN's full coverage from Davos, click here.

"Washington (CNN) -- The gay son of Republican congressional challenger Nan Hayworth says his mother -- who's trying to unseat New York's only openly gay congressman -- is ""no extremist"" in a new ad. The spot is an attempt to insulate Hayworth against Democratic Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney's criticism of her stance on social issues like same-sex marriage, which she's said the federal government shouldn't mandate nationwide. ""As a gay man, coming to terms with who I am wasn't easy,"" Hayworth's son Will says in the ad. ""But my parents love me for who I am and for whom I love. So when I hear vicious negative attacks against Nan Hayworth, I have to speak out. ""Nan Hayworth is no extremist,"" he says. ""She's my mom. She's kind. She's compassionate. She's always been there for me. And she'll always be there for you."" The race is an attempt at a comeback for Hayworth: She'd previously won the Hudson Valley seat in 2010 before being ousted by Maloney in 2012. But her stances on gay rights issues have opened her to criticism from Democrats who also point to her calls to defund Planned Parenthood as they portray her as loyal to the tea party. After Hayworth told the Poughkeepsie Journal that while she has no problem with recent court rulings legalizing same-sex marriage in some states, the federal government ""should not impose the definition of marriage on the states and I think every state is proceeding as it should,"" Maloney accused Hayworth of allowing discriminatory state policies. ""How dare you say that you respect my marriage and wish us well and say that if we go down to Alabama they can discriminate against us,"" he said. Maloney has run ""millions of dollars of negative attack ads against Dr. Hayworth, which are not true, and we figured, what better way to respond than with her son,"" said Terence Michos, a Hayworth campaign adviser. Hayworth has also felt heat from the right. While in Congress, Hayworth was a member of the LGBT Equality Caucus, angering conservatives in her district.","Republican Nan Hayworth is challenging openly gay Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney .

"(CNN) -- For the first time in history, a woman has received the highest honor in mathematics, often nicknamed the Nobel Prize of mathematics. Since it was established in 1936, the Fields Medal had gone only to men, until Wednesday, when Maryam Mirzakhani received it in Seoul, South Korea, from the International Mathematical Union. ""This is a great honor. I will be happy if it encourages young female scientists and mathematicians,"" Mirzakhani said, according to a statement from Stanford University, where she is a professor. For those of us less versed in the uppermost echelons of mathematics and geometry than Mirzakhani, it's mind-twisting to understand the abstract accomplishments that got her field's highest recognition. Mirzakhani has delved into the depths of geometry, helping bring unexpected order to an area that many of her colleagues considered chaotic and hardly tamable. And her peers have found this very exciting. The International Mathematical Union called her long list of accomplishments in Reimann surfaces and moduli spaces ""stunning."" What are those? Simply put, those are complex geometric forms. Anyone who has had high school algebra and geometry may remember that shapes like squares, triangles, circles and spheres are described by mathematical formulas. But jump to more complex, roundish, theoretical objects, like perfectly formed doughnuts, ultra-warped, crisscrossed potato chips, undulating geometric pretzels or uneven blobs like amoebas. That's getting close to the kind of math and geometry Mirzakhani works with. Go deeper, and things can appear to descend into infinite chaos. Find that intimidating? Some bright mathematical minds do, too. ""Because of its complexities and inhomogeneity, moduli space has often seemed impossible to work on directly,"" the International Mathematical Union said. ""But not to Mirzakhani."" But even she finds those theoretical depths challenging. ""It is like being lost in a jungle and trying to use all the knowledge that you can gather to come up with some new tricks, and with some luck you might find a way out,"" she said. What's it good for? Mirzakhani's work was not driven by any practical purpose -- like engineering -- but purely to satisfy mathematical curiosity, to create more knowledge. The implications of her work go beyond just the description of shapes. Since her area of math also informs physicists, her work could help advance scientists' understanding of the origins of the universe and the workings of subatomic particles, which could have implications for engineering. The International Mathematical Union praised Mirzakhani for her mastery of various contrasting aspects of mathematics. Equally as impressive is how Mirzakhani got to where she is today. From Tehran to Stanford . She discovered her knack for numbers in high school in her native Iran, where she grew up in the capital, Tehran. Media in Iran are also reporting about her achievement. ""It is fun -- it's like solving a puzzle or connecting the dots in a detective case,"" she said. As a teenager, she gained international attention when she won gold medals in two International Math Olympiads, achieving a perfect score in one of them. Mirzakhani got her undergraduate degree at Sharif University of Technology, then moved to the United States, where she went to work on her doctorate at Harvard University. She was an assistant professor at Princeton University before moving to Stanford. The Fields Medal, officially called the International Medal for Outstanding Discoveries in Mathematics, is awarded every four years. The past 52 recipients were men. This year's medal went to four recipients in total. The other three were also men.","The Fields Medal is often nicknamed the Nobel Prize of mathematics .

"Washington (CNN) -- House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi is tapping a fresh face -- 42-year-old Latino Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico -- to replace Rep. Steve Israel of New York at the helm of the party's campaign efforts. Israel chaired the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during the 2012 and 2014 elections but had said in the wake of this year's Republican victories that he wouldn't seek a third term in that role. Lujan, a former state utility regulator who was first elected to Congress in 2008, is set to start his fourth term representing a congressional district that includes Santa Fe. Pelosi tweeted the news of Lujan's selection Monday. Lujan is one of the Democratic caucuses younger members, a group that has faced pressure to bring newer members to the leadership table. Lujan will face a tall task: After a drubbing in the 2014 midterms, Democrats have just 186 House seats to the GOP's 244, with five races still undecided.","New Mexico Rep.

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- More artillery fire and shelling. More deaths. More disputes surrounding Russian convoys -- filled with aid, according to Moscow, though they were never checked by Ukrainian or International Red Cross officials -- that jetted in and out of eastern Ukraine. And out of all this, more questions whether the ceasefire in Ukraine -- if you can still call it that -- struck after talks involving officials from Kiev, Moscow and rebel-held areas can hold. In an interview with TV Tsentr, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the truce agreed upon in Minsk, Belarus, appeared to be holding generally and that Moscow, at least, is ready to work toward a long-term peace. ""Sporadic exchanges of fire occur on both sides, but the process of establishing (a) durable peace is still in progress,"" he said, according to parts of that interview published by the state-run Itar-Tass news agency. Progress was hard to see Saturday in Donetsk, one of the biggest cities in the war-torn region and a hotbed for clashes. Explosions and gunfire reverberated through the area around the city's airport, according to CNN crews on scene. National Defense and Security Council spokesman Col. Andriy Lysenko said in a televised Kiev news briefing that a GRAD missile system was used in the attack on the airport, from three different points in the area. Donetsk City Council reported that at least two homes in the area were hit. The Kiev government claimed that Ukrainian military positions were also being targeted in at least 15 other spots around Donetsk and at least three around Luhansk, according to the Ukrinform state news agency. A spokesman for Ukraine's national defense council said at least one Ukrainian solider had been killed and five others wounded since the announcement of the truce. Russian convoy rolls in and out of Ukraine, unchecked . One of the biggest disputes Saturday in Ukraine didn't involve rockets, shells or bullets but rather -- according to Moscow -- desperately needed aid. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has monitors in Ukraine, said that Russian vehicles began showing up late Friday near the border. By 7:45 a.m. Saturday (12:45 a.m. ET), all had crossed into Ukraine -- and all without having been checked for arms, ammunition or whatever else by Ukrainian border and customs officials. According to an OSCE statement, a self-identified Russian official said the process ""would not involve Ukrainian customs and border guard officers"" near the Donetsk crossing. A spokesman with Russia's Federal Security Service disputed such reports, according to RIA-Novosti, another official Russian news agency. ""Ukrainian border guards and customs officers were invited to run checks on the convoy at the 'Donetsk' checkpoint, but the Ukrainian side rejected the offer,"" the spokesman said. The trucks carried 2,000 tons of food, generators, medicine and blankets went into the Luhansk region, Itar-Tass reported. Once there, the report said the convoy was greeted by people lining ""the roads, waving hands and Russian flags, many women crying."" They were back in Russia by 5:30 p.m. This is the second time that Russia has sent a convoy into the region without the Kiev-based government's OK. It also happened in late August, raising concerns that the trucks main intent was not to relieve suffering by citizens but arm the pro-Russian separatists that Kiev blames for the violence and unrest. Sanctions target Russia . A new round of EU sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine came into effect Friday, targeting six companies and a number of Russian officials and separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine. This was a day after U.S. President Barack Obama announced that, in coordination with the European Union, ""we will intensify our coordinated sanctions on Russia in response to its illegal actions in Ukraine."" Russia in return accused the United States of once again escalating the crisis -- undermining the chances for peace there as well as the greater quest for ""global stability."" Kiev and the West accuse Russian President Vladimir Putin of arming and supporting the pro-Russia rebels, and of sending Russian troops into Ukraine. A NATO military officer said Thursday that Russia has about 1,000 troops inside eastern Ukraine, down from a significantly higher number in recent weeks. NATO also sees 20,000 more Russian troops aligned along the border, according to the NATO officer, who was not named according to standard practice in the organization. Yatsenyuk: Values outweigh tanks . Speaking at Ukraine's biggest annual political forum, the YES Forum, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said that the latest round of sanctions are ""the real threat"" to the Russian economy. ""Putin's idea was to split the unity among EU member states and to split the unity between the U.S. and the EU. And at a certain period of time I was thinking even that he succeed. But no, he failed,"" he said. ""Values, EU values, and values of freedom and democracy are much stronger than Russian tanks and artillery and his autocratic regime."" Yatsenyuk claimed that Putin's ultimate goal was ""not to just take Donetsk and Luhansk, his goal is to take the entire Ukraine. ""He cannot cope with an idea that Ukraine would be a part of the big EU family. He wants to restore the Soviet Union."" A day earlier, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko told the same forum that the latest sanctions against Russia demonstrate Europe's unity and solidarity with Ukraine. ""It shows how close Ukraine is for every leader, every European country,"" said Poroshenko. Russia blasts new sanctions as counterproductive, 'confrontational' CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta, Laura Smith-Spark reported and wrote from London, and Reza Sayah reported from Donetsk.

"(CNN) -- It's been one year since the bodies of the McStay family were found in the Mojave Desert. An off-road motorcyclist reported possible skeletal remains in two shallow graves on November 11, 2013. Dental records confirmed that those graves held the bodies of Joseph McStay, his wife Summer and their two young sons, Gianni and Joseph Jr. Just last week, authorities announced a major break in the case with the arrest of Charles ""Chase"" Merritt, the man they think is responsible for the deaths. Who is Chase Merritt? In his first on-camera interview since Merritt's arrest, Joseph McStay's father described his reaction to the latest development. ""A lot of people will say it's like lifting a ton off your shoulders. I said, no, it was more to me like a boulder falling on me,"" Patrick McStay told CNN's Randi Kaye. The McStay family disappeared in February 2010, and Patrick McStay has been working tirelessly to figure out what happened to them. He has even had numerous conversations with Merritt. Asked what he would like to ask Merritt now, Patrick McStay said he wouldn't ask anything. ""There'd be one person coming out of that room,"" he said. Merritt, 57, is charged with four counts of murder in the deaths of the McStay family. His arraignment is set for November 12. Police say they believe the family died of ""blunt force trauma"" inside their home north of San Diego, but they declined to discuss specifics of the deaths or a motive. Earlier this year, Kaye interviewed Merritt, who was a close friend and business partner of Joseph McStay. Merritt said at the time he had ""absolutely no clue"" what happened to the McStays. Merritt and McStay met for a business lunch in Rancho Cucamonga on February 4, 2010, the day the family disappeared. ""I am definitely the last person he saw,"" Merritt said during the January interview. Merritt also told CNN they were also on the phone constantly, perhaps 12 to 13 times that day. There was another call from McStay's phone to Merritt the night of the family's disappearance. It came about 40 minutes after a neighbor's security camera captured the family's Isuzu pulling out of their cul-de-sac. Merritt didn't answer. Merritt told CNN's Kaye he was watching television with his then-girlfriend, and he picked up the phone, looked at it and set it back down. He was tired. He called back the next day, he said. ""There are hundreds of scenarios. I have gone over all of them in my head,"" he said. ""Of course I regret not picking up the phone."" Merritt was questioned by police after the disappearance. They just asked him the ""standard questions,"" he said. He also claimed to have taken a polygraph test. Police had never named Merritt as a suspect before his arrest last Wednesday. He has served time in prison, according to criminal records from California, but none of the crimes involved violence. San Bernardino authorities said Friday that after reviewing 4,500 pages of investigative records, executing 60 search warrants and conducting 200 interviews, they believe Merritt acted alone.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday searched desperately for ways it could avoid a sweeping ruling in what one justice called a ""tinderbox"" legal fight over perhaps the most vexing diplomatic issue -- unrest in the Middle East. Menachem Zivotofsky, 12, and his family want the American citizen's passport to say he was born in Jerusalem, Israel. But the U.S. State Department, ignoring a congressional law, will not allow the boy to list his country of birth on the document, only Jerusalem. The Obama administration maintains a strict neutrality policy over the holy city's sovereignty. Both Israelis and Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their capital, but the international community does not recognize either position. The Zivotofskys framed the case as a ""small gesture"" for a boy, which does not implicate the U.S. government's ongoing efforts to secure a binding, lasting peace settlement for the troubled region. Supreme Court to decide if boy can list Israel as passport birthplace . At issue is a classic tug of war between the executive and legislative branches of government -- specifically whether a federal law that explicitly directs the State Department how to record the birthplace of an American citizen on a passport impermissibly infringes on the president's power to recognize a foreign sovereign. More than 50,000 Americans were born in Jerusalem since the law was passed in 2002. In a brisk hour of oral arguments, the nine justices seemed especially torn about how to decide the case, many looking for a way perhaps to rule narrowly. Many on the bench were at odds over whether this mix of politics, diplomacy and religion will result in de facto recognition of Israel's unilateral sovereignty over Jerusalem. ""You say that this isn't recognition,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy told the Zivotofskys' attorney. ""So the ultimate conflict is not before us and therefore, the government's policy, which says that this is recognition, should be given deference and it trumps."" Justice Antonin Scalia said, ""Congress is entitled to do what it is authorized to do under the Constitution, even when that contradicts"" with the views of the executive branch, And as far as the passport issue, ""the fact that the State Department doesn't like the fact that it makes the Palestinians angry is irrelevant."" Case heard during growing unrest in Jerusalem . The debate comes during a week of unrest in Jerusalem, with daily protests near sacred sites and fears of a third intifada, or Palestinian uprising. Temple Mount crisis fuels unrest in volatile Jerusalem . The case could have broader implications over U.S. foreign policy. The justices raised ongoing debates over those born in British-controlled Northern Ireland; whether Taiwan should be recognized as independent of China; and the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine over disputed territory, including Crimea. Jerusalem's Old City is the heart of the region, a holy symbol to the three major Abrahamic religions -- Christianity, Islam and Judaism. That tiny area -- just a third of one square mile -- contains the Temple Mount, Western Wall, Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque. It has been destroyed twice -- and attacked, besieged and captured more than 100 times. Canaanites, Hebrews, Arabs, Greeks, Romans, Persians, Crusaders, Turks and the British have all laid claim to the land. Its status today remains one the thorniest issues blocking a comprehensive Mideast peace agreement, with both Israel and the Palestinian people claiming sovereignty. During the 1948 war, the western part of the city was annexed by the newly formed nation of Israel, and the eastern part annexed by Jordan. Israel then captured the eastern part during the 1967 Six-Day War. It considers East Jerusalem part of its ""undivided capital,"" but most of the international community deems the annexations illegal and a part of Palestinian land. The Israeli government is based there, but no foreign embassies are. The city is home to Ari and Naomi Zivotofsky. The couple and their two oldest sons were born in the United States, but the family migrated to Israel a decade ago, and in October 2002 the youngest, Menachem Binyamin, was born. ""We're very proud of the fact that he was born in Israel and that we live in Israel and it's the modern state of Israel,"" Ari Zivotofsky told CNN. ""Religiously and historically, that's very significant."" The father said his son -- who has been at the center of this legal fight for 11 of his 12 years -- frequently reminds his siblings he is the one Zivotofsky born in their current home. The boy is preparing for his bar mitzvah. Bush's 'signing statement' Three weeks before Menachem was born, Congress gave American citizens born in Jerusalem the individual discretion to ask that Israel be listed on passports and consular reports, where it says ""Place of Birth."" President George W. Bush signed the bill but issued an executive ""signing statement"" indicating he would not comply. The law, he said, ""impermissibly interferes with the president's constitutional authority to conduct the nation's foreign affairs and to supervise the unitary executive branch."" The State Department's official Foreign Affairs Manual still reads: ""For a person born in Jerusalem, write Jerusalem as the place of birth in the passport. Do not write Israel, Jordan or West Bank for a person born within the current municipal borders of Jerusalem."" It is not the first time Congress and the White House have clashed over the region. The American Embassy remains in Tel Aviv over U.S. lawmakers' objections. Competition to speak among justices . During Monday's oral arguments in the case, Zivotofsky v. Kerry, there was much competition on the bench to speak. Chief Justice John Roberts at one point had to referee and allow Kennedy, with his seniority, to go first. ""You want us to say in our opinion that this is not a political declaration?"" Kennedy asked attorney Alyza Lewin of the 12-year-old congressional law. When told that was true, ""Well, then, I'm not sure why that Congress passed it then."" Kennedy offered a compromise, suggesting what a select number of U.S. passports might say: ""The place of birth on this Jerusalem-born citizen's passport has been listed as Israel at the holder's request. This designation is neither an acknowledgment nor a declaration by the Department of State or the President of the United States that Jerusalem is within the borders of the State of Israel."" But Justice Elena Kagan -- who along with Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor seemed most supportive of the administration's assertions -- wondered ""(i)f Congress then passed a law saying that (hypothetical) statement had to come off the passport, could Congress do that?"" ""Why is it that it's OK for Congress to say something that hasn't happened, meaning to say that someone born in Jerusalem is actually born in Israel?"" Sotomayor added. ""I mean, they can self-identify all they want, but can they do that?"" Representing the government, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli framed the issue in larger terms, saying the congressional law in effect would ""force the executive branch to issue official diplomatic communications that contradict the position of the United States."" Justice Samuel Alito asked, ""But is that really true? Could Congress pass a law saying that every passport issued to an American citizen must list the place of birth, including country, and that for this purpose, the country is the nation that issued the birth certificate to that individual? Could Congress do that?"" Zivotofsky's attorney, Lewin, concluded by saying granting the boy's request would be a ""nonissue"" and have no long-term effect since the Jerusalem passports -- by simply listing ""Israel"" would be indistinguishable from those who were born elsewhere in Israel. ""This seems a particularly unfortunate week to be making this kind of, 'Oh, it's no big deal' argument,"" said Kagan, referring the recent violent protests in Jerusalem. ""History suggests that everything is a big deal with respect to the status of Jerusalem. And right now Jerusalem is a tinderbox because of issues about the status of and access to a particularly holy site there. And so sort of everything matters, doesn't it?"" A ruling in the case is due by the spring.","A boy, 12, and his family want his passport to say he was born in Israel .

"(CNN) -- The Michael Brown case has great significance because it is yet another in a growing line of tragedies that further demand a conversation about our civil liberties within the criminal justice system. It has highlighted a massive lack of trust that exists between police and minorities. We must face the inconsistencies and the biases that remain if we are ever to move towards a system worthy of the trust it needs to succeed. Only by doing so can we end the devastating loss of life that is becoming an all-too-common occurrence. We have another opportunity to become focused on and vocal about the changes that are necessary. It is only by bringing those problems to the forefront and into the harsh light of constant and public critique that we can hope to make a better system. I still contend our criminal justice system is the best in the world for dispensing true justice, but, like every facet of the American democratic experience, it can use polishing. However, I reject the notion that the system is incapable of dispensing justice in cases where young, unarmed black men and women are killed. With my experience representing George Zimmerman as a backdrop, I've been following a number of cases that have overtones of Ferguson, and I know that we have made progress: . Earlier this month, Michael Dunn received a life sentence for the murder of Jordan Davis in the so-called ""loud music"" trial. In January, a grand jury indicted Officer Randall Kerrick on voluntary manslaughter charges after fatally shooting unarmed Jonathan Ferrell. And on August 7, a jury in Michigan convicted Ted Wafer of second-degree murder for shooting Renisha McBride on his front porch. The verdict came just two days before the Michael Brown shooting. Black victims, white shooters. Certain commentators have suggested we should skip the grand jury and that Officer Darren Wilson must be tried before a jury. While I laud the idea of having open trials, thereby allowing the public to view that the process works fairly, it is dangerous to short-circuit justice because of media attention or social pressure. We gave the Ferguson shooting an enhanced social significance before we knew all the facts of the case, facts we still don't know. The grand jury should not consider the broader social issues; they should focus on the facts. And if they decide, solely on the facts, to indict Wilson, only then should he stand trial. But in light of the recent press leaks regarding evidence in the case, most now suggest an indictment is not likely. I fear that those who equate justice with nothing other than an indictment of Wilson are allowing deep-seated predispositions against the system to infect how they define justice. We should not be asking for reparations at the cost of putting a thumb on the scales of justice in favor of convicting, or even charging, someone who does not, based upon the facts as viewed dispassionately, deserve it. I do not suggest trust in this system merely to quell the voices of criticism or to forestall the feelings of frustration. Rather I contend it is the only answer. So, what happens if the grand jury decides not to indict Darren Wilson? District Attorney McCullough committed that he will release all of the transcripts of the proceedings. This will give all the witness testimony, forensic evidence, and other information presented from which they decided not to indict. Transparency here is absolutely necessary. The Federal officials should not interfere with that release. If Wilson is not charged, there will, undoubtedly, be a backlash. Many people consider an indictment as a step for justice -- not only in this individual case -- but in the larger effort of balancing the racial inequities in our justice system. Conversely, a failure to indict Wilson will be seen as an indictment of the system. But that point of view is not only wrong, it is dangerous. I fear that pinning significant civil rights issues to the facts of this case may serve only to foster more mistrust in the system. It will create a greater racial divide, and it will create another generation of disenfranchised young black men and women who are less willing to become police officers or legislators or attorneys or judges at the very time that we need their leadership most. If the grand jury decides not to indict, they will do so because they concluded Officer Darren Wilson's shooting to be justified based upon his and Michael Brown's actions. While it is considered callous and insensitive to review the actions of a deceased person, it does none of us any good to ignore facts, should they exist. By doing so, we lose the lessons that may be learned from a dispassionate analysis of what actually happened that day, not what we as individuals, or we as communities, want to believe happened. The decision to indict or not can be a catalyst for us to move further apart, or it can be seen as an opportunity to critically analyze how these tragedies are occurring and how to stop them in the future. That choice, no matter how it may go against the grain of our emotions, is a voluntary one, but we must decide on the latter.","Grand jury hearing Michael Brown case; some believe there won't be indictment .

"(CNN) -- A fireplace isn't just a spot to keep logs and kindling. According to decorators and design enthusiasts, it's where you put your heart on display. Of course, in decorator speak, a fireplace serves as a design focal point, something you can use as a jumping-off point for furniture placement and accessories. It adds ""charm"" to any room. But in practical terms, what you choose to display on a mantel is something that will be seen -- and seen as important. Often coveted as a must-have detail for home buyers, fireplaces -- and mantels in particular -- evoke a specific feeling of tradition and comfort, decorator Emily Clark said. ""I think they represent the coziness and warmth that we envision when we think of what 'home' should be,"" she said. It doesn't matter whether the fireplace is regularly used, she said, noting that the climate around her North Carolina home doesn't always provide the opportunity for a roaring fire. Holly Modica of House by Holly said the time her family spends around their fireplace makes the cold, snowy days in Connecticut easier to bear. When hurricanes and recent record-breaking snowstorms caused power outages, their fireplace delivered. ""There is something so cozy about sitting by the fireplace and enjoying the moment,"" she said. But what if it's not cold? There's little reason to use a fireplace in the middle of a sweltering summer, but that won't stop decorators from giving their mantels the summertime treatment. Many decorators who contributed to this week's Open House assignment confessed to switching out their mantel decor often, at least once per season. Open House: No matchy-matchy in the bedroom, please . Light, bright and simple are the go-to decor philosophies for summer mantels. Fresh garden clippings in simple containers, seashells, driftwood, outdoor lanterns and cool shades of green and blue help keep the mind on beach vacations and lazy days. Thoughts of home . ""There is absolutely something nostalgic and magical about a fireplace,"" said Run to Radiance blogger Tania Griffis. ""While they aren't exactly a necessary thing to have these days, they represent a time period and a way of life where things were a little slower and more traditional."" She and her husband love their fireplace so much that they stared a Christmas tradition of pulling a mattress into the living room and sleeping nearby on Christmas Eve. Sometimes, as in Julia Konya's case, the memories associated with mantels are more literal. ""To me, a fireplace is a symbol of my childhood in Germany,"" she said. ""My family still has the same very traditional wood-burning fireplace from when I was growing up. It has a beautiful heavy stone mantel and is surrounded by a huge built-in library wall. ""We spent every winter and holiday around that fireplace,"" Konya said. ""While people in other homes used to put their family photos and knickknacks on their mantels, my mother never decorated like that. My mother always kept it simple and only displayed a few pieces of her inherited silver."" And that's a tradition Konya carries on, as seen on her blog Cuckoo4Design. There's just something special about fireplaces, Anisa Darnell of Milk and Honey Home said. Aside from hanging stockings from the mantle during the winter holidays and lighting fires in the box for cold weather ambiance, ""we take all of our big family photos in front of ours,"" she said. Open House: Steps to a decorated staircase . Application of tchotchkes . For decorating purposes, a mantel is essentially a shelf. But it's not usually very deep, and there's no right or wrong way to decorate it. And that can stymie the best-laid decorating plans. Although mounting a flat-screen television above a fireplace is one modern solution to the ""focal point"" part of the decorating equation, it's also the part of a room where modern decorators feel comfortable about ""breaking the rules,"" said Elizabeth Baumgartner of The Little Black Door. Memories of mantels cluttered with formal portraits, holiday cards and the urns of loved ones have given way to the idea of a mantel being a piece of art, she said: ""I love that people are reclaiming it and making it their own."" ""A mantel is a great way to showcase what is meaningful and beautiful to you,"" said Corrie Moore, the owner of Little House on the Update. ""People are using mantels as more of a showpiece now. Before, it was just a shelf to set things on."" ""They also tell a story,"" Modica said. ""You can easily change your decorations out for every season and display things that you really love. It could be as simple as one or two things or as many as you want. It's your story."" Open House: Are you brave enough to decorate boldly in the foyer? Stories large and small . As staircase pictures walls and gallery-style picture hanging continue to gain popularity, the mantel is now the place for decorative items. ""Scale is an important challenge when decorating a mantel,"" Modica said. ""Finding that perfect big item may take some time. An oil painting, a mirror or just an interesting empty antique frame are all good options."" Smaller items resting on the mantel help balance out the bigger items. But sometimes those smaller items get tricky, said Stephanie Zell of Atlanta. Her home has a double-sided fireplace, with one side facing the living room and the other her bedroom. ""The biggest challenge for me is trying to edit the items on the mantel,"" she said. ""Sometimes I can go overboard and find too many things I want to stick on it, (and they) don't necessarily go together."" Baumgartner sticks to arranging items in groups of odd numbers, making sure the items share a similar color or shape. ""I think the biggest challenge is knowing how much is enough,"" she said. ""Be sure to include some negative, or empty, space to make it more pleasing to the eye."" Or, you can run with that space, like Holly Browning of Down to Earth Style does. ""Nothing is wrong with a very simple mantel, so if you don't think you got it right, keep it sparse,"" she said. ""(It's) a much better choice than adding clutter.""

"(CNN) -- On Sunday, Pope John Paul II and Pope John XXIII were canonized as saints of the Roman Catholic Church. This event clearly has intense significance for Catholics, but what about everyone else? Why should non-Catholics even care? Both men are widely popular among the laity, and the ceremony drew an enormous crowd. Both men also have critics. Some conservative Catholics still work to roll back the reforms of the Second Vatican Council called forth by John XXIII. Many Catholics strongly critique John Paul II's centralizing tendencies and catastrophic response to all the sex abuse scandals. For Catholics, however, saints don't have to be perfect. In fact, Catholics are inspired by the ability of saints to do good despite their human flaws. The process of canonization concentrates devotion on the best features of a historical person. In 1903, long before John XXIII was elected Pope, he wrote about each saint being ""holy in a different way."" These differences enhance, rather than detract, the importance of saints. So what might non-Catholics take away from this? First, both saints offer a model of risk-taking based on a strong sense of moral purpose. Second, one could learn a lot about what's going on with the billion or so Catholics in the world today. The dual canonizations, it turns out, symbolize an attempt to turn the church away from decades of infighting and turf wars and toward a mission for the common good. David O'Hara, associate professor of philosophy of religion at Augustana College, said, ""It should matter to us when our neighbors announce that they have designated new moral exemplars."" If our neighbors tell us a new story about their ideals, heroes and models for their own lives, then ""we have an interest in watching and even in helping our neighbors to tell that story in a way that is beneficial."" Beneficial -- but how? Claire Noonan, vice president for Mission and Ministry at Dominican University in Illinois, suggested that we all might be inspired by their risk-taking. Both men, she said, ""moved through the world discerning where, when and how to act without fear. The possibilities of their lives were not constricted by desires for wealth, power or honor. That freedom makes way for the pursuit of truth, justice and love."" Noonan cites John Paul II's work against communist oppression in Poland and John XXIII's efforts to ""free the entire church from the fear of modernism."" Nonbelievers can, if they choose, admire these examples of courage and action without believing that the two men have a special status in heaven or endorsing everything that they did. In that framework, the process of canonization crystallizes the memory of the two popes around their best deeds. The canonizations, though, do more than provide strong examples of moral courage. They reveal something very important about the aspirations of Pope Francis for the role of the Catholic Church in the world. According to Catholic belief, popes do not make people into saints; God does. Canonization, an all-too human practice, is the process of recognizing divinely given sanctity. As John Allen Jr. has written, ideally this is a deeply democratic process, with devotion to a holy person flowing upward from the laity to the hierarchy. Canonization provides an opportunity to shape memory. People become recognized as saints, in part, through storytelling, a topic I study as an historian of the Middle Ages. When we choose what stories to tell about a person, we reveal a lot about ourselves, our hopes and fears, the ways in which we might try to do better personally, and the kinds of changes we'd like to see in the world. That's been true since the early centuries of Christianity, a period in which sainthood was generally bestowed by local and regional communities without any broader oversight from church authorities. If a group of people believed that someone was a saint, and they set up shrines, venerated relics, developed rituals and told stories about miracles -- then that person was a saint. During the Middle Ages, the papacy asserted ever-increasing control over the process of who got to tell the stories of saints. While the vox populi still matters, next Sunday is Pope Francis' show. The symbolism of the twin canonizations is so powerful, in fact, that the editorial board of the New Catholic Reporter reacted to the announcement last July by declaring that truly ""the pontificate of Francis has begun."" Robert Ellsberg, author of several popular books about saints, suggested that by linking the canonizations, Francis is trying to start a new narrative. Ellsberg said, ""The internal Catholic cultural wars and polarization have increasingly embittered a lot of the internal life of the church. Overcoming some of those divisions and synthesizing some of the best and noblest features of these two popes by joining them, is a hopeful sign for anyone who is concerned about the future of humanity."" If the canonizations of Popes John XXIII and John Paul II can inspire more of us, as individuals, to find a moral purpose and take risks, our lives will be better for it. If the canonizations can help lead the Catholic Church away from bitter division and toward taking powerful moral positions on the world stage, especially following Francis' focus on poverty and inequality, we'll all be better for it.","Pope John Paul II and Pope John XXIII were canonized as saints .

"(CNN) -- Several hundred demonstrators clashed with officers in riot gear in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Sunday in a protest that raged for more than 12 hours, ending around midnight, CNN affiliate KOAT reported. The protesters were enraged by what they called police brutality in the March 16 shooting of James M. Boyd. KOAT reported that Boyd was homeless. The U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into the shooting, as have the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Mexico, the Justice Department said in a release. Meanwhile, arrests were made related to the protest, KOAT said. Mayor Richard Berry told the station that an officer was spat on and hit with a rock and another officer was trapped in a patrol car. Police shooting protest 'turns hostile' The mayor praised the police department for how it handled the protest, saying officers did an ""exceptional job of de-escalating situations when we have protesters who obviously"" want to ""escalate the situation."" ""We want people to be able to protest,"" Berry added. But he said the demonstration was plagued by a ""smaller group of individuals whose main goal"" was to ""put the public and themselves in danger."" According to KOAT, protesters began gathering at about noon Sunday, and made their way to the city's Civic Plaza, the University of New Mexico and the Albuquerque Police Department.

"(CNN) -- You know a club is exclusive when they won't even let the Queen in. For almost 200 years Britain's Royal Yacht Squadron has had a strict men-only policy, meaning even its patron, Queen Elizabeth II, was denied entry. But it seems the tide has finally turned for the world's most prestigious sailing club, after it voted in favor of allowing women to become members for the first time in its history. The elite club, based in the dramatic 16th century Cowes Castle on the Isle of Wight in southern Britain, unanimously voted for the new rules this week. Of its 475 members, 150 attended the meeting -- all agreeing to introduce the rules from Spring next year. The membership changes require no further vote, but still need to be ratified by all members. Founded in 1815, the yacht club has an illustrious place in British history, launching the first ever America's Cup -- so named after the New York Yacht Club beat their English rivals in their boat ""America."" In 1826, the club also started the annual Cowes Week sailing regatta, which kicked off on Monday and features more than 8,000 sailors from across the world. The squadron's grand castle marks the start line for Cowes Week races, firing cannons over the water. While the prestigious club is currently open to ""gentlemen actively interested in yachting,"" in reality usually people of the upper classes are invited to join. To become a member, you must still be voted in through another member. The Queen's husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, is the club's Admiral, while Queen Elizabeth II herself is a patron -- though not officially a member. British sailor Dee Caffari, the only woman to have circumnavigated the globe three times, said the change in rules could encourage more women to join the sport. ""Making such bold changes to clubs with strong traditions and heritage takes time -- we've seen it take place at Lords in cricket, we have recently discussed female club members at Muirfield during the Golf Open and now we are seeing a change at the Royal Yacht Squadron,"" she told CNN. ""Many yachts have women amongst the team members so this now allows the club to better reflect the sport of sailing. It also highlights the uniqueness of our sport that it is one of the few sports that allow men and women to compete on a level playing field."" In the early 1960s, the club did allow Lady Associate Members, who were allowed to use facilities.","Britain's Royal Yacht Squadron to admit female members .

"(CNN) -- Of all the terrible conflicts facing the world in 2013, Syria is undoubtedly the most complex and dangerous. Violence has left four million people inside Syria in desperate need of help -- shelter, food, education, clean water, health care and protection -- and has uprooted two million inside the country and sent 600,000 fleeing the horrors of war into neighboring countries. Now a bitter winter is the new enemy. Syria's children suffer the most. At least half of all those affected by the conflict are children. Too many have been injured or killed; too many have seen family and friends die, their homes and schools reduced to rubble. The good news is our aid is reaching approximately 1.5 million Syrians, even in areas of fighting -- children are being vaccinated, and temporary schools are being set up, families are being fed and sheltered -- thanks to our work and to the valiant, efforts of many partners like the Syrian Arab Red Crescent. But we could do so much more. There are areas inside Syria where our ability to deliver is intermittent at best; where we cannot reach those in need of our help. We appeal to all the parties involved in the conflict to grant unrestricted humanitarian access inside Syria. Sadly, if this appeal continues to go unheeded, we fear the already horrific level of suffering will become even worse. Crisis in Syria: The Refugees . With each passing day, and each passing week it becomes harder for Syrians to endure. Most cannot flee and find safe havens in neighboring countries. Some find precarious refuge with friends or the kindness of strangers in another town. Others shelter in abandoned, unheated buildings or makeshift camps. Many find themselves moving from one place to another, again and again as the conflict spreads. Living conditions in all areas of the country are deteriorating rapidly. It is not only the violence that people fear, but the combined threat of hunger, cold and illness. Neighboring countries have opened their borders to 600,000 Syrian refugees and, with the help of humanitarian organizations like ours, offer basic support for their survival. But even they face difficult challenges. Most refugees are children who have escaped with mothers and grandmothers. Now, many have been refugees for 21 months. It has been UNHCR's job to register them and provide them with shelter and basic relief items like mattresses, blankets and kitchen sets. What's next for Syria in 2013? In most places, WFP vouchers allow them to buy fresh food from the market. UNICEF helps children overcome their trauma, gets them into schools, and gives them with books and supplies and access to better health. Host communities open their homes and their hearts. Host governments provide medical and other community services. As the numbers of refugees grow, so does the strain on these host governments. The resources provided by Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq are dangerously stretched. No one can predict how long this will last. What is needed now is support from the entire international community to asylum countries and organizations like ours to help us do more. In December, the U.N. appealed for $1.5 billion for the humanitarian response both inside and outside Syria and we are urging donors to contribute more. If the conflict can't be stopped now, the least we can do is ease the suffering. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of António Guterres, Ertharin Cousin and Anthony Lake.","Four million people inside Syria are in desperate need of help .

"(CNN) -- The pilot of an air tanker battling a wildfire at Yosemite National Park died after the tanker crashed, Cal Fire said. The tanker was being used to help battle Dog Rock Fire when authorities lost contact with its pilot Tuesday afternoon, Cal Fire spokesman Daniel Berlant said in a statement. Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said the plane -- which had only one pilot on board -- went down near an entrance to the park. On Wednesday, officials identified the pilot as Geoffrey ""Craig"" Hunt, 62. ""We continue to mourn the tragic loss of Craig,"" said Chief Ken Pimlott, Cal Fire director. ""We know wildland firefighting is an inherently dangerous job, but Craig made the ultimate sacrifice."" Video from CNN affiliate KCRA showed smoke and flames rising from what appeared to be a tree-lined ridge in a remote valley. A helicopter could be seen dropping what appeared to be water on the blaze before flying from the scene. The tanker that crashed was an S-2T, one of several aircraft that Cal Fire deploys to battle wildfires. According to Cal Fire, it bought 26 such planes from the U.S. Department of Defense in 1996 and fitted them ""with modern, powerful turboprop engines"" that made them ""faster, safer, and more maneuverable."" All but a few of those planes, equipped with a payload of retardant to drop on flames, are now being used statewide. The aircraft went down ""under unknown circumstances,"" said Gregor, the FAA spokesman. The Dog Rock Fire was reported around 2:45 p.m. (5:45 p.m. ET) Tuesday between the park boundary and the Arch Rock entrance station. The blaze has already prompted the evacuation of 60 homes, most of them vacation rentals, in the park's Foresta area, according to Cobb.","NEW: The pilot is identified as Geoffrey ""Craig"" Hunt, 62 .

"New York (CNN) -- Evidence in the investigation of the controversial chokehold death of Staten Island man Eric Garner will be presented to a grand jury, prosecutors announced Tuesday. The grand jury will convene in September, Richmond County District Attorney Daniel M. Donovan said. Garner, 43, died on July 17 after police confronted him on Staten Island for allegedly selling cigarettes illegally. During the encounter, a video shows a police officer grabbing the 350-pound man in a chokehold and pulling him onto a sidewalk. The New York City Police Department prohibits the chokehold tactic. ""After a careful review of the recent findings of the Medical Examiner regarding the cause and manner of Mr. Garner's death, I have determined that it is appropriate to present evidence regarding the circumstances of his death to a Richmond County Grand Jury,"" Donovan said in a statement. Prosecutors provided no additional information about the exact date that the grand jury will convene, what witnesses will testify, what criminal charges will be considered or whom those charges could be levied against. The New York City medical examiner ruled Garner's death a homicide. The cause of death was ""compression of neck (choke hold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police."" The controversial death has sparked several anti-police demonstrations throughout New York City in the month since it happened. Demonstrators have called the police response during his arrest excessive and criminal. Opinion: What led to chokehold death? In his statement, Donovan said that prosecutors are committed to conducting ""a fair, thorough and responsible investigation into Mr. Garner's death,"" adding that ""no person is above the law, nor beneath its protection."" The video that surfaced after his death shows Garner lying on the ground motionless after he was taken down by a group of officers. Garner, an asthmatic, was later declared dead at a nearby hospital. After the incident, New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton ordered an extensive review of the New York Police Department's training procedures. Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who is seen on the video choking Garner, was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun amid the investigation, the NYPD said. A second police officer was placed on desk duty. Two EMTs and two paramedics also were suspended without pay, said Erika Hellstrom, vice president of development at Richmond University Medical Center. Garner, a grandfather with six children, had a lengthy criminal history, including more than 30 arrests, and had been arrested for selling untaxed cigarettes in May, police said.

"(CNN) -- The Marquez brothers Marc and Alex made motorcycling history Sunday with a double triumph in the final round of the season in Valencia. Marc, who had already wrapped up a second straight MotoGP crown, set a new record for wins in a season with his 13th, while his 18-year-old younger brother clinched the Moto3 crown. It means they are the only brothers to hold titles in the same season and it can only be a matter of time before they are direct rivals in the top echelon of the sport. Alex, who will be promoted to the Moto2 class next season, finished third in the final race, enough to hold off Australian Jack Miller, who won in Valencia, by just two points. He then watched as Marc overcame tricky conditions to round off another triumphant season on his Repsol Honda with an emphatic victory. He started from fifth on the grid after a crash in qualifying Saturday, but quickly worked his way through the field. Marquez eventually took the lead on the 11th lap and had opened up a near four-second advantage by the time he took the checkered flag from Italian legend Valentino Rossi, who clinched second in the title race. Marquez's teammate Daniel Pedrosa took the final spot on the podium, while Andrea Dovizioso held off his Ducati teammate Cal Crutchlow for fourth. Marquez, who tied Mick Doohan's 1997 record of 12 runs in the previous round in Malaysia, said he had been inspired by his brother's earlier triumph. ""The truth is I am very, very happy. During the race at times I was thinking of my brother and thought I had to do well,"" he admitted. The 18-round season has proved an all-Spanish affair at the top of all the categories, with Esteve Rabat having already clinched the Moto2 crown.","Marc Marquez wins season-ending MotoGP race in Valencia .

"(CNN) -- Colombian and Mexican drug cartels have jumped the Atlantic Ocean and expanded into West Africa, working closely with local criminal gangs to carve out a staging area for an assault on the lucrative European market. Authorities destroy cannabis found in Ivory Coast. West Africa is appealing to drug traffickers from Latin America. The situation has gotten so out of hand that tiny Guinea-Bissau, the fifth-poorest nation in the world, is being called Africa's first narco-state. Others talk about how Africa's Gold Coast has become the Coke Coast. In all, officials say, at least nine top-tier Latin American drug cartels have established bases in 11 West African nations. ""The same organizations that we investigate in Central and South America that are involved in drug activity toward the United States are engaged in this trafficking in Western Africa,"" said Russell Benson, the Drug Enforcement Agency regional director for Europe and Africa. ""There's not one country that hasn't been touched to some extent."" The calculus is simple: bigger profits in Europe than in the United States, less law enforcement in West Africa than in Europe. The driving force is the booming European market for cocaine. ""The exponential rise in the number of consumers has made Europe the fastest-growing and most-profitable market in the world,"" said Bruce Bagley, dean of the Graduate School of International Studies at the University of Miami. While the European market has been expanding, use in the United States has declined from its peak in the 1980s, the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime said in its 2009 annual report, issued in July. ""Cocaine use prevalence in the USA is 50 percent lower than it was two decades ago, while Spain, Italy, Portugal, France and the United Kingdom have all seen cocaine use double or triple in recent years,"" the U.N. report said. About 1,000 tons of pure cocaine are produced each year, nearly 60 percent of which evades law enforcement interception and makes it to market, the report said. That's a wholesale global market of about $70 billion. Criminals traffic about 250 tons to Europe each year, though not all of it makes it there, the U.N. said. The European market totals about $11 billion. About 27 percent of the cocaine that entered Europe in 2006 came from Africa, the United Nations said. Huge profits make Europe particularly attractive. Two pounds of uncut cocaine can sell for $22,000 in the United States but for $45,000 in Europe, analyst Ashley-Louise Bybee wrote in a policy journal this year. The Justice Department said the price in Europe can be three times more than in the United States. ""It's a significant market for them to exploit,"" Benson said. A strong euro and weaker dollar also make Europe attractive to traffickers because of favorable exchange rates. There's also the fact that the European Union recently issued a 500 euro note, currently equivalent to about $700. The largest U.S. denomination in circulation is the $100 bill. Traffickers prefer the large euro notes because they are easier to carry in large quantities. For example, Benson said that $1 million in $100 bills weighs 22 pounds, while $1 million in 500 euro notes weighs 3.5 pounds. ""It's a huge difference,"" he said. Though Europe is highly attractive to traffickers, it can have tight, Western-style security. So the Colombian and Mexican cartels have discovered that it's much easier to smuggle large loads into West Africa and then break that up into smaller shipments to the continent -- mostly Spain, the United Kingdom and France. West Africa is a smuggler's dream, suffering from a combination of factors that make the area particularly vulnerable. It is among the poorest and least stable regions in the world. Governments are weak and ineffective and, as a top DEA chief testified to the U.S. Senate this summer, officials are often corrupt. Law enforcement also is largely riddled with corruption. Criminal gangs are rampant. Foot soldiers can be recruited from a large pool of poor and desperate youth. ""It's a point of least resistance,"" Benson said. West Africa refers to Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. ""This area of the world is ripe,"" Bagley said. ""There has been very little attention paid to it. The United States is loath to give aid to these countries because they are corrupt."" U.S. authorities find themselves at a great disadvantage fighting cartels that have much more money and guns. The DEA has four offices -- in Egypt, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa -- to cover a continent that spans 11.7 million square miles and has nearly 1 billion people. ""It's a big place,"" Benson acknowledges, noting that there are 54 countries on the continent. Local police also are vastly outgunned. Guinea-Bissau offers an alarming example. ""The Judicial Police ... have 60 agents, one vehicle and often no fuel,"" analyst Bybee wrote in a journal called New Voices in Public Policy, published by the George Mason University School of Public Policy. ""As a result, when culprits are apprehended, they are driven in a taxi to the police station. They just recently received six sets of handcuffs from the U.K., which were badly needed. In the military, one rusty ship patrols the 350-kilometer (217-mile) coastline and 88 islands."" Even when criminals are caught, Bybee said, ""the near absence of a judicial system allows traffickers to operate unimpeded."" For example, she said, ""because the police are so impotent, the culprits are often held for just a few hours before senior military personnel suddenly attain extraordinary judicial powers to demand their release."" The few officials who stand up to the traffickers receive death threats or are killed. West Africa also is particularly attractive to traffickers because it is near ""the soft underbelly of Europe,"" said retired four-star Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who was drug policy director for President Clinton. Geography plays another role because West Africa is fairly close to the three South American nations that produce nearly all of the world's cocaine -- Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. Many of the shipments depart from Venezuela, which shares a 1,273-mile (2,050-kilometer) porous border with Colombia and is even closer to Africa. ""They go right dead-ass across the shortest route,"" McCaffrey said. Most of the cocaine shipments cross the Atlantic in large ""mother ships"" and then are off-loaded to small vessels near the coastline, the United Nations said. Small planes modified for overseas flight that can carry a 1-ton cargo also have been used. Most of those come from Venezuela, the United Nations reported. A report issued in July by the Government Accountability Office said traffickers use go-fast boats, fishing vessels and commercial shipping containers as the primary means of smuggling cocaine out of Venezuela. McCaffrey also noted the use of go-fast boats and special planes. DEA Assistant Administrator Thomas Harrigan testified before the Senate in June that authorities in Sierra Leone seized a cocaine shipment last year from a twin-engine aircraft marked with a Red Cross insignia. The flight originated in Venezuela, he said. The GAO report noted that ""U.S. government officials have observed an increase in suspicious air traffic originating in Venezuela."" In 2004, the report said, authorities tracked 109 suspect flights out of Venezuela. In 2007, officials tracked 178 suspicious flights. Then there's the crime connection in West Africa. ""Colombian and Venezuelan traffickers are entrenched in West Africa and have cultivated long-standing relationships with African criminal networks to facilitate their activities in the region,"" Harrigan told a Senate subcommittee on African affairs. ""These organizations don't operate in a vacuum,"" Benson said. ""They have to align themselves with West African criminal groups."" The cartels also have aligned themselves with terrorists, Harrigan said. ""The threat of narco-terrorism in Africa is a real concern, including the presence of international terrorist organizations operating or based in Africa, such as the regional threat presented by al Qaeda in the Lands of Maghreb,"" he said, referring to al Qaeda activists in North Africa. ""In addition, DEA investigations have identified elements of Colombia's Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia [FARC] as being involved in cocaine trafficking in West Africa."" Benson said the groups operating in Africa are ""primarily narcotics organizations"" but acknowledged that the Marxist FARC guerrillas in Colombia are a force to be dealt with. The rebels have waged war on the Colombian government for more than 40 years. ""The profit potential is such that the FARC is one of the largest cocaine-trafficking operations globally and is also a terrorist organization,"" he said. Bagley and McCaffrey see less evidence of terrorist connections with the traffickers in Africa, both using nearly identical language. ""I'd be really skeptical of those kinds of assertions,"" McCaffrey said. ""I'm quite skeptical about linkages between cartels and terrorists,"" Bagley said. ""The criminal groups seek profits. They're not interested in taking over governments."" Still, Bagley said, traffickers and terrorists may use some of the same criminal networks. Analysts note that the surge of cartel activity in West Africa is a fairly recent development. The U.N. report said it started around 2005. Bybee places it around 2006. McCaffrey, who was in the Clinton White House in the 1990s, said he saw the problem coming a long time ago. ""I've been warning people in Europe and Latin America starting 10 years ago where this issue was going to move,"" he said. ""The Europeans absolutely blew me off."" The U.N. report offers some hope, saying that cocaine seizures in Europe peaked in 2006 and topped out in West Africa in 2007. Overall seizures have declined since 2006, the report said. ""This trend appears to be continuing in 2009 and includes declines in the number and volume of seizures made in the region and in the number of air couriers coming from the region in Europe,"" the report concluded. For example, authorities seized 11 large shipments in Africa in 2007, four in 2008 and none so far this year. The report does not specify whether there are fewer shipments or smarter criminals avoiding detection. But if there is a decline, the DEA's Benson said he has not seen it. ""In the last three or four years, it's increased quite dramatically,"" he said. ""The Colombian organizations have been active there longer than that. In the last two years, we've also seen Mexican involvement in the area as well.""","Guinea-Bissau, fifth-poorest nation in the world, is called Africa's first narco-state .

"(CNN) -- It was 2:30 a.m. on the morning of June 4, 1989. From a balcony of the Beijing Hotel, I looked down Chang'an Avenue towards Tiananmen Square a few hundred meters away. Red tracer bullets whizzed through the air. The crackle of gunfire echoed through the humid Beijing night. I could see armored vehicles of the People's Liberation Army moving just in front of the famous portrait of Chairman Mao hanging above the vast square. Below me crowds gathered, surged forward, and then broke and dispersed as soldiers opened fire at them. Several people were hit. I watched as others loaded the dead and wounded onto flatbed bicycle carts. WATCH: ""Assignment China"" As the drama unfolded, my colleagues and I reported it live on CNN over a scratchy phone line to transfixed TV audiences around the world. The events that night were a turning point for China, as well as a watershed moment in the history of the media. Weeks of student-led protests had become the largest movement for political reform in the history of the People's Republic. The military crackdown I covered had far-reaching consequences, not only for China's development but also for its relations with the rest of the world. Global coverage . The protests generated unparalleled international coverage, and became a defining moment in the Information Age. It was the first time a popular uprising in an authoritarian state was broadcast live across the globe. According to Bernard Shaw, who anchored CNN's live round-the-clock coverage from Beijing for much of the crisis: ""You could say that that was the beginning of the 'CNN effect'"" -- the idea, which became widespread after Tiananmen Square, that the immediacy of live TV news available 24 hours a day played a crucial role in influencing the behavior of key players during major crises. The images from that time -- the Goddess of Democracy, the man in front of the tank -- became enduring symbols of popular resistance to injustice. In the United States, the coverage of Tiananmen redefined the relationship between the press, public opinion, and foreign policy-making, and brought an end to the romance in Sino-American relations that had begun with Richard Nixon's trip in 1972. To this day, the event and the images continue to shape international perceptions of the country. It was no accident that at a U.S. Congressional hearing on Tiananmen in late May, lawmakers from both parties emphasized how the television coverage from 25 years ago had influenced popular views of China. Tiananmen legacy . Inside China, Tiananmen also continues to exert a profound influence. The crisis in 1989 led paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to purge liberal officials who had sympathized with the students, and replace them with more conservative figures. Yet for Deng, a central lesson of Tiananmen was that public confidence in the Chinese Communist Party could only be maintained by continuing the market-oriented economic reforms begun in the 1980s. In the wake of Tiananmen, Deng pushed to revive and accelerate the reform process, triggering a bitter fight with the very conservatives he had relied on to back his decision to crack down in 1989. In what was his last great political battle, Deng triumphed, and his efforts paved the way for China's emergence as an economic powerhouse. Yet for the same reason -- ensuring the Party's survival -- Deng also stifled any new moves towards political reform, as did those who followed him. In particular, fearing that the events of that June could undermine the Party's legitimacy, Beijing has relentlessly sought to erase June 4 from public memory. All public discussion of the crisis is banned. Every Spring, the authorities move against anyone seeking to raise the issue, whether dissidents, lawyers, or relatives of those who died. The Communist Party in effect offered the Chinese people a bargain: greater economic opportunity and more personal -- as opposed to political -- freedom in return for not challenging the Party's monopoly on power. 'Suffocating control' Despite pervasive political repression, it is a bargain many Chinese have accepted. And with the passage of time, the suffocating control of any public discussion, along with stunning economic growth, has meant that for the vast majority of Chinese, the events of 1989 have faded from memory. An entire generation knows little but the official government version of what occurred. Yet memories of 1989 still haunt the Communist Party. Ensuring that nothing like it occurs again remains a central feature of Beijing's policies on a host of issues. This can be seen in the exceptionally nervous reactions to the Arab spring and so-called ""color revolutions"" in parts of the former Soviet Union, the growth of the internal security services, the intense repression in Tibet and Xinjiang, the harsh actions against dissidents like the imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, and the government's management of the thousands of protests over local issues that occur in China every year. So far, Beijing's approach has generally worked and the Chinese leadership has proved itself to be more skillful and resilient than many in 1989 would have predicted. However, with the country's economy slowing, social and economic tensions rising, and the Internet and other new forms of communication giving citizens new tools to voice their opinions and generate political pressure, the Communist Party is facing new challenges -- which could give new resonance to the legacy of Tiananmen Square. Beijing's approach to June 4 therefore remains a paradox. A quarter of a century later, the Communist Party still feels compelled to use all the powers of the state to convince people inside China that nothing worth remembering happened on a date that, outside the country, will be an occasion for reflection and analysis of what remains the gravest crisis the Party has faced since the revolution of 1949.","Chinoy: The Tiananmen Square crackdown was a watershed moment in the history of Western media .

"Denver (CNN) -- A Colorado man faces a murder charge in what he initially said was an accidental fatal fall by his second wife on a 12th wedding anniversary outing, and now authorities also are re-examining the circumstances of his first wife's death. Harold Henthorn, 58, appeared before a federal judge in Denver on Thursday to face a first-degree murder charge in the death of Toni Henthorn, who died after falling off a cliff in Rocky Mountain National Park in September 2012. The couple, who met through a Christian dating website, was enjoying an anniversary getaway and reportedly hiking in steep and rocky terrain when Toni Henthorn plunged 40 to 50 feet to her death, according to park officials and Toni Henthorn's family. Authorities haven't disclosed any motives. Toni Henthorn was insured for $4.5-million under three life insurance policies, probate court records show. The documents also state that a claim was sent on one of those policies on October 1, 2012, two days after Toni Henthorn's death. However, no payment was made. The couple also had a daughter, who is now 9, said Toni Henthorn's brother Todd Bertolet. Harold Henthorn said his wife's death came when she slipped while taking a picture. Coroner's conclusion . However, an autopsy showed Toni Henthorn died from multiple blunt force injuries after tumbling face first over a ledge ""when she fell or was pushed down a cliff,"" the coroner wrote. ""Homicide cannot be excluded."" A federal indictment says Harold Henthorn ""willfully, deliberately, maliciously, and with premeditation and malice"" killed Toni Henthorn, a 50-year-old ophthalmologist. Henthorn was arrested outside his suburban Denver home without incident Thursday morning after dropping his daughter off at school, the culmination of a more than two-year investigation that involved the National Park Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Douglas County Sheriff's Office. Defense attorney's statement . The arrest was a long time coming for family members, who have had their suspicions, the brother said. ""It was a day we were looking forward to,"" Bertolet said. Bertolet said the family was immediately suspicious about the death because Harold Henthorn kept changing his story about what happened. ""I think there are four or five versions of the story he told,"" said Bertolet. Harold Henthorn's attorney, Craig Truman, didn't want to talk about the cases outside the courtroom, but provided a statement to CNN, which said, ""I'm sure when all the facts are known in this difficult and complex case, that justice will be done."" Authorities are now re-investigating the 1995 death of Harold Henthorn's first wife, Sandra Lynn Henthorn. First wife's death . At that time, the couple was driving on a rural road about 10 miles outside Sedalia, Colorado, when Henthorn pulled over on a gravel shoulder to check a tire. According to the autopsy report, Sandra Lynn Henthorn may have been looking under the car for a lug nut when the jack slipped and the car crashed down, pinning her underneath. She was rushed to the hospital and underwent surgery, but did not survive. ""We can only say that there is an open, active investigation into the death of his first wife,"" said Deborah Sherman, a spokeswoman for the Douglas County Sheriff's Office. ""We can't release anything else because of the investigation."" Bertolet said it wasn't until after his sister's death that his family learned the details surrounding the death of Harold Henthorn's first wife. ""We knew he had been married previously. But he told us that she had died during a car accident. There's a big difference between a car crash and a car falling on you,"" Bertolet said. ""I think if my sister had known the complete background on this guy, she never would have been with him,"" he added. His 'dominant' personality . His sister was living in Mississippi when she met Henthorn on the Internet, and he was in Colorado, Bertolet said. She sold her practice in Mississippi to be with Henthorn in Colorado. Harold Henthorn said he was a businessman who owned a company, but Bertolet said no one in the family really knows what he did. Bertolet said Harold Henthorn controlled the couple's finances. Bertolet questioned his sister's relationship with Henthorn, adding that he seemed like a very controlling person. ""He was so dominant over my sister and the child. It was almost like whatever he said, went,"" Bertolet said. If convicted in the death of Toni Henthorn, Harold Henthorn faces life in prison without parole and up to a $250,000 fine. He is scheduled to be arraigned on the murder charge on November 12, which is also a detention hearing.

Conservative critics howled when Obama said in 2009 that police acted ""stupidly"" in arresting black Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates outside his home. Holder prompted a similar outcry earlier that year when he called America a ""nation of cowards"" about racial issues. Now past the two-thirds mark of the Obama presidency, the pair have avoided such loaded language in response to the August 9 shooting death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white police officer in suburban St. Louis. Root causes . While Holder recently reiterated his ""nation of cowards"" statement, he and Obama have tried to focus attention on root causes of racial division in the aftermath of Brown's killing, which has sparked more than a week of unrest on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, chronicled by widespread media coverage. ""The eyes of the nation and the world are watching Ferguson right now,"" Holder said Wednesday during a visit to the community. ""The world is watching because the issues raised by the shooting of Michael Brown predate this incident. This is something that has a history to it, and the history simmers beneath the surface in more communities than just Ferguson."" On Thursday, he said ""few things have affected me as greatly"" as his trip to Ferguson, and he cited a ""sense of mistrust and mutual suspicion"" between law enforcement and residents as something that needs to change. ""I wanted the people of Ferguson to know that I personally understood that mistrust,"" Holder said. In commenting on the matter earlier this week, Obama also spoke of troubled minority communities that ""as a consequence of tragic histories, often find themselves isolated, often find themselves without hope, without economic prospects."" ""You have young men of color in many communities who are more likely to end up in jail or in the criminal justice system than they are in a good job or in college,"" he said. ""And, you know, part of my job -- that I can do, I think, without any potential conflicts -- is to get at those root causes."" Racial issues . To CNN political commentator LZ Granderson, a series of divisive racial issues since Obama took office have shaped the President's approach. First came a white police officer's arrest of Gates, a prominent African-American scholar, as he tried to get into this own locked home. In 2012, the shooting of unarmed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman roiled the nation, and now there's the Brown killing. ""Any time a situation like this occurs, he becomes more of a more centrist, emotionally,"" Granderson said Wednesday. ""But in terms of what he is actually saying to the American people, he's becoming much more thoughtful."" In the aftermath of the Martin killing and soaring gun violence in Chicago and elsewhere, Obama this year launched the My Brother's Keeper program to provide mentoring and other support for African-American and Hispanic boys in rough neighborhoods. Holder, meanwhile, has launched 20 investigations of police practices and alleged discriminatory enforcement patterns in the past five years, more than twice the number of such inquiries in the previous five years. Calming affect? He said Wednesday that he hoped his visit to Ferguson would have a calming affect by showing the federal government was investigating. At the same time, Holder made clear that federal authorities were examining possible civil rights violations under their jurisdiction, while state and local authorities would continue their criminal investigation of Brown's killing. A child of the civil rights era, Holder told his own stories of racial profiling -- his car being searched during a traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike; police officers stopping him as he ran to a movie theater in Washington's tony Georgetown neighborhood. ""At the time that he stopped me, I was a federal prosecutor,"" Holder said. ""I wasn't a kid. ... I worked at the United States Department of Justice. So I've confronted this myself."" ""A good step"" Antonio French, a St. Louis city alderman, called Holder's visit ""a good step"" because it showed that the community's plight was ""at the top of his priority list."" A decade younger than Holder, Obama has taken a present-day approach to personalizing his experience as black in America. After Martin was killed by Zimmerman two years ago, the President called for a full investigation, noting that ""if I had a son, he would look like Trayvon."" In his remarks Monday, Obama avoided any assessment of blame in the Brown killing, saying ""I have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed."" He admonished an overzealous police response that has dispersed peaceful demonstrators, as well as looting and other protest violence that he said undermined the goal of seeking justice.

"(CNN) -- Ferguson, Missouri, has been in the national spotlight since Saturday when 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a local police officer. Witnesses said the teen was unarmed; police say that he had tried to get an officer's gun. Outrage quickly followed the shooting as many in the town charged that the killing was racially motivated. The teenager was black. The officer has not yet been identified publicly. Turmoil has broken out, dozens have marched in the street and tensions are high. As the story continues to develop, here's a quick look at its backdrop -- Ferguson, a suburb in the shadow of St. Louis: . 1. Are racial tensions getting worse? Antonio French is a St. Louis alderman who lives near Ferguson. He told CNN on Monday that racial tensions in the suburb aren't unique to Ferguson but part of a larger and wider frustration that has been worsening over time in the area -- a notion that a Washington Post article explores. ""What's happening in Ferguson isn't different from a lot of municipalities out here in St. Louis County ... small municipalities that have large African-American population and very few black police officers,"" French said, adding that there is a disconnect between the people and those who police them. ""Tensions have been rising for years and years,"" he said. Ferguson is a predominately black community with a mostly white police force. Only three of the city's 53 officers are African-American. It's a statistic Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson says he's working to improve. He told CNN that racial profiling is ""strictly forbidden."" ""We actually have mandatory racial profiling training that we have to take to be certified,"" he said. ""Racial profiling is against our policies. It actually benefits nothing."" 2. Who lives in Ferguson? According to the most recent census, 67% of Ferguson's community is black; 29% is white; there is less than 1% Asian and Native American. A little more than 1% of the population is Hispanic or Latino. Its residents are mostly young; the average age is 31. Median household income is about $37,000. Twenty two percent of people in Ferguson live below the poverty line. 3. Where is it? About 10 miles north of downtown St. Louis, Ferguson is one of many cities that comprise St. Louis County. The first thing you see when you click on the Ferguson city website is a community family fun fair happening this weekend in the St. Louis suburb of 22,400 and a video that promises to describe the town. Bluesy, folksy music plays while a camera pans down well-trimmed streets dotted with large homes. 4. What do its leaders say? ""Everyone knows everyone. Everyone feels like they're comfortable no matter who they are,"" Councilman Dwayne James says in the video. Mayor James Knowles describes the businesses that are flourishing -- new lofts, a farmer's market, a brew-and-coffee house. He hopes they will help bring people to the city and encourage them to stay, including the younger crowd from nearby University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""The whole city is kind of like the bar in 'Cheers.' You know, it's the place where everybody knows your name,"" Knowles says. 5. What's the city's history? William B. Ferguson founded the city in 1894 as a station for a railroad. Ferguson is proud of its history. ""Historic preservation is a big part of what we do in Ferguson because it's one of those resources that cannot be replicated. You can always rebuild a house but you cannot rebuild the integrity and the history that is in some of our historic homes and some of our historic buildings. And so maintaining that's always been a big part of Ferguson,"" the mayor says in the video. What we know about Michael Brown's shooting . Teen was two days away from starting college .

"(CNN) -- The photo from Ferguson, Missouri, that stopped me in my tracks was taken by a local educator. One man was on his knees, arms outstretched to prove to the police that he had no weapon. The other man was still standing, but had his hands up in the air; his shirt covered his mouth, a feeble defense against tear gas. In the right hand of each man was a cell phone. The standing man was holding his phone so that the camera pointed toward the police. I wondered to myself, was he recording this confrontation? The interplay between amateur media -- like this photo, taken by Liz Peinado on her phone and immediately posted to Twitter -- and professional media has been impossible to ignore in the days since 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by police in Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis. Brown was unarmed. A town in turmoil -- 5 things about Ferguson, Missouri . For every cool-headed account from a reporter, there's been an impassioned Facebook post or Instagram photo from a community member that illustrates, I think, strengths and weaknesses of both traditional and social media. These days we need both. After all, it's one thing to hear a news anchor say that police fired nonlethal rounds to disperse protesters on Monday night; it's another to see photos of the pepper balls and wooden pellets and the bloody injuries they caused. Jon Swaine, a Guardian reporter on assignment in Ferguson, wrote on Twitter that a St. Louis police spokesperson claimed on Monday night ""he didn't know what I was talking about when told protesters claimed they were shot with wooden pellets."" On Tuesday morning, Swaine held some of the pellets in his hand and said they matched protesters' descriptions. The police subsequently confirmed the pellets were fired. Peinado, the local educator who posted the photo I mentioned earlier, wrote on Twitter that she was ""devastated"" by the use of ""tanks, tear gas, rubber bullets, hand launchers, and sheer intimidation of county police."" Peinado's photo of the two men holding cell phones was captioned, ""Men armed with nothing but phones ordered to get on their knees. I witnessed tear gas thrown at them."" The same two men were also shown in a Vine video by Antonio French, a local alderman who was perhaps the most prolific citizen journalist during tense protests Sunday and Monday. French's six-second videos of tear gas in the streets of Ferguson were picked up by CNN and other news outlets -- giving audiences at home a raw, close-up view of the situation. ""For the most part, social media has helped bring home the impact of this death in the local Ferguson community in a way that traditional media probably could not have,"" said David Clinch, the executive editor of Storyful, a company that specializes in finding and verifying newsworthy material on the Web. What we know about Michael Brown's shooting . There have also been online attempts to hold traditional media outlets accountable. The best example of this is the Twitter hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown, which posed the rhetorical question, ""If they gunned me down, what photos would the media use to portray me and my life?"" The hashtag was born after a photo of Brown circulated over the weekend. Some saw the teenager holding up a peace sign; others speculated that it was a gang sign. Resentment and disappointment about media portrayals of African-Americans was evident in the commentary about the use of the photo. Yesha Callahan, a writer for The Root, wrote that Brown's death ""has once again shown that the narrative the media paints surrounding black people in America more often than not includes depicting us as violent thugs with gang and drug affiliations."" On Twitter, contributors to #IfTheyGunnedMeDown shared pairs of photos -- one stereotypical or unsavory, another showing the same person on graduation day or surrounded by family. The same site, however, was also a tool for inflammatory rumor-mongering. Monday night, for instance, some Twitter users shared false claims that another citizen had been shot by police. And, according to local reports, social media erroneously identified a police officer as the one who shot Brown. ""It is very important to be careful in stories like this, when emotions are running high, to make sure that information and content is verified,"" said Clinch, who formerly worked at CNN. Clinch said he has spotted instances of people sharing images and saying they were from Ferguson, when in fact they were from years-old protests in other states. Teen was two days away from starting college . Perhaps the best example of the interplay between amateur and professional media is also one of the rare bits of good news to come from the current unrest in Ferguson: A photo of local residents cleaning up one of the locations that was looted on Sunday night went viral on Monday: . I saw a number of complaints on Twitter along the lines of ""the traditional media will never show you THIS side of the story."" But the photo was originally shared on Facebook with a small group of friends -- it went viral with the help of local reporters and television stations. Some of the volunteers were subsequently interviewed by a local newspaper, the Riverfront Times, widely amplifying their act and the message therein. ""We just all put our heads down and got to work,"" one of the volunteers, Kathryn Banks, told the newspaper. ""We'd felt hopeless and helpless watching everything unfold on the news the night before. This was a way we could give back. We felt like there was something we could do.""","Twitter, other social media light up with firsthand accounts of protests in Ferguson, Missouri .

"(CNN) -- They've served in wars in what is now the U.S. since 1637. When natural disasters strike, they're often among the first to head to the epicenter. And now, National Guard members are trying to keep the peace in Ferguson, Missouri, as the city grapples with the shooting death of an unarmed teenager. Ferguson certainly isn't the first time the troops have been called up to quell civil unrest. According to the U.S. Constitution, the militia can be deployed ""to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions."" And both the president and governors can call up the troops. Here's a look at other times National Guard members have stepped in during civil turmoil: . WHAT: Hurricane Katrina . WHEN: 2005 . WHY: In addition to assisting with rescues, National Guard members were called in to help support local law enforcement. Lt. Gen. Russel HonorÃ©, who led Task Force Katrina, said National Guard troops ""were positioned on every block to establish a sense of safety and source of help for the people in need."" The storm that led to 1,833 deaths also spawned tumult, particularly in New Orleans. Officers told CNN at the time they lacked manpower and steady communications to properly do their jobs. They said they needed help to prevent the spread of looting and violence that were prevalent in the city. HonorÃ© said about 50,000 National Guard members responded to Katrina. They ""did not leave communities till people were safe and sound,"" he wrote. WHAT: Los Angeles riots . WHEN: 1992 . WHY: When four police officers were acquitted after the beating of Rodney King, a series of riots over five days left more than 50 people dead and a city wracked with racial tensions. Like in Ferguson, the Los Angeles conflict started with the controversial treatment of a black man by white police. After King led officers on a high-speed chase, he was struck more than 50 times with police batons and suffered 11 fractures. More than 9,800 California National Guard troops were dispatched to help restore order. Unlike with Ferguson, where Missouri National Guard troops were summoned by the governor, President George H.W. Bush called the Guard into federal service during the Los Angeles riots. The LA riots marked the most recent time the National Guard was federalized, National Guard spokesman Jeremy Webster said. WHAT: Kent State University rally . WHEN: 1970 . WHY: About 100 Ohio National Guardsmen were called to Kent State in Ohio to disperse an angry crowd of students protesting the Vietnam War. Guard members fired tear gas, and some students said they were surprised the guardsmen followed them as they ran away. After several standoffs, 28 Ohio guardsmen fired into the crowd for 13 seconds, wounding nine students and killing four. The shootings led to a national protest involving more than 4 million students. WHAT: Little Rock high school desegregation . WHEN: 1957 . WHY: In perhaps the most controversial state deployment of National Guard members, Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus called on troops to block nine black students from attending Little Rock Central High School. ""That's when I knew that they were just not going to let me go to school ... that they were not there to protect me, too, like the other students,"" recalled Elizabeth Eckford, one of the ""Little Rock Nine."" She was 15 at the time. The nine black students were taunted and spat upon by a white mob when they attended school. President Dwight Eisenhower eventually sent more than 1,010 federal troops to Little Rock to ensure compliance with court-ordered integration. WHAT: Whiskey Rebellion . WHEN: 1794 . WHY: A popular uprising broke out against a federal excise tax on liquor and the stills that produced it. After Pennsylvania's governor said he didn't have enough militia to enforce compliance, Secretary of War Henry Knox called for more than 12,000 troops from Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. But it took two months to get the troops to western Pennsylvania. By the time they reached Pittsburgh, the uprising had been pacified. Why bring National Guard to Ferguson?

"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) -- As the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson calmed Friday after nights of protests over the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teen, the question remains: Where's the police officer who pulled the trigger? Officer Darren Wilson, 28, shot Michael Brown on August 9. The shooting sparked days of violent protests in Ferguson as residents demanded his arrest. Separate federal and local investigations are under way, and Wilson -- who has received death threats -- has disappeared from public view. Governor orders drawdown of National Guard in Ferguson . Here's what is known about his whereabouts. Where is he now? Few outside Wilson's family and authorities know for sure. Wilson owns a house in a modest neighborhood about 20 miles from Ferguson. He bought the house shortly after he was divorced last year, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. But several neighbors have told CNN that Wilson left home before his name was released last week. What are his neighbors saying about his whereabouts? Not much. Most have shunned reporters' requests for interviews, and some put signs in their yards shooing away journalists. ""We don't know anything ... Pray for Peace,"" one read, according to the Post-Dispatch. ""We have 2 children. Do not knock!! No comment,"" another family wrote. Any trails on social media? The newspaper reported that Wilson deactivated his social media accounts before his name went public. The only social media presence for him now is from supporters, who have set up Facebook pages to support and raise money for him. Posts express frustration about not being heard in the media and allege a lack of support for Wilson and law enforcement. Has he contacted his friends? One friend, Jake Shepard, told the Daily Mail newspaper in Britain that he'd texted with Wilson after a CNN appearance, and a woman going by the name ""Josie"" called a radio show to say she knew his side of the story. The Daily Mail reported that Shepard said he didn't know for sure where Wilson is but that he's safe and under 24-hour guard. Shepard said he received a text from Wilson after his CNN appearance, thanking him for the kind words he'd said, the newspaper reported. In his CNN interview, Shepard said he couldn't imagine the officer killing somebody. ""I can say -- without speaking to Darren, without even having heard his statements -- that, at that moment in time, he was scared for his life,"" Shepard said. In the text conversation, Wilson said that, among other things, he ""can't go out"" because of the tumult over the shooting, the Daily Mail reported. CNN can't confirm the authenticity of the messages. Shepard has declined further interview requests with the network. As for ""Josie,"" it's unclear what relationship she has to the officer. But a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation says her account of what happened tracks with what Wilson has told investigators. Dueling narratives in Michael Brown shooting . What is the police department saying? Authorities are not saying where Wilson is. Wilson, who has six years on the force with no disciplinary issues on his record, is on paid administrative leave. If he returns to duty, he will have to undergo two psychological evaluations, authorities said. What's next for him? It depends on the outcome of the investigations. He could return to work -- which seems unlikely -- face charges or just fade away from public view as attention to the shooting declines.","The officer at the center of the Michael Brown shooting case is in seclusion .

"(CNN) -- William Fox-Pitt sounds rather like a character straight out of the pages of a novel and, at times, his life has played out like one. He used to teach the ""Queen of Pop"" Madonna how to ride a horse, while his first wife left him for his arch-rival on the three-day eventing circuit, Andrew Nicholson. It is a career beset by tragedies too -- of riders and horses -- that made him think twice about climbing back into the saddle. But now happily married for a second time, the Briton has three children and a myriad of victories. At the age of 45, the world No.1 is still riding and is still desperately seeking that elusive Olympic gold medal. ""If I'd won gold at London 2012, it might have been different,"" Fox-Pitt, who won team silver at his home Games, adding to the bronze he won in Beijing four years earlier and another silver secured in Athens in 2004, tells CNN. ""That would have been a good time to think I'll kick back. But I'm still living the dream over again. ""Of course, there's the sense that I've used up a lot of good luck in an obviously dangerous sport. But if you're doing something you love, it's worth the risk. ""In the front of your mind, there's that sense you could have a prang and end up in a mess. But this is a calculated risk. If your number is up crossing the road, riding a horse or getting in the car, that's how it is. It certainly makes everything feel more fragile."" It is 23 years since Fox-Pitt thought about walking away from the sport altogether. Competing at the prestigious annual Badminton event in the UK, his mount Briarlands Pippin lost a shoe just before a fence, slipped, flipped over at the fence and had to be put down because of a broken neck. For all the bravado required for such a dangerous sport, Fox-Pitt talks of that moment as though the emotional wounds are still raw. ""I was really quite damaged by that,"" he recalls. ""I remember being very unsure whether I thought this was a good sport. I've had some bad falls, times when I've woken up in the air ambulance, I've had friends that have died doing this. ""And yes you do ask yourself, 'what on earth are you doing?' But if you're going to break your neck, you might as well be doing something you love. Thankfully I'm still hanging in there."" This is not the rider nor family man brushing off the obvious repercussions of a fall, but rather the elite athlete in him knowing that he cannot spend too much time dwelling on the what ifs of his sport. That sport reached its nadir in 1999 with five rider deaths in as many months, a period Fox-Pitt described as a ""freak year"". Improvements in safety have steadily come into force in the proceeding 15 years, with collapsible fences and inflatable jackets for riders. But while Fox-Pitt wants to be safe, he does not want to entirely eradicate the inherent dangers of horse and man riding over gargantuan fences, often at breakneck speeds. ""I think there has to be an element of risk, otherwise no one would want to do it,"" he explains. ""It's a bit like Formula 1. I'm sure the guys are the same before a race -- at the start of the cross-country I get that feeling in the pit of my stomach. It's the excitement, the anticipation and the nerves. It's a very raw feeling ahead of what you're hoping to conquer."" The Briton, who was educated at Eton, where Princes William and Harry and British Prime Minister David Cameron among others attended, is bemused as to how he has made it to the pinnacle of his sport. Modest to the core, he says: ""I never thought this would happen. When I started competitively I was quite average. Riding was just a family thing to do."" But that modest beginner has managed to become the golden boy of eventing, something which seemed to catch the attention of Madonna when she was married to Guy Ritchie and living in the UK. ""Well, I'm not sure it was because of what I'd achieved but just simple geography that she approached me -- she lived nearby with Guy Ritchie,"" Fox-Pitt says. But how was it teaching the notoriously volatile ""Queen of Pop"" how to ride? ""It was a very enjoyable and surreal experience,"" Fox-Pitt, who taught her for two or three years, says. ""When she arrived, no one could quite believe it was happening and there is something about her that's quite extraordinary, but it was also all very normal, she was very normal. ""Horses are great releases for people and I think the riding was just that for her. Needless to say she took it very seriously. She's quite feisty and we had a few, how should I put it, heated debates about stuff. It was a fun time but it's all in the past now."" Similarly in the past is Fox-Pitt's previous life with Wiggy, his first wife, who left him for Nicholson, the New Zealand horseman who is currently ranked second in the world. Fox-Pitt, however, can now look back on the separation and laugh. ""It was a bit like something out of Eastenders,"" he says. ""I can see people like to make a lot of the rivalry and that's good for the sport. It adds an interesting twist to something that can often be dull I guess. ""It's someone that the media and people supporting make quite a hoodoo about and that can be quite tiring. Everyone seems to have their team -- his or mine. I guess it's fun for most people."" The relations between the pair are understandably still frosty because of their personal and professional lives, while there are few words exchanged between the two riders, except for the odd congratulations should one get the upper hand on the other. Yet there is so much more to Fox-Pitt than the remarkable horseman that he is. There is his indomitable mother, Marietta, who spurred him on to ride and would not accept his occasional decisions to quit. There are the contradicting aspects of him -- that he is part of the bloodline of William Pitt, British Prime Minister in the 18th Century, which contrast to the black eye he sported after sumo wrestling at his bachelor party, prior to his second marriage to the television presenter Alice Plunkett. But first and foremost, he is known for pulling off the ultimate equestrian juggling act, mastering the three complex disciplines of dressage, cross-country and show jumping. Quite how much longer he will ride is a question he cannot answer. Rio de Janeiro 2016 is an obvious cut-off point but, then again, so was London 2012. ""I really had to do London -- if I hadn't that would have been devastating -- and in many ways everything else is a bonus,"" Fox-Pitt adds. ""It takes a long time in eventing to build up your business, horses and sponsors and to finally make some money. My horses wouldn't retire and I'm not sure I could see someone else ride them. ""I could do without the sick feeling in my stomach before a big event but I'm not done yet. I'm still having fun.""","Fox-Pitt risks life and limb in his bid to remain the world's No.1 three-day event rider .

"(CNN) -- The intense situation in Ferguson, Missouri, is disturbingly familiar to us. In November, it will be eight years since we suffered the same tragedy as Michael Brown's parents. Our unarmed son, Sean Bell, was killed in a barrage of 50 shots fired by New York plainclothes police officers on his wedding day, November 25, 2006. Our prayers go out to the Brown family, and we offer Michael's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr., our hearts and support. We know how it feels to have your child snatched away, slain by the police. I remember the gut-wrenching moment we learned the details of our son's brutal final moments. As if that wasn't enough, we also had to deal with the public defamation of our son's character, which seemed to be saying: ""He was an animal, he deserved to die."" The killing of unarmed black men has become a staggering pattern across the United States, and for the city of Ferguson, the outrage has reached its boiling point. But we are concerned about the effects the citizens' outrage and their retributive actions might have on the grieving family. My wife, Valerie, believes the racial situation in Ferguson has forced its citizens to aggressively rebel against the infringement of their civil rights. It's true, protesters initially responded to the killing with violence and looting -- which, if continued at that level, would have ultimately destroyed their community and produced the opposite of what they were fighting for in their search for justice. The Brown family called for peace in the midst of looting and violent protesting. Although the looting has stopped, clashes between protesters and police stayed heightened this week, with the Missouri National Guard, troopers and police in riot gear confronting angry demonstrators. The chaos is reminiscent of the Civil Rights movement. I was born and raised in Alabama and clearly recall the protesters armed with passion for change, protest signs, and their voice of power confronting police armed with batons, water hoses, shotguns and police dogs. In this new day, things are different. Various reports, often contested, say police and protesters were in full battle, with armed police using armored vehicles, tear gas and rubber bullets as shotguns rang out and some protesters threw Molotov cocktails. The tactics have changed in the new generation's battle, but the causes remain the same: justice and equality. My wife and I stand in solidarity with Ferguson's call for justice in the killing of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown. But we also stand with the Brown family's call for peaceful protesting. It seems protests are calming down, which is very good news. During this dynamic climate of change in Ferguson, it is imperative not to lose sight of what is in the best interest of the family. Ferguson seems to be in a civil war as Michael Brown's family struggles with the legal complexity of this fight. They are at the core of it all. Many miles must be traveled in their journey for justice. My wife and I know well the transitional process the Brown family must endure. Finding a balance between fighting for justice and mourning the loss of your child can become overwhelmingly challenging. When their time comes to lay their son to rest, it should be a time of peace, giving the family space for grieving and moving forward. Many emotions are running high in Ferguson. However, not one of those emotions can compare with the anguish the family is experiencing; and that should be considered throughout this journey for justice.","William and Valerie Bell's son was unarmed when police killed him on his wedding day .

"Macon, Georgia (CNN) -- Kendrick Johnson's former schoolmates and their parents have been subpoenaed by a federal grand jury investigating the Georgia teen's 2013 death, according to sources with knowledge of the subpoenas. Among those seen entering the federal courthouse in Macon on Thursday were current students at Lowndes High School and current and former students at Valdosta High School, also located in Lowndes County. Thursday's development comes four months after the feds launched an investigation. Johnson's parents have said the original probe was mishandled by local authorities. The FBI has interviewed several of Johnson's former schoolmates, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. Outside the federal courthouse Thursday, U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said, ""We're working methodically, and sometimes we remember we're running a marathon instead of a sprint. So, we're working on it. It's better to get it right than to get it fast. I'm satisfied that the FBI is moving forward at the appropriate speed, and they're doing a fine job."" Johnson's body was found in a rolled-up mat in the Lowndes High School gymnasium on January 11, 2013. Investigators with the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office ruled his death accidental, concluding that Johnson climbed into the center of the gym mat to reach for a shoe and got stuck. State officials later concurred that Johnson's death was accidental and listed his cause of death as ""positional asphyxia,"" or suffocation by his own body weight. Johnson's parents have called the official story a ""coverup"" and said they believe their son's death was a homicide. A separate autopsy commissioned by the family attributed the 17-year-old's death to ""apparent non-accidental, blunt force trauma."" The complete list of those subpoenaed for Thursday's grand jury proceeding was not clear, but Lowndes County Sheriff Chris Prine said he had not received a federal subpoena, and Lowndes County Schools said it was subpoenaed only to provide hard drives containing surveillance video from the school. County Coroner Bill Watson said he hasn't received a subpoena, either, though the FBI has interviewed him twice and he has spoken to the U.S. attorney. Johnson's parents say they, too, spoke with the FBI during a three-hour interview in Thomasville, 40 miles west of Valdosta, in December. Asked during a January interview if he found the feds' involvement encouraging, Johnson's father, Kenneth Johnson, said, ""We really won't feel anything until justice comes for Kendrick. We're glad they're here, but my feelings won't be there until we get justice for our son."" His wife, Jacquelyn Johnson, said the FBI interview left her hopeful. ""They answered a lot of questions about a lot of what we had heard,"" she said. ""I felt better because it's another set of eyes looking into the case.""","Current and former students from Lowndes County Schools seen at courthouse .

"(CNN) -- Supporters of Ferguson, Missouri, Police Officer Darren Wilson say they have faced threats over their views, but vowed not to be silenced. Wilson on August 9 shot and killed unarmed black teen Michael Brown, an incident that stirred racial tensions and unrest. An unnamed spokeswoman for the Support Darren Wilson group, speaking at a rally Saturday, accused the media of having a bias against supporters of the officer. ""We believe this has only intensified the destruction of the community of Ferguson and the surrounding St. Louis areas,"" said the spokeswoman. ""We will not hide. We will no longer live in fear,"" she said. ""We ask this question: Can justice ever be attained if one side's supporters are living in fear of speaking out?"" The spokeswoman said that she and her group were not speaking on behalf of Wilson or his representatives, but were making a statement for his supporters. She said she had received online threats against her and her family. The pro-Wilson rally, attended by about 100 supporters, was held outside Barney's Sports Pub, a popular gathering spot for area police officers several miles south of Ferguson. Supporters, many of them armed, carried signs saying ""Innocent until proven guilty"" and ""We love cops."" An African-American woman at one point tried unsuccessfully to interrupt the rally, asking loudly why police had not broken up the gathering. A handful of counterprotesters later gathered peacefully across the street. There are competing versions from witnesses about what happened in Ferguson. There is agreement that there was a scuffle between Brown and Wilson, but some witnesses say the teen ran away, turned around and put his arms up as he was shot. The officer's version, as told to a radio station by a friend, is that Brown charged the officer before the shooting. Wilson's actions were warranted and justified, and he counts on the support of many, the spokeswoman said at the rally. ""We believe that the evidence has and will continue to validate our position,"" she said. The media is yet to earn the trust of those supporting the officer, she said. But Wilson's supporters can take comfort that they have plenty of company from all around the country. The online fund-raising effort for Wilson surpassed $300,000 on Saturday, according to totals from two related pages on GoFundMe.com. In addition, supporters had raised about $10,000 in cash at the rally. A post on one of the pages notes that organizers ""anticipate these funds will be used to cover potential legal fees, relocation and living expenses of both Officer Darren Wilson and his immediate family."" ""We truly appreciate your time, efforts, prayers, kind words and donations,"" that message added. ""It means more than you could possibly know.""

"London (CNN) -- Three summers ago, my wife and I were settling into a short summer holiday when I received an unexpected phone call from the police chief in Tottenham, the part of North London where I grew up and now represent in the UK Parliament. Phone calls from police officers are not uncommon in my line of work, but when the chief's number appeared on my screen I knew this was serious. I was right. The voice at the other end of the phone informed me that a black man had been shot dead by armed police in my constituency. His name was Mark Duggan. I knew immediately that I had to return home, and jumped on the first train back the following morning. I arrived back in time to watch as fire and unrestrained violence tore through my favorite local cafes and shops, and shattered glass covered the streets I have walked on all my life. The High Street just yards from the house in which I grew up was engulfed in flames, with homes set alight and buildings ransacked. This was the start of four nights of rioting, looting and widespread disturbance that made international headlines and wreaked havoc in communities across England. Watching the live footage coming out of Ferguson, Missouri, has brought these memories flooding back. 5 things to know about the Michael Brown shooting . While there are differences between the Tottenham riots and events in Ferguson, the similarities are stark. Michael Brown is not Mark Duggan, but he is yet another black man controversially shot dead by police. The police officers have different uniforms and the rioters different accents, but the sense of distance and distrust between them is all too familiar. And the human cost of rioting -- the businesses destroyed, homes damaged and relationships shattered -- transcends all borders. Soon the violence will stop, the streets will empty and the broken glass will be quietly swept away. As a degree of normality returns to this Missouri town, journalists will drift away and the TV cameras will move on. What will be left is a deeply scarred and divided community. The distrust and anger that is compounded by these type of events endures long after public attention has turned away. Healing these divisions will take time, money and commitment. What is crucial is that Ferguson is not left to deal with this alone. When a community so publicly fractures in the most devastating of circumstances, it needs outside help to heal. After the violence in London stopped, the Mayor and the Government committed to a series of reviews, commissions and repair funds that would take place over the coming months. While these were not entirely effective, they did ensure that the needs of the community were not simply forgotten. A damaged community being left to its own devices, with no one to mediate the anger and accusations between different parties, is not a recipe for progress. Much of this work will focus on repairing the relationship between the police and the communities they operate in. Police forces can operate only with the consent of those that they are policing; deep distrust in the police puts that at risk. The first part of this process will involve establishing the truth about what lead to Michael Brown's death, and bringing any wrongdoers to justice. But the protesters on Ferguson's streets know that Michael was not the first young black man shot dead in controversial circumstances, and nor will he be the last. Deeper, more long-term fixes are required. This will require serious effort on both sides to rebuild and move forward. London's current police commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, knew this when he committed to virtually abolishing the controversial and divisive practice of stop and search. So too did New York Mayor Bill de Blasio when he focused his election campaign on the problems caused by its transatlantic cousin: stop and frisk. Similar leadership will be needed in Missouri. My experience suggests that, with time, police-community relations can be rebuilt. In Tottenham, problems remain but the divisions are nowhere near as deep as they once were. The solutions, though, must go deeper than police reform. What became clear from speaking to those who had been involved in the August 2011 UK riots was a sense of alienation -- an awareness that these people felt they had nothing to lose. They were rebelling not just against the local police but against a society they felt they had no stake in. It was, on the whole, those without a job, an education or the hope of a brighter future who were most likely to risk a jail sentence for the sake of a new pair of Air Max trainers. More must be done, through employment, education, urban regeneration and community programs, to integrate these groups with the rest of society. So, too, should we address the problems that have arisen from the social revolution of the 1960s and the economic liberal revolution of the 1980s. Liberalism has made our societies fairer and more tolerant, but in excess it leads to a hyper-individualism that trumps our shared interests and makes us aware of our rights but not our responsibilities. Both in Tottenham and in Ferguson, legitimate protesters were joined by an opportunistic minority. In London, people who had never heard of Mark Duggan rushed down to Footlocker to grab whatever looted trainers they could lay their hands on. Whole families were caught on CCTV making off with widescreen televisions robbed from electronics stores. This sense of entitlement, together with an absence of responsibility or the ability to delay gratification, was also present in pre-crash Wall Street and in the Enron boardroom; it has been very visible in recent years at both ends of society. Since the 2011 UK riots, similar disturbances have taken place in Sweden, Italy, Belgium, Spain, France and the USA. While the immediate anger usually forms around a particular event or a specific government policy, all of these events stem from much deeper and more fundamental issues that continue to rumble below the surface in communities across the developed world. Every now and then we see an eruption, as in Ferguson. It is a sign of the fractures that have emerged in our societies.

"(CNN) -- President Obama spoke Thursday about the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri -- an unrest that began in response to the shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old boy with no criminal record. While the community searched for answers about the killing, answers were slow to come -- both from city officials and police. The name of the officer who shot Brown was not released until today. Citizens, exercising their First Amendment right to peaceful assembly, protested. The police have responded with riot gear, military equipment and tear gas -- banned in international warfare, but used more than once in Ferguson. Against this backdrop, President Obama struck the correct tone, telling the country to ""take a step back to think about how to move forward."" He's tasked both the FBI and Department of Justice with independently investigating Brown's death, and he has spoken with Missouri's Gov. Jay Nixon about the details on the ground in Ferguson. Opinion: Obama needs to lead on racial profiling legislation . While there was no direct mention of the role of race in Brown's killing and the protests that ensued, the President emphasized the shared values of all parties involved. He urged the local authorities to be transparent and to protect citizens' rights to peacefully protest. He urged local citizens to refrain from looting or vandalism and to uphold public order. And he urged everyone to start the path to healing from this tragedy. Full coverage of Ferguson shooting . I do hope that we can begin on this path of healing, but the events in Ferguson are a microcosm of larger forces that pervade American society. First, initial eyewitness reports from Brown's friends indicate that Brown raised his hands and tried to explain he was unarmed, but the police officer began shooting. The tendency to shoot first, ask questions later -- particularly when dealing with young black men -- is an issue the police force must confront. Second, the subsequent reluctance of the police to release details about such a grave use of deadly force is of concern. In a democratic society, we need the authorities responsible for protecting us and given authority to apprehend us to be responsive and transparent. 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting . Third, when the community has a grievance with the authorities, the authorities' first response should not be an extreme crackdown, characteristic of autocratic countries like Russia. To send militarized units with combat-like gear and weapons into the heart of a suburban community where protests are occurring, is deeply troubling. Fourth, the tendency of some in the mainstream media to use pictures of Brown that reinforce a ""thuggish"" stereotype has to stop. The twitter hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown has effectively been used to show how the media could reduce an individual to a stereotype with simply one Facebook picture. Opinion: Obama, can't you see black anger in Ferguson? The situation in Ferguson is changing hourly, but there is hope. With Gov. Nixon's decision to take law enforcement duties out of the hands of St. Louis County and put it into the hands of other law enforcement groups, there could be a return to effective law enforcement. I'm glad to hear the President will continue to monitor the situation and offer federal support to ensure a transparent investigation. When one of our communities experiences tragedy, it deserves answers and it deserves the right to express grievances. I continue to pray for the family and friends of Michael Brown and for a community torn apart to begin to heal.","Donna Brazile: President Obama struck the right tone in asking us to ""move forward""

"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) -- Hours after federal civil rights investigators and the FBI opened an inquiry into the death of a teenager shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, violence flared again in the St. Louis suburb. Police Chief Thomas Jackson told CNN shots were fired Monday night in Ferguson, and police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd that had gathered in an area where looting occurred Sunday. ""Officers were brought in to quell the hostilities,"" he said. ""Tear gas was deployed."" The Saturday-night shooting, which left 18-year-old Michael Brown dead, has fueled rising tensions in the town of 21,000 and sparked national debate. One side says the African-American teenager was surrendering, his hands in the air to show he was unarmed, when the officer opened fire. Authorities counter that Brown had attacked the officer in his car and tried to take his gun. After a vigil for the teen devolved into chaos Sunday when violence and looting broke out among some protesters, NAACP President Cornell William Brooks called Monday for people protesting Brown's death to do so nonviolently. ""We have seen young people giving in to violence and frustration and rage. It may be inexcusable. It is not unexpected,"" Brooks told reporters. ""But I say to my young brothers and sisters, note the young man whose rage is your heart, note that he was nonviolent. He never got into a fight. If you want to honor his memory, honor his memory by seeking justice nonviolently."" Witnesses to Brown's shooting say he was unarmed and had his hands in the air when the police officer shot him. Authorities tell a different story. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar says the officer tried to get out of his vehicle just before the shooting, but Brown pushed him back into his car. Brown ""physically assaulted"" the officer, Belmar said, and the teen tried to get the officer's weapon. Brown was shot about 35 feet from the vehicle, the chief said, declining to provide more details. The officer's name has not been released by authorities. ""The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,"" Belmar said, adding that his department has been called in to conduct an independent investigation. The Ferguson Police Department said its cars are not equipped with dashboard cameras. Shell casings collected at the scene were from the officer's weapon, Belmar said. Monday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the shooting ""deserves a fulsome review"" by federal investigators. ""At every step, we will work with the local investigators, who should be prepared to complete a thorough, fair investigation in their own right. I will continue to receive regular updates on this matter in the coming days,"" Holder said in a statement. ""Aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve."" Mother: 'No violence, just justice' The lawyer representing Brown's parents called Monday for a swift investigation. ""We want this investigation to be done fairly, and we make a demand to the Justice Department to come in and help restore trust and confidence in the process of equal justice. ... This family is very distrustful. This community is very distrustful,"" attorney Benjamin Crump told reporters, calling for witnesses to come forward. Brown's parents urged people to remain calm. ""No violence, just justice,"" the teen's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told reporters. McSpadden said her son recently graduated from high school and was supposed to start college Monday. ""We can't even celebrate,"" she said. ""We've got to plan a funeral."" Standing beside the teen's family, Brooks said the NAACP is committed to determining what happened. ""We are committed to this family, committed to seeking justice, committed to being a presence, day-in and day-out,"" he told reporters. Mayor calls for calm . ""Obviously, the events of last night are not indicative of who we are,"" Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said on CNN on Monday morning, adding that Sunday night's chaos was ""not constructive"" and was only ""bringing down the community."" St. Louis County Police said 32 people were arrested and shots were fired at police. Monday, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch said charges had been filed against about 10 people in connection with burglaries of several businesses. ""What occurred last night, the mob action, we know certainly is not representative of what's going on and what the people in the neighborhood necessarily think,"" he said. Flanked by several from the community Sunday, McSpadden was McSpadden was emotional as she shouted into a television reporter's microphone. ""You took my son away from me! You know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate? You know how many black men graduate? Not many!"" she said. ""Because you bring them down to this type of level where they feel they don't got nothing to live for anyway! (They feel) they gonna try to take me out anyway!"" Others who gathered shouted at police. ""We will stay out here as long as you are!"" they screamed at officers. Many of the officers appeared stoic, watching young men kneel before them and raise their hands up to symbolize surrender, but one officer can be heard on video yelling back, calling protesters ""animals."" Some in Ferguson are demanding that the name of the officer who shot the teenager be released. Monday afternoon, Jackson -- the police chief -- said he plans to release the name in the next 24 hours. Authorities want to make sure the officer is in a safe location, he said. 'Lost control' ""Last night, everything lost control,"" Knowles said Monday. He was asked about the officer who called protesters ""animals."" ""The officers did their best. They're only human,"" Knowles responded, adding that not every police officer present was from the Ferguson department. Sunday's gathering became more intense as some people broke windows at a store and began taking things from it. They threw rocks and bottles. Gunshots rang out. Antonio French, an alderman in St. Louis, said a QuikTrip gas station was looted and an ATM dragged out. ""This QuikTrip is where things started (Saturday) with this case, based on various accounts,"" French said. The slain teenager and a friend were ""accused of stealing gum from the store or some sort of cigarettes,"" the alderman said. ""People have a lot of anger and are frustrated,"" French said. ""They don't have recourse in the system, and it happens often in this country, and it has boiled over. I think people are angry and looking for a reason to let it out tonight."" Knowles said he wants to let the independent investigation into Brown's death take its course. He plans to meet with Brown's parents soon and will meet with clergy in Ferguson and African-American leadership in the town. Whatever the investigation's findings, ""we will deal with that,"" he said. Multiple gunshots . An autopsy will determine how many times Brown was shot. The medical examiner for St. Louis County, Mary Case, said Monday afternoon the autopsy is complete, but she would not give details and said St. Louis County police will release the information. Toxicology results on Brown's body are pending. On the number of times Brown might have been shot, Belmar has said, ""It was more than just a couple."" ""We don't know what happened, and there are lots of conflicting stories,"" Knowles said. ""Unfortunately, there will have to be some time taken to understand what happened. Hopefully, we will get to an understanding, and justice will be served."" The officer who shot Brown is on paid administrative leave during the investigation and will be available to talk to county homicide detectives. He has been with the force for six years and will be required to undergo two psychological evaluations before returning to duty, Belmar said. Crump, who also handled the case of Trayvon Martin in Florida, said Monday that Brown's family is ""devastated"" and doesn't believe that the teenager got into a physical confrontation with police. Martin, 17, was killed in 2012 by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted last year of murder charges. The high-profile case sparked a heated nationwide discussion of race as well as debate over Florida's ""stand your ground"" law. Monday, Crump said Brown's shooting once again highlights ""the senseless death of a young boy of color at the hands of people who are supposed to protect and serve them."" ""Their son was doing all the right things,"" Crump said. ""Graduating from high school, never been in trouble. And for this to happen, for him to be killed in broad daylight ... they want answers just like everybody else in the community."" Trayvon Martin case fast facts .

"(CNN) -- Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has appointed Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, a black man, to take over the security on the ground in Ferguson. The President has issued a call for calm in the wake of a weekend police shooting that left teenager Michael Brown dead. Hopefully we will not see a repeat of the chaos of Wednesday night, when protesters clashed with police. At this point, we ought to be thinking about what the best outcome for the citizens of Ferguson and the family of Michael Brown will be. Monday night I was at a reception for civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis where he spoke eloquently about the importance of voting. Anyone in the black community who says voting is a waste of time because ""they don't care about us"" should take a good, hard look at Ferguson, Missouri. Almost 68% of its citizens are black and just under 30% are white. Five of six city council members are white, the mayor is white, the chief of police is white, and its police force has 50 whites and three blacks. (By the way, has anyone seen any black police officers in Ferguson?) To me the miracle of Ferguson is that the citizens have had the courage to stand up to a power structure that generally does not include them. They are finding the resilience to fight against their oppression, as they appear to have been living in a police state for a very long time. A Missouri Attorney General report on racial profiling last year showed that there were 611 searches in Ferguson: 562 of blacks; 47 of whites; one of a Hispanic; and one of a Native American. Although whites represent almost 30% of the population, they represent less than 10% of those stopped, according to the report. Many people may think those statistics don't look unusual because they genuinely believe blacks are more likely to commit crimes and should be stopped and searched more frequently. But consider that in instances where contraband was found, a higher percentage of whites (34%) who were stopped had contraband when compared with blacks (22%). Against this backdrop, the citizen protest Wednesday night over Brown's death, in the face of a militarized response, was courageous. Why? Because the police in Ferguson are clearly out of control. They have tear-gassed and reportedly shot rubber bullets at demonstrators. They have arrested two reporters -- one of whom works for the Washington Post and was wearing his press credentials around his neck at the time, the other from the Huffington Post. They have pointed high-powered rifles at unarmed citizens in front of cameras; they have refused to identify themselves when making arrests; and they have refused to identify or arrest the police officer who killed Michael Brown. The chief of police says he won't release the name because of fears for that officer's safety. Now that he is in charge, perhaps Johnson will have confidence in his ability to not only guarantee the safety of the police officer, but also the safety of all the citizens of Ferguson. Witnesses say Michael Brown had his hands in the air when he was shot repeatedly by the police officer. The medical examiner's report will put any speculation to rest; Michael Brown's body will speak from the grave. But what will his legacy be for Ferguson, Missouri, and the nation? Elected officials don't have to care about black citizens as long as they don't fear them at the ballot box. Every member of the city council who has sat by silently while citizens were treated like second-class citizens should be voted out of office; Michael Brown's death must result in one of the largest voter registration drives in the history of the state of Missouri. That would be a lasting legacy for such a senseless and untimely death.","Dorothy Brown: Missouri Gov. Nixon appointed highway patrol chief to take over in Ferguson .

"(CNN) -- Two journalists covering civil unrest following a fatal shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, said they were briefly arrested Wednesday night inside a McDonald's in the community. Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan J. Reilly of The Huffington Post said on Twitter that they were arrested while they were doing work and then released within roughly 45 minutes. Neither was charged. ""This was very unnecessary,"" Lowery said in a telephone interview. He said he was never told why he and Reilly were detained, except that they were ""trespassing"" by being inside the fast-food restaurant. Lowery recorded a portion of his interaction with an officer inside the McDonald's. In the video, which was published on The Washington Post's Web site, an officer is heard demanding that he ""stop videotaping."" Citizens and professional journalists generally have the right to record police activities. Afterward, Reilly wrote in a Facebook post that a police officer ""in full riot gear"" ""purposefully banged my head against the window on the way out and sarcastically apologized."" Reilly added, ""I'm fine. But if this is the way these officers treat a white reporter working on a laptop who moved a little too slowly for their liking, I can't imagine how horribly they treat others. And if anyone thinks that the militarization of our police force isn't a huge issue in this country, I've got a story to tell you."" Lowery emphasized that he did not want his arrest to overshadow the ongoing protests in Ferguson or the treatment of the protesters. ""I want this to be about the community,"" he said. ""But this arrest is in some ways an anecdote of what's going on here."" The arrests came amid an already-tense situation between journalists and the authorities in Ferguson, the site of last Saturday's police shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old, Michael Brown. There have been several reports of reporters and the camera crews being told to leave protest areas, but no reported arrests until Wednesday. The Ferguson police chief, Thomas Jackson, told CNN he did not know who the arresting officers were. ""We had a lot of different agencies out there,"" Jackson said. At 11 p.m. CDT, Jackson said 18 people had been taken into custody on Wednesday, including the two reporters. Elsewhere in the area on Wednesday evening, a number of reporters said they were doused with tear gas when authorities tried to disperse crowds. Ash-Har Quraishi, a correspondent for Al Jazeera America who previously worked for CNN, said his crew was in a place ""we believed to be safe"" when people started running toward them. ""Rubber bullets were fired on us, and then a canister,"" he said. ""We had to retreat into the neighborhood."" In a statement about the ""worsening situation in Ferguson,"" Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon urged law enforcement agencies ""to keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press during this difficult time."" Officials at both The Washington Post and The Huffington Post issued statements that assailed the reporter arrests. Martin Baron, the executive editor of The Washington Post, said in a statement Wednesday night that ""there was absolutely no justification"" for Lowery's arrest. Baron noted that the reporter was ""illegally instructed to stop taking video of officers. Then he followed officers' instructions to leave a McDonald's -- and after contradictory instructions on how to exit, he was slammed against a soda machine and then handcuffed. That behavior was wholly unwarranted and an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news."" Ryan Grim, The Huffington Post's Washington bureau chief, noted in a statement that Reilly ""has reported multiple times from Guantanamo Bay."" According to Grim, Reilly ""said that the police resembled soldiers more than officers, and treated those inside the McDonald's as 'enemy combatants.'"" Grim concluded his statement by saying, ""Police militarization has been among the most consequential and unnoticed developments of our time, and it is now beginning to affect press freedom.""

"(CNN) -- The central California city of Salinas is being rocked with unrest and violence after protesters accused police of racism and brutality in the fatal shootings of three Latino men since March, including one captured on grainy video this week. Demonstrations peaked Wednesday night when a man was shot to death outside his home near an anti-police protest. The circumstances of that shooting, which did not involve police, are being investigated, police said. When authorities responded to that homicide, demonstrators went to the scene and threw bricks, bottles, sticks and rocks at police and EMS personnel as they aided the shooting victim, police said. One bottle struck the head of an officer who was giving CPR to the victim, stopping him from giving aid, police said. The shooting victim, Constantino Garcia, 23, who had just moved to Salinas with his wife and child, was pronounced dead at a hospital, police said. Detectives said about 100 people saw the homicide, but no witnesses are cooperating with police. In Wednesday's protests, police arrested demonstrator Diego Garcia, 26, who was accused of taunting officers, antagonizing a police dog and urging the crowd to join him. He was arrested on accusations of inciting a riot, resisting arrest and probation violation, police said. The rising tensions led Police Chief Kelly McMillin to hold a news conference Thursday afternoon in which he offered more details on one incident that has infuriated some and explained his department's approach to addressing it. ""They are frustrated, they are angry -- and legitimately,"" McMillin said. ""I'm not going to tell anybody that you just don't understand what you see. They see it, they react to it, that could upset them."" The residents should be able to express their views, as should police, he added. ""We recognize that ... the anger of the community (is) coming out,"" said McMillin. ""We're trying to explain ourselves as best we can and move on."" Most recent fatal shooting . The most recent officer-involved shooting happened Tuesday afternoon and ended in the death of a man who allegedly lunged at officers with gardening shears. The man -- whom police identified Thursday as 44-year-old Carlos Mejia -- was accused of breaking into a woman's home and threatening her while armed with the shears, police said. The suspect also exposed himself to the woman and made sexually explicit statements, police said, adding that the man also tried to kill the woman's dog. When police responded to a 911 call, the suspect was walking on Elkington Avenue and police noticed he had a large pair of gardening shears sticking out of his backpack, police said. Rather than comply with officers, the man swung the gardening shears at the officers near him, according to police. ""It's a pretty common item, we see it all the time,"" McMillin said Thursday, holding up the shears. ""...But the manner in which it was presented ... this clearly is a weapon and obviously a very dangerous one."" The officers ""were dead set against allowing him to get into"" a nearby bakery, fearful of the damage he could do there, according to the chief. One attempt to subdue him using a Taser ended in ""a catastrophic failure,"" according to McMillin, and ultimately the officers fired on the suspect. The man was pronounced dead on the scene. From a distance, a witness took a videotape of the encounter between two police officers and the suspect, who walked away from police before being shot and killed. But the videotape wasn't clear on what had transpired between police and the man before the shooting. The video was posted on YouTube. The police chief played that and other footage of the incident reporters, explaining that he did so to give the public a better sense of what happened. He said no final judgment has been made on whether the officers were ""reasonable"" in their use of deadly force. ""When people look at (this case), you don't (necessarily) get a lot of the details and you don't necessarily understand exactly what was happening,"" McMillin said. This new information was released ""to make people understand why the officers did what they did, and just what the officers did."" March 20 shooting . The first officer-involved shooting occurred March 20, when police fatally shot a man with a gun under his sweatshirt in a restaurant parking lot, police said. Police had received a call about a suspicious person with a handgun. ""As the involved officers challenged the suspect, the suspect lifted his sweatshirt, brandishing a handgun at the officers. Fearing that the suspect was going to shoot, the involved officers shot the suspect, resulting in the suspect's death at the scene,"" police said. ""Three Salinas police officers were involved in this incident and were not injured."" The fatally shot man was Angel Ruiz, who was armed with an Airsoft pellet gun, CNN affiliate KSBW reported. May 9 shooting . On May 9, police received 911 calls about a man chasing people and waving a large knife, and after arriving on the scene, officers used a Taser on the suspect, Osman Hernandez, 26, who had no arrest history in Salinas, police said. When they tried to put handcuffs on him, Hernandez ""pulled up his shirt clearly exposing a large knife that was tucked into the area of his waistband,"" police said. ""Quickly, the suspect grabbed the knife and pulled it out towards the officers who were in close proximity to him while attempting to restrain him,"" police said. Two officers shot Hernandez, who died at the scene, police said. On Wednesday, Hernandez's family filed a claim against the city seeking $2 million in damages, KSBW reported, quoting the family's attorney. ""There is something seriously wrong. It's horrific.

"(CNN) -- A car packed with explosives blew up outside a popular restaurant in Somalia's capital Sunday evening, killing at least 10 people, police said. Fifteen others were wounded in the blast in the heart of Mogadishu, senior Somali police Officer Farhah Aden said. He said the death toll could rise, since many of the victims were seriously injured. The car was parked at the gate of the Oromo restaurant before it was detonated, Aden said. The hotel is popular with Somalian government officials and is just a few kilometers from the country's parliament compound. An eyewitness said he saw a ball of smoke rising into the sky after the explosion. ""I was inside the restaurant at the time of the blast,"" Ibrahim Mohamed said. ""I heard a loud sound of an explosion from the gate of the building and went outside, where I saw dead bodies lying on chairs they were sitting down in, using the Internet."" The Al-Shabaab terror group has claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the spokesman for the group, Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab. Last month, the group's leader was killed in an American airstrike.

"(CNN) -- In a single column, a veteran police officer has catapulted himself into the national debate over the death of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. ""I'm a cop. If you don't want to get hurt, don't challenge me,"" the Washington Post headline blares. The piece was written by Sunil Dutta, a 17-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department. ""Even though it might sound harsh and impolitic, here is the bottom line: if you don't want to get shot, tased, pepper-sprayed, struck with a baton or thrown to the ground, just do what I tell you,"" he wrote. Dutta cautions against arguing, insulting, or screaming at officers, ""and don't even think of aggressively walking towards me. Most field stops are complete in minutes. How difficult is it to cooperate for that long?"" If you believe an officer is violating your rights or bullying you, Dutta says, don't challenge him then -- save that for lodging a complaint later. ""Do what the officer tells you to and it will end safely for both of you."" It took no time for the anger over his message to explode. ""The outrageous thing is not that he says it. The outrageous thing is that we accept it,"" writes Ken White of the blog Popehat, which tracks American legal issues. ""Do we have a justice system? By name, yes. Is it effective in deterring cops from abusing citizens or punishing them when they do? No... If you hope the cop will be charged criminally for misbehavior, you're going to be waiting a very long time for no result."" Dutta's message is to ""shut up and take it, because even the slightest bit of intransigence is grounds for the cops to unleash a world of hurt,"" writes Benjamin Freed of the Washingtonian. ""To say that putting up a verbal argument warrants bringing out the billy clubs, stun guns, or actual guns only stokes what's been seen coming out of Ferguson in the past week -- images of peaceful demonstrators being met with a lines of officers rigged with military-grade equipment, marchers being fogged with canisters of tear gas, and people being slugged with rubber bullets after not moving quickly enough,"" Freed complains. Authorities in Ferguson say force has been needed to stop the minority of ""agitators"" who have fomented violence, through gunshots and Molotov cocktails. CNN.com users weighed in on social media. ""So, 'Do what I say or I will hurt/kill you?' How does that even remotely correspond with 'To Serve and Protect?'"" Carter Gaddis wrote on Twitter, citing the police motto. But Rhonda Heim wrote on Facebook, ""I think an officer puts his life on the line on a daily basis. He wants to go home after his shift like everyone else. No one should challenge him."" Mike Knox, a business owner and father of four in Ferguson, told CNN ""people are just tired"" of being pulled over when they did nothing wrong, so it's common to give police attitude in the area. But he teaches his children not to. ""When you see police, respect the police,"" he tells them. ""Say 'yes sir and 'no sir.' It'll get you a long way."" And since loitering can lead police to think you're up to no good, he adds, ""keep it moving."" ""If you let your attitude take over, that can be you laying on that ground,"" Knox adds. In Dutta's column, published Tuesday, he writes, ""Cops are not murderers. No officer goes out in the field wishing to shoot anyone, armed or unarmed."" Still, he does not defend all police. ""I know it is scary for people to be stopped by cops. I also understand the anger and frustration if people believe they have been stopped unjustly or without a reason. I am aware that corrupt and bully cops exist. When it comes to police misconduct, I side with the ACLU: Having worked as an internal affairs investigator, I know that some officers engage in unprofessional and arrogant behavior; sometimes they behave like criminals themselves."" Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests . Dutta notes that people don't have to submit to illegal stops or searches, and can refuse consent to search a car or home without a warrant. ""Always ask the officer whether you are under detention or are free to leave. Unless the officer has a legal basis to stop and search you, he or she must let you go. Finally, cops are legally prohibited from using excessive force: The moment a suspect submits and stops resisting, the officers must cease use of force."" But protesters throughout the country say submitting to an officer doesn't always avoid police brutality. They point to the case of Eric Garner, killed by New York police in a chokehold in July. And in California, a 51-year-old woman was seen on video being repeatedly punched by a Highway Patrol officer. In a CNN.com column last week, Iris Baez of the Justice Committee in New York wrote that her son died nearly 20 years ago in an illegal police chokehold. ""These tragedies and injustices happen year after year, and people of color -- primarily black and Latino -- are usually the victims."" ""Police-community relations can only start to improve when individual officers who abuse civilians' rights are held accountable with a zero-tolerance policy for police brutality,"" she says. Dutta wants all police to use body cameras and video recorders in their vehicles, which ""will prevent a situation like Mike Brown's shooting, about which conflicting and self-serving statements allow people to believe what they want."" The events that led up to the teen's shooting remain unclear, with very different descriptions emerging. While Dutta comes off as ""reasonable,"" he is demanding ""unresisting submission to police without argument or even legal protest,"" J.D. Tuccille writes at Reason.com. ""Just how do you 'refuse consent to search your car or home' without running afoul of the no-nos Dutta warns may get you 'shot, tased, pepper-sprayed, struck with a baton or thrown to the ground?'"" Journalists who were arrested amid Ferguson protests have reported they did nothing wrong. Dutta, a professor of homeland security and criminal justice at Colorado Technical University, could not be reached immediately for comment Wednesday on the uproar over his column. In a tweet linking to his response, the Washingtonian's Benjamin Freed wrote, ""I challenged Officer Sunil Dutta. Hopefully he won't come hurt me."" Magazine: The aftermath in Ferguson .

"Washington (CNN) -- Ron Paul and Rand Paul are singing slightly different tunes on the threat of Ebola. Sen. Rand Paul, an ophthalmologist and likely presidential contender, has been generating headlines for his stark warnings about the virus, urging a temporary flight suspension from certain West African countries and suggesting Ebola is much more contagious than the government says. His father, former Rep. Ron Paul, who's also a physician, appears to feel differently. In a column out Sunday, he sounds less distressed about the potential of the virus spreading in the United States and doesn't seem to think airline restrictions will do much good. White House not naming Ebola 'czar' The former presidential candidate -- an obstetrician with a strong libertarian following -- doesn't mention banning flights as a possible solution. Instead, he writes that safety concerns can best be handled by the airlines themselves, which he says would have a greater incentive to protect passengers than governments would. ""They can do so while providing a safe means of travel for those seeking medical treatment in the United States,"" he writes. ""This would remove the incentive to lie about exposure to the virus among those seeking to come here for treatment."" Questions remain about how Dallas nurse got Ebola . While his son, a Republican from Kentucky, has speculated that the virus can be transmitted via cough particles in the air, Ron Paul calls it ""very difficult to contract."" ""Common-sense precautions should be able to prevent Ebola from spreading,"" he writes. Government officials have said the virus can only be transmitted through bodily fluids. But they've also said they would look closely at cases in which individuals had direct contact with Ebola patients, including getting sneezed or coughed on. But Ron Paul dedicates part of his opinion piece on accusing the U.S. government for partially propping up the virus by sending foreign aid to countries like Liberia. Ebola outbreak: Get up to speed with the latest . According to Paul's logic, private investment rather that government money would help countries develop a competitive, more effective medical infrastructure. ""The people of Liberia and other countries would be better off if the US government left them alone,"" he writes. ""Leave it to private citizens to invest in African business and trade with the African people."" It's no surprise that the two men don't fall perfectly in line on the topic. Rand Paul has long taken different policy stances and opinions that those of his father. CDC 'doubling down' on Ebola training efforts . But as the senator prepares for a potential presidential bid and as Ron Paul remains a vocal activist who frequently weighs in on the issues, their differences shed light on the politically famous father-son pair and how a Rand Paul for President campaign would look all the more different from Ron Paul's three White House bids.","Ron Paul and Rand Paul are both physicians and prominent politicians.

"(CNN) -- Seeking to stem what it calls media ""misinformation,"" Florida State University has broken what it calls its ""deliberate silence"" about the way it has dealt with sexual assault allegations that were raised against star football player Jameis Winston nearly two years ago -- allegations that he denies. In an open letter sent Friday ""to members of the Florida State University community"" and the media, the university said it decided to share a time line of the case and the university's responses. The reason for providing more detail, the letter stated, was ""the continual drumbeat of misinformation about the University's actions (that) causes harm to our students, faculty, alumni, supporters and the FSU community as a whole."" The letter does not mention Winston by name, nor does it specify which facts of the case have been misrepresented in news reports. Previously, the university would not comment on the investigation, citing state and federal student privacy laws. FSU is conducting a Title IX investigation concerning an allegation that Winston, sexually assaulted a woman in a Tallahassee bar in December 2012. The accuser reported the alleged assault to campus police that night, and a month later accused Winston of the alleged rape. Police said the woman ""broke off contact"" with investigators in February 2013 and didn't want to go forward with the case. However, the Title IX investigation is required by law even if criminal charges were not filed. Winston could be charged by his university for a code-of-conduct violation for sexual misconduct, depending upon the results of the school's investigation. Meanwhile, Winston, aside from a one-game suspension earlier this season for yelling a sexually explicit remark near the school's student union, continues to play for the Seminoles, who are undefeated and ranked No. 1 in the polls. Winston won the Heisman Trophy, the award for college football's most outstanding player, while guiding the Seminoles to the national championship last season. FSU shares details of Winston case . Among the main points in FSU's time line: . -- The university said the FSU athletics department learned of the allegation against Winston in January 2013. Winston came forward to the department after a Tallahassee police detective contacted him about the allegations. -- The athletics department heard accounts from Winston and two other players who were present during the alleged encounter, and all three players said the event was consensual, the university said. -- The university says the athletics department did not initially file a report with the school's Title IX administrator because police filed no charges, and because of the players' accounts, in which they said no sexual assault had taken place. -- The university says it took several steps to protect the woman's identity and privacy. -- A Title IX investigation was eventually opened after media inquiries were made into the incident, and local law enforcement had referred the case to the state attorney's office. ""The University takes sexual assault very seriously,"" the letter states. ""The University is also cooperating fully with the U.S. Dept. of Education investigation into this matter. Indeed, it was the University that informed the DOE nearly six months ago about the Athletics Department knowledge of the case."" John Clune, an attorney for the accuser, said in a email to CNN that the ""obvious news in this statement is that senior athletic department officials met with Winston and his lawyer one month after"" the alleged incident, ""then decided to hide it from the Title IX office."" Clune said the university's ""PR team is trying to do a little preventative damage control"" in anticipation of more negative media reports. ""What else can the school do wrong in this mess?"" Clune said. "" The whole country is moving toward improving the response to campus rape while Florida State still backpedals the other way."" FSU not alone in troubles . FSU is one of several universities under federal review for their handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints. Roughly 150 miles away in Gainesville, University of Florida quarterback Treon Harris was briefly suspended after being accused of sexually assaulting a female student early Sunday morning in a campus residence hall. The student who accused Treon Harris of sexual battery has withdrawn her criminal complaint, the school said. That means she is not pursuing criminal charges against him now, though she may in the future. ""We have been notified that the university and legal process is complete,"" head coach Will Muschamp said in a statement. ""Treon has been reinstated to the team, but he will not play Saturday. This has been a learning experience for everyone involved. Treon has been honest with me throughout the process and is looking forward to rejoining his teammates."" Harris' attorney, Huntley Johnson, said his client is not guilty of a crime, according to multiple news reports. The University of Kentucky has indefinitely suspended freshman defensive end Lloyd Tubman after he was charged with rape. The school's athletic department announced the suspension Tuesday. Tubman pleaded not guilty Wednesday and was released on a $10,000 bond, according to The Courier-Journal newspaper in Louisville. He is due back in court later this month. ""Obviously, I'm very concerned about the allegations and all parties involved,"" Kentucky head football coach Mark Stoops said Tuesday. ""We're working extremely hard to develop quality young men on and off the field. We will continue to cooperate with the local and campus authorities while the process takes its course."" Winston accuser did not press charges . According to police documents in the Winston case, the accuser said the athlete raped her in December 2012 after she had been drinking with friends at a bar in Tallahassee. She said an unknown man gave her a shot glass of liquid before they left the bar. The accuser also said she did not remember much of what happened next but that she remembered being in a ground-floor apartment, where a man took off her clothes and had sex with her despite her objections, according to police documents. The accuser reported the alleged assault to campus police that night. A month later, in January 2013, she accused Winston of the alleged rape. Tallahassee's interim police chief at the time, Tom Coe, said the woman ""broke off contact"" with investigators in February 2013 and didn't want to go forward with the case. The woman's family said a detective warned her attorney that Tallahassee is a ""big football town"" and that life could be miserable if she pursued the case. Tim Jansen, an attorney for Winston, said his client had consensual sex with the woman. After Winston won the Heisman Trophy, the Seminoles went on to win the BCS National Championship against Auburn in January. Winston spent this spring playing for the Florida State baseball team, until April when he made headlines again for allegedly shoplifting crab legs from a supermarket in Tallahassee. According to police, Winston said he forgot to pay. Winston was suspended from the baseball team for four days. As part of a civil citation for alleged shoplifting -- an alternative to criminal prosecution for first-time, nonviolent offenses in Leon County -- Winston was not arrested but was ordered to serve at least 20 hours of community service, authorities said. Florida State initially announced Winston would be suspended for the first half of the game against Clemson after the sexual remark. However, Athletics Director Stan Wilcox increased the punishment the day before the game after hearing eyewitness accounts that differed from Winston's initial version, a source close to the situation told CNN's Rachel Nichols.","FSU issues an open letter detailing its investigation of the case .

"(CNN) -- Authorities made a series of arrests at Occupy Wall Street protests in California and Georgia on Tuesday and Wednesday, with clashes in one city that involved tear gas being used on demonstrators. Police said they fired the tear gas on protesters in Oakland, California, after the crowd threw paint and other objects at officers. Among the injured in the clash was a two-time Iraq war veteran, Scott Olsen, who sustained a skull fracture after allegedly being shot in the head with a police projectile, according to Iraq Veterans Against the War. Olsen, a former Marine, was in serious but stable condition Wednesday afternoon at Highland General Hospital in Oakland, said Dottie Guy, a member of the veterans group who told CNN by phone that she was visiting Olsen at the hospital. Among a growing number of war vets participating in the Occupy movement, Olsen was peacefully marching from a downtown library toward City Hall in an effort to reclaim an encampment that had been cleared out by police, the veterans group said. During Tuesday's clash in Oakland, plumes of smoke could be seen in the city as about 500 people defied calls to leave an area of downtown Oakland, according to police. Protesters had camped for weeks in several areas in the city, including near City Hall, police said. ""The city remains committed to respecting free speech as well as maintaining the city's responsibility to protect public health and safety,"" Oakland police said in a statement. Oakland resident Andrew Johnson said he decided to leave when police threatened arrests, soon after hearing explosions as tear gas canisters were fired into the air. ""I think at first it was a pretty inspiring sight,"" he said of the protesters. ""It was inspiring to see people so impassioned. But when the police action began, it was a pretty unnerving sight. Just to see that energy turn into panic and anger was unsettling."" In Atlanta, police arrested demonstrators at a downtown park overnight. The arrests came after Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said he sent ministers to the park ""to see if we can find a way to resolve this amicably."" Reed told CNN affiliate WSB that concerns were increased when a man in the park was seen with an assault rifle. ""We could not determine whether the weapon was loaded and could not get additional information on the weapon,"" he said. Authorities ordered people to leave the park around midnight Tuesday, WSB said, going from tent to tent with flashlights. Arrests began taking place about 12:45 a.m. Organizers had asked protesters to be peaceful if police took action, and most were, WSB said. Many gathered in the center of the park, locked arms and sang ""We Shall Overcome,"" as police led them one by one to waiting buses. A protester at the park said he was scared. ""It's very intimidating,"" said Malcolm McKenzie. ""I believe what we're doing is right, but we're going to jail. It hurts to see America do this to people who want change."" It was unclear how many people were arrested in the two cities. CNN affiliate KGO reported that at least 85 people were arrested during an early morning raid in one part of Oakland and there were other arrests throughout the day. In Atlanta, WSB reported 53 were arrested. In Oakland early Tuesday, police dismantled a tent camp set up by protesters in a city park. The overnight camping had to end because of health and safety concerns, Oakland police said in a statement. ""There were a series of safety conditions, including numerous reports of fighting, assault and threatening/intimidating behavior"" at the camp, police said in a statement. Medical responders could not get to the scene to provide medical care on at least two occasions, and fire and police also could not get through. ""Sanitation conditions worsened with frequent instances of public urination and defecation, as well as improper food storage,"" the police statement said. ""The existing rodent problem in the park was exacerbated, and authorities were unable to control it because of the campers' presence. Graffiti, litter and vandalism also posed problems, police said. After the camp was dispersed, the protesters reconvened for demonstrations later in the day, the affiliates said, prompting the new clashes. Video from the Oakland clashes showed a chaotic scene, with protesters running from clouds of tear gas. Oakland and Atlanta are two of many cities worldwide dealing with the Occupy Wall Street protests, the leaderless movement that started in New York in September. Next round of protests to be closely watched . Demonstrators have typically railed against what they describe as corporate greed, arrogance and power, as well as repeatedly stated their assertion that the nation's wealthiest 1% hold inordinate sway over the remaining 99% of the population. Meanwhile, Occupy Wall Street expanded its message to include a call for better health care for the ""99 percent,"" marching to a shuttered Greenwich Village hospital slated to become high-end condominiums. Several hundred protesters from Zuccotti Park spent their afternoon connecting their message to the health care debate, converging on the offices of Blue Cross Blue Shield, rallying with doctors and nurses, before heading to the site of the former St. Vincent's Hospital. The hospital closed April 30, 2010, and there has been a bitter public debate since over plans to build high-end condominium apartments in a neighborhood with overcrowded schools and no other public health care.

"(CNN) -- What if this was your town? That's the haunting question being chanted in the streets of Ferguson, Missouri. It demands an answer. Ever since an unarmed black teen was shot and killed by Ferguson police five days ago, what's unfolded has been positively un-American. The Ferguson police chief has refused to name the officer who shot Michael Brown or to reveal key details about the shooting. His force has responded to protesters with a surplus of militarism and a deficit of sense, skill or humanity. They've run roughshod over freedom of the press, freedom of assembly and the right to be young and African-American and presumed innocent. LZ Granderson: How many unarmed people have to die? There has been a vacuum of leadership at every scale of this story. The mayor has seemed flat-footed. The governor was too long silent, then finally issued a statement, saying he would visit Ferguson. The President has kept his distance since issuing a statement of his own. Nowhere thus far has there been a political leader like Robert Kennedy in Indianapolis after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., wading at once into the charged scene with physical courage and quiet moral authority -- sharing in grief, naming the tragedy, earning the trust needed to call for peace. Fortunately -- if that's a word that may be used in this situation -- everyday Americans have been filling this void. Citizens in Ferguson and across Missouri have protested and organized marches and vigils. African-Americans unleashed a wave of commentary on social media, highlighting how swiftly stereotypes can indict and convict black men in the court of public opinion. Then when journalists covering the story were manhandled by the police and locked up for reporting the story, Twitter exploded and people across the country -- indeed, the world -- began to amplify their voices in a burgeoning, turbulent virtual square called #Ferguson. Now libertarians who have long mistrusted the heavy hand of government find themselves in common cause with social-justice progressives who cannot believe that this is happening half a century after the Civil Rights Act became law. What these citizens from the right, left and all points between are saying is simple: No one in the United States should get away with this kind of abuse of power. We may disagree on taxes and health care and immigration. But we can agree that the most basic form of civic power -- the force necessary to protect a community -- must in a democracy be subject to the kind of accountability that is utterly missing in Ferguson. To be sure, some perspective is important: There is still so much unknown about the killing. A Twitter wave obliterates context and thrusts forward only the most sensational aspects of a story. And plenty of partisans on the left and right are taking Ferguson as a chance to bash the other side for its failed policies and ideologies. But let's be very clear. What's happening in Ferguson is not just politics. It's not what historian Daniel Boorstin called a ""pseudo-event."" It's real. It's a spark of anger and alienation that emerged first from African-Americans who bear the petty humiliations and mortal dangers of second-class treatment. Now it's spreading. Complete coverage on Ferguson shooting and protests . In this age of contagion, when pent-up frustration and a desire to change social norms can cascade quickly into tea parties or Arab Springs or marriage equality movements, it's not easy to say where this spark will lead. And as events unfold, we would do well to ask ourselves a basic question. It comes from the exam that immigrants take to become citizens of the United States, and it is surprising in its simple profundity: . ""What is the rule of law?"" Alas, the killing of Michael Brown is awakening many to the meaning of that question -- and to the consequences of ignorance. The rule of law must mean, at the barest minimum, that the government tells us which of its agents has slayed an unarmed citizen. It must mean administering justice in a way that is credible, transparent and responsive to the people. It must also mean an end to the looting in Ferguson. But it also should have meant that we never got to a scene like Ferguson. 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting . So now it's time for each of us not to be spectators, merely watching the flames in the streets or the pundits on the screen, but to be citizens. It's time to look around our own communities and consider just how we see and treat each other. How over-martialized and under-professionalized our own police forces may be. How little empathy exists among people of different races and social classes. How so many of our neighbors see ""the rule of law"" as a cruel, cynical joke. And how we can change all that.

"St. Louis (CNN) -- The lines to get a seat inside Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church started forming before 8 a.m. By then the sun was already high and the air thick. Many of the elderly who arrived early for Monday's funeral retreated to the few pockets of shade around the rim of the building, while a handful of younger women used their Sunday hats as fans. The few men who bothered to put on suit jackets joked about a change of heart. Their smiles, framed by streams of sweat, greeted friends and strangers alike. It would appear that after protests, riots, tear gas and rubber bullets in Ferguson gripped national headlines for a week, this Missouri summer waited until cooler heads prevailed before unfurling one of its hottest days. ""I just want peace, girl, peace,"" I overheard a woman saying. ""Yes, Lord,"" was the reply. The word ""peace"" was heard a lot during Michael Brown's homegoing. For many, this was a day of peace because there were no protests. I find that notion misguided. For to pin all of the events that have brought chaos over the past two weeks on Officer Darren Wilson firing six bullets into an unarmed 18-year-old is to oversimplify a much more complicated problem. Blacks in and around Ferguson have felt targeted by police and disenfranchised for decades. They are overrepresented in police stops and arrests and underrepresented as police officers and lawmakers. They have been frustrated by this dynamic since long before Michael Brown was born -- so no, it is not this day that would confer peace, no matter how many hugs and smiles came with it. That's because nothing has changed. It might have been a day devoid of violence in these streets, but the unrest within the souls of the people who walk them remained. How can there be peace? The power structure must change. And when you know that just 6% of eligible black voters made it to the polls in the last municipal election in a city that is nearly 70% black, where to start that change is clear. ""We have got to vote,"" said Shirley Minter, a mature woman, who arrived early because, she said, ""I needed to be here."" ""There is not a whole lot we can do to fight this injustice if we're not willing to make our voices heard. And the main way to make our voices heard is by voting. Especially our young people."" Her friend, Stella Dermin, agreed. ""I'm originally from Louisiana. I can remember when they used to charge us $3 to vote. And you had to pass a test. And if you didn't pass that test, you couldn't vote,"" she said. ""Now the young people don't even bother voting and it's holding us back. All of this protesting -- this boy's death will mean nothing if we don't start doing what we can to change the way things are."" Makeshift voter registration booths had popped up around Ferguson, most notably at the burned-down QuikTrip which has served as ground zero for protesters, and another near where Brown was shot and killed. But signing up is not the same as following through. And following through does not guarantee a slate of candidates who are sensitive to their constituents' needs. The day of Michael Brown's funeral may have been without violence, but that should not be mistaken for peace. ""I vote, but many of my friends don't because they think it doesn't matter,"" said 21-year-old Joshua Jones, a native of Ferguson who said he recently graduated from DePauw University and is starting graduate school at St. Louis University this fall. He said he didn't know Brown but came to his funeral because ""he could've been me."" ""The thing is, my friends think the system isn't looking out for them. And it's hard for me to argue with them when so many things around support what they are saying,"" Jones said. ""But I don't think anything in Ferguson is going to change unless black people start voting."" A statement that is as true as it is sad and frustrating. So much blood was shed to fight for the black community's right to vote and too many of us choose not to -- still. It's hard to point an angry finger at an unjust system when we surrender any power that we have to change it. Though on this day, there are signs that true peace may be on the horizon here. The oppressive heat drew plenty of complaints, but it did not stop the people from coming. So when the pews of the sanctuary were full, church greeters directed those who came to pay their respects to Michael Brown and his family to the overflow building next door. And when the designated overflow area was full, the community was sent to the gymnasium, where a sea of folding chairs waited. And when that was full, people were sent across the street to another overflow area where the funeral was being broadcast on portable screens. More than 4,500 came to say goodbye to Michael Brown, many of whom did not know him personally. If that energy can be converted into political power, who knows? Maybe peace isn't that far away. ""I'm here because I believe we can turn things around here,"" said Gary Orr Sr. ""We've got to. It's not up to white people to make things better for us, it's up to us. We've got to care about each other more, look out for each other more, get involved."" Orr, who brought his family to the ceremony, was standing in front of one of the overflow buildings during my interview with him. Afterward, I went inside. That's when I saw a mural bearing Isaiah 40:31: . But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings as eagles, they shall run and not be weary; and they shall walk and not faint. That's what the people of Ferguson must do when the cameras are gone. The tears have all dried. The protests done. Whether Wilson is indicted or not, they must run and not be weary. Walk and not faint. Vote -- lest the outrage that followed Michael Brown's passing be for naught, and true peace remain unattainable.","Granderson: At Michael Brown funeral, people spoke of peace, but that's more than no protests .

"(CNN) -- On the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, support for slain teenager Michael Brown has been overwhelming. On the Internet fundraising site GoFundMe, however, Officer Darren Wilson gets more of the backing. The fundraising effort for Wilson, which began Sunday, had raised more than $235,000 from 5,900 donors as of Friday afternoon. That compares with $165,000 for Brown's family that has flowed in over eight days from roughly the same number of contributors into a page on the same site. The sites are peppered with comments that reveal stark contrasts in views. ""My heart breaks at this injustice,"" one person wrote on the page set up to raise money for Brown's family. ""God bless you and keep you as you move forward with your lives! Thank you for the transparency of where the money will go and how that will be handled."" Another person on that site saw a larger resonance in the killing by a white police officer of an unarmed black teenager. ""I am tired of seeing our children cut down like dogs....."" that person wrote. It's a different story just a few clicks away. ""I just want him and his family to know how much we care and believe he did the right thing and he is not alone in this,"" someone wrote in support of Wilson. ""Every single law enforcement agency in the country should hold a fundraiser or collect $ to donate directly to this officer for his legal expenses, relocation of his family and additional living expenses,"" another message said. ""We are all one law enforcement family."" Firm conclusions for the disparity in levels of support for Wilson and Brown's family were elusive. Where is Darren Wilson? One limitation of comparing the amount of money raised online is that those figures do not include donations to places that also may be raising money, such as churches, said Stacy Palmer, the editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy. ""They may be more trusted than some of the other organizations, and in a case as explosive as this, trust is a huge issue,"" she said. On Wilson's side, he is a police officer -- a group known for vigorously taking care of its own. And it would be a mistake to ignore the fact that millions across the country do stand with Wilson and are happy to back him. Another factor that could affect giving: Researchers have found that people are less likely to give to causes where they find the recipients somehow responsible for their plight, said Karen Winterich, an associate professor of marketing at Penn State who has studied why people donate money. On the one hand, that could make people less likely to support Wilson if they conclude that he acted improperly -- some witnesses say he shot and killed Brown even though Brown had his hands raised. On the other hand, it could translate into diminished support for Brown's family among people who focus on police assertions that Brown stole cigars and roughed up a convenience store employee moments before the shooting, or on reports that say he shoved the officer and wrestled for his gun. Regardless of the reasons, both Palmer and Deborah Small, a marketing professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said focusing on the donations leaves out a huge part of the story: the direct support for Brown on the street. Protesters have vowed to force change, and some lawmakers have proposed legislation to address some of the issues raised by the shooting. ""Lots of people are supporting Brown in other ways, and these actions may be more useful than donations,"" Small said. Lauryn Hill releases song in support of Ferguson .

"(CNN) -- Miami-area lawmakers are proposing adding a 51st star to the American flag. City of South Miami commissioners have approved a resolution that calls for splitting Florida in half. The resolution outlines a new state, made up of 24 counties in the southern part of the peninsula. The split would be along the Interstate 4 corridor. Specifically, commissioners want Pinellas, Hillsborough, Polk, Orange and Brevard to become the border counties of the state of South Florida. The new state would include the cities of St. Petersburg, Tampa and Orlando -- so Disney World is in, Daytona Beach is out. The 24 counties would include 23,000 square miles, about 40% of Florida's present land mass. It would also house 13.4 million people, about two-thirds of the present population. Though the proposal sounds farcical, it highlights the serious issue of rising sea levels, which threaten the southern half of the state. According to the resolution, which passed by a 3-2 vote, North Florida sits 120 feet above sea level, while parts of South Florida are 5 feet or less above sea level. Read the resolution for yourself (PDF) The ""situation is very precarious and in need of immediate attention,"" according to the resolution, which goes on to say that water levels are expected to rise 3 to 6 feet over the next century. Commissioners said the creation of a 51st state ""is a necessity for the very survival of the entire southern region,"" claiming that, ""Often South Florida issues do not receive the support of Tallahassee. This is despite the fact that South Florida generates more than 69% of the state's revenue."" The commission directed its clerk to send copies of the resolution to all 24 counties, as well as the cities within those counties, for approval. Florida voters and Congress would need to approve splitting the state.","In resolution, South Miami commissioners propose creating state of South Florida .

"(CNN) -- I believed we had learned lessons from the George Zimmerman case in how to better handle cases like the Michael Brown shooting. Zimmerman, you'll recall, was charged with shooting Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager in Sanford, Florida, in 2012. I was Zimmereman's lawyer. That case caught national attention for the shooting itself, but almost more for the way law enforcement was perceived to have mishandled it and for the racial animus it exposed over how young blacks are treated in the criminal justice system. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that all of the right people have learned all of the right lessons from that case. Now, as the days drag on in Ferguson, Missouri, it seems that some involved, particularly in the law enforcement hierarchy, are not handling the Michael Brown case better than the Zimmerman case. In fact, this time it's being handled worse. Some observations on Ferguson: . The social media response has been amazing. An event these days -- whether it be the Michael Brown shooting, the Donald Sterling uproar, the questionable death of Kendrick Johnson in Georgia -- gains a life online via social media, keeping it in the forefront of our national conversation. Though there are down sides, one of social media's strong positives is that it allows for an open, quick and national discourse. With the crackdown on the press in Ferguson this week, it was citizens with cell phones who provided pictures and helped set the editorial agenda. The Ferguson Police Department has fallen far short of expectations. While we still don't know -- and likely won't for a while -- what exactly happened and why the officer fired those fatal shots, the way the Ferguson police department reacted was poor and made matters worse, not better. A sensitive response -- informed by an awareness that this shooting would lead to a powerful, communitywide reactionâ€”would have acknowledged the trauma inflicted on the entire black community. While I still maintain that the integrity of the investigation is paramount (if charges are being considered, we must make sure that the witnesses were not tainted by leaked information or coached in their answers to the perceived events), the police mishandled the situation in important ways, and in ways that undermined or destroyed the black community's faith that this would be handled properly. Critics rip police tactics, use of military equipment . The name of the officer who shot Michael was finally released Friday. He is Officer Darren Wilson, a six-year veteran of the department. It was time to do this. At least now that point of frustration has ended. But the decision also to release the videotape of the previous robbery event in which Michael Brown was suspected was a further insult to the sensitivities that exist in this now cultural event. If it had to be done, it should have been well separated. We shouldn't forget that the law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation, from the Justice Department and the FBI to the St. Louis County Sherriff, had already had the officer's name, his background, his disciplinary record, his medical records--and are still gathering the other information necessary to begin drilling into who he was before this shooting and what happened to him during it. The coordinated interaction between these agencies is a good definition of transparency, not piecemeal distribution of snippets of information. The police chief's decision to come out with a statement early in the investigation defending his officer was a poor decision, as it polarized an already tense environment and was insensitive to Ferguson's African-American community. Missouri state troopers take over security in Ferguson . How the police reacted to the civil unrest is a mixed bag. While law enforcement agencies have both the right and the obligation to maintain civil order and peace, they must do so in a way that is sensitive to the issues that are being addressed in protests. I do not have a concern with an appropriate police presence, and I believe police should act to stop destruction of property or the use of the protest for personal gain or profit, such as looting stores. That said, nothing justifies use of an aggressive police presence without proper cause. There was no basis for a military-style response, even though the law enforcement could justify it by looking at their textbooks. This did not warrant a textbook response. This warranted -- demanded -- a response that carried the respect appropriate in such difficult times. We also now know that a lesser response, as has happened since estate police took over, worked to lessen tensions. 5 things to know about the Michael Brown shooting . At the very least, I sincerely hope that the police agencies involved maintained their own video log of events witnessed and reacted to by law enforcement. If those actions were necessary in response to threats or inappropriate actions from protesters, I would give the department deference. But they are going to have to justify tear gas and rubber bullets, and that will be tough to do in a situation as socially charged as this one. There will be and should be, a review of police activities in response to the shooting; not to place blame, but as a learning tool. We were dangerously close to a meltdown in Ferguson. We now look back at how Seminole County, Florida, handled the Zimmerman matter and must acknowledge they did a better job than Ferguson. The protesters, setting aside for a moment the looters and hooligans, have acted in a very appropriate and responsible way. Our country was built upon the concept of seeking appropriate redress of actions by our government. It is not only allowed and appropriate, but it is ingrained in our national fabric and the nation would be weaker without it. The people who take advantage of a situation that allows them to loot and steal -- which they continued doing early Saturday -- should face significant consequences. Not only have they committed individual crimes by their actions, but they have desecrated the very purpose of the respectful protesters and in doing so damaged the national perspective of the protest itself. Their actions distract attention from the important, underlying reasons for the protest and threaten to turn the process into a dangerous, counterproductive battle between themselves and the police presence. Looting, tensions dash tenuous peace in Ferguson's streets . The response Friday night and early Saturday by law enforcement was restrained; they deserve credit. Even more so, the protesters who tried to block the looters stand as testament to the true purpose of their involvement: peaceful pleas for change. The governor of Missouri should have taken stronger action and done so much sooner. While he may have hoped that this incident could be addressed properly at the local level, Gov. Jay Dixon should have realized that wasn't going to happen by the end of the first 24-hour period. At that point, having an elected official unconnected with the police department involved would have given the proper appearance of impartiality and would have put the strength of the entire state behind this event. I'm very glad that Dixon finally became involved in the process, and I believe his presentation to the church affirming the state's commitment was necessary. His promise to handle this matter to the end, in a transparent way, and to seek justice wherever that may lead, was the right position for the governor to take. (P.S.--Don't try to make jokes about how you look on camera when you're dealing with a national tragedy.) President Barack Obama should have a voice in the public reaction to this event, but he needs to be circumspect in his presentation. I have, in the past, expressed my chagrin that Obama injected himself into the Zimmerman matter -- not because he involved himself with a national tragedy, but because he took a side in a pending case where he should be very reluctant to do so. I appreciate his more inclusive and tempered response to this troubling shooting. Opinion: Obama, can't you see black anger in Ferguson? Traditional media have handled this case well. Across the board, media outlets have presented a number of well-balanced reviews of the relevant issues. The traditional media learned a good deal from the Zimmerman case: Reporting on the Michael Brown shooting has been much better founded in both the rules of evidence, the rules of the court and the statutes that deal with such issues as self-defense, ""imminent fear of great bodily injury,"" and police procedures. The media have learned to understand the subject and the applicable statutes before commenting on the case. Full coverage on Ferguson shooting and protests . There has also been a greater level of fairness in reporting, and also a necessary acknowledgment that precious few facts are available yet. The media have asked the right questions, but have hesitated to fuel speculation. And that is the essence of responsible reporting.","Mark O'Mara: Response in Brown killing shows we didn't learn enough in Trayvon Martin case .

"(CNN) -- Love was in the air on Sunday for Dottie Coven and Keith Stewart. Business travelers and frequent fliers on Southwest Airlines, the couple from Corydon, Indiana, decided there was no place they'd rather marry than while flying. And why not land at the airport known for love -- Dallas Love Field -- after the happy occasion? That's why they approached Southwest with their idea of being married in the air. The airline was game. After all, it's famous for its fun, including flight attendants who entertain, wedding proposals and even rewarding flight attendants who are especially good to customers (After a customer praised one flight attendant on Twitter midflight, the airline publicly honored her with a giant cookie). But this was the Southwest's first wedding where the airline joined the wedding planning team from departure gate to arrival gate. (Follow the fun using Southwest's hashtag #nonstoplove.) With a band playing and balloons decorating the jetway, the happy couple and about 30 friends and family boarded Southwest Flight 4058 in Nashville for the ceremony. About 100 unsuspecting fellow passengers received an extra boarding pass inviting them to celebrate. A flower girl walking down the aisle handed out peanuts to start the ceremony, followed by an officiant using the loudspeaker to perform the marriage of Coven and Stewart. There were modifications for the unique location: ""If anyone can show just cause why they might not be lawfully joined together, let them push their flight attendant call button now or forever hold your peace."" The airline had a reason for highlighting this particular route: The wedding took place on Southwest's first nonstop flight from Nashville to Dallas Love Field. The airline had been prevented from offering that particular route under the Wright Amendment, which Congress passed in 1979 to allow only flights from Love Field to neighboring states (with a few exceptions). Congress repealed the law in 2006, and it expired in October. The Stewarts were heading to their honeymoon in Puerto Rico on Monday morning, a gift of the airline. Puerto Rico is another relatively new destination for Southwest Airlines, which moved into the international market after its 2010 purchase of AirTran (and its international routes).

"(CNN) -- Famed film director Roman Polanski, wanted in the United States for having sex with a minor in the 1970s, was questioned this week by Polish authorities but allowed to leave after the interview. A spokesman for the Polish Prosecutor General's office said Thursday that authorities there didn't believe it was necessary to hold him in custody while the United States seeks to extradite him. Mateusz Martyniuk told CNN that Poland received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, and the Oscar winning filmmaker came Wednesday to the office in Krakow. ""(The matter) was not sent to the court that could impose a temporary arrest because the prosecution did not find basis for that,"" Jan Olszewski, one of Polanski's attorneys, told CNN affiliate TVN24, according to the network's translation. Polanski, who was in Krakow on Thursday, said he wants to film a movie in Poland, his parents' homeland, next spring. The director has both French and Polish citizenship. He told TVN24 he hoped the extradition question had been settled ""once and for all."" Polanski pleaded guilty in 1977 in California to having unlawful sex with Samantha Geimer, who was 13. The director of ""The Pianist"" was 43 at the time. He fled to Europe before he was sentenced. Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in 2009 on a U.S. fugitive warrant. The Swiss rejected the American extradition request in 2010 because the United States did not supply all the legal records Switzerland requested and because Polanski had a reasonable right to think he would not be arrested if he visited the country, Justice Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said at the time. Geimer publicly forgave Polanski in 1997 and has called for the case to be dismissed. Besides the Oscar win for ""The Pianist,"" Polanski also received Academy Award nominations for ""Tess"" and ""Chinatown.""","Roman Polanski fled the United States after pleading guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old .

"Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (CNN) -- A judge needs to decide if new lawyers are needed to defend Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other prisoners charged in the September 11 terrorist attacks or if more hearings should be conducted on whether there's any conflict of interest caused by an FBI investigation. A U.S. Justice Department lawyer acknowledged Monday that the FBI investigated members of the team representing Mohammed and the other Guantanamo Bay detainees accused of the September 11 attacks, prompting the lead defense lawyer to threaten to pull out of the case out of fears that he too is a subject of a federal probe. ""I do have a reasonable fear. I am trimming my sails. I am pulling my punches. I am being extremely careful about how I proceed,"" David Nevel told the military commission hearing the case, adding that he canceled a trip to the Middle East to do investigative work. Defense attorneys argued that the FBI essentially infiltrated and spied on them by asking members of the team if the lawyers were engaged in suspicious activity. The lawyers said in court that two civilian investigators, a classification expert and Mohammed's linguist were approached by the FBI. The FBI investigation centered on the release of classified information to unknown third parties that are not part of the case. Fernando Campanor-Sanchez, an assistant United States attorney, said the investigations are now closed and that none of the lawyers or anyone else on team are currently under investigation. The four that were under investigation no longer work for the defense team.

"(CNN) -- On the one hand, there's the need to respect and protect people's constitutional right to congregate and express their opinions. On the other, there's the need to make sure all people and all property are safe and secure. But, if and when these responsibilities' conflict, where do you draw the line? That's a question authorities in Ferguson, Missouri, are having to answer this weekend. In fact, they've had to answer it every day and night since 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer. The shooting stirred anger, indignation and emotional, expansive, racially-charged protests. At times, these protests have been followed by looting -- as happened overnight Friday -- and confrontations with police. ""If there was an easy way to separate those who hurt from those who helped, we would. But it's hard,"" Gov. Jay Nixon said. ""And sometimes, especially at night, we can't."" Acknowledging ""the balance is important"" between maintaining security and protecting the First Amendment right to free speech and peaceable assembly, Nixon on Saturday decided that -- for five hours daily, at least -- security will take precedence. He's instituted a curfew for Ferguson to last between midnight and 5 a.m. Governor imposes curfew in Ferguson . ""This is not to silence the people of Ferguson or this region or others, but to contain those who are drowning out the voice of the people with their actions,"" Nixon said. ""We will not allow a handful of looters to endanger the rest of this community."" His decision stirred instant indignation among many gathered at the community meeting where he announced it. Some screamed out that authorities' priority should be to provide justice to Brown's family, not to clamp down on those calling for it. Carissa McGraw is one of those protesters who don't think the curfew makes sense, accusing authorities of being focused more on intimidating people than addressing their core concerns and calls for justice. The order might further fuel residents' animosity by giving the implication that police don't trust them to be on the streets. Beyond that, McGraw simply thinks having a curfew won't work -- and, in fact, might make things worse for community-police relations if it leads to confrontations. ""They're not going to do this,"" McGraw said of people abiding by the curfew. ""You have people who -- at this point -- do not care what authorities say right now."" Rebuilding trust seen as key . The shooting of Brown spurred animosity among Ferguson residents toward their police force. The fact that Brown was black while the man who shot him, officer Darren Wilson, is white added fuel to the tension. The police response in the days afterward didn't help, with some criticizing it as too militarized and heavy-handed. Nor did Ferguson police Chief Thomas Jackson's decision to release video and documents calling Brown the ""primary suspect"" in the robbery of a box of cigars from a convenience store, only to add hours later that this robbery wasn't related to why Wilson confronted the teenager. Multiple officials -- from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who has been overseeing the security in Ferguson since Thursday -- have spoken about the need to rebuild trust in the community for law enforcement. But as community members' shouting down of Johnson and the governor at a meeting Saturday illustrated, it hasn't happened yet. Far from it. The situation did appear to calm significantly Thursday, when Johnson literally and figuratively embraced the protesters rather than confront them. Then came Friday night and early Saturday morning, violence that McGraw said she believes was ""instigated by the police officers themselves (who) were in their militant stance against the people. ""At that point, the people were like, 'Wow, we're supposed to have our freedom. We're supposed to be able to do this. And you're still being very aggressive.' "" Ex-FBI official: 'No choice' but to have curfew . There are also those who think police weren't aggressive enough as men looted stores around Ferguson overnight Friday. While some activists criticized authorities for using armored vehicles and tear gas in one instance, on the other side store owners ripped police for not stepping in and arresting those responsible. Not being as aggressive could invite more criminal acts in Ferguson, claims Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director and CNN law enforcement analyst. ""If I was a police officer on the street once again in that situation, I'd be scared that the message went out to all the hooligans in the greater St. Louis area, if you need a new TV set or you need something, come to town because we're not going to stop you when you start looting stores,"" Fuentes said. ""That's a horrible message to send."" In Fuentes' opinion, authorities had ""no choice"" but to institute and enforce a curfew. A full week in, the situation has not gotten much better -- as the unrest overnight Friday shows. As Cincinnati Police Chief Jeffrey Blackwell said, ""There is no excuse for looting to be going on six days later in a community in the United States."" If people go after more stores, what are police supposed to do? If they throw rocks or Molotov cocktails at police, what's wrong with having them wear riot gear and armored equipment? And, the bottom line, how long can this go on before authorities step in and clear the streets? If the protesters aim to get their message out and, in so doing, get justice for Michael Brown, then ""we must first have and maintain peace,"" Nixon said. And having a curfew should help in that regard, he argued. ""The eyes of the world are watching,"" the governor added. ""This is a test of (whether) a community -- this community, any community -- can break the cycle of fear, distrust and violence and replace them with peace, strength and ultimately justice."" Cincinnati chief: Some residents must 'stand up' Will Ferguson pass that test? Will residents and the police come to see other as being part of the same solution, rather than seeing each other as the problem? A big part on how that relationship turns out might depend on what happens with officer Wilson, including whether he's charged and/or convicted in Brown's shooting. But beyond that, the most important thing all parties must do is talk, Blackwell said. Really talk. ""Their needs to be words of healing,"" the Cincinnati police chief said of what police and other officials must express. ""There needs to be a strategic dialogue that is aimed at resolution and reconciliation."" It's not all on police, though. The people of Ferguson -- especially the leaders among them -- also have a responsibility to speak up, act out and take care of their community, according to Blackwell. That means working with police as partners, not as adversaries, for the common good. ""There needs to be some people that stand up,"" Blackwell told CNN. ""... The people in Ferguson that stand for justice and stand for peace need to be in the trenches with law enforcement, right now."" What's next as authorities probe Ferguson shooting?","Ferguson, Missouri, has seen large protests, some violence .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge has lifted a temporary ban on painful forced feedings of a Guantanamo Bay detainee, saying she had no choice and ""the court simply cannot let (him) die."" In the meantime, the court will advance a ""speedy exchange"" of information about terrorism detainee Mohammed Abu Wa'el Dhiab's request to stop what he describes as abusive forced feedings, U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler ruled late Thursday. Dhiab, 42, a Syrian, was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 and has been detained in the U.S. military's facility for terrorism suspects at Guantanamo for more than 10 years, according to the London-based human rights group Reprieve. Dhiab has stopped eating, and his case is example of the forced feedings at Guantanamo, which the U.S. government has been administering typically to detainees who go on hunger strikes. Dhiab was cleared for release by the Obama administration in 2009 and has never been charged, Reprieve's website said. Kessler said the court ""is now faced with an anguishing Hobson's choice: reissue another temporary restraining order despite the very real probability that Mr. Dhiab will die, because he has indicated a continuing desire to refuse to eat and/or drink liquids, or refuse to issue the TRO and allow the medical personnel on the scene to take the medical actions to keep Mr. Dhiab alive, but at the possible cost of great pain and suffering."" ""The Court is in no position to make the complex medical decisions necessary to keep Mr. Dhiab alive,"" the judge said. ""Thanks to the intransigence of the Department of Defense, Mr. Dhiab may well suffer unnecessary pain from certain enteral feeding practices and forcible cell extractions. However, the Court simply cannot let Mr. Dhiab die."" The judge noted that Mr. Dhiab's physical condition has been ""swiftly deteriorating, in large part because he was refusing food and/or water.""","A federal judge says she has no choice in allowing forced feeding to resume .
'The court simply cannot let (the detainee) die,' the judge writes .

"(CNN) -- Amid the firestorm over the decision to release five Guantanamo Bay detainees in exchange for captured American soldier Bowe Bergdahl, the Obama administration is continuing its efforts to close the controversial prison in Cuba. Recent efforts to do so are focusing on the establishment of a Periodic Review Board to intermittently decide whether detainees not currently facing charges can be transferred to their home country or to a third-party country willing to take them. According to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on Thursday, the board ensures that detainees are ""regularly getting a fresh look,"" and getting the chance to have someone hear their case. U.S. law currently does not allow Guantanamo detainees to be moved to the United States, a provision that has impeded the administration's efforts to close the prison, since detainees cannot be tried in civilian courts or moved to American prisons. The Periodic Review Board was created by Executive Order in March of 2011, and was launched in October of last year. So far, the board has conducted seven reviews, and three detainees have been approved by it for transfer. The board is made up of representatives from the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, and State, as well as the Joint Staff and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. They review detainees' histories to determine whether they are likely to represent a continued threat to the United States. But the decision to approve a detainee for transfer does not lead to their immediate release. In fact, of the 149 detainees at the prison, 78 have already been approved for transfer but are still awaiting repatriation. Most have been in this limbo for more than four years. That's because the United States must first work out a deal with a foreign country willing to take them, and the deal must satisfy certain security and humane treatment obligations, according to the official. Once a deal has been reached, justification for the release must be submitted to members of congress for a mandatory 30-day review period. The Obama administration decided to bypass this stage of the process in the Bergdahl case, which has led critics to accuse the administration of violating the law. The administration insists it had an obligation to do so because intelligence suggested the Bergdahl was in ill health, and might not survive the 30 days. Moreover, a Senate aide took that further, telling CNN on condition of not being identified that senators were told by the administration that the United States had credible information that leaked word of the deal ahead of time would result in Bergdahl being killed. Even with approval from government officials and the support of Congress, it can be difficult for the U.S. to find foreign governments willing to take the detainees or able to provide the appropriate assurances. The Obama administration also has a blanket ban on the transfer of all detainees to Yemen. And critics have levied a wave of concerns over recidivism. A September 2013 report from the Director of National Intelligence found that 16.6% of the approximately 600 released detainees were confirmed to have returned to the battlefield, and another 12.3% were suspected of having done so. Still, the administration says it is determined to reduce the Guantanamo Bay prison population, and points to data showing recidivism rates have been on the decline under Obama. ""We are very pleased with the progress we have been making,"" the senior administration official said, adding that the government was appreciative of efforts by foreign governments to accommodate detainees. The official also cited cost as a big motivator, saying, ""It simply does not make sense at this point in our history to be spending this type of money"" on the prison. Citing efforts by the Bush administration to reduce the detainee population, the official suggested there is room for bipartisan cooperation on transfers. More than 500 detainees were released under former President George W. Bush. According to the official, 71 of the Guantanamo's remaining detainees have not been approved for transfer. Of those, 10 are facing trial in front of the military commission system and are therefore ineligible to face the Periodic Review Board. Twenty-three have been referred for prosecution and the remaining 38 remain under detention with no decision made on their status. The prison was opened in January of 2002 and has housed over 750 detainees since.","U.S. captive Bowe Bergdahl was exchanged for Taliban detainees at Guantanamo Bay .

"(CNN) -- As we learned in past battles with polio and AIDS, the key to solving a massive health crisis is to move public sentiment away from fear and stigmatization toward action and acceptance. That is why a recent ad campaign about Ebola from Medicins Du Monde -- MDM or Doctors of the World -- is so encouraging . An international humanitarian and medical organization with a long history of advocating for vulnerable populations, MDM joined in the United States with ad agency Publicis Kaplan Thaler to turn public fear of Ebola on its head by asking people to donate a hazmat suit to workers in Africa. The symbol of the fearful hazmat suit is reintroduced as a crucial piece of the solution: ""Here it's a costume. There it saves lives."" With a message of hope that asks us to get beyond our irrational fears of exposure to Ebola here in the United States, MDM focuses on our enormous power as individuals to participate in solving the global crisis that is unfolding. Perhaps more important is this suggestion in the ad from MDM: Medical workers are also at risk of becoming vulnerable, to stigmatization and marginalization, as a result of their direct contact with Ebola at its source. This threat to their status comes at a time when we most urgently need doctors and caretakers on the ground in Africa. Miranda Sissons, executive director of Doctors of the World USA, told me, ""Ebola may be the largest humanitarian crisis of the century,"" adding that the current challenge ""is driving the system beyond its capability."" History shows us that the world's response at the moment when effectiveness could be at its highest can in fact be slowed if public perceptions and government actions penalize or stigmatize doctors, health workers and caretakers working on the front line of a crisis. AIDS, for example, still stands as one of the most politicized, feared and controversial diseases in modern history and its spread in the early 1980s is partially attributed to the marginalization of its victims and caretakers by the press, government and traditional health care institutions. The media defined AIDS originally, as a ""gay man's"" illness, and then a disease of ""The Four H Club"": homosexuals, heroin addicts, hemophiliacs and Haitians. Each group was, for different reasons, already on the outside of mainstream U.S. social norms -- feared and often ignored by many Americans -- and AIDS pushed them further outside the circle of public empathy and institutional help. Early attempts by advocacy groups to turn around negative public perception failed because there was little objective information about what caused the disease, and so fear and ignorance prevailed in the public consciousness. Health care workers stayed away from treating AIDS patients, leaving communities on their own to deal with the growing crisis. Local groups, like New York City's Gay Men's Health Crisis, were virtually the only place for dying victims to turn to for help in the early 1980s. To make matters worse, the U.S. government did not jump in to guide the public narrative on AIDS, and the vacuum was filled with inaction, for the most part, on treatment and cures. It was clear by the end of 1981 that AIDS was a national threat, but President Reagan didn't publicly mention the disease until late 1985, by which time acknowledging the epidemic was unavoidable: AIDS had become the leading cause of death among all Americans age 25 to 44. In the era of polio, starting in the United States in the early 20th century through the 1950s, a similar pattern of stigmatization and lack of leadership emerged. The healthy pushed away the diseased in fear, locking away the afflicted in attics, hiding them in institutions and exiling them to the sidelines of life, long after they had passed the contagious stage. Forty years passed with no overarching government strategy to find a cure or ensure victims' basic rights, until Jonas Salk accidentally discovered the polio vaccine and victims' advocacy groups took up the charge by starting the disability rights movement. Franklin D. Roosevelt, who contracted polio in 1921 at age 39, was paralyzed from the waist down and used a wheelchair. FDR understood the power of the public's fear of polio to stigmatize him in the minds of voters. Like the hazmat suit that symbolizes Ebola and elicits fear today, FDR's wheelchair would have been a powerful symbol of polio in the American mind in the 1930s if he had let people see it: FDR scrupulously hid it from public view to avoid any association with the disease. There are only three known photographs of FDR sitting in a wheelchair. Only in recent years has FDR been viewed by many as a hero for how he doggedly overcame the stigma of the disease in the face of widespread public discrimination against polio victims. It is possible we can chart a better course in the future on Ebola by learning from the mistakes of the past in our response to AIDS and polio. First, there needs to be a U.S. government-led public health strategy to deal with the Ebola crisis here, and across the ocean at its source. No other country, or single international organization, has the credibility to lead on this issue. The White House, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other key government agencies, is crucial to establishing the policies, action agenda and outlining the priorities to beat this disease, and to focus and coordinate all the international players who need to be involved. Second, everyone involved in the public dialogue needs to come together to address and manage the ongoing fears of an epidemic in the United States. While experts may believe they're relieving our fears when they tell us we're safe, it is difficult to feel safe with the frequent reports of another individual suspected of being infected on our shores. In reality, an Ebola epidemic is not a threat to Americans at home: The U.S. health system is the best prepared on the planet to treat and cure Ebola patients. But ongoing fear distracts us from focusing on the urgency of treating Ebola at the source in Africa. Third, stigmatization slowed the cures for polio and AIDS and, without any legitimate reason, marginalized people for being victims of a disease they had no control over. Key to the conversation at this moment is that our response to the Ebola crisis can be dangerously slowed if we repeat those mistakes of stigmatization. We are at risk of rejecting the wrong people in this war -- not only the victims, but the doctors and health workers who are courageously caring and fighting the scourge. If we allow the very workers we need on the ground in Africa to be stigmatized when they come home, this will take longer to solve. This is exactly the moment when health workers need to be encouraged to be on the front line, and recognized as heroes for doing so when they return. Finally, Ebola needs an official face, a spokesperson high up in the U.S. government who is the credible, expert public voice of the disease both here and abroad. The White House seems to have missed the opportunity to connect the power of its pulpit with an official posture that can help stem fear and stigmatization, and bring a coherent message to the effort. They see Ebola as an administrative challenge and appointed Ron Klain as Ebola czar, because ""the job is regarded as a managerial challenge"" and Klain is seen ""at the White House as a good manager with excellent relationships"". Leading the Ebola conversation is not an administrative task; it's an important way to connect government policy to people's concerns and emotions, to move opinion away from fear toward information and hope. Which is why the ad campaign for Doctors of the World is meaningful: a credible voice that starts to fill the vacuum and pushes us to shift our perceptions of Ebola toward hope and life.","Martha Pease: We need to avoid stigmatizing Ebola as we did AIDS, polio .

"Dubai, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- During London Mayor Boris Johnson's recent visit to Dubai on an investment promotion trip, he jokingly declared that he is ""mayor of the eighth emirate."" Though uttered in typical self-deprecating jest, the mayor of the world's greatest city proclaiming that London is a mere province of the United Arab Emirates is revealing about how Dubai's fortunes have revived since the punishing real estate crash and debt restructuring following the financial crisis. With the UK economy slumping so severely that the IMF has recommended it reconsider its austerity policy, Johnson has to look abroad to maintain London's economic dynamism. He particularly appealed to the UAE's sovereign wealth funds (such as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Mubadala) to invest in London's underground subway upgrades (not that Emiratis are regulars on the Tube, since they often ship their supercharged Italian sports cars to London for the summer months). Thirty years ago, when I was a child growing up in the UAE, Dubai's highlights were a cheap revolving restaurant in the creek district of Deira and the modest gold souk of nearby Sharjah. But a revolutionary transformation was also just under way under the visionary leadership of Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed al Maktoum, and subsequently carried forward by his third son Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, who currently rules Dubai while also serving as prime minister and vice president of the UAE. More from Parag Khanna: Is Brazil ready to take sporting center stage? Decades of heavy infrastructure investment built what is today one of the world's busiest ports at Jebel Ali, and the world's most transited airport. At any hour of the day, Dubai's Terminal 3 is the single most cosmopolitan building in the world, with every conceivable nationality transiting, visiting, or settling. The Dubai Mall, located at the base of the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, was visited 65 million times in 2012, more than any other monument in the world. The increasingly populous and built-up corridor connecting Abu Dhabi and Dubai have inspired many to refer to this core axis as ""Abu Dubai,"" the unofficial capital of the entire Middle East. In time, all seven emirates -- and all the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries -- will be linked by a coastal high-speed rail network. Led by the largest economy of Saudi Arabia, the GCC collectively deserves a place in any conversation about the ""BRICS."" Huge real estate projects, central geography, and reconciliation with its fraternal capital Abu Dhabi made Dubai resilient to the crisis in ways almost every global analyst missed. Those who erroneously wrote gloating ""Dubai is finished"" headlines are derisively referred to here as ""the haters."" Ironically, they come from the same places -- Europe and America -- that now send officials and out-of-work executives desperately seeking investment and jobs in the UAE. Would you rather be in Athens right now? In his penetrating new book ""The History of Future Cities,"" author Daniel Brook matter-of-factly declares Dubai as the center of the world. But he also sketches a portrait of a place that is not just a city, but an idea, and a dream. In one generation, Dubai has graduated from a village that people just fly over, to an instant city in the desert, to a destination for migrant workers and expatriates, to a world financial center and demographic microcosm of the planet. Just a couple of years after its economic crisis it feels like the center of the world again. In the traditional but affluent beachfront district of Jumeirah, the aesthetic matches the geography of being halfway between Europe and India: patisseries next to sari shops. An even further concentric circle of cultures is represented: Burger King and Chinese massage parlors. More from Khanna: Evolution, not revolution, in Myanmar . Geography plays a major role in Dubai's rebound. The UAE's largest trading partners are China and India. Indians are the second largest investors in the all-important property market (behind Emiratis); they flock here as the most convenient meeting point for far-flung diaspora families. Like anyone else, they also enjoy functioning infrastructure; hence the saying that Dubai is India's best-run city. (If only Dubai were still administered by the British Raj, when its currency was the rupee.) Dubai has also become a crucial outpost for China, with more than 2,000 Chinese companies registered in the UAE. While many have visited the sprawling Dragon Mart complex where low-cost Chinese goods are sold wholesale, an estimated 180,000 Chinese people reside in the country, including senior figures for state-run banks who negotiate joint investment opportunities in Africa with Western companies. The Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC) is their neutral meeting ground, offering a one-stop shop for legal, financial, accounting and other services. The UAE also wisely plays a neutral game of multi-alignment with the superpowers: major arms deals with the U.S., massive energy exports to China, and billions in investment from Europe. Whether or not China is able to avoid the ""Malacca trap"" by building pipeline and railways across Central Asia to the Middle East, it will still need Dubai as its hub for its growing reach into the Middle East and Africa. Last week's third consecutive government-sponsored Annual Investment Meeting (AIM) in Dubai featured businessmen and officials from 114 emerging markets, showing how the city is the most convenient meeting point for the globe-spanning webs of commerce forming across Latin America, Africa, and Asia. With its location at the intersection of three continents, Dubai captures not only the shift in economic power from West to East, but also the rise of the South. Forty percent of the world's population lives on the Indian Ocean rim, and Dubai is the financial crossroads for their growing trade and financial relationships. Dubai is increasingly the hub for companies investing across Africa, and home to domestic powerhouses like Dubai Ports World, which is operating ports from Djibouti to Senegal, and Emirates Airlines, the only airline capable of flying non-stop from Dubai to every major city in the world. When you fly on Emirates Airlines, the pilots need several full breaths to list the languages spoken by the staff, usually including English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Afrikaans, Bulgarian and half-dozen others. In his forthcoming book Start-up Rising, veteran tech entrepreneur Chris Schroeder points out that Dubai is effectively the commercial capital for companies looking to gain access to about 300 million Arab consumers. According to Standard Chartered Bank, the UAE itself has the highest rate of mobile penetration in the world, with 176 phones per 100 people. Smart phone penetration is expected to grow to 50% in Egypt in the next five years. Schroeder argues that Western VCs need to be greater risk takers, the way UAE-based ones already are. Abraaj, the largest private equity fund in the Middle East, has investments in 43 countries from Peru to Pakistan. Only at conferences in Dubai does one find billboards advertising Pakistan as ""vibrant,"" and find investors talking about the ""huge opportunities"" there. Perhaps the greatest geopolitical risk to the region is also what will become the UAE's next big opportunity: Iran. It is unlikely that Iran will spend the rest of the decade as an isolated pariah. Whether by war or diplomacy, with or without nuclear weapons, the giant Persian nation in the region's heart will be open for business. The smuggling business that has thrived for decades between Dubai and Iran will graduate to Dubai becoming the full-blown staging point for all parties involved in Iran's economic rehabilitation. With such strong, unchallenged and popular leadership, the UAE has wound up a beneficiary of the Arab Spring. Free of the troubles of Egypt, Syria, and other Arab states, ""Dubai is where you come to forget you're in the Middle East,"" according to one commentator. Just as it benefited in the 1970s and '80s from Lebanon's descent into civil war, the UAE is now absorbing an estimated 15,000 Arabs a month from Iraq and Syria, but also Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The best and the brightest -- and wealthiest -- are hedging their bets, fed-up with civil war or democracy. While the country is relatively open, tolerant and progressive, its freedoms come at a price. Human Rights Watch has recently reported on crackdowns of free speech, closure of Western NGO affiliates, intimidation and imprisonment of dissidents, continued human trafficking, and poor protection of foreign worker rights. And as in countries in West and East, security cameras are now ubiquitous, reminding of the underlying securitization that enables the peaceful daily order. Even as these issues receive growing scrutiny, Dubai is undeniably the deserving favorite to host the World Expo 2020 (the winner will be announced in November). The UAE biggest long-term challenge is demographic. The UAE and Qatar are unique in the world as nations whose indigenous populations are all but disappearing relative to the influx of foreigners. The country's population has tripled in just the past decade to over ten million people, yet Emiratis make up less than 10% of the entire population. The prominent academic Abdulkhaleq Abdulla is a provocative and thoughtful embodiment of the dilemma the UAE's success has brought about: on the one hand, he praises his country's spectacular modernization, but he has also sounded the alarm that Emirati identity is being extinguished, his tribe becoming extinct. At the same time, though Dubai has by far the highest foreign-born population rate in the world, it is not quite the melting pot New York is. To achieve that level of permanent, inter-ethnic integration, the UAE will have to transform itself from post-modern feudalism to an innovative stakeholdership model in which foreigners are accorded long-term residency rights, and both citizens and foreigners have meaningful rights as well as responsibilities. If it does so, it can be a role model for dozens of other cities that are becoming multi-ethnic global hubs. That is exactly what the world expects from the city at its center. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Parag Khanna.","Dubai's fortunes have revived since real estate crash and debt restructuring .

"(CNN) -- Nearly three years after the Costa Concordia cruise ship ran aground off Italy's Giglio Island, the remains of the final victim have been recovered. The remains of Russel Rebello were found in a cabin in the wrecked ship, which is currently in Genoa, where it was moved to be scrapped, Italy's state-run ANSA news agency said Monday. Thirty-two lives were lost in the January 2012 incident, when the ship ran aground with more than 4,200 passengers aboard. The remains of all the dead had been found except for Rebello's. Rebello's brother, Kevin Rebello, confirmed the news on Facebook. ""I promised my family that I will bring back home my brother some day,"" Kevin Robello wrote, noting that 1,025 days had passed since the disaster. Russel Rebello's body was found on Deck 8 in a cabin, his brother wrote. ""I don't have words to express,"" Kevin Robello said. ""Just my pain, my tears, my heart pounding harder and my body trembling."" The wrecked Costa Concordia became part of the landscape near Giglio Island for years, until it was refloated in July of this year and eased into a dry dock in Genoa for salvage. The lengthy process of dismantling the wrecked ship is expected to take two years. More than 80% of the Concordia will be recycled or reused, including copper wiring, plumbing pipes, kitchens and some of the plastic room fittings that can be repaired. The remaining 50,000 tons of steel will be melted down and sold at the market price to be used to make construction girders, cars and even other ships.

"(CNN) -- An autopsy report has revealed that Michael Brown was shot six times. It's among the few bits of concrete information released to the public, another being the name of the officer, Darren Wilson, who shot dead an unarmed and (by some accounts) surrendering Brown on August 9 on the street in Ferguson, Missouri. Police have argued that their silence has been to protect Wilson from retaliatory acts of violence. After all, as possible 2016 presidential candidate Ben Carson argued on Bill O'Reilly's Fox show, ""Police are individuals, too. They have feelings also."" They do, but Brown died without due process and is lifeless in a Ferguson morgue. Even if Brown were guilty of stealing Swisher Sweets cigars a short time before his encounter with Wilson, as some have alleged, there is no death penalty in the United States for such an offense. But a young black man is dead. We don't know all the details of what happened on that street in Ferguson. But for black men in America, the incident carries familiar, troubling echoes. Black men occupy and distress the psyches of many white Americans, the way Tom Robinson in Harper Lee's ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" unsettled the white folks of Maycomb, Alabama. Justice, for black men, often seems whatever officers deem it to be. We remain, as the writer and activist Pauli Murray put it, ""the pervasive irritant, the chronic allergy, the vague apprehension which (makes) one uncomfortable and jumpy."" Even as we serve as the cornerstone of American ""cool,"" we continue to be seen by many as aberrant, inferior, threatening, hyper-sexed, and Ã¼ber-violent guests in this experiment in democracy -- still only ""in"" America and not ""of"" America, as the great W.E.B. Du Bois wrote more than a century ago . Regardless of what he may or may not have done, Michael Brown's very presence on that Ferguson street would be seen by too many white men as threatening. In what has become a customary occurrence in America, Brown's fate was sealed by being and breathing as a nonwhite man at the wrong place and at the wrong time. According to a recent FBI report, white police officers in America killed a black person, 18% of whom were under 21, nearly twice a week between 2005 and 2012 -- more than twice the rate of such killings of white youth of the same age. The criminalization, incarceration and slaying of black people, in this so-called post-racial America, remain endemic. Magazine: The aftermath in Ferguson . Unfortunately, many law enforcement professionals and police departments, but not all of them, seem to care more about safeguarding themselves and their authority than understanding this dynamic and protecting and serving accordingly. It comes as no surprise then that Ferguson police want to paint a different picture of the circumstances surrounding Brown's death. But as one protester's sign put it, ""Ferguson police need better scriptwriters."" Their release of Wilson's name Friday was viewed by many not as an act of transparency, but of placation -- and instigation: While naming Wilson, police conveniently released surveillance footage of a man, alleged to be Brown, involved in a strong-armed robbery at a local minimart. The indirect message here was that Wilson could not be another cop with a jaundiced view of black males and an itchy trigger finger; he was a dutiful white male compelled to use deadly force in the face of a menace. This new narrative is one we've seen over and over through history old and recent: A black man, like Brown, is depicted in the foulest of ways to paper over institutional missteps and white male anxieties, and to grant absolution for the imperfections of both. As historian and writer Jelani Cobb wrote in The New Yorker, ""The parameters of this story have already spread far beyond what happened between Brown and Wilson that afternoon."" Is this what concerns the police in Ferguson and beyond; that there are many who would tether this tragedy to broader issues of socioeconomic isolation, criminalization of people of color and others on the margins? That Brown's shooting would expose again the entrenched, systematic authoritarianism in a society that is more diverse than it ever has been, but still vulnerable to stereotypes and intolerance? The delicate peace that had been achieved in Ferguson on Thursday and Friday has been erased by looting, a declaration of a state of emergency and curfew by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon. One hopes that more unrest will not follow as more details of Brown's death emerge. ""What happens to a dream deferred?"" asked the great Langston Hughes. ""Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore -- And then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over -- like a syrupy sweet? Maybe it just sags like a heavy load. Or does it explode?""","Matthew C.

"Washington (CNN) -- A lawyer for Benghazi suspect Ahmed Salin Faraj Abu Khatallah entered a plea of not guilty Monday to all charges related to the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic complex in Libya. But the federal judge in Washington delayed the setting of a trial date as prosecutors address concerns about classified material that will be involved in the case. The government's attorney declined to say whether Khatallah will be the only defendant. Khatallah was brought to District Court in a motorcade under heavy security that included a police helicopter circling overhead and U.S. marshals with M4 carbines patrolling the court perimeter. Inside the courthouse, a bomb-sniffing dog explored the courtroom before the hearing began. Khatallah, a slender man with long gray hair and a shaggy gray beard, was led in by a team of four plainclothes security officers, three of whom stood directly behind him during the proceeding. He wore dark green overalls with ""Alexandria Inmate"" stenciled on the back, but he was not restrained by handcuffs or leg chains. An interpreter provided Khatallah with a narrative. Khatallah stood for his lawyer to enter his plea of not guilty but did not speak. During the short hearing, prosecutors said they needed more time to work with a variety of government agencies in obtaining classified materials that defense attorneys can use in the case. A defense attorney told the judge that prosecutors have been slow to produce even a bare minimum of documents that could allow her to make progress. ""We have to start getting the basis on which he's being charged,"" said defense attorney Michelle Peterson, complaining it's been five months since Khatallah was first named. A federal grand jury handed up an 18-count indictment October 14 that replaces a single count initially filed June 26. The indictment alleges he was the ringleader of the attack, leading 20 others to attack the diplomatic complex. Among the charges was murder for the deaths of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and three American security officers. Khatallah remained free for more than a year after the attacks, doing interviews with CNN and other media, prompting criticism of the Obama administration over how long it was taking to arrest the alleged attackers. He was arrested in a military raid in Libya in June and charged in federal court in Washington, D.C., mere yards away from Capitol buildings where he has become the center of political controversy. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper asked prosecutor Michael DiLorenzo to characterize the state of document production required for the defense. He responded by saying there are ""thousands of thousands of pages"" and hundreds of hours of video, both consisting of a mix between classified and unclassified material. DiLorenzo said the government will request a closed hearing to discuss how to handle the classified material already in hand and anticipated from other government agencies. Peterson told the judge it is misleading for prosecutors to list a large quantity that she has received so far, since she believes much of it is less meaningful than it could be. ""They're still redacting names that are publicly available,"" she said, asserting that the defense shouldn't have to spend its time piecing together a puzzle of who said what. Prosecutors did not directly answer the judge's question as to when they will be ready to propose a trial date, and the defense counsel said her team needs more time to review the additional charges recently filed.

"(CNN) -- Lauryn Hill has been performing her song ""Black Rage"" in concert for years, but on Wednesday she released a recording of the song in support of the residents of Ferguson, Missouri, in the wake of the Michael Brown incident. The singer tweeted on Wednesday, ""An old sketch of Black Rage, done in my living room. Strange, the course of things. Peace for MO"" along with a link to the recording on SoundCloud. Sung to the tune of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""My Favorite Things,"" the lyrics include ""Black rage is founded on/Blatant denial/Squeezed economics/Subsistent survival"" and ""When the dogs bite/ When the beatings/ When I'm feeling sad/ I simply remember all these kinds of things and then I don't fear so bad."" Hill is just one of the members of the hip-hop community lending support. Rapper and St. Louis native Nelly, joined protesters as they marched, and artist J. Cole, visited and released the song ""Be Free"" in tribute to Brown. Activist and hip-hop artist Talib Kweli mixed it up with CNN's Don Lemon on Thursday while explaining what he saw during protests. ""As an artist I wanted to put my money where my mouth is,"" Kweli said. ""I'm supported by the community that's been brutalized. I have a son that's Mike Brown's age."" The unrest in Ferguson has even caused a crossover of sorts. ""Sleepy Hollow"" star Orlando Jones took a page from the ALS ""Ice Bucket Challenge"" to issue one of his own. After dumping a bucket of bullets over his head in a YouTube video posted on August 18, the actor spoke out about the slaying of Brown and what has resulted in Ferguson. ""This past week I've watched an American city become something akin to a war zone,"" said Jones, who added that he is a lifetime member of the NRA.

That's my challenge to me and hopefully you will accept this challenge too.""","Hill has performed the song in concert .

"(CNN) -- Try to imagine New York or California dealing with a situation like this: The tap water's only good for toilets, not drinking, washing, cooking or showering; more than a dozen people have been hospitalized for complaints related to water that's been contaminated with a somewhat mysterious chemical; and residents wait in line for bottled water -- or for ice to melt -- in order to have something to drink. That's been life since Thursday in West Virginia's capital city, Charleston, where 300,000 people were left without safe water -- again, except for toilet flushing -- after chemicals contaminated the Elk River. Some of the taps have started coming back on; cleanup and testing are underway, according to the news reports on Monday. But the spill, which has been attributed to a leak in a chemical-storage tank not far upriver from the city's water treatment plant, continues to paralyze Charleston. A Washington Post reporter described living in the city as ""a lot like camping."" A resident was blunter: ""It's like a zombie apocalypse here."" Where's the national outrage? Our collective indifference is troubling. It's like we think: It's OK, the water's safe to flush. Or: Whatever, it's just West Virginia. This would be the story everyone in America's talking about if chemicals used for cleaning coal were spilled into a river in a state with more political clout and media presence. Take New Jersey, where Gov. Chris Christie's administration is accused of jamming up traffic as payback for a rival politician. The public has been ravenous for that story; meanwhile, West Virginia matters just as much. At least it does to real people -- people who value safe drinking water. Sure, I understand why the Christie scandal -- which we're all calling ""Bridgegate"" these days -- matters. He's a national figure who has (or had) a good shot at being the Republican front-runner for the 2016 presidential race. There's an alleged cover-up, a trough of juicy e-mails, calls for a federal investigation, and real people were inconvenienced. I'm not arguing the bridge scandal is insignificant. But it's sad that disasters seem to need brand strategists these days. ""If we called West Virginia 4-methylcyclohexane-methanol leak 'Watergate,' do you think the political press would pay more attention?"" asked Ana Marie Cox, a columnist for The Guardian. The answer, as she implies, is yes. Jason Linkins wrote for the The Huffington Post that none of the major Sunday morning news shows gave much -- if any -- coverage to the chemical spill. ""Sunday shows to West Virginia: Drop Dead!"" his headline blared. They were too obsessed with Christie, which, as he points out, has plenty of time to play out before the presidential elections, two years from now. This stuff goes way beyond the media and its handling of events. Major newspapers and television networks, including CNN, sent reporters to West Virginia to cover the story. Information is out there. It's not that no attention has been paid. But West Virginia is so maligned in our national consciousness that some people probably expect environmental contamination like this to happen there. The country should be in the middle of a national debate about how to ensure chemicals are kept out of our drinking water. It's one of the most basic of government services. Some people in West Virginia are trying to advance that conversation. Take Angela Rosser, executive director of the West Virginia Rivers Coalition. She told The New York Times that, ""We need to look at our entire system and give some serious thought to making some serious reform and valuing our natural resources over industry interests."" She and others also are asking the tough questions: Why was a chemical storage tank allowed to be on a river that's used for drinking water? And why wasn't the tank inspected since 1991? Then there's Ken Ward Jr., from The Charleston Gazette, who reported that the U.S. Chemical Safety Board had recommended three years ago that West Virginia ""create a new program to prevent hazardous chemical accidents."" It didn't, of course. It should now. Let's join Rosser and Ward in their search for answers. That's needed to ensure a spill like this never happens again. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Noncontaminated tap water is coming back for some West Virginia residents .

"Washington (CNN) -- After weeks of urging the Obama administration to implement a travel ban to and from Ebola stricken countries, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has taken matters into his own hands. On Monday, Jindal signed an executive order calling for all state departments, agencies, and offices to ""develop a plan and reporting mechanism"" for employees to disclose whether they had recently traveled to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The order was made in an effort to monitor travelers from potentially exposing other Louisiana residents to the disease. If an employee recently visited one of these countries, they will be immediately restricted from using commercial transportation and visiting public spaces for 21 days, the incubation period set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization. The order does not clarify how individuals will be advised to cooperate. An Ebola travel ban would be completely unprecedented . ""The federal government, to date, has failed to implement protections at the national level to prevent the entry of the Ebola Virus Disease into the United States of America,"" Jindal said in his order. ""Such a threat can be reduced with the implementation of precautionary, common-sense measures for public employees and students, faculty, and staff of institutions of higher learning who travel to these countries."" The potential 2016 candidate has been vocal against the administration's hesitancy to consider a blanket travel ban following the diagnosis of two Ebola patients in Texas. Thomas Eric Duncan, who traveled from Liberia to the U.S., died earlier this month. A nurse who treated him, Nina Pham, is currently receiving treatment at the National Institute of Health and remains in fair condition. Senate slates Ebola hearing as calls for ban grows . The administration has warned against a travel ban, saying that it will only hurt efforts to deliver necessary resources to combat the spread of the disease. However, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson announced Tuesday that visitors traveling from West Africa to the U.S. can only enter through five airports that have taken additional screening measures. ""A travel ban is something that we're not currently considering,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters earlier this month.

"(CNN) -- Jesse Matthew, a suspect in the disappearance of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, returned to Virginia on Friday, authorities said. Matthew had been taken into custody this week in Texas, 1,300 miles away from the town where Graham disappeared. Matthew agreed not to fight extradition from Texas, and arrived by plane in Charlottesville, Virginia, home of the university. Officials at the Albemarle Charlottesville Regional Jail said Matthew was being processed on Friday night. He has also been questioned in connection with an alleged sexual assault nearly 12 years ago, authorities said Thursday. However, no charges were filed because the woman didn't want to go forward with the case, and investigators determined there wasn't enough evidence to arrest Matthew back then, said Michael Doucette, the commonwealth's attorney for Lynchburg, Virginia. According to a statement from Lynchburg police, a woman reported she was raped on the campus of Liberty University on October 17, 2002. Matthew was a student there for three years and played on the football team. Matthew told authorities that the woman consented, Doucette said, adding that there were no witnesses. On Thursday, Matthew was in a Texas court twice Thursday, once to determine whether he wanted to fight extradition to Virginia and once on a charge of giving false information to a Texas peace officer. Jesse Matthew's father spoke out on his behalf on Thursday, saying his son would not have harmed Graham. ""For a big man, he's as gentle as they come,"" Jesse Matthew Sr. told CNN affiliate WTVR. ""The only thing I could see, him, maybe trying to give the girl a ride or help her out."" ""To kill or hurt somebody, that's not my son."" Found camping on the beach . Authorities found Matthew on a Galveston County beach after deputies got a call about a suspicious person camping there. A license plate check revealed he was wanted, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. Matthew did not resist arrest, police said. Mike Rodenberg, a vacationer who was fishing near the campsite when Matthew was arrested, said the big man came up to him to ask about why he was throwing some of his catch back. ""He seemed real nice. He was real soft spoken,"" Rodenberg said. ""(He) said he was down here from New Jersey and was looking for a job. I told him if I caught another red fish he could have it."" Matthew told him that his name was George, Rodenberg said. Nothing really seemed out of the ordinary until the police showed up. Lawyer: No comment at this point . Authorities had obtained an arrest warrant for Matthew on Tuesday, and police believe he was the last person with Graham. Matthew willingly went to a Virginia police station over the weekend, when there was no warrant for his arrest, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo said. He asked for a lawyer. They spoke and then left, police said. Authorities are now offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the safe return of Graham, 18, a second-year student at the University of Virginia. The Northern Virginia native is 5 feet 11 inches tall with a slender build and has light brown hair, blue eyes and freckles. She was last seen September 13 wearing a black crop top and capri pants. She had an iPhone in a pink case. Police have received 1,500 tips so far in the case and are urging anyone with information to call the police tip line at 434-295-3851. Hannah Graham disappearance: What we know . Graham was last seen in an area of Charlottesville known as the Downtown Mall. Police have asked owners of large parcels of property in surrounding counties to search their land and report back.

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) -- Imagine if Iowa held a caucus and nobody but Hillary Clinton showed up. Democrats of all stripes, including Clinton allies, have predicted for months that the former Secretary of State -- who was campaigning for midterm candidates in Iowa on Wednesday -- will face some kind challenge in the race for the Democratic nomination if she decides to run. The prospect of a Clinton campaign seems more likely with each passing day. But with the presidential race set to lurch into gear after next week's midterm elections and no clear alternative to Clinton emerging, there are questions about whether she will be the sole candidate on the ballot. That would mark a dramatic shift from the rollicking caucus fights in previous campaigns, including Clinton's battle with Barack Obama and John Edwards in 2008. ""There is a distinct possibility that there will be no serious alternative,"" said Kurt Meyer, a plugged-in Democratic activist from Mitchell County, Iowa. ""She may in essence have the field to herself, with one or two fringe protest candidates and no serious candidates opposing her."" The prospect of an uncontested race is a little bewildering to some Democrats here, where competitive caucuses are ingrained in the culture. ""It could be a process with just one person,"" said Bonnie Campbell, a longtime Clinton loyalist in Des Moines. ""None of us can imagine that, because it hasn't really happened before."" For their part, the GOP isn't worrying about a boring race. A platoon of Republicans — Chris Christie, Rand Paul, Rick Perry, Ted Cruz and others — have paraded through Iowa for the last two years, almost shamelessly transparent about their national intentions. Among the cast of Democratic potentials, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is the most active in Iowa, helping candidates up and down the ballot with campaign stops, paid staffers and financial assistance. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is also visible. Both men have said they are seriously considering running regardless of what Clinton does, though it's hard to imagine Sanders, a 73-year-old self-described socialist, mounting much more than a protest candidacy. Meanwhile, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a progressive darling with grassroots appeal, whipped up a frenzy in the college town of Iowa City earlier this month at a campaign event for Senate candidate Bruce Braley in Iowa City. Former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb is weighing a run and Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick hasn't quite ruled it out. Vice President Joe Biden, of course, is nurturing his long-standing relationships in the state. And Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was warmly received after a headline speech at the state Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner last weekend. But she also typified the reluctance of Democrats to step forward until Clinton's decision is clear. ""I am excited about the possibility of Hillary Clinton running,"" Klobuchar said in an interview. ""Democratic women senators have signed onto a letter asking her to run. I am one of them. I have put that in writing."" All of the Democrats, with the possible exception of Biden, are not widely-known to most voters and have room to grow their support in Iowa if they run. The state has rewarded insurgent candidacies in the past, and Clinton is a well-defined politician whose centrist politics and cautious instincts could make leave vulnerable to a challenge from a fresher-faced candidate with stronger progressive impulses. ""For Hillary, it's about meeting the expectations, because she can't exceed them,"" said state Rep. Pat Murphy, who is the Democratic nominee in Iowa's First Congressional District. ""The thing about Iowa is they will give everybody a look, so you can't rule anybody out at this point."" But it's also real possibility that none of the other choices run — they have said as much publicly, with Warren particularly forceful in her denials — potentially leaving Clinton in the driver's seat with no one riding shotgun. Democrats here fear that a non-competitive one-woman show would sap the caucuses of grassroots energy and the potential for party-building, even with the history-making potential of her candidacy. ""If you look at the vigor that a caucus or primary brings to a party long-term, you have to hope that happens every once in an awhile,"" Meyer said. ""If it hadn't happened two cycles in a row, in 2004 and 2008, then our party would be weaker than it is today."" Dave Price, a political reporter and anchor for WHO-TV in Des Moines, said a non-competitive Democratic caucus would offer Republicans another presidential cycle in the Iowa limelight, ""bashing Democrats non-stop."" He said Iowa's quadrennial caucus-industrial-complex would much prefer a two feisty battles, as it did during the busy winter of 2007 and 2008, rather than just one. ""Restaurants, hotels, everyone here gets used to it,"" said Price, the author of ""Caucus Chaos,"" a chronicle of the 2012 Iowa contest. ""It becomes its own spectator sport. You see people going all over town the week before the caucuses trying to see famous people, politicians, journalists, operatives, whoever."" Though past campaigns are never predictive, even those preparing for a Clinton challenge struggle to remember a previous caucus dynamic like this one: A singular, dominant frontrunner — who still needs to make inroads with an electorate that never quite warmed to her in 2008 — and a cast of smaller figures who may or may not run. ""I don't recall anything like this,"" said Campbell, the Clinton supporter. There was the 1992 caucus campaign, when Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, the hometown liberal, sought the Democratic nomination, allowing his opponents to forfeit the state and focus their energies on New Hampshire and elsewhere. Another close analogy: the 2000 race, when the frontrunner, Vice President Al Gore, fought off a challenge on the left from Bill Bradley. Like Clinton, Gore was the cautious heir apparent. Bradley had the field to himself, after other potential candidates like Dick Gephardt and Paul Wellstone took a pass. But unlike the Democrats who might challenge Clinton for the 2016 nomination, Bradley was not gun shy. After aggressively courting Iowa Democrats for months, he launched an exploratory committee in December of 1998, just weeks after the midterm elections, and immediately set about raising money and framing himself as the liberal alternative to Gore, focusing on education and poverty. Gore, though, ultimately defeated Bradley in Iowa, 63-35, on his way to the nomination. To mount anything more than a gadfly candidacy against Clinton in today's drawn-out, media-saturated nominating process will require a boatload of cash. Clinton and Barack Obama both raised over $100 million before the January 2008 caucuses, and that was almost seven years ago — before the Citizens United ruling made the political system even more awash in money. Looking at the field of potential Clinton rivals, only Warren seems to have a natural base, the potential to raise serious money and a significant grassroots fundraising reach. A handful of big, progressive donors could help prop her up. ""We have this mythology that you can go to Iowa and New Hampshire and knock a few doors and ultimate you too can be a serious presidential candidate,"" Meyer said. ""Maybe Eugene McCarthy could do that. I think that the schedule and political life has gotten to the point today where you aren't a serious candidate unless you go through the hoops of raising money and creating an organization. I think O'Malley probably comes the closest to it, but I don't see who else."" O'Malley has done more than any Democrat, including Clinton, to help elect Iowa Democrats this year — and he has traveled far and wide to do the same in other states. Though polling is of little consequence at this early stage, he remains stuck around one or two percent in hypothetical 2016 polls that match him up against Clinton, Biden, Warren and others. Still, O'Malley's Iowa antennae is so heightened that during the Big 10 match-up between the University of Maryland and the University of Iowa earlier this month, he wandered over to a Hawkeye tailgate and chatted up the revelers who had made the long trip from Iowa to Maryland. ""All the Iowa Hawkeye fans were quite impressed that here was the governor at this tailgate, and so was I,"" said George Appleby, a Des Moines attorney and longtime Democratic activist. ""Of course, we didn't talk about any of the future. But implicitly, people don't spend time with Iowans at a football game without a reason."" But O'Malley is still wrestling with the decision to mount a bid and — despite the conventional wisdom about his intentions — could very well sit the race out. What's left, beyond a protest candidacy on the left mounted by Sanders or someone else? A long list of ambitious Democrats eager to make a name for themselves in Iowa, but unwilling to take the plunge against Clinton. Klobuchar's speech last weekend was a folksy and populist-tinged speech in which she declared that, ""Corporations aren't people! People are people!"" It was warmly-received by Democrats in the crowd who said they admired her family's immigrant history. After the speech, she happily ticked through the similarities between her state and Iowa. ""Iowans are our neighbors,"" she said in an interview. ""We have a lot of friends here back and forth between Minnesota and Iowa. our states are pretty similar. We are both agriculture states. The farm bill and and the renewable fuel standard are really important. So it's important to me to have allies in Iowa like Tom Harkin has been, to get things done for the midwest."" The message was obvious: She would play well here in Iowa. But she is not stepping into the arena so long as there's a Clinton in the other corner.","Hillary Clinton campaigned in Iowa this week, stumping for Democrat Bruce Braley .

"(CNN) -- Clemson University suspended a mandatory online course that asked students and faculty about their sex lives and drinking habits following backlash from the school community. The South Carolina public university started using the third-party online course this semester as part of required ""Title IX training"" on sexual violence prevention. Questions such as: ""How many times have you had sex?"" and ""With how many different people have you had sex?"" raised privacy concerns among students. Clemson junior Machaella Reisman said she appreciates the school's efforts to educate the community on sexual violence prevention, especially in light of recent headlines related to domestic violence in the NFL. But, schools should be able to educate students without asking how many times they've had sex in the past three months, or if drugs or alcohol were involved, Reisman said. ""This is not information that I discuss with my friends, let alone information I feel the need to disclose to the school or whoever the third-party source may be,"" Reisman, 20, told CNN in an email. ""As a questionnaire that is supposed to serve the purpose of educating students on gender equality to prevent sexual violence, why should there be questions regarding how much sex a student has had and if they used drugs, alcohol, or a condom?"" The controversy comes as schools across the country are experimenting with new approaches to sexual harassment prevention and education to comply with federal law. Sexual violence prevention in higher education has been a concern for schools across the country amid widespread allegations that schools mishandled sexual misconduct incidents in violation of federal law. Mandatory sexual violence education programming is common in schools nationwide. The University of California-Berkeley said this week that at least 500 freshmen could face holds on spring registration if they do not complete mandatory sexual harassment training this semester. The White House launched a task force earlier this year dedicated to the issue, and unveiled a new public awareness and education campaign on Friday called ""It's On Us."" The program, which President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden announced Friday, aims to engage students and colleges to take active roles in preventing sexual assault on campus. Clemson's Title IX training module was stirring debate on campus as more people started taking it, Reisman said. A Campus Reform article on the program brought the conversation to the national level, prompting Clemson to suspend the program Wednesday pending further ""review and revision."" ""We felt it was important to take those concerns seriously,"" Shannon Finning, dean of students and associate vice president for Student Affairs, told CNN. ""We are very committed to not only meeting federal requirements, but also assuring that we will provide critically important training and education to all members of our community."" Reisman also questioned the extent to which her responses would be treated anonymously considering she used her name and student ID number to register for the online course. But Finning said the responses were ""captured anonymously"" and would not be identifiable by the school or CampusClarity, the vendor that created the module. ""At the conclusion, we would gather it in aggregate and it would give us a better picture of campus culture and give us an opportunity to identify additional educational and training needs."" The questions were included among other slides related to campus resources and exercises in how to deal with potential scenarios, Finning said. On the whole, the course was intended to address requirements under Title IX to make students aware of resources for dealing with sexual violence and how to report sexual misconduct, she said. Schools that receive federal funding are required under the Violence Against Women Act to provide sexual violence education to new and returning students and employees. Guidance under Title IX issued by the Office for Civil Rights in 2001 and 2014 also makes clear that schools should be providing educational programs on sexual violence to their student body, said Nancy Chi Cantalupo with the professional group Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education. Surveys are not required by Title IX and VAWA, and schools do not have to purchase surveys or educational programs from third parties, Cantalupo said. There are several models schools can adapt, including White House guidelines. ""By designing their own survey, schools can insure that the survey questions are non-invasive"" Cantalupo said.","Clemson's ""Title IX"" online training included questions about sex, alcohol and drug use .
""How many times have you had sex in past three months?"" among questions asked .
Students said they were concerned over how the responses would be used .

"(CNN) -- Every war veteran has stories. They can be shocking, harrowing, tragic -- sometimes even funny. The problem for families trying to understand those experiences, on Veterans Day and every day, is that they won't hear much about them. Many vets have trouble talking about them. This was the case with my father, who saw lots of action as an artilleryman in the Philippines during World War II. When I was a kid, I'd beg him for tales about the war. Usually, he waved me away. Sometimes, though, he gave in to my badgering. I found it strange that most of his accounts were short on the blood and guts bravado that my G.I. Joe comic books had led me to expect. Mostly, they were about men who simply wanted to do their job and go home, but found themselves subject to the deadly coin toss of war. Like today's soldiers recovering from injuries, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or haunted by images of fallen friends, he soon learned after returning home that he couldn't explain war to a civilian. He would carry this alone. ""There's no way anyone who wasn't there could understand,"" he would say. He shook his head telling about the time he had been relieved of duty at a forward observation post. Moments after he walked away, an enemy shell hit the site. It obliterated everyone there, including the friend who had just taken his place. He was lucky in war. I think that bothered him, too. His unit saw 187 days of active battle, but his only injury came when his leg was peppered with shrapnel during an assault. Gangrene set in. Doctors told him the leg had to come off or he could die. He refused to let the doctors operate, and they reluctantly respected his wishes. Then a new ""wonder drug"" arrived. It was the first batch of penicillin to reach the Philippines, and his life was saved. Why was he spared and others not? Again, he couldn't explain. One day, he heard that an acquaintance -- a kid from his hometown in Missouri -- had been killed in a nearby conflict. He drove to the battlefield to search for the body, but most of the dead were too disfigured to be recognized. Finally, he gave up. He couldn't understand why he had wanted to find him. Or, what he would have done if he had. ""Really, I didn't even know him,"" he told me. At some point during those evenings, he would stop and turn his head. I knew he was finished then, and I would wander off, leaving him to his distant world. Years later, as a reporter, I wrote a series of articles about WWII veterans. Each had his own accounts of exploits and escapes. Like Dad, they usually had to be coaxed into talking. Often, the interviews astounded members of their own family who were hearing the stories for the first time. Like many veterans today, the war never left my father. For years, he suffered bouts of malaria from his time in the South Pacific. His wounded leg sometimes gave him trouble. He regretted not signing up for disability pay while getting his discharge. But the line of injured vets was too long for him to wait. He wanted to get home to a bride he hadn't seen in 3Â½ years. And a 4-year-old son he'd never met. My father respected the sentiment behind Veterans Day, but it wasn't an observance he enjoyed. Dad became a successful businessman in a small Midwestern town after the war and, each year, the Veterans Day parade filed past his storefront. He never joined it, or added his voice to the cheering crowd. While everyone else saw the ranks of veterans parading past, he saw the wartime buddies who weren't there. So, he simply watched grim-faced until it was over. Then he went back inside and tried to forget all over again. Join us Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"Washington (CNN) -- The turbulent political environment and a flood of outside spending from Republican backed Super PACs are throwing House Democrats on defense twenty days before the midterm elections, and they are putting out the call for help from their allies. Money once earmarked to try to knock off House Republicans in competitive seats is now being used to prop up Democratic members watching millions of dollars in television attack ads air in their districts funded by GOP backed outside groups. ""Tough and unpredictable"" and ""admittedly difficult"" were two phrases used by Rep Steve Israel, D-New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democrats' campaign arm used to describe the landscape to reporters on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. While Democrats were never in position to compete for control of the House they did go into the midterms with the goal to pick up some seats in districts President Barack Obama won in 2012. Now the objective is to minimize losses on their own side, and hope that the House Republican majority doesn't grow to a number that makes their objective of taking back the House in the next national election in 2016 insurmountable. Israel admitted his candidates face headwinds this fall, but doesn't see anything like the wave in the last midterm in 2010 that washed Democrats out of the House majority and took many candidates by surprise. He pointed out that on average the president's party loses 29 House seats in midterm elections. And the New York Democrat said the lesson of 2010 was to prepare his colleagues for the worst case scenario in 2014 and prioritize current House members' races over those of Democratic challengers. A senior House Democratic aide confirms that resources are being moved away from targets in red districts to shore up Democrats on defense against Republican attacks. Money reserved for DCCC television ads in Colorado's sixth congressional district, where Democratic challenger Andrew Romanoff is hoping to oust GOP Rep Mike Coffman has been canceled. The House Democrats' campaign arm pulled resources way from a race in Northern Virginia to replace a retiring Republican, where Democratic challenger John Foust is competing against former House GOP aide Barbara Comstock. The campaign cash is instead being directed to help people like freshman California Rep Ami Bera, who just had Republican outside groups drop well over a million into TV spots just last week. But Israel insisted that his long term strategy to organize early and send 700 field staff to key races around the country has kept a group of more than 30 House races still in the competitive column. The Democratic campaign chief repeatedly used the session with reporters to communicate a plea to outside donors and advocacy groups supportive of Democrats that it's not too late to stop the bleeding. ""In a world of Republican Super PAC hurt, the pain can be ameliorated, and in some cases reversed, when some of our outside allies decide they are not going to leave a single race on the table and they come in and help fortify some of our candidates,"" Israel said Wednesday. By law the DCCC can't coordinate political strategy and resources with outside groups. So Israel used the press to send the message. ""It is frustrating that the cavalry that has always been there doesn't seem to be there."" He argued that Democratic allies shouldn't just help Senate Democrats, who are in jeopardy of losing their majority, but they could focus on both chambers and that 20 days remaining amounted to ""an eternity"" in the political world. A spokeswoman for the House GOP's campaign committee said Israel's focus on outside factors ignored the drag that the president was having on congressional Democrats. ""Chairman Israel needs stop the Washington blame game and admit that President Obama and his devastating policies are casting a large shadow over the landscape for House Democrats,"" Andrea Bozek, spokeswoman for the NRCC said in a written statement. In a sign of how difficult Nov. 4th is likely to be for House Democrats, Israel acknowledged that Democrats were having a tough time competing against New York Republican Congressman Michael Grimm, who faces a 20 count federal indictment for mail fraud, wire fraud, filing false tax returns, hiring unauthorized aliens and perjury. Israel declined to outline how many seats would remain in Democrats hands after voters cast their ballots. But it was clear he was already ready to move onto the next election cycle, saying of Republicans the day after the election, ""they wake up to a really hostile environment going into 2016 and part of this was laying that infrastructure long term.""","Rep. Steve Israel who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Commmittee briefed reporters Wednesday.

"Louisville, Kentucky (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton sounded a populist tone in a fiery campaign appearance Wednesday, as she continued to unveil a political message ahead of the midterm elections. ""The other side has done everything it can to divide you,"" she told several thousand raucous fans in Louisville. ""This election is about the future."" Clinton's speech comes as the former secretary of state moves back into the political sphere with a series of rallies for Democrats up this midterm cycle. On Wednesday, she rallied supporters of Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in a high-profile race. ""Let's put another crack in the glass ceiling, and elect this incredible young woman to the United States Senate,"" Clinton exhorted the cheering audience. Clinton criticized McConnell and politicians in Washington for causing gridlock and slowing economic growth, and she lamented the avalanche of money outside groups are dumping into the midterm elections. She urged Kentuckians to send a new voice to the Senate. Some of her biggest applause lines centered on pocketbook issues such as raising the minimum wage and equal pay. ""Isn't it amazing that it's 2014, and we are still debating whether women deserve equal pay for equal work?"" she asked. ""If there's only one reason that will motivate you to go vote in the next 20 days, put that at the top of the list."" Clinton's visit to Kentucky comes a day after the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said it would stop running ads in support of Grimes.

"(CNN) -- Nathan Cirillo was the strong, smiling type. The Canadian army reservist could look the part of intimidating soldier, the way that his abundant muscles filled out his uniform. But his Instagram and Facebook page and recollections shared online suggest Cirillo was a person at ease snuggling with a dog, enjoying music or joking with friends. ""His smile will live in our hearts forever,"" wrote one woman who'd go over to Cirillo's house growing up. ""I am proud to say I knew someone who put his life on the line for this country."" His life ended late Wednesday morning in downtown Ottawa, as he stood guard at the National War Memorial in ceremonial uniform with white gloves alongside another soldier at the National War Memorial. It's the kind of role that's supposed to be an honor, not a risk. Yet, then and there, someone approached Cpl. Cirillo and fired. Peter Henderson heard four shots, then saw Cirillo's body laying on the ground by the memorial's soaring granite arch. He appeared to have been shot in the back with ""catastrophic"" wounds, Henderson said. Hours later, authorities announced Cirillo had died as a result. Prime Minister: 'Terrorist' killed soldier 'in cold blood' Mayor: 'Combat soldier (killed) in cowardly ambush' Cirillo ""was a very proud member of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders,"" Col. Lawrence Hatfield from that regiment told reporters Wednesday night. That group is a reserve unit consisting of the Canadian ""Army's primary war-fighters ... responsible for closing with and destroying the enemy,"" according to its website. ""They've had an immense fighting history,"" Bob Bratina, the mayor of Cirillo's hometown of Hamilton, Ontario, told CNN partner CTV. ""It's said (the unit's) history is written in blood in so many different places."" Ottawa's National War Memorial, though, wasn't supposed to be one of them. As Bratina pointed out, ""the posting of the ceremonial guard is an honor who goes to special privileged soldiers who have the credentials and the qualifications and the approval of their commanding officers. ""This individual would have been a trained combat soldier sadly taken in this cowardly ambush, which makes the tragedy even greater,"" the mayor said, before Cirillo had been identified publicly. In his brief statement, Hatfield expressed his regiment's ""sincere condolences"" over Cirillo's tragic, violent death. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with his family,"" the colonel said, ""and we hope that Canadians share that with us and as well for the ongoing safety of our soldiers."" Images show him as buff, dog lover . Cirillo leaves behind a son, who started kindergarten earlier this fall, according to his Instagram page. After his death became public, pictures began appearing online showing Cirillo recently at the memorial in his full ceremonial garb, kilt included. Other people went much further back, like a men he'd befriended in the military and a high school classmate who recalled Cirillo as someone who was ""always so funny and always had a smile for people as he would walk down the hallways."" One woman remembered Cirillo waiting her for over an hour one freezing night in Hamilton, coffee in hand. Another reflected on his finding an abandoned puppy and then taking it home, describing him as ""a great guy with an even bigger heart."" Cirillo's Facebook and Instagram pages include impressive pictures of him working out as well as his sculpted physique. They also show a man who'd strum a guitar, snuggle with dogs and post a picture of a cute, furry kitten in his backpack. This soldier, after all, also ""liked"" the nonprofit Dog Lovers International. His Instagram page is full of canines, including some that were his own and at least one he helped rescue and placed in a home. It's that big heart, for humans and animals alike, that his friends will miss most. ""Not only did you protect our country, but you were such a loving, caring, and funny person to everyone around you,"" one of them wrote.

"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) -- The tide may be turning in Ferguson, Missouri. For the first time since a white police officer fatally shot unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, the streets emptied early Thursday. Protest crowds thinned from hundreds to dozens late Wednesday, then disappeared. Thunderstorms may have doused their numbers. ""I hope that people do calm down and just continue it to be peaceful. I hope the outsiders leave and let the real individuals who are really trying to make a difference remain so that it can stay peaceful, so some type of resolution and change can happen,"" said Charles Davis, owner of a local burger bar. Late Wednesday, police made targeted arrests. Earlier in the day, they suspended an officer caught on video pointing a semiautomatic rifle at peaceful protesters and shouting profanities at them the night before. But community leaders were grateful that tensions on the streets had eased. In a move that reflected what appeared to be increasing calm, Gov. Jay Nixon ordered the Missouri National Guard to begin withdrawing from the city. Troops had been sent there Monday to protect the police command center, which officials said had come under threat of attack. ""We're going to have a systematic drawdown. We're working with the commanders to do that, but we're going to make sure we keep safety there,"" the governor told CNN's Don Lemon on Thursday. ""As we see folks getting calmer, fewer arrests, fewer problems here, that mission we're going to draw down off that. We don't need the same force of strength,"" he said. But even then -- when calm returns to Ferguson -- work in the community is not done, Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson told residents. He said police need to be educated, not by professors, but by regular people about how best to build bridges. ""We need not sit there and make excuses; we just need to make it right,"" he said. Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests . We stand with Ferguson, Holder says . U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder spoke Thursday about his visit to Ferguson to check in on the federal civil rights investigation into Brown's shooting. ""This attorney general and this Department of Justice stand with the people of Ferguson,"" he told reporters in Washington. Holder has assigned scores of FBI agents and Justice Department investigators to look into Brown's August 9 death in the suburban St. Louis city. Police have said Brown and the officer, Darren Wilson, struggled over the officer's gun; witnesses who have spoken publicly say the 18-year-old had his hands in the air when he was shot. On Thursday, a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN that reports in the media that Wilson suffered a fractured eye socket from his reported scuffle with Brown are false. The officer had a swollen face and went to the hospital, where he underwent medical tests and was treated for his injury, the source said. A St. Louis County grand jury began hearing testimony in the case Wednesday, but it's not expected to make a decision on charges against Wilson before mid-October. While Holder said agents have made ""significant progress"" in their investigation, he said it will still take time to complete and asked for the community's support. Holder met with Brown's family not long after the teen's mother viewed her son's bullet-riddled body at a morgue for the first time. He heard from a woman who said her brother died in an encounter with Ferguson police in 2011. And he spoke to the community of a festering mutual mistrust between law enforcement and many communities in the United States. Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an interview Thursday that Holder's visit made a difference. ""Because, you can read a person,"" she said. ""And when you're looking at them and they're looking at you in your eyes, it puts some trust back there,"" she said. His trip was not universally well-received, however. Activist Akbar Muhammed gave the attorney general low grades for the trip. ""We thank him for coming, but he gets a D minus,"" Muhammed said. ""He came to have a community meeting, and in that community meeting he didn't meet with any of us who were out in the street,"" he said. 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting . Magazine: The aftermath in Ferguson . Slow wheels of justice . The grand jury meeting in Clayton, Missouri, will examine whether charges should be filed against Wilson in Brown's death. St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch told local media Wednesday that the grand jurors will see every bit of evidence that investigators gather and will be allowed to meet as long as they want before making a decision. ""The aspirational time is by mid-October to have everything completed,"" he told CNN affiliate KMOV. He wants the case to proceed through the grand jury ""expeditiously"" but also ""thoroughly,"" he said. ""We're not going to rush it through, and we're not going to leave anything out."" On Thursday, Holder declined to answer questions about whether his department was looking into past allegations of abuse by Ferguson police, including a 2009 incident in which a man said police bloodied him in a jail cell, as well as the 2011 death that Holder spoke of. ""I'll just say at this point, we are keeping all of our options open,"" he said. Controversy over prosecutor . Activists delivered petitions they said were signed by 70,000 people asking McCulloch to step down. ""That is the only way we're going to bring strong confidence within this investigation,"" Missouri state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed said. Critics have complained that McCulloch, who is tasked with prosecuting Wilson, could be biased in the officer's favor. McCulloch comes from a family of law enforcement officers. His father was killed in the line of duty. McCulloch has rejected that criticism, telling St. Louis radio station KTRS on Wednesday that the experience of losing his father turned him into a passionate advocate for all victims of violence. He said again Thursday after the petitions were delivered that he would not step aside. ""I appreciate and understand the concerns of those who honestly believe that I cannot or will not be fair to all in the gathering and presentation of the evidence pertaining to the tragic death of Michael Brown,"" he said in a statement. ""Although I understand the concerns, and do not take lightly the demands that I recuse myself from this case, I also recognize that I have a responsibility to the family of Michael Brown, the people of Ferguson and the entire community.""

"(CNN) -- It's one of the great ironies in all of sports: Pro baseball's career hitting leader is not in baseball's Hall of Fame. As long as Pete Rose is banned from baseball, he will be banned from any Hall of Fame ballot. On Monday, 20 years to the day Pete Rose signed an agreement with Major League Baseball banning him from the sport, he is no closer to being reinstated. In that agreement, Rose, accused of betting on MLB games while he managed the Cincinnati Reds, was ""declared permanently ineligible in accordance with Major League Rule 21."" Rose didn't publicly admit the betting until this decade. Baseball's history, Rose's lying about his gambling and his brash nature in handling the manner have all painted him into this corner, with no apparent way out. ""Nobody who has ever been thrown out of baseball has ever been reinstated. An owner of Philadelphia bet on baseball, the 1919 White Sox, you name it. No matter if it's a third-base coach or an all-star, Hall of Fame-type player,"" said Faye Vincent, who was MLB deputy commissioner at the time baseball investigated Rose for betting on his team. Vincent, who talked to CNN.com from his summer home in Williamstown, Massachusetts, wrote the agreement in 1989. It was signed by then-MLB Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti, Rose and his attorneys, and Vincent. ""I think the door is closed. There is no possible way they can retract what was done,"" said Furman Bisher, longtime columnist for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and a voting member of the Hall of Fame's Pre-1943 Veterans Committee. ""Every club has it as you walk into their clubhouse in big letters: No gambling. ""I think Bart Giamatti handled it beautifully. He was banned for life, and that should be the last line of his career."" Last month, it took one comment about baseball's hit king from baseball's former home run king to reignite the controversy. ""I would certainly like to see him in,"" Hank Aaron told reporters at baseball's Hall of Fame festivities. ""He belongs in, really."" At first, many observers thought those remarks were a big move in favor of Rose, as Aaron is a longtime friend of MLB Commissioner Bud Selig. Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Feller later told the San Francisco Chronicle, ""I heard what Hank Aaron said about it, and that's a cockamamie idea. I had dinner with the commissioner Sunday, and he didn't like it."" Bisher, who has covered Aaron his whole career, said he ""couldn't believe Aaron said it."" ""Sometimes Henry wants to be likable and is kind to some people,"" Bisher said. This weekend, another friend, Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt, went to Rose's defense, in a column he wrote for The Associated Press. ""Is this the way Bart Giamatti would have wanted it 20 years later?"" Schmidt asked. Schmidt maintains Giamatti was the only man who could broker Rose back into the sport's good graces: ""Giamatti was a compassionate man who would have eventually met with him, laid out a lifestyle plan that Pete would follow, and today he'd be a forgiven member of baseball's family."" Schmidt points to baseball's current steroids scandal as another reason for Rose's ban to be lifted. ""Which is worse? Does the penalty fit the crime?"" Schmidt wrote. A USA Today/Gallup poll released this week showed that 75 percent of more than 1,000 Americans surveyed think that player use of performance-enhancing drugs is more serious than Rose's offense. The same poll showed that support for Rose's Hall of Fame eligibility has not changed in 20 years -- 60 percent favor it; 35 percent are opposed. Giamatti's successor, Vincent, said Rose prevented himself from ever getting considered for a possible return to baseball. ""He and his lawyers said all kinds of things about Bart Giamatti, claiming Bart was biased and all,"" Vincent said. ""The proper course for Pete would be to say then, 'I'm sorry, I want to help you, I want to help baseball.' But he never did that, of course. ""Bart and I told him about reconfiguring his life, and that's the sad part. He was very defiant then, and he made it more difficult for himself."" Giamatti died eight days after banishing Rose. Vincent took over as commissioner, and he said he never saw any signs of change or remorse from Rose. ""I understood very quickly Rose had no intention of making changes,"" Vincent said. ""He never acknowledged he had a gambling problem. I don't think to this day he ever recognized he had a problem."" Rose made matters worse as the years went on. On the weekend of baseball Hall of Fame inductions in Cooperstown, New York, he often held autograph sessions at a nearby bookstore, rankling the Hall of Famers who played before Rose. From the time of the ban until 2004, he publicly insisted he didn't bet on baseball. When he did admit to betting on baseball in his 2004 book, he was back in Cooperstown on the weekend of inductions, signing copies. ""If you talk to some of the Hall of Famers, like Bob Feller and others, they would never go for that. Bob Feller has said to me before, 'If Pete Rose is allowed in the Hall of Fame, I'll never come back,' "" Vincent said. Rose and attorneys who once represented him did not return calls and e-mails for comment. He makes a living making public appearances and signing autographs, through his Web site and at one of the shopping malls at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. He has a message for his fans on his Web site: ""I begrudgingly do not have any positive new updates as it relates to my quest for official re-instatement back into Major League Baseball."" Schmidt is one of the few Rose supporters who will publicly say baseball should lift the ban. Rose's ex-teammates Tony Perez and Joe Morgan did not return calls and e-mails. Like Aaron, both are on the Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee. So are Don Sutton, Phil Niekro and Tony Gwynn, who would not comment on Rose's status. ""Some other players like Mike Schmidt, from time to time, come out and comment that it is time for Pete Rose to be reinstated,"" Vincent said. ""But when you talk to players, they seldom see the universe the way a commissioner sees it. For every player that thinks Rose should be reinstated, there are 10 that don't."" Aaron's and Schmidt's comments may be the last talk of Rose entering the Hall of Fame anytime soon, especially during the reign of Selig, who has a contract as commissioner through 2012. When contacted, a spokesman for Selig said, ""The commissioner stands by his comments to reporters he made during [last month's] Hall of Fame weekend, as judge and jury on this."" Selig said then, ""I would remind you that Pete Rose admitted to gambling on baseball and agreed to a lifetime ban."" He added the case is always under review, but nothing has changed. Rose does have hometown support. In a recent unscientific sampling of readers' views on The Cincinnati Enquirer's Web site that included 5,000 responses, 89 percent said Rose should be allowed in the Hall of Fame. This weekend, for the second time in the past month, an Enquirer columnist wrote that it is time to forgive Rose. ""He has his fans in Cincinnati, no doubt; he has people who want to forgive him,"" said Bisher, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution columnist. ""But if you robbed a bank, you still robbed a bank. It's done, and nothing you do can change that."" Vincent recalled a conversation he had with Hall of Famer Tom Seaver. ""Tom Seaver once asked me, 'If I'm a Hall of Famer, and I bet on baseball, do I get the same treatment?' I said, 'Yes.' Tom said, 'I get it. If you didn't do that, we would all bet on baseball.' "" And the Dowd Report, baseball's 225-page account of the investigation of Rose's gambling activities -- including bank and telephone records, Rose's betting slips and witness testimony -- has stood the test of time. ""Not a single fact has ever been challenged,"" Vincent said. ""The case was so overwhelming, and it had so much. Some people tried to write books on it and couldn't because it didn't miss a thing."" Rose isn't entirely missing from the Hall of Fame. His hitting accomplishments and some artifacts are a part of the sport's timeline there, but so is his lifetime suspension. ""Many artifacts donated by him are on display,"" said Brad Horn, National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum's senior director for communications and education. ""As a history museum that tracks the game's greatest moments, Pete is noted several times in the museum's timeline ... but as a history museum, we do have the responsibility to tell the history of baseball. We do say Pete was banned from baseball for gambling in that timeline."" Rose holds 19 MLB records, including most career hits, 4,256. He is the only player in MLB history to play more than 500 games at five different positions, and he played in more wins than any player in history. One of the roads buffering the Great American Ballpark, the current home of the Reds, is Pete Rose's Way, and it was there back when he was playing near the same site, at Riverfront Stadium. But he isn't going to get his way on the Hall of Fame anytime soon and may never find the road leading there.","Pete Rose signed agreement with Major League Baseball banning him 20 years ago .

"Washington (CNN) -- Joni Ernst is creeping away from her Democratic opponent in Iowa's contentious Senate race, building a lead of 4 percentage points in the latest poll. The Republican candidate for Senate in Iowa carries 49% of support to U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley's 45% according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday. Six days before the election, Ernst has the momentum in a race that could tip the balance of the Senate, picking up 2 percentage points since Quinnipiac's previous poll in mid-October. Ernst gained support among independents, a key bloc that favored Braley in the previous Quinnipiac poll. Ernst carried 51 percent of independent support to Braley's 41%, a seven-point upswing for Ernst. Republicans picked up an unprecedented lead in Iowa's early ballot count last week after a beefed up early voter ground game and the two parties are now neck-in-neck in the early voting game. But the poll showed Braley still winning the early voting game, as Democrats have done in the past, leading among the respondents who had already voted 57% to 36%. Braley and Ernst held onto their edge with women and men, respectively, but Ernst continues to carry male voters by a 17-point margin compared to Braley's eight-point lead among women. Hillary Clinton: Not answering questions should be 'disqualifying' Ernst has consistently led in polls over the last month, but the four-point lead is her best number yet after polling from the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg, NBC News/Marist and the previous Quinnipiac poll all showed her lead at or below 3 percentage points. Braley's slumping prospects come despite Democrats' best efforts to boost Braley's candidacy with top class surrogates like First Lady Michelle Obama and Sen. Elizabeth Warren among others. Joni Ernst defends skipping Des Moines Register meeting . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is also returning to the Hawkeye State on Wednesday, with her husband former President Bill Clinton expected to rally voters with Braley on Monday. Ernst could also be benefiting from the prospects of Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, who leads his Democratic challenger by 19 points.","Joni Ernst has a four-point lead over Rep.

"(CNN) -- In a matter of days, they transformed from caretakers into patients. The two women live thousands of miles apart, but the first known Ebola cases contracted outside Africa during this outbreak have one striking similarity: Both were health care workers, caring for someone infected with the deadly virus. As a nurse in Dallas and a nurse's assistant in Madrid fight for their lives, a key question looms: Are people who are putting themselves in harm's way to care for Ebola victims receiving the training and equipment they need? No, says Zenei Cortez, vice president of National Nurses United. ""It's really a disaster waiting to happen,"" she told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" on Thursday. The union is pushing for more equipment, training and education for nurses, Cortez said. A survey of 1,900 nurses by the union found that 76% said their hospital had not communicated any policy for the potential admission of patients infected by Ebola. It's a ""startling statistic,"" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said, particularly since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in May that it was distributing guidelines to hospitals around the country. ""Infectious disease protocols, universal precautions should be the same, really, in hospitals all over the country. They should apply here with regard to Ebola as well,"" Gupta said. ""But obviously, that's not happening. These nurses who are a part of that survey just don't feel comfortable as things stand now."" CDC chief blames protocol breach . The CDC is ""doubling down"" on outreach and training to increase awareness of Ebola and make sure U.S. hospitals ""think Ebola,"" CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said Monday. Hospitals should be skilled at taking travel histories of people who show Ebola symptoms and should isolate those who have been to Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea, Frieden said. And the CDC is also planning more hands-on training at hospitals and outreach to health departments. As authorities confirmed that the Dallas nurse had contracted Ebola, Frieden was quick to point to a breach in protocol. Frieden said he wasn't pointing fingers, but trying to pinpoint what happened. ""Stopping Ebola is hard,"" he said, adding that the CDC will do anything possible to protect health care workers. The nurse, Nina Pham, had cared for Thomas Eric Duncan, who contracted Ebola in Liberia and died of the illness at the hospital. Frieden said he would not be surprised if there were additional cases among those who cared for Duncan, but so far, no one is showing symptoms. On Monday morning, an official with direct knowledge of the Texas nurse's case told CNN that CDC disease detectives interviewed the nurse several times and thought there were ""inconsistencies"" in the type of personal protective gear she wore and with the process used to put the gear on and remove it. Health care workers on the front lines often get sick in the early stages of an outbreak, while dealing with patients who are highly infectious, Gupta said. That's why there are guidelines for what protective gear they should wear when dealing with Ebola patients. But the Dallas case is concerning, he said. ""The patient was the most infectious,"" he said, ""but she should have been protected."" CDC Director Tom Frieden faces rising tide of criticism . Husband of infected nurse's assistant writes scathing letter . The nurse's assistant in Spain with Ebola remains in critical condition and is having trouble breathing, authorities said. The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said the hospital where Teresa Romero Ramos is being treated doesn't meet all the standards set for centers capable of Ebola care. In a scathing letter, Javier Limon, her husband, said she received only 30 minutes of training in putting on protective gear and called for the resignation of Madrid's regional health minister over how the case has been handled. ""Please explain to me how one puts on a protective suit, since unfortunately my wife doesn't have a master's degree in that,"" Limon wrote in a letter distributed by a family spokeswoman. ""Teresa had 30 minutes or a little more to learn how to do so through a colleague."" He fired back at criticism that the family had gone on vacation. ""No one told us that we couldn't do what we did, because the protocol did not tell us that we could not do that,"" Limon wrote. ""Now I know that in other countries they quarantine health care workers after treating an Ebola patient. Even though I am only a welder, I understand that if we had done this my wife would possibly not be battling between life and death."" Experts note ways CDC is getting it wrong . Are hospitals ready? President Barack Obama wants federal authorities to immediately take further measures to ensure that health care workers are able to follow protocols for treating Ebola patients. He met with senior administration members at the White House on Monday afternoon for an update on its response to the Dallas case and the broader effort to make sure the country is prepared to handle an outbreak. Of the thousands of hospitals in the United States, only four have been training for years to deal with highly infectious diseases such as Ebola: Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, the National Institutes of Health in Maryland and Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Montana.

"Dubai (CNN) -- The United Arab Emirates is no stranger to superlatives: the world's tallest building, among the world's most expensive hotels, even the largest kebab. The country has more than 100 world records to its name, so it's little wonder that Guinness has decided to open an office in Dubai next year to make it easier for people and businesses in the region to have their attempts certified. Talal Omar, the head of Guinness's Dubai office, says the region has seen huge growth in recent years. ""In the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, we've seen an increase of 300 to 400% in the number of applications over the past five years. The aim of this office is to make it easier, to make it quicker for people and businesses all across the region to access and achieve world records,"" he told CNN. There have been several this year alone: the largest handprint in Kuwait, the longest table in Dubai or the most people to parachute-jump from a hot-air balloon. Omar has overseen more than 300 records across the world, and relocated from London to Dubai just to cope with the new demand in the Middle East. He says any record attempt must meet four criteria to even be considered: . 1) It must be measureable -- longest, heaviest, fastest etc . 2) It must be verifiable, that is to say you must provide evidence to prove it . 3) The record must be breakable, in other words it can be challenged in the future . 4) The record must have one single variable: you cannot have the longest, fastest marathon, they'll either measure the longest or the fastest. Alastair Richards, president of Guinness World Records, says the organization is moving with the times in a bid to attract younger readers. ""We've got a website and of course it's got the news daily as to what records are being broken around the world,"" he said. ""It also as a website will give you a link to our YouTube site, Facebook, Twitter. There's also a section of the website where you can video yourself on let's say your mobile phone doing something you think is really cool that you think should be a Guinness World Record but as far as you know it's not at the moment. ""So this is really going after and encouraging the sort of 14 to 24-year-old boys and girls to have a go at record breaking, which is all about self-esteem and self-worth but that's a bigger question as to why Guinness World Records still exists after 56 years. ""So the website for instance now gets 1 million unique visitors a month, the vast majority of which are all about, they're looking at records and they're making record inquiries or they're enquiring about record claims."" ""The Guinness World Records is about the amazing superlatives that make up our physical world or our universe but at the heart of it is just about human beings and it's a measure as to how unique and amazing each and everyone of us is. So in that sense we reflect society. So lots of who's got the most fans on Facebook, who's got the most Twitter followers or who's been tweeted the most in 24 hours. So for example, President Barack Obama when he gets four more years, that got retweeted some 770,000 times, within 24 hours, it's that type of record now that is probably the most popular."" Here are some recent records that have been set in the Middle East . • The greatest distance covered in 24 hours in a motorized wheelchair. Haidar Talib, an Emirati travelled the 141km from Masdar City to Al Thiqa Club for Handicapped in Sharjah in 14 hours, 28 seconds on a solar-powered wheelchair. • The world's biggest kebab, weighing 468kg, was made by Doner Restaurant on Jumeirah Beach Road in 2012 . • The longest line of sandwiches, measuring 2,667.13 meters, was created by Kraft Foods Middle East and Africa in September 2010. • The world's heaviest gold ring, the Najmat Taiba (""Star of Taiba"") was created by Taiba for Gold and Jewellery of Saudi Arabia at the Old Gold Souq in Deira in April 2009. The ring, weighing 63.856 kilograms, consisted of 5.17kg of precious jewels set in a 58.686kg, 21-carat gold ring. • The largest coin, 1 meter wide, 2.3 centimetres thick and weighing 185kg, was made in Dubai. • The world's most expensive cocktail, ""the 27.321,"" named for its 27,321 dirham ($7,400) price tag, features on the menu of the Skyview Bar at Burj Al Arab. • Dubai's Princess Tower, completed in 2013, is the world's tallest residential tower at 413.4 meters and with 100 above-ground floors.","Guinness will open office in Dubai so people in region can have attempts certified .

"(CNN) -- At some 7 billion people, the world can sometimes seem like a crowded place. But if the latest estimates are to be believed, then in less than a century it is going to feel even more so -- about 50% more crowded, in fact. Such dizzying numbers understandably raise an important question, one that we have been wrestling with at least since Thomas Malthus famously predicted that rising populations would create a food crunch: Can the world's supply of food continue to meet demand? World Food Day, being marked Thursday, seems as good a time as any to wrestle with this question. And for once, it looks like there is actually some good news in the fight against global hunger. But any attempt to fully understand the magnitude of the challenge -- and to formulate ways we can meet it -- should begin with five key numbers: . 805 million: The number of people who suffer from chronic hunger. While this number is down about 11% over the last decade, it still represents an unacceptable proportion of the world's population. 10.95 billion: How many people the United Nations thinks the world is going to have to support by the year 2100. This represents a significant upward revision from previous estimates that had pegged the human population as leveling off around 2050 at about 9.5 billion. Much of this new growth is occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, where family size remains high and mortality from HIV is down. 33: The percentage of the world's food that is wasted before it is consumed by a human being. In the Global South, this waste occurs thanks to inefficient processing and storage facilities. In the Global North, consumers and retailers are to blame. The United Nations estimates that global food waste costs $2.6 trillion annually. 2.512 billion: How many tons of food the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization expects the world's farmers to harvest this year. If this projection comes true, we will be within .50% of the world's most bountiful year on record. 2,868: The number of dietary calories available on our planet per person per day in 2011, the last year for which data is available. This number has actually been growing, suggesting that the amount of food produced per person has been steadily rising (in 1990 there were 2,619 dietary calories per person per day). This growth in productivity is especially remarkable considering that the Earth's population grew by about 2 billion people over this time. Most importantly, the number of calories per person per day tells us that there is enough food on the planet for us all. Of course, the first two numbers paint a sobering picture of the potential food security and sustainability challenges the world faces. And when we add in the uncertainties over climate change, then the task of planning and effectively implementing systems and policies that will ensure everyone in the future receives an adequate diet seems a daunting one. But the other figures tell a different story, and allow room for some optimism. Why? Because fundamentally, the data show us that we have enough food. We are not up against some irrefutable Malthusian monster. What's more, these numbers prove that hunger is a matter of public policy and everyday behavior and suggest that social collapse, widespread famine and destitution should never be seen as inevitable in a world that wastes one-third of its food. Ultimately, these five numbers tell us that hunger is a solvable problem. Yes, famines, droughts and food riots will be an increasing feature of the headlines in the decades ahead. But this should not distract from the underlying: The world can have a well-fed future, one where everyone has enough to eat.","World's population set to grow to almost 11 billion by 2100, United Nations estimates .
About one-third of the world's food is wasted .
There is room for optimism over whether world can feed growing population, says Evan Fraser ."
"(CNN) -- The slayings of Israeli and Palestinian teens during the summer was a bloody precursor to the Gaza-Israeli conflict that took more than 2,000 lives. Now, once more, children on both sides have lost their lives violently, rending hearts and stoking resentment. One of those killed was a kindergartner, another a baby, both run down by motorists last week. And on Sunday, Palestinians lay to rest a teenage boy with U.S. roots, whom the Israel Defense Forces shot and killed in the West Bank on Friday, according to the U.S. State Department. In Ramallah, Palestinians are angry and are expected to take their grief to the streets marching beside the casket of Orwa Hammad, 14, whose father lives in New Orleans, where he also spent a year, according to The Times-Picayune newspaper. Clashes, gunfire . The teen died in clashes in the town of Silwad on Friday, the State Department said. The IDF said an ""attack was prevented"" when the military fired upon a male hurling a Molotov cocktail on a main road with traffic. They have not identified the deceased. Hammad's father got on a plane the day he died to go be at his funeral. Hammad's uncle Hakeem Khalek, back in New Orleans, feels the odds were stacked against him. Boys throwing objects are no match for soldiers' bullets, he told the Picayune. ""This all happens overseas, where kids throw rocks at military jeeps. And of course the Israeli army returned fire (and) we're not talking rubber bullets,"" he said. Innocents on both sides . A week ago, an Israeli settler ran over and killed a Palestinian kindergarten girl and seriously injured another child. The official Palestinian news agency, WAFA, said it was deliberate. Israeli police say they are investigating. Three days later, a Palestinian man drove his car into commuters at a rail stop in Jerusalem. It rammed a baby carriage with a 3-month-old inside. She died. She was an American citizen, the State Department said. Driver Abdelrahman al-Shaludi then fled on foot, and police gunned him down. He later died of his wounds in an Israeli hospital. He rammed the commuters intentionally as an act of terror, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Cruel déjà vu . Children also paid the price of tensions between Israelis and Palestinians before this summer's armed conflict. The bodies of three Israel teens kidnapped in the West Bank in June were found charred. Hamas leaders later said that some of its militants had killed Eyal Yifrach, 19; Gilad Shaar, 16; and Naftali Frankel, who was a 16-year-old dual U.S.-Israeli citizen. The militants had done this without their knowledge, Hamas said. Then three Israelis allegedly killed Palestinian youth Mohammed Abu Khedair, 16, in July out of revenge for the Israeli boys' deaths, Israeli prosecutors said. They abducted, beat and strangled Khedair, then burned him to death after he fell unconscious. It was ""only because he was an Arab,"" Jerusalem's district attorney said. The three have been indicted. Khedair's Palestinian-American cousin, Tariq Abu Khdeir, of Florida, received a beating from Israeli police after clashes sometime after the slaying. One of the officers was suspended from duty. Tensions mounted in the wake of the killings. Israeli airstrikes and Gazan rocket fire followed. Seven weeks of heavy fighting ensued, with more than 2,000 Palestinians killed and 67 deaths on the Israeli side. CNN's Joshua Berlinger, Karen Smith, Erin McLaughlin, Tal Heinrich, Ben Wedeman and Josh Levs contributed to this report .","A baby in Israel, a Palestinian kindergartner and an American-Palestinian youth killed last week .

"(CNN) -- Israeli-Palestinian tensions flared again in Jerusalem on Wednesday, with police and youths clashing at one of the holiest sites in Judaism and Islam, and a Palestinian motorist slamming into pedestrians, killing one. The events occurred amid unrest spurred in part by a days long war of words -- and sometimes rocks and bullets -- over the compound called the Temple Mount by Jews and Haram al-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary, by Muslims. At the compound -- the holiest site in Judaism and the third-holiest in Islam -- groups of Palestinian youths threw stones and set off fireworks at Israeli police officers when the site was opened to visitors, Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. Clashes left more than 15 people injured, police said. It was just the latest round of unrest since right-wing activist Rabbi Yehuda Glick was shot and gravely wounded after championing more Jewish rights at the site, where Jews can currently gather, but not pray. The October 29 shooting helped to ratchet up tensions in Jerusalem and prompted Israeli authorities to close the holy site for one day -- a move that a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called a ""declaration of war."" Before Wednesday's violence, the youths had gathered at the site's al-Aqsa Mosque overnight, amassing rocks, fireworks and Molotov cocktails with which to attack police, Samri said. Police pushed the Palestinians back into the mosque during Wednesday's clashes, Samri said, and, in an attempt to control the violence, police temporarily closed access to the compound. Witnesses among the Muslim worshipers gave a different version of events, saying police tossed stun grenades into the mosque to clear the way for Jewish protesters intending to support Glick. ""Inside the mosque they formed obstacles to hide behind,"" Samri said. ""There were violent clashes with the police."" Police later allowed Jews and tourists back to the site, but unrest flared again near another gate, when police threw stun grenades and fired rubber bullets at Muslim worshipers who were chanting and praying because they weren't allowed back into the compound. Paramedics from the Red Crescent said 15 people were injured, one of them with a serious injury to the eye. Samri said police officers were injured. Israeli police officer killed, 13 hurt in driver's rampage . Also in eastern Jerusalem on Wednesday, a Palestinian man drove a van into pedestrians at a rail station, killing an Israeli border police officer and injuring 13 other people, police said. Police shot and killed the attacker, identified by Israeli authorities as a member of the Islamist Hamas movement and a resident of the Shuafat Palestinian refugee camp in eastern Jerusalem, Samri said. News of the attack and subsequent killing ignited fierce clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian youths at the entrance of the refugee camp, according to witnesses. Police did not say the van attack was tied to unrest at the holy site. No motive was immediately released, but the Islamist movement Hamas supported it in a text message to the news media: ""Hamas blesses the action. What is happening in Jerusalem is pushing us to prepare for war."" Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld called the incident ""a terrorist attack."" That was followed later in the day by a similar incident, when a car with Palestinian plates rammed into Israeli military post near Al-Aroub in the West Bank, injuring three Israeli soldiers, authorities said. Police are searching for the driver, who appears to have fled the scene, they said. The soldiers were taken to Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital. All three are in moderate condition, Dr. Asher Salmon, the hospital's deputy head, said. Earlier, Samri said one was in critical condition. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned what he said was the ""incitement"" of violence by Palestinian leaders. He said the assassination attempt on Glick has led to other violence, including the vehicle attack. The attack comes on the heels of two hit-and-run incidents that happened in Jerusalem and the West Bank last month. On October 22, a Palestinian man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light rail stop in Jerusalem, killing a baby and wounding several other people, Israeli police said. Palestinian state news reported that a 5-year-old girl died October 19 after an Israeli settler deliberately ran over her as she returned home from kindergarten near a village to the north of Ramallah in the West Bank. Recent tension at the holy site . Some of the recent tension centers on the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif and Glick, who has argued that Jews must have a place of worship there. Israeli police shot and killed a suspect in Glick's shooting. That is a sensitive issue for Muslims, who suspect a plan to expel them from the site. A spokesman for the military wing of Hamas said the site's al-Aqsa Mosque ""is the detonator needed to ignite a volcano in the face of the cowardly and treacherous occupier."" ""We salute the heroes of the mujahideen of Hamas,"" Abu Abiada said in a message posted on the military wing's website. Jordan controlled the site for a time until 1967, when Israel seized eastern Jerusalem. In the 1980s, Jewish radicals plotted to blow up the Muslim buildings, believing that it would lead to a spiritual revolution and usher in the messiah. In 2000, the Second Intifada -- a five-year Palestinian uprising -- was sparked, Palestinians say, after Ariel Sharon, then a candidate for Israeli prime minister, visited the compound surrounding the al-Aqsa mosque. Sharon insisted that his visit was not intended to provoke Palestinians, but many saw it as an attempt to underline Israel's claim to Jerusalem's holy sites. Revered by Jews, Muslims . With its golden dome overlooking Jerusalem, the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif site is said to have hosted sacred events in the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions. Rabbinic sages say that God gathered dust from this spot to create Adam, the first man, before setting him loose in the Garden of Eden. Jewish tradition holds that the Temple Mount contains Mount Moriah, where Abraham, the Hebrew patriarch, is said to have nearly sacrificed his son -- under God's orders -- before an angel intervened. Later, Israeli King Solomon constructed the first Jewish temple on the mount, including the Holy of Holies, a room that kept the Ark of the Covenant, which was said to contain the tablets on which God wrote the Ten Commandments. At the foot of the Temple Mount, the 62-foot-tall Western Wall, or Wailing Wall, stands. Once supporting the courtyard of the ancient temple, Jews gather there now to hold religious services, to pray or to slip notes into its cracks. For Muslims, the Noble Sanctuary contains one of the most sacred sites in Islam: the al-Aqsa Mosque. Muslims believe that the Prophet Mohammed was carried on a flying steed from Mecca to the site during his miraculous Night Journey, said Muqtedar Khan, an expert on Islam and politics at the University of Delaware. According to Islamic tradition, the night journey took Mohammed to the same Jerusalem rock on which Abraham nearly sacrificed his son, where the Muslim founder led Abraham, Moses and Jesus in prayers as the last of God's prophets. That rock is now said to sit in the Dome of the Rock, its golden roof gleaming above the Old City skyline. Since Muslims began construction at the site in the seventh century, Haram al-Sharif, now controlled by an Islamic trust, has been an almost constant source of tension between Muslims and Jews.

"(CNN) -- It's probably been a few years since you packed your books and lunch in a bag, kissed your mom at the door and stumbled off to grade school. But if you've got a friend traveling to Japan, you might soon find yourself slinging an old-timey book bag over your shoulders. Randoseru, Japan's traditional schoolchild's backpack, has become the latest must-buy souvenir in Japan. The randoseru is a mandatory item for first-year elementary school kids in Japan. Made primarily of leather, the simple, boxy backpack is known for its sturdiness and is usually expected to last a student through his or her first six years of school. Its popularity among foreigners gained traction earlier this year when Zooey Deschanel was spotted in New York sporting a red randoseru. It's not the first time Deschanel's taste in backwear has spawned an unlikely trend. In 2012, she was seen wearing a Fjallraven rucksack -- a hipster schoolbag brand from Sweden -- and a fashion mini-wave was born. Randoseru sales up . In addition to becoming a topic of conversation on talk shows in Japan, the photo of Deschanel and her randoseru made the rounds on the internet. In April, Yorozu and Nagomi souvenir shops at Kansai International Airport in Osaka began stocking the bags in response to a sudden and unexpected demand from tourists. Yorozu tells CNN that the shop now sells about 120 randoseru each month. Chinese and Taiwanese parents and grandparents are among the biggest buyers, but travelers from other countries have been snatching them up, as well. Seiban, a randoseru manufacturer, has also seen an increase in foreign shoppers at its randoseru shop in Tokyo's Harajuku area. The company says it's considering hiring more foreign-language-speaking staff to accommodate the demand, according to the Japan Times. Randoseru typically cost between $120 and $600. How long the randoseru trend lasts is anybody's guess. Probably at least until Deschanel is spotted toting her stuff in an egg basket, toolbox or whatever's next.

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton got herself into a frenzy of controversy as a result of an interview with The Atlantic in which she took some shots at President Obama's foreign policy. Clinton said that ""Don't do stupid stuff,"" an infamous off-the-record quote from the President, didn't cut it as an ""organizing"" principle in foreign policy. Although she had been relatively silent about her differences with the Commander in Chief, her comments triggered a firestorm from liberal Democrats who felt that this sounded like the same old Clinton, the politician who they had so disliked in 2008. President Obama's supporters fired back. David Axelrod rebuked Hillary through a tweet: ""Just to clarify,"" he wrote, reminding people of her infamous vote authorizing the use of force in Iraq, ""Don't do stupid stuff' means stuff like occupying Iraq in the first place, which was a tragically bad decision."" Hillary called Obama to apologize for any harm her interview might have done the President and both attended a party in Martha's Vineyard, where Obama was having what CNN commentator Jeffrey Toobin called his ""vacation from hell."" It's not known if they did indeed ""hug it out,"" as predicted. All of this comes at a moment that Clinton is trying to regain her footing following the difficult roll-out of her book, ""Hard Choices,"" during which she made a number of comments, such as saying that she and her husband were ""dead broke"" upon leaving the White House, that offered fodder for her critics. Also, her lead in the polls over GOP rivals has narrowed. Opinion: Clinton, Obama both wrong . The most recent controversy over her differences with President Obama immediately sparked familiar concerns -- can Hillary Clinton win over the liberals in her party so that ""the base"" comes out in November 2016, should she decide to run? Can she prevent a primary challenge from a candidate like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren who stands closer to the left's position on many issues? The tension between Hillary Clinton and the Democratic base is nothing new. Indeed, both Hillary and Bill Clinton have always been at odds with the more liberal members of their party as they have been insistent on crafting a more coalitional approach to winning elections. Back when he ran for president in 1992, Bill Clinton infuriated liberals with his ""Sister Souljah moment"" when he made disparaging remarks about the activist at a conference of Jesse Jackson's Rainbow coalition. During his presidency, his support for certain kinds of deregulation and market-based approaches to public policy, as well as decision to end the federal welfare program, generated considerable heat from stalwarts in the party. Hillary Clinton has made similar moves, particularly when she served as senator from New York and worked hard to build bipartisan coalitions. Most famously, her vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq in 2002 became a symbol of her alliance with the centrist wing of the party. Hillary Clinton won't be able to remake herself into something that she is not. Trying to reinvent herself as part of a presidential run just won't work. When Vice President Al Gore sought to do this in 2000, his speeches fell flat. And Hillary Clinton's extensive record in public office leaves too much of a paper trail for her to pretend to be someone else. Instead, Clinton needs to make a compelling argument to the Democratic base about why she, as opposed to any other member of her party, is the best choice to run for president. The most important argument that she will bring to the table is that she can be a fierce and aggressive partisan fighter. Following eight years when many Democrats feel that they have watched President Obama get beat up by Republicans on Capitol Hill, Democrats are going to want someone who can fight and fight hard. Ever since her famous statements about the ""right-wing conspiracy"" that aimed to bring down her husband, Clinton has demonstrated repeatedly that she has the stomach for the kind of brutal partisan warfare that defines Washington. While Democrats in 2008 were still looking for someone who could break through the bipartisan noise, now they are searching for a politician who can accept the reality of Washington and take on their opponents by flexing their partisan muscle rather than avoiding it. Clinton's emerging platform about economic inequality is also one that all Democrats should be able to embrace. In recent months, Hillary Clinton has been telling audiences and reporters that if she ran, fighting inequality would be the major theme of her campaign. The inability and unwillingness of the nation's leaders to address this issue has been one of the greatest sources of frustration for liberals. Both on ethical grounds -- meaning that the current economic situation is not something Americans should tolerate -- as well as for partisan considerations -- meaning Democrats have traditionally been the party that has been associated with taking on this problem -- the time is ripe for an agenda centered on this theme. If Clinton is as serious about the issue of inequality as she sounds in recent speeches -- such as the one she made to the New America Foundation where she promised that this would be her main focus in the coming years -- her embrace of the issue could blur divisions between her and some of her critics. She can continue to use this theme to highlight to the left and center that they have much more in common than their bickering suggests, especially in contrast to the Republican agenda. Gender inequality has also been an issue that keeps getting pushed to the sidelines. Although the government has made some progress on issues like gender discrimination in employment and pay equity, Hillary Clinton is a candidate who has been deeply committed to these issues throughout her career and who could promise to go much further than any president has before her. The rights of women and girls around the world is ""the great unfinished business of the 21st century,"" she said at the Women in the World summit in 2013. Her victory in itself would be inspirational to the cause of gender equality, a watershed moment just like the election of the first African-American as president. While much of the left-center debate has revolved around how to deal with the power of Wall Street or how to use military power, gender equality can also serve as an issue to bridge the left and center. Opinion: Clinton dances between loyalty and self-interest . Finally, Hillary Clinton will need to talk more about the importance of internationalism to her foreign policy agenda as a way to highlight to the base that she is more than simply a ""hawk."" One of the great questions that came out of the Bush years was how much the United States should work in international alliances to pursue its goals. For the Bush administration, unilateralism was legitimate. Obama inspired many followers by insisting on a different way. As New York Times columnist Ross Douthat said about his policies in Libya in 2011, when Clinton was secretary of state, ""the Obama White House has shown exquisite deference to the very international institutions and foreign governments that the Bush administration either steamrolled or ignored."" He has not always lived up to those goals, as has been evident with the use of drone airstrikes. Regardless, overall the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton did stick to an internationalist strategy and she can make a commitment to this approach as a defining aspect of her vision. In the Washington Post, Aaron David Miller explained why foreign policy would not have been that different had Clinton won the presidency in 2008. Surveying all the hot button issues, such as Israel and Syria, he finds that the differences between them are exaggerated: ""They both are transactors, not ideological transformers â€” smart, pragmatic centrists largely coloring inside the lines in a world of long shots and bad options. In other words, there's no need for them to 'hug it out' on foreign policy. Both parties have often succeeded when politicians find issues that can unite the different wings of their party. Historian Meg Jacobs (full disclosure: my wife) has shown that Franklin Roosevelt -- without remaking himself into a far-left Democrat -- championed policies to boost the purchasing power of industrial workers as an issue that could bring together the party. During the 1960s, LBJ did the same with health care for the elderly, while Ronald Reagan used tax cuts and anti-communism to achieve these goals in the 1980s. George W. Bush achieved a similar effect with the fight against terrorism following 9/11. Making peace with the Democratic base will be one of Hillary Clinton's greatest challenges if she is going to run for the presidency. Without trying to be someone she is not, Clinton must figure out how to make the case that the Democratic Party can stand united behind her.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A Canadian couple living in a city close to China's border with North Korea are under investigation for the suspected theft of state secrets, state media said Tuesday. Kevin and Julia Garratt, who run a cafe in the northeastern city of Dandong, are suspected of stealing information about China's ""military and national defense research,"" according to a brief report released by China's official news agency Xinhua. It is not clear whether the pair have been detained. Calls to their cafÃ©, Peter's Coffee House, were not answered on Tuesday morning. Xinhua said that the State Security Bureau in Dandong was investigating the case. Officials at the Ministry of Public Security in Dandong, when contacted by CNN, said they were not aware of the situation. The couple had been living in China since 1984 and had been running the coffeehouse, named after their youngest son, since 2008, according to Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper. Peter Garrett, who still lives in China, told Canadian broadcaster CBC that he was taken in for questioning by authorities on Tuesday. He called his parents' arrest ""ridiculous,"" and, alluding to suspicions that the action taken against his parents might have been motivated by their religious convictions, played down their evangelism. ""My parents are Christians, yes, and they don't hide that,"" the 21-year-old told CBC's ""As it happens"" radio show. ""But they're not doing anything against the Chinese government or trying to proselytize or anything like that."" The couple's other son, Simeon, lives in Canada. He told Hong Kong's South China Morning Post that the accusation of ""stealing state secrets on China's military and national defense research"", was ""wildly absurd"" and ""crazy."" He described his parents as ""openly Christian"" and said that they were involved in sending food aid to North Korea. He told the newspaper that the accusations ""(sound) like something somebody made up,"" he said. ""I really don't know why. It's just so absurd.""

"(CNN) -- Events are unfolding at a rapid pace in Ferguson, Missouri. The city has been in turmoil since August 9, when a white city police officer fatally shot an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, in the middle of a street. Protesters and law enforcement officers have clashed in the streets. Here are the latest developments for Tuesday: . Another night of violence: . Once again, peaceful protests gave way to angry confrontations with police late Monday night into early Tuesday. After a handful of protesters threw rocks, bottles and Molotov cocktails, security forces responded with tear gas and stun grenades. Most of the demonstrators, however, tried to keep the peace. St. Louis County jail officials said at least 77 people were arrested, the vast majority of them on refusal to disperse charges. Some of them came from as far away as New York and California. Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, told CNN there were 50 to 60 arrests. Michael Brown's family: . The late teenager's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told NBC's ""Today"" show that the only way to end the unrest is ""justice"" -- which her family and their supporters have repeatedly tied to the arrest of the police officer who killed Brown. ""Justice will bring peace, I believe,"" McSpadden said. The family's attorney, Benjamin Crump, also announced that Brown's funeral will be held Monday. Criminal proceedings: . A grand jury could begin to hear testimony as early as Wednesday from witnesses, according to Ed Magee, a spokesman for the St. Louis County prosecutor's office. They'll ultimately decide whether or not to return an indictment against Darren Wilson, the police officer who killed Brown. Federal investigation: . U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder will visit Ferguson on Wednesday, in part to check on the investigation being handled by the Justice Department's civil rights division and the local U.S. Attorney's Office. In an op-ed in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Holder said that a number of federal prosecutors and about 40 FBI agents have already been tasked with looking into the case. He said that hundreds of people have been interviewed and a team of medical examiners will conduct a second autopsy. Prosecuting attorney protest: . Dozens protested Tuesday outside the office of St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, demanding that he recuse himself in the case. The Mound City Bar Association -- a Missouri-based organization that calls itself ""one of the oldest black bar associations west of the Mississippi River"" -- did the same in a statement. Some residents and community leaders claim McCulloch has deep ties to the police and has favored law enforcement in criminal cases. Yet the prosecutor has given no indications that he'll step away. School closures: . The situation remains so unstable that the Ferguson-Florissant School District said it is canceling classes for the rest of the week. Two nearby districts -- Jennings and Riverview Gardens -- opted to remain closed again Tuesday as well, according to CNN affiliate KMOV. In light of the closure, the Ferguson-Florissant School District is offering food assistance -- in the form of sack lunches -- to children and teenagers at five elementary schools between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests . The investigation: . St. Louis County police are looking into Brown's shooting. President Obama has the Justice Department, including the FBI, looking into the case as well. The police officer: . Darren Wilson, 28, who has six years on the force with no disciplinary issues on his record, is on paid administrative leave. If he returns to duty, he would have to undergo two psychological evaluations, authorities said. He was briefly taken to the hospital after the confrontation with Brown for treatment of an injury that left his face swollen, according to the Ferguson police chief. Wilson has garnered more and more public support in recent days. That includes a rally held for him in St. Louis and a fundraising effort that had raised more than $36,000 from nearly 1,000 people as of Tuesday. Michael Brown's family: . They've hired lawyers and expressed outrage at how the police have handled things, including Friday's simultaneous release of the officer's name and surveillance video from the day of the shooting that showed a man identified in police documents as Brown roughing up a convenience store clerk while purportedly stealing cigars. The family and critics of the department have accused police of trying to damage Brown's character. Magazine: The Aftermath in Ferguson .

"New York (CNN) -- The daughter of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was arrested after police said she shoplifted items at a cosmetic store. Caroline Giuliani, 20, was charged with one count of petty larceny after the incident at a Sephora skincare and makeup store Wednesday, the New York Police Department said. She is the younger of Giuliani's two children with his ex-wife, Donna Hanover, a television reporter and actress. Since his public divorce from Hanover and his marriage to Judith Nathan, Giuliani's relationship with his children has been strained, The New York Times reported in March 2007. He missed his son's high school graduation and Caroline's plays, The Times reported. That year, when Giuliani was seeking the Republican nomination for president, Caroline Giuliani's Facebook profile listed her as part of a group that supported then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama's presidential bid. After Slate.com emailed her about it, she immediately left the group, the website reported. In August 2007, Giuliani talked about his daughter at a campaign stop in Clear Lake, Iowa. ""My daughter I love very much,"" Giuliani said. ""I have great respect for her, and I'm really proud of her. And I don't comment on children because I want to give them the maximum degree of privacy. I think children in situations like this deserve to have the maximum degree of privacy. And the best way to preserve that is, except to point out that you love them and care about them and you're very, very proud of them, just don't comment about it."" Sephora representatives declined to comment. Giuliani's office did not return calls Wednesday.

"Miami (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton rolled out a new addition to her usual stump speech geared towards women empowerment on Thursday: Her new granddaughter Charlotte. ""I think my granddaughter has just as much God-given potential as a boy born in that hospital on the same day,"" the former Secretary of State said at the Commercial Real Estate Women Network Convention in Miami. Bill and Hillary Clinton became grandparents last week when their only daughter, Chelsea, gave birth to Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky on Friday, Sept. 26 in New York City. While it is obvious that that line is new for Hillary Clinton -- the baby was just born last week -- she was more overt in mentioning her granddaughter as a way to drive home her points. Clinton's speech both opened and closed with a mention of her new granddaughter. Photos: See grandparents with baby . When the former secretary of state took the stage, a woman shouted, ""You look beautiful!"" Clinton laughed and said, ""I think it is a grandmother glow."" ""She is doing great,"" Clinton said of Charlotte. ""She is the most perfect, most beautiful, smartest five day old you will ever know."" After delivering a speech that stressed the importance offering an equal playing field to women, Clinton closed her speech stating that with the right policies, her vision of equal pay, paid leave and affordable child care could be attained. Clinton's midterm campaign schedule . That, Clinton said, is ""the kind of country I want my granddaughter growing up in."" Charlotte was also on the minds of many of the attendees -- and participants -- in Thursday's conference. While on stage with Clinton, Judy Nitsch, the president of CREW, asked what advice she will have for Charlotte when she gets older. ""One is do the very best you can at everything you do... but learn from your mistake and your failures,"" Clinton said. ""Second, be kind. Try to find a time for kindness every single day."" Her last piece of advice was something, Clinton said, she hoped to model for her new granddaughter. ""Find something you are passionate about, that you love to do,"" Clinton said. ""And again, pursue it. It can be anything, it can be a sports, it can be the arts, it can be service. Find something that you really feel invested in.""","Clinton repeatedly mentioned her granddaughter in her speech Thursday .

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court Thursday allowed four states to prohibit same-sex unions -- a decision that could force the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the issue. In a 2-1 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed lower court rulings in Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee and Kentucky that struck down same-sex marriage bans. ""When the courts do not let the people resolve new social issues like this one, they perpetuate the idea that the heroes in these change events are judges and lawyers,"" Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote in the ruling. ""Better in this instance, we think, to allow change through the customary political processes, in which the people, gay and straight alike, become the heroes of their own stories by meeting each other not as adversaries in a court system but as fellow citizens seeking to resolve a new social issue in a fair-minded way,"" Sutton wrote. The ruling . Sutton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, said that it's not the responsibility of the judicial branch of government to make ""such a fundamental change to such a fundamental social institution."" ""Process and structure matter greatly in American government,"" Sutton wrote. ""Our judicial commissions did not come with such a sweeping grant of authority, one that would allow just three of usâ€”just two of us in truthâ€”to make such a vital policy call for the thirty-two million citizens."" Judge Deborah L. Cook joined Sutton's decision, while Senior Circuit Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey dissented. ""This is a very important decision from the federal court of appeals in Cincinnati, which disagreed with every other circuit court that has decided this case so far,"" said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""[The court said] there is not a constitutional right to same-sex marriage."" Daughtrey said that Cook and Sutton's decision read more like a piece of political philosophy than a court decision that grappled with a constitutional question. ""Instead of recognizing the plaintiffs as persons, suffering actual harm as a result of being denied the right to marry where they reside or the right to have their valid marriages recognized there,"" Daughtrey said, ""my colleagues view the plaintiffs as social activists who have somehow stumbled into federal court."" 'They can't duck it anymore' In October, the Supreme Court announced it would not hear appeals to same-sex marriage cases filed by a handful of states -- effectively paving the way for same-sex unions to become legal in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin. A handful of states later followed suit. The high court's decision left the door open for future challenges -- such as one that could result from Thursday's decision. Missouri judge overturns state's ban on same-sex marriage . Many observers of the high court said they believed it did not take up same-sex marriage cases because there seemed to be a consensus on the issue on the circuit court level since the Supreme Court struck down the federal law that defined marriage as between one man and one woman -- the Defense of Marriage Act. ""[The ruling] sets up an almost-certain fight before the Supreme Court,"" Toobin said. ""They can't duck it anymore."" The American Civil Liberties Union said it will appeal the appeals court's decision to the high court. ""We believe it's wholly unconstitutional to deny same sex couples and their families access to the rights and respect that all other families receive,"" Chase Strangio, staff attorney in the ACLU LGBT Project, said in a statement. ""We will be filing for Supreme Court review right away and hope that through this deeply disappointing ruling we will be able to bring a uniform rule of equality to the entire country."" This ruling is the first by a federal appeals court to uphold a state's same-sex marriage ban since DOMA. The Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative organization, praised the decision. ""The people of every state should remain free to affirm marriage as the union of a man and a woman in their laws,"" ADF senior counsel Byron Babione said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- It all comes down to this: 11 years later, the front door was unlocked. When Oscar Gonzalez jumped the White House fence late last month, he should have been just another statistic. A mentally ill man who was doing what a handful of others do every year, get onto the White House lawn and find themselves tackled by guards or brought down by dogs or fired upon by snipers. But this time it was different. The President and first family weren't home, the snipers didn't shoot. It's still not clear where the dogs were or why there was no Uniformed Division officer at the North Portico door. But the door was unlocked and the reason why can be traced directly back to the beginning of the disintegration of protocols for what the Secret Service once did better than any other agency in the world: protect the principal. Toward the end of the 1990s, there was turmoil in senior management, which saw new Secret Service directors come and go. There were also high-level retirements -- especially Presidential Protective Division agents who had lived through March 30, 1981, the assassination attempt on President Reagan. These were men and women who knew what it was to fail. In the wake of that incident, the Secret Service had upped the ante with new plans and a revised agenda, which had included working in closer proximity to the President, increasing the intensity in the levels of protection and paying closer attention to the minutest details. They had also learned to deal better with the presidential staff, who are always looking to break the President loose from his shackles for the sake of the next great photo opportunity. It worked for a while. But shortly after 9/11--11 years ago, in 2003--George W. Bush made the colossal mistake of uprooting the Secret Service from its rightful home in the Department of the Treasury, where it had been since 1865, throwing a proud tradition out the window and dropping it into the hodgepodge mess that was, and still is, the Department of Homeland Security. It was like yanking a great old oak tree up from the roots and shoving it into the ground somewhere else. The great oak slowly began to wither. What was once a quasi-independent agency was treated like just another bureaucracy that had to defend its turf and fight for every nickel against the rest of this new and increasingly dysfunctional family. Morale suffered and so did efficiency. You saw it in 2003, when the Bush White House staff cooked up the highly dangerous and totally unnecessary publicity stunt of landing the President on an aircraft carrier in a fixed-wing plane. That scheme ran head-first into everything the Secret Service used to stand for. The President and the staff were doing this their way. The Secret Service is charged by Congress with protecting the life of the President; it is not his choice whether or how he is protected. You saw it again in December 2008 at the Bush press conference in Baghdad, when an Iraqi journalist threw his shoe at the President. Bush ducked. The journalist threw his other shoe. And no agents appear anywhere near the President. In fact, the agent who suddenly showed up next to him does not grab the President and pull him away, he watches other men tackle the journalist. By the time President Obama came along, the lack of proximity and intensity was startling. This goes beyond the phony signer at Nelson Mandela's funeral, agents with hookers at Cartagena or drunk agents at a hotel in Holland. This is a couple of reality show wannabes getting into the White House for a formal reception, without an invitation. This is the President at the Martin Luther King ""I Have A Dream"" remembrance in 2013, standing alone and exposed in the middle of the Lincoln Memorial, in front of tens of thousands of people, and there isn't an agent within 30 feet of him. This is the President working rope lines, with plenty of agents present, but none of them in very tight proximity, holding onto him, the way they did with Reagan. Nor are the agents intensely working the crowd -- ""May I see your hands, please... hands... please show me your hands..."" the way they did with Reagan. This is the President speaking from a stage with 100 people behind him, and no agents right there to grab him if something happens, with no clear exit to get him out of there if something happens, because all those people behind him will panic and run for the same exit. This is a man jumping the White House fence with a knife, and bullets in his car, after having been on the Secret Service's list of people already interviewed as a possible threat to the President. It's a man with a gun riding in an elevator with the President at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is some crazy taking shots at the White House, and no one reporting it for days. Secret Service director resigns . The Secret Service agents who protect this President are the best and brightest. They make unbelievable personal sacrifices to keep the President safe. And like him, they too have been let down. They've been let down by senior management. And they've been let down by time, because without a tradition of passing stories on to the next generation, memories fade and ""the way it used to be"" is eventually forgotten. It's time to return the Secret Service to Treasury, where it traditionally has belonged, because at Treasury, there was real oversight. It's also time to bring into the senior ranks men and women who understand that proximity and intensity and attention to the minutest details truly matters. These must be men and women who understand and appreciate that those who served before them protecting Ronald Reagan set the gold standard, that the gold standard is an absolute minimum, and anything less -- like an unlocked door at the White House -- can all too quickly look like November 22, 1963.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Wednesday his administration will respond to new Ebola cases ""in a much more aggressive way,"" taking charge of the issue after a second Texas health care worker was diagnosed with the disease. Obama scrapped plans to attend Democratic fund-raisers in New Jersey and Connecticut on Wednesday afternoon so that he could huddle with Cabinet members and officials who are leading the administration's Ebola response. The meeting came amid questions about how two health care workers could have contracted Ebola in a country said to have strict protocols in place -- and with one of those Ebola victims having flown on a commercial jet Monday. Afterward, the President sought to tamp down fears of of an outbreak of the disease within the United States -- saying that he shook hands with, hugged and kissed nurses who'd treated an American doctor who contracted Ebola in Africa, and felt safe. Obama acknowledged that even foolproof plans don't work when local health care providers don't know how to carry them out -- and said his administration will make sure ""certain local hospitals that may not have that experience are walked through that process as carefully as possible."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will have ""SWAT teams"" ready to send to hospitals where future cases are discovered, he said. Obama has spoken with the heads of Japan, Germany, Italy, France and England to prod them to pump more resources into combating the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Doing so, he said, ""is an investment in our own public health. It's not simply charity."" The heightened attention came as Republicans pummeled the president. Rep. Tom Marino of Pennsylvania said the situation ""is beginning to spiral out of control,"" and said CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden should resign. ""The reports my colleagues and I have received are utterly unacceptable and the information provided to the public has been cryptic and in some cases misleading,"" Marino said. ""This has provided a false sense of security to many of our citizens."" Sen. John Thune of South Dakota and House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania said the United States should ban people who live in or have visited West Africa from entering the country. House Speaker John Boehner said the United States should consider a travel ban ""along with any other appropriate actions as doubts about the security of our air travel systems grow."" ""The administration must be able to assure Americans that we will stop the spread here at home,"" Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said in a statement. ""We will continue to press the administration for better information about what steps will be taken to protect the American people, including our troops, from this deadly virus,"" he said. ""And we will work with the administration on appropriate policy options that will help stop the spread of this horrific disease both here in the United States and around the globe."" State-level officials who'd insisted they had the situation under control changed their plans, as well. Texas Gov. Rick Perry -- lambasted by Democrats in his state for leaving on a trade mission to Europe this week -- decided to scrap the last three days of his trip and return to his state Thursday to lead the state's Ebola response in person. Perry said Wednesday that he speaks daily with Dr. Brett Giroir, who heads an infectious disease task force that Perry formed earlier this month, and Dr. David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services. Those two are helming the state's efforts. ""This is the first time that our nation has had to deal with a threat such as this. Everyone working on this challenge -- from the medical professionals at the bedside to the public health officials addressing containment of the infection -- is working to end the threat posed by this disease,"" Perry said in a statement. ""These individuals are keeping the health and safety of Texans and the needs of the patients as their most critical tasks,"" he said. ""Every relevant agency at the local, state and national levels is working to support these individuals.""","President Obama meets with Cabinet members and health officials .

"(CNN) -- Mark your calendars: The midterm elections aren't yet decided, but there's already a date scheduled for a 2016 presidential debate. With slightly more than two years until a new president is chosen, The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation announced Thursday its plans to host a televised debate for Republican primary candidates on Sept. 16, 2015 at the Reagan Library in California. ""Ronnie would be so pleased to know that his presidential library continues to attract America's leaders to discuss the future of the country he loved so dearly,"" former First Lady Nancy Reagan said in a release from the Reagan Foundation, an organization geared toward promoting the GOP icon's national legacy. ""I can't think of a better way to honor my husband than to keep the tradition of Reagan Library-hosted debates alive."" But don't get too excited for a heated GOP faceoff: New rules from the Republican National Committee plan to limit the number of primary debates in the upcoming presidential contest after a series of contentious debates rattled the party leading up to 2012. In a statement, the RNC's Sean Spicer said the list of sanctioned debates will be announced later in the year. ""We are focused on Tuesday's election,"" he said. Although no Republicans have officially announced a 2016 White House bid, many potential contenders have made themselves known in recent months by stumping for midterm candidates. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, for example, has made four trips to Iowa in recent months to support GOP candidates there. And Republican U.S. Senator Rand Paul recorded robocalls for a Florida Republican in a tight race to maintain his House seat. Both politicians are regarded as 2016 frontrunners -- that is, should they decide to throw their hats in the ring.","A GOP presidential primary debate has been scheduled for Sept. 2015 .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- California corrections officials released an updated prison photograph of Charles Manson on Wednesday, showing the balding and graying 74-year-old, complete with his iconic forehead swastika. A new photo of Charles Manson shows his graying beard and his legendary swastika tattooed into his forehead. The picture was taken as part of a regular update of inmate images at the California State Prison in Corcoran, about 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles, where Manson is serving a life term. The release of the picture comes ahead of the 40th anniversary of the ""Manson family"" killings in August 1969. Manson and four others -- Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, Charles ""Tex"" Watson and Leslie Van Houten -- were convicted of murder and other charges in connection with a two-night rampage that left pregnant actress Sharon Tate and seven others dead. Van Houten, who was 19 at the time of the killings, was convicted in the murders of Leno LaBianca, a wealthy grocery store owner, and his wife, Rosemary. Van Houten was accused of stabbing Rosemary LaBianca 14 to 16 times in the back. Van Houten was also convicted of conspiracy in Tate's death and four others at the actress' Beverly Hills home. Tate was 8½ months pregnant, and the baby also died in the attack. Manson, Atkins and Krenwinkel were convicted for those murders. All members of the ""Manson family"" have been up for parole multiple times over the past four decades, but it has never been granted. Atkins, who has been declared terminally ill, was denied a compassionate release from prison in July 2008.  Atkins has told police she was one of the people who stabbed Tate and scrawled the word ""pig"" in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with director Roman Polanski. In May 2008, authorities dug for bodies at the Inyo County, California, ranch where Manson and his followers once lived, after police learned that testing had indicated human remains might be buried there. According to authorities, nothing was found.","Prison officials release updated photo of convicted murderer Charles Manson .

"Washington (CNN) -- A top Colorado Democratic donor has had enough of Sen. Mark Udall's campaign focus on women's reproductive rights. As Udall (D-Colo.) delivered a line on the issue in his stump speech Sunday during the final hours of a tight campaign against Republican challenger Cory Gardner, a heckler interrupted by shouting: ""That's not the only thing you stand for! Jesus Christ!"" An account of the exchange was detailed by The Guardian. According to the newspaper, Udall responded: ""I'm sorry?"" And then the man shouted again: ""That's not the only thing you stand for!"" The Guardian identified the heckler as Leo Beserra, who became a millionaire on Wall Street and for years has been a hefty donor to Colorado Democrats. He's given at least $9,800 to Democrats this year alone. He's far from the first person to criticize Udall's campaign for its focus on the issue -- largely targeting Gardner's previous support (he reversed his stance this year) for a ""personhood"" measure that would have had the effect of outlawing abortion. The issue could help Udall turn out votes among women, a key Democratic constituency, who live in Denver's suburbs. They could be key in a neck-and-neck race: A Quinnipiac poll released Monday showed Gardner with a 45% to 43% lead over Udall. But the state's largest newspaper, The Denver Post, called Udall's campaign ""obnoxious"" in an editorial endorsing Gardner in the Senate race. ""Rather than run on his record, Udall's campaign has devoted a shocking amount of energy and money trying to convince voters that Gardner seeks to outlaw birth control despite the congressman's call for over-the-counter sales of contraceptives,"" the newspaper editorialized. ""Udall is trying to frighten voters rather than inspire them with a hopeful vision. His obnoxious one-issue campaign is an insult to those he seeks to convince."" Udall's campaign argued the idea that the campaign has focused solely on women's reproductive rights is a ""misunderstanding."" Udall spokesman Chris Harris said the campaign has aired TV ads on immigration reform, flood recovery, veterans' affairs, the National Security Agency and more. He said on Monday, Udall was at a press conference with several other top Colorado Democratic officials on immigration reform. ""This campaign has focused on a wide range of issues. Those who imply otherwise are simply wrong,"" he said. Still, Harris defended the campaign's efforts to highlight women's reproductive rights, calling it an area of ""fundamental difference"" between Udall and Gardner. ""These are not simply social issues, as many people talk about,"" he said. ""They are fundamental issues of freedom that affect every single aspect of not just a woman's but a family's lives, be it economic, professional and personal.""","Democratic Sen.

"(CNN) -- Let's see how far this goes without making a dead parrot reference. Wish me luck. Monty Python's Flying Circus cannot be stopped. And, apparently, not even contained. The five surviving members of the British-based renegade comedy troupe announced this week they were getting the band back together for live performances, their first together in more than a decade. In the funny business world, this is equivalent to the Beatles getting back together. And the Rolling Stones, too. (Oh, wait. They've never broken up exactly, have they? Rewind.) See what I just did? I broke the pattern, digressed from form -- and did so with unapologetic silliness. If you want to know why this Python get-together has aroused such good feeling from everyone, you have to begin by knowing that this is how Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin went about their business back when their BBC series began in 1969. The Pythons stretched, tugged and bent the TV variety-revue format into shapes unimagined in the medium except by such American pioneers of surreal TV as Ernie Kovacs. Imagine, for instance, having three clueless and crass Spanish Inquisitors burst into an English drawing room for a routine and using them as a running gag through other routines on the same episode up to and including the closing credits. Monty Python did that bit and many more, using unlikely elements, like bicycle repairmen, hapless superheroes, dotty old ladies, bookshops with naughty dentists, cheese shops with dancing men in derby hats and lots and lots of Spam. ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" made landfall -- or, rather, pratfall -- on American public television stations in the early 1970s, and its unapologetic anarchy and snide surrealism triumphed here. Oh, there were some who didn't get the jokes, believing the blithe zaniness of the Pythons' humor to be irrelevant to the Vietnam War and on behalf of women's rights, black empowerment, gay pride and other white-hot issues of that polarized time. What these solemn spoilsports didn't, or couldn't understand at the time is that sociopolitical conflicts come and go, but a dirty fork and a sissy lumberjack are things of lasting consequence and sublimity. Those who weren't there at the time -- and you know who you are -- can see for yourselves what all the giggling was about thanks in large part to YouTube's Monty Python Channel, which the troupe initiated in 2008 as a site for showcasing its vintage BBC sketches as well as scenes from such classic Python films as 1975's ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" 1979's ""Life of Brian"" and 1983's ""The Meaning of Life."" With Python-esque faux grouchiness, the channel urged its viewers to ""click on the links, buy our movies and TV shows, and soften our pain from being ripped off all these years."" They're kidding, of course. At least, they seem to be. But I'm speculating that one of the reasons the band is getting back together (without Chapman, who died in 1989) is partly to take advantage of this fresh wave of digital fans who've never seen them act silly in public, but have likely wasted time at work or home watching the ""Flying Lesson"" routine in which Jones walks into an office seeking a pilot's license and is instead goaded by Chapman, suspended in midair, to flap his arms and jump off a desk? Or to watch Palin walk into a formal office in search of an argument and find himself in a pointless series of contradictions with a stuffy Cleese? Or to watch those same two gentleman in riotous dispute over the sentience of a Norwegian blue parrot . ... (Almost made it! Dang!) The only question this week's news offers is whether these now-septuagenarian crazy men are still limber enough to bring fresh surprises to the table. I'm going to go with ... probably. Which is the best I can do until I see for myself whether Jones and Palin can still work their old-lady outfits.

"Mursitpinar, Turkey (CNN) -- Fighting over ISIS's attempt to seize the Syrian town of Kobani on the border with Turkey remained at a stalemate Saturday, with Kurdish fighters claiming they were fending off the Islamic militants' siege. The battle over Kobani, an enclave for Kurds, is significant because ISIS is trying to claim a vast swath of land from its self-declared capital of Raqqa, Syria, on the Euphrates River to the Turkish border, more than 60 miles away. U.S.-led coalition airstrikes in northern Syria killed at least 35 ISIS extremists Saturday, including five in Kobani, also known as Ayn al-Arab, said the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group that collects casualty information. The other 30 ISIS fighters were killed in in the town of Shadadi in the Hasakah province, which is about a 35-mile drive south of Kobani, the monitoring group said. On the Turkish side of the border at Mursitpinar, checkpoints were more numerous than usual, and many people were said to be trying to cross the border to enter Kobani to help their fellow Kurds fighting against the ISIS militants. At one point, however, the crowds were dispersed when tear gas was used, witnesses told CNN. A water cannon was observed by CNN to be firing at random people. The smell of tear gas was also in the air. Across the border, in Kobani, the air had cleared of smoke that was evident in earlier fighting this week. Witnesses told CNN that several mortars landed on the Turkish soil Saturday, continuing a daily shelling. Marine lost in Persian Gulf might be first U.S. casualty in ISIS campaign . Kurdish fighters . Alan Minbic, a fighter with the Kurdish People's Protection Unit, or YPG, said ISIS maintained control Saturday of the southwest corner of Kobani, but YPG snipers held off an ISIS attempt to seize a strategic ridge overlooking Kobani. Mustafa Abdi, a media activist in Kobani, confirmed Minbic's account. In the overnight hours, clashes continued on the western side of Kobani, around an area called Tal Shair, which ISIS controls, Minbic said. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu vowed to help the Kurdish fighters defend Kobani from ISIS, also known as ISIL and the Islamic State. Thousands of civilians have fled the predominantly Kurdish city in northern Syria in recent days as ISIS forces apparently are seeking to create a direct route to the Syria-Turkish border. The Sunni extremist group's reported entry into the city on Friday came a day after Turkish lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to authorize military force against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Australia decided hours later to join the U.S.-led air campaign against ISIS in Iraq. ""We wouldn't want Kobani to fall,"" Davutoglu said. ""We welcomed our brothers who came from Kobani. We'll do whatever we can to prevent this from happening."" Vice President Joe Biden apologizes to Turkey; UAE mad, too . ISIS in Iraq faces U.S.-led airstrikes . For months, ISIS has been advancing, capturing portions of northern and eastern Syria and western and northern Iraq for what it says is its new Islamic state, or caliphate. In an effort to damage ISIS's movements, the U.S.-led coalition continued to bomb ISIS targets. In all, the coalition conducted nine airstrikes Friday and Saturday against ISIS targets in Syria, U.S. Central Command said. The forces used fighter aircraft and drones, CentCom said. The coalition carried out five airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq, officials said. Recent airstrikes in the Kirkuk area have killed nine people and injured 16 more, but it wasn't immediately clear how many of them were ISIS fighters, Iraqi security forces said. In the Sinjar area, 14 ISIS militants were killed in coalition airstrikes, Iraqi security forces said. But ISIS still remained in control of several areas, including portions of Hit and Kabisa, Iraqi security officials and witnesses said. Hit is a town along the Euphrates River about a 115-mile drive from Baghdad. The airstrikes in Iraq -- northeast of Fallujah, south of Rabiyah, north of Hit and Ramadi -- struck several ISIS targets, Central Command said. ISIS controls an Iraqi river town . But ISIS militants still controlled much of Hit, where there is no presence of the Iraqi army or local militias, and they also managed to control parts of Mohammadi, about seven mile southeast of Hit, without any resistance from the army or the security forces, according to accounts from witnesses and Iraqi officials. ISIS militants in Hit burned two police stations inside the city and the local council building, officials and witnesses said Saturday. Coalition fighter jets launched an air strike on Hit bridge, where ISIS militants have been positioned, the officials and witnesses said. For the third consecutive day Saturday, Hit has seen power outages and a stoppage to power generators because of a lack of fuel, according to witness and official accounts. In Syria, two of the coalition airstrikes hit south of Kobani and destroyed an armored personnel carrier, a vehicle and a small unit, all belonging to ISIS, Central Command said. Two strikes east of Kobani destroyed a vehicle, a building, three artillery positions and a large unit, all belonging to ISIS. Southwest of Ar Raqqah, a coalition airstrike damaged the Taqba Airfield, and another west of the same city destroyed an ISIS artillery piece, CentCom said. Two strikes southeast Deir Ezzor destroyed an ISIS tank and an ISIS vehicle, and a strike south of Al Hasakah destroyed an ISIS depot and logistics complex, Central Command said. Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates participated in the coalition airstrikes. All of the coalition aircraft involved returned safely. American held hostage by ISIS . On Saturday, UK Prime Minister David Cameron said that the death of British aid worker Alan Henning at the hands of ISIS was ""absolutely abhorrent"" and ""completely unforgivable."" A short video released by ISIS on Friday appeared to show Henning's beheading, with the killer blaming the death on the United Kingdom for joining the U.S.-led bombing campaign against the group. In that same video, ISIS threatened the life of hostage Peter Kassig, an American aid worker. Kassig's family released a YouTube video Saturday asking his captors to show mercy and free him. Referring to him as Abdul-Rahman -- a first name his family says he took, having converted to Islam while being held hostage -- father Ed Kassig said: ""We implore his captors to show mercy and use their power to let our son go."" Peter Kassig, 26, first went to the Middle East as a U.S. soldier and returned as a medical worker, feeling compelled to help victims of war. A native of Indiana, Peter Kassig founded Special Emergency Response and Assistance in 2012, a nongovernmental organization aiding Syrians fleeing the civil war there. In summer 2013, he moved its base of operations to Gaziantep, Turkey. Since 2012, he delivered food and medical supplies within and outside Syria and provided trauma care and training, his family said. But on October 1, 2013, he was ""detained"" on his way to Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria while performing a project for SERA, his family said.

"(CNN) -- Australian police arrested a 23-year-old man in Melbourne on Tuesday on suspicion of funding a U.S. citizen who went to fight in Syria. The Australian investigation was sparked by a tip-off from the FBI earlier this year, a police statement said. The man, who has not been named, is accused of providing about $12,000 to what he knew to be a terrorist organization. His arrest, in a joint operation by the Australian Federal Police and Melbourne Joint Counter Terrorism Team, came after searches at seven addresses in Melbourne suburbs. Police said there was no known link to an incident last week in which a teenage terror suspect, Numan Haider, was shot dead outside a police station in Endeavour Hills, Melbourne, after he stabbed two police officers. There was also no intelligence to suggest that the man arrested Tuesday in the Seabrook suburb was involved in planning a terror attack or that there was any risk to the community, police said. National Manager Counter Terrorism Neil Gaughan, of the Australian Federal Police, said the operation showed law enforcement was actively investigating all aspects of terrorism. ""We are acutely aware that to participate in overseas fighting, funds are required. In this case we will allege that the man was funding someone from the US. However who is being funded makes no difference,"" Gaughan said. ""Providing funding is equally criminal as actually traveling to participate and we will use all our resources to cut off the supply of funds to terrorists."" The suspect was due to appear before Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday. Australian PM: Public execution terror plot foiled . Terror threat level . Last week, the government introduced a new bill in parliament to imprison Australians found to be fighting abroad, or supporting terrorist actions. Formally called the ""Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill, the legislation includes new offenses for visiting countries on a no-go list issued by the government, without good reason. Civil liberty advocates have criticized the speed at which the new legislation has been introduced, calling for the Australian public and members of parliament to be given more time -- two months -- to have their say on the bill. On September 12, Australia lifted its terror threat level from ""medium"" to ""high,"" although at the time Prime Minister Tony Abbott said no specific threats had been made. A reading of ""high"" means a terrorist attack is considered ""likely."" Days later, more than 800 officers raided 15 homes and businesses across Sydney after investigations suggested suspects were planning ""a random attack on individuals,"" police said in a statement. Authorities claimed to have foiled plans to kidnap a member of the public, behead the victim and drape the body in an ISIS flag. Lone wolf? Australian police shoot dead teen 'terror suspect' Home-grown terrorism fears . Authorities believe around 60 Australians are fighting in the conflict in Syria and Iraq, with around 100 more working in support roles within Australia. Officials have in the past expressed fears about ""home-grown terrorism,"" the likelihood that Australians recruited to fight foreign wars could bring their training and philosophies home to carry out local attacks. It's believed that about 20 fighters have already returned to Australia. Australia is backing the U.S.-led campaign of airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq with personnel and aircraft.

"(CNN) -- Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen repeatedly accused Republican challenger Scott Brown of ""fear-mongering"" -- on Ebola, ISIS and more -- in the second debate of a New Hampshire race that's key to determining which party will control the Senate. But Brown shot back that his are ""rational fears"" shared by a majority of Americans. The race a dead heat. A CNN/ORC International poll released Thursday found Shaheen with 49 percent support to Brown's 47 percent -- well inside its margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. It could turn on whether Shaheen is able to keep on her side voters who have turned on Obama. His approval rating dropped to 39 percent in New Hampshire -- which has driven Brown's efforts to connect Shaheen with the president. And that's what Brown tried to do, using every issue possible -- illegal immigration, Ebola, ISIS and Obamacare among them -- to try to nationalize the debate. Shaheen, meanwhile, cast Brown as a political opportunist and turned to Democrats' bread-and-butter economic topics like equal pay and raising the minimum wage. Here are six lines that showcased the debate's top issues: . Scott Brown: ""She calls it fear-mongering; I call it rational fear."" The day another potential Ebola case was reported -- this time, a doctor in New York -- the two sparred over the Obama administration's handling of the threat. Brown called for a ban on travel from the West African epicenter of the outbreak. He blasted Obama's appointment of Ron Klain as the nation's Ebola response coordinator as someone ""with no experience in his field."" He criticized Shaheen for not voting to close the U.S. border with Mexico. And he complained that the New York doctor should have been quarantined when he returned to the United States. Brown even said the Ebola threat would be minimized if Republican Mitt Romney had been elected president. ""Had he been president, I feel he would have had a clear and concise plan. He would have reassured the American people,"" Brown said. Shaheen, meanwhile, criticized Brown for ""fear-mongering about this issue,"" and said neither she nor Brown have medical expertise on the issue. But Brown shot back that ""she calls it fear-mongering; I call it rational fear."" Jeanne Shaheen: ""I don't think it makes sense for the president to come to New Hampshire right now."" Just like he has through the entire race, Brown repeatedly tied Shaheen to Obama -- whose approval rating, a CNN/ORC International poll released Thursday found, is 39 percent in New Hampshire. The political damage that association can cause Shaheen was most clear when she said she didn't want Obama to campaign for her. ""The fact is, that there are big differences in this race between my opponent and me, and it's not just about the president,"" Shaheen said, repeatedly turning to issues like increasing the minimum wage and mandating equal pay. Brown said on a number of issues, Shaheen and Obama might as well be the same person. He said she's already supported the president's agenda for six years, and said she cast the deciding vote to approve Obama's signature health care law. ""There were 60 of us,"" Shaheen said, referring to the Senate's 60 Democrats at the time, all of whom supported Obamacare. ""Every one of us was a deciding vote."" Brown: ""There is a rational fear ... [of] criminal elements, terrorists, people with diseases coming through our border."" Illegal immigration appeared to be Brown's comfort zone. He repeatedly returned to the issue, asserting that weak border security could open the United States up to an influx of ISIS fighters, victims of the Ebola virus and more. He criticized Shaheen's support for the DREAM Act, for failing to crack down on undocumented immigrants who receive government benefits and for standing by as Obama moves toward executive action on immigration after the Nov. 4 election. He said he'd never support any bills that would ""actually legalize people that are here illegally, who are not entitled to the protections and/or the rights and privileges that have been earned by our citizens."" Shaheen, meanwhile, cast Brown's position as unworkable. ""The fact is,"" she said, ""if you want border security, then you should support comprehensive immigration reform."" She criticized Brown for voting in favor of a GOP budget that would have slashed homeland security spending, and for missing committee hearings on border security. Shaheen: ""We don't need to import a candidate who's going to outsource our jobs."" The Democrat landed two punches in one line -- hitting Brown, the former Massachusetts senator, for moving into his native state to mount another Senate campaign and then pivoting to economic issues. She pointed repeatedly to Brown's support for oil industry subsidies, accused him of doing the bidding of large corporate interests and even tried to latch Brown to the Koch brothers, the conservative political funding giants who she said have pumped $2.6 million into New Hampshire's race. The two debated Shaheen's zero rating with the National Federation of Independent Businesses -- with Brown repeatedly citing that figure and Shaheen dismissing it, arguing that the organization is funded by the Koch brothers. Moderator Wolf Blitzer pointed out that using Congressional Quarterly's scoring, Brown, while representing Massachusetts, voted with Obama 78 percent of the time. ""Well when the president does something right, I'll support him,"" he said. ""As an independent senator, I can do that."" Brown: ""We've taken the greatest fighting force off the table."" Brown accused Obama -- and, by extension, Shaheen -- of blowing the United States' chances of defeating ISIS in Iraq and Syria by insisting that ground forces won't be part of an effort that so far has included air strikes. ""What if air strikes don't work? Then what?"" Brown said. He pointed to a new book by former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta accusing Obama of ""half-steps and missteps, and as a result our allies don't trust us, our foes don't fear and respect us, it's been an incoherent policy."" Shaheen responded that the United States is ""building an international coalition"" that includes 60 partners, including some Arab countries. She looked for wiggle room, saying she would take sending ground troops to the region off the table ""right now."" ""I don't think we should be putting tens of thousands of American troops back in as an occupying force, and we should also not be talking about ISIS in a way that spreads fear and panic among our population,"" she said. ""That's just grandstanding."" Shaheen: ""We should make sure that people can make a living."" She tried to back Brown into a corner on whether he supports raising the minimum wage. Shaheen said women -- who support her over Brown -- would make up two-thirds of the beneficiaries of an increase in the minimum wage. National Democrats have called for a new figure of $10.10 per hour. ""This is one of the issues that distinguishes me from my opponent, because I have been supporting middle class families here,"" she said. ""I think it's now clear that he doesn't support that."" Brown said his mother worked minimum wage jobs, and that he did, as well, earning his first paychecks at a Dunkin' Donuts. He said he's supported increases in the past. But he didn't say whether he supports an increase now, instead accusing Obama and Shaheen of trying to ""dictate"" to businesses already burdened by overregulation. ""What's happening right now is another effort by the Obama administration, as supported by Sen. Shaheen, to just dictate to businesses what they're going to pay,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The gunman responsible for the terrorist attack in Ottawa last week was ""driven by ideological and political motives"" and made a video of himself, police said Sunday. Authorities have previously identified the gunman as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau. He opened fire Wednesday at Canada's National War Memorial and Parliament Hill, killing army reservist Cpl. Nathan Cirillo. The gunman was then shot and killed by security. The video was recorded just prior to the attack, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said in a statement. Authorities are conducting an analysis of that video and said they would not be releasing it at this time. They also provided a handful of other updates on their investigation: . -- Zehaf-Bibeau used a gun that was old and uncommon; . -- He carried a knife, which authorities believe was retrieved from his aunt's property; . -- Zehaf-Bibeau had worked in the oil fields in Alberta and saved his money; . -- Officials are looking into whether anyone else could have contributed to the attack. Zehaf-Bibeau had ties to jihadists in Canada who shared a radical Islamist ideology, including at least one who went overseas to fight in Syria, multiple U.S. sources said last week. He was a Canadian citizen who may have had dual Libyan-Canadian citizenship, according to RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson. The gunman had criminal records indicating infractions related to drugs and violence. Zehaf-Bibeau was applying for a passport -- an application that was under investigation -- at the time of the attack, Paulson said. ""I think the passport figured prominently in his motives,"" said the police commissioner. ""However, we have not come to ground completely on his motivations for this attack. But clearly, it's linked to his radicalization. Clearly, it's linked to his difficult circumstances.""","Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was ""driven by ideological and political motives""

"(CNN) -- The fiancee of Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber lived on property that was to be used for growing marijuana, and married an illegal immigrant for money during a period in her life when she was ""associating with the wrong kind of people and making mistakes,"" according to a statement she released Tuesday. Cylvia Hayes, 47, admitted to living on a property in Okanogan, Oregon, in 1997 that was supposed to become a marijuana growing operation, but she said it never materialized. ""I am not proud of that brief period of time - I was involved in an abusive relationship with a dangerous man,"" Hayes said. The man who sold the property to Hayes and her boyfriend told CNN affiliate KOIN that the couple stopped making payments. Public records show Hayes gave up her interest in the property in April 1998. Hayes said she did not put any money into the property. ""In the spring of 1998 I began to make plans to get away. In July 1998 I moved to Central Oregon and began building a life and career that I am very proud of,"" Hayes said in a statement. She runs an environmental consulting company. From 1997 until 2002 she was married on paper to an Ethiopian immigrant, a fact she said her husband-to-be didn't know about until it came to light last week. ""This is the most painful part for me,"" Hayes said in a news conference in Portland on Friday confirming the sham marriage. ""John Kitzhaber deserved to know the history of the person he was forming a relationship with. The fact that I did not disclose this to him meant that he has learned about this in the most public and unpleasant way."" Fraudulent green card marriages are a federal offense. Hayes said she needed the money at the time, when she was 29. ""The money I had received in July 1997 for entering a fraudulent marriage was used to purchase a laptop and pay school expenses,"" she said. Kitzhaber is running for re-election next month, and addressed his fiancee's actions during a gubernatorial debate Tuesday evening. ""What we know is that 17 years ago, before I know Cylvia and she knew me she was involved in some illegal activity. I wish it hadn't happened, but it did,"" Kitzhaber said. ""The fallout of that set of activities and how we deal with that fallout is really a personal matter between Cylvia and myself."" Kitzhaber has already served three nonconsecutive terms. The Democrat was first elected in 1994 and remained in office until 2003. In 2010, he was elected to a third term, and he's now seeking a fourth in a race that he has been expected to win. He won his last election with 65% of the vote. While Kitzhaber and Hayes aren't married, they've been a couple for more than a decade and engaged since this summer, according to local news reports. Hayes has been officially referred to as Oregon's first lady during Kitzhaber's latest term.","NEW: Oregon governor says his fiancee's past illegal activities are a private matter .

"(CNN) -- Tweeting about why her Tuesday night flight was delayed got Lisa Carter-Knight kicked off a JetBlue airplane, she claims. An hour after JetBlue Flight 760 was scheduled to depart Philadelphia for Boston, a fellow passenger joked about the aircraft's alcohol supply. Another passenger joked about wishing for a fully stocked bar on the flight, Carter-Knight told CNN affiliate WPVI. The pilot misunderstood the joke and took it to be an accusation that he had been drinking. ""The pilot ran out and said, 'That's it; everyone back up at the gate; I've been accused of being intoxicated,' "" Carter-Knight said. That's when she turned to Twitter. ""I went to Twitter to share my experience, not bad, just very strange, with my friends and my followers,"" she said. ""JetBlue staff and the pilot did not like that tonight, and so I'm standing here at 1 o'clock in the morning because I was denied access to the flight."" JetBlue says that's not true. ""The customer was not kicked off because of her tweets,"" JetBlue spokeswoman Tamara Young wrote in an email. ""There were other customers that also tweeted and boarded the plane. As we shared, it is not our practice to remove a customer for expressing criticism of their experience in any medium. This customer however was denied boarding due to unruly behavior and creating a disturbance by the gate area."" CNN reached out to Carter-Knight via Twitter but has not heard back. JetBlue confirmed that a customer accusation of the pilot being intoxicated delayed Flight 760 prior to departure. ""As a precautionary measure, a sobriety test was conducted. The test demonstrated the pilot was sober and as a result, he was cleared to perform his duties. Customers boarded the aircraft which departed PHL at 12:03am and arrived in BOS at 1:12am."" ""The decision to remove a customer from a flight is not taken lightly,"" Young said. ""If we feel a customer is not complying with safety instructions, exhibits objectionable behavior or causes conflict at the gate or on the aircraft, the customer will be asked to deplane or will be denied boarding especially if the crew feels the situation runs the risk of accelerating in the air.

"(CNN) -- Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, and now Syria and Iraq. The decade-plus duration of America's confrontation with al Qaedism offers lessons not only on how we battle extremist ideology but also how we should calibrate our expectations. The traditional goal in warfare is simple: Defeat the adversary by destroying its will and capability to pose a threat. Force the adversary to capitulate. With a nontraditional foe, it's not clear that we need to limit ourselves to traditional measures of victory. Containment could work. We know by now that in no cases have the adversary's radical ideology been defeated. The most striking successes, such as Indonesia's evisceration of the Jemaah Islamiya organization and African forces' push against Al-Shabaab in Somalia, have only limited the reach of al Qaedism but failed to fully stem the flow of recruits to al Qaeda affiliates or squelch the ideology that underpins its festering. We have too many reminders of the resilience of this particularly violent ideology to think that it can be eliminated. Despite counterterrorism successes, Jemaah Islamiya in Indonesia still lies dormant and remains potentially dangerous, as recent Indonesian arrests show. In Somalia, Al-Shabaab has been pushed out of large swaths of territory and its leader killed, but it is nowhere near finished in East Africa. French successes in Mali were stunning but have not come close to defeating al Qaedism in the Sahel. Despite these lessons, commentators across the political spectrum speak today about the defeat of an even larger, more geographically diverse, and more brutal adversary, in Syria and Iraq, as if somehow the lessons of the durability of al Qaeda ideology has proven brittle in other, equally complex, battlefields. It hasn't. We need to manage not just our expectations. Our rhetoric, too, matters more than we think. When we declare that we will defeat ISIS, what do we mean? What is a sufficient condition to declare victory? Unless we define that condition, we risk involving ourselves in yet another unending conflict. We cannot aim to eliminate Salafi jihadism. Not in one year or two, and probably not in one generation or two. The events of the past years -- both our combat in Iraq and the instability ushered in by the Arab Spring -- have created new grievances and vast ungoverned (or ungovernable) spaces in a region that is better armed than any other place on Earth. There is a more modest way forward, though, and one that has proven successful without overreaching. How about rolling back ISIS gains, confining it in and preventing the flow of fighters both into the battle area and back, as one goal? Yes, and that has already begun. Simply showing to its local adversaries that ISIS isn't invincible, that it folds under pressure, is an early win. And it isn't just American airpower that can accomplish this. Shia in Baghdad's outskirts, Kurds in Syria, the Peshmerga in northern Iraq, have begun to push back and have had early successes. This will be a long, tough battle, but ISIS has made too many enemies and has too few friends to succeed in the long term. Truly degrading the ISIS menace will involve eliminating the minds who manage the operation. The leaders, including not just ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, but also his so-called ministers, media advisers and field commanders, need to be killed or captured. Most of their supporters, including European and American recruits to Syria and Iraq, will die on the battlefield, but al Qaeda's ideological sympathizers typically also turn their attention to building cells that can attack Western targets, as we have witnessed in Indonesia, Yemen and the tribal areas of Pakistan. For that reason, selective, carefully targeted strikes in Syria will help decrease the risk here at home. Elimination of every ISIS leader and commander is too all encompassing a goal, and it's unnecessary. We can take a page out of the Waziristan book by using the lessons of the standoff campaign against al Qaeda's leadership remnants that has worked so successfully along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Were there American boots on the ground? No. Were the selective strikes effective? Absolutely. Pakistan's Waziristan region offers other important lessons. Gains against the entrenched al Qaeda network there didn't come overnight. Likewise, America's years of engagement against key targets in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen provide a blueprint. This new fight against ISIS similarly will take patience, careful intelligence work, persistence and time. Commitment to disrupting the group over time will eliminate the leaders who have the vision and capability to sponsor this kind of plotting. If we can find ways to keep those terror leaders on the run, that will shift their focus from plotting to survival. So, we should start the campaign with an achievable definition of victory and a reasonable expectation about what that will take. We want to degrade ISIS so its ability to attack us and our interests is minimized, and to aid allies -- particularly Iraqis and Middle Eastern governments who are willing to commit even limited forces. We have to ensure that this doesn't become America's war again. Along with our allies, we want to free the people who now come under the cruel ISIS boot. Defeat of ISIS may come. In the meantime, a good dose of degrade will be more than sufficient.","Andrew Liepman, Philip Mudd: Ideology-driven adversaries are hard to eliminate .

"(CNN) -- After the fall of the Berlin Wall, East Germany lay in shambles as many businesses went bankrupt and millions of people lost their jobs. Some firms, however, got back on their feet and revived the ""Made in Germany"" trademark by harnessing the expertise of their workers. Their aim was to become, once again, a global brand. CNN travelled to the town of Glashütte in Saxony, known as the birthplace of the German watchmaking tradition. Here, watchmakers such as A. Lange & Söhne and Nomos Glashütte among others have thrived since the fall of the Wall and have since exported their high-end watches to the rest of the world. German craftsmanship . It is companies like these which put their personal, unique stamp on a timeless piece which isn't assembled overnight, explained A. Lange & Söhne. ""It takes about four weeks for a watchmaker to put this piece together. And to learn to do this you need about five to ten years of experience,"" said Marco Wolf, a watchmaker at A. Lange & Söhne, one of the longest-running high-end watchmakers in the world. The hand-crafted timepieces, all mechanical and made with microscopic precision, are carefully created in the former Communist town of Glashütte. ""That is what our customers appreciate. The love for details striving for perfection. All that with typical German attributes like solidity, cleanliness, understatement. I think that combination is what drives people and what makes them our customers,"" said Wilhelm Schmid, CEO of A. Lange & Söhne. Attention to detail goes beyond the surface, according to Schmid, who describes how even tiny parts of the watch the customer will never see are engraved. ""And each engraver has his or her own signature style,"" he added. All in the family . The company's namesake, Ferdinand Adolf Lange, founded Glashütte's watchmaking tradition in 1845. The industry flourished and for over a century Glashütte was Germany's watchmaking capital. But all that changed after World War II, when Glashütte suddenly found itself in the Communist east part of Germany. All the watchmaking companies were nationalized and forced to build cheap watches, some of which were secretly sold in the West. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, much of the watch industry was able to get back on its feet, explained Schmid. ""There was still talent here. They were working on different watches than we are working on here today, but the talent generally speaking was there,"" he said. ""So all we had to do was help them to get to the next level."" Bouncing back . Fortunately for those companies, Glashütte has revived as Germany's capital of watchmaking once again, employing more people than it ever has. Of the town's 1,800 residents, 1,500 work in the watchmaking industry. Watchmaker Nomos Glashütte is another example of the area's growth in the past 25 years. The company, formed two months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, says its focus on design has pushed it forward in the past 25 years. ""We have brought great and unique design to Glashütte,"" said Uwe Ahrendt, CEO of Nomos Glashütte. ""We make beautiful watches and our timepieces come at very good prices,"" he said. In an era of start-ups and cheaper products being made at a fraction of the cost, the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall is a reflection of how resilient these particular watchmakers have been, and how adaptable they are in the global landscape.

"(CNN) -- Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, received an experimental medicine nearly a week after being admitted into the hospital -- a far longer wait than experienced by four other Ebola patients treated in the United States. Those patients -- two each at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital and the University of Nebraska Medical Center -- received their experimental medicines immediately. Those four are U.S. citizens; Duncan is a Liberian national. ""We feel he didn't get the medicine and treatment for the disease because he's African and they don't consider him as important as the other three,"" Josephus Weeks, Duncan's nephew, said at a press conference Tuesday afternoon. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who attended the press conference with Weeks and Duncan's mother as a newly appointed spokesman for the family, added, ""We don't feel good about that. It's been a concern he had to wait so long."" Jackson said he thinks money also played a role in Duncan's treatment. ""I would tend to think that those who do not have insurance, those who do not have Medicaid do not have the same priorities as those who do,"" the civil rights leader said. In a statement, a spokeswoman for Dallas' Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital said Duncan is being ""treated the way any other patient would have been treated, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care. We have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area."" The hospitals that took care of the four other patients had substantial advance notice that patients were on their way. Duncan went the emergency room at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 25, but staff there didn't realize he had Ebola and sent him home hours later. He was admitted on September 28 when the hospital realized he had the disease. He started receiving the experimental drug, brincidofovir, on October 4. He was in critical condition Tuesday. Weeks, though, said his uncle is ""doing better"" -- he's still on dialysis, but his heart rate has improved, his blood pressure is ""normal,"" ""his fever is pretty much gone"" and his diarrhea has ""slowed."" It's not clear if the experimental drug has anything to do with these changes. Thomas Eric Duncan: First Ebola death in U.S. Since the drugs being used to treat Ebola are still experimental, it is up to each individual hospital to file the paperwork with the Food and Drug Administration for permission to get the drug from the manufacturer and use it. The hospital has declined to tell CNN when they filed for permission to the FDA to use brincidofovir. ""The care team has been consulting with the CDC and Emory, on a daily basis since Mr. Duncan was admitted to the hospital, discussing the possible course of treatment, including the use of investigational drugs,"" hospital spokesman Wendell Watson said in a statement. The FDA and Chimerix, the company that makes the drug, said if there was any delay it wasn't on their part. Stephanie Yao, a spokeswoman for the FDA said she couldn't comment on any particular case, but when doctors make requests for experimental Ebola treatments, ""we turn them around in a matter of a few hours -- often less than one hour."" Ebola drugs are in the works . Joseph Schepers, a spokesman for Chimerix, said requests to use brincidofovir ""are expedited immediately in the most expedited way you could possibly do it."" ""It's a general rule in medicine that the earlier you start therapy in a sick person who needs the therapy, the better the response,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, when asked about the impact of the wait for the drug. Weeks said he and his family had to ""pressure"" the hospital to apply for permission to give the drug, brincidofovir, to Duncan. ""They were treating him with oxygen, water and a bed to lay on,"" he said. Weeks and Jackson said they believe the hospital applied for permission to use brincidofovir only after Jackson gave out the hospital's phone number on his radio show last week and urged listeners to call in and complain. Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance NBC cameraman, was admitted to the University of Nebraska Medical Center Tuesday and began receiving brincidofovir the same day. Dr. Rick Sacra received another experimental drug called TKM-Ebola, which is easier to access but still requires permission from the FDA. Dr. Kent Brantley and Nancy Writebol -- both treated at Emory -- took Zmapp, which is no longer available because the company ran out of supplies of the drug. FDA warns companies about fake Ebola drugs . CNN's John Bonifield and Matthew Stucker contributed to this report.","Thomas Eric Duncan was admitted to a Dallas hospital for Ebola on September 28 .

"(CNN) -- In the war against regulations and government restrictions, proponents have argued that it would be better for our economy to let the market rule. If we just get government out of the way, the market would determine business winners and losers and more jobs would be created. It's an appealing, red-blooded, American-sounding pitch. But what are the practical outcomes of such a policy? Let me tell you what the outcome would have been for me. I am the American portrait of a small-business success story. Microsoft might have started in a garage, but my business started in a renovated gas station at the corner of St. Paul and College streets in downtown Burlington, Vermont. That's where Jerry Greenfield and I opened Ben & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream Scoop Shop with a $12,000 investment,$4,000 of it borrowed, on May 5, 1978. We were two college kids (well, one of us dropped out) who just wanted to have a small ice cream store in a university town. But the popularity of our product led us in 1980 to dream bigger. We began packing pints and hand-delivering our ice cream to local grocery stores and restaurants. Our reputation grew and in 1983, independent ice cream distributors started selling our ice cream in Boston. By 1984, our micro-enterprise small business grew to more than $4 million in sales. The big ice cream brands weren't happy. That year, Haagen-Dazs, owned at the time by Pillsbury, had enough of our upstart small business. Did they try to promote their ice cream harder, develop some new flavors or cut prices to competitively beat us? No. Their game plan was to try to stop our distributors from carrying our ice cream. Pillsbury, a $4 billion corporation back then, was a major source of income for these distributors and they were told, in no uncertain terms, not to do business with Ben & Jerry's. This is what letting the free market reign really means. If you are a big business and don't want competition from small companies, you just use your economic clout to shut them down. Fortunately, the government does restrict this practice somewhat to protect the little guy. It is called the federal antitrust law. We believed Pillsbury's actions were illegal under this statute, which says a company that controls a major share of a given market cannot use its power and economic strength to keep other businesses out of the market. Ben & Jerry's filed a lawsuit against Pillsbury, but we also created a ""What's the Doughboy Afraid Of?"" customer campaign because we knew that in a strictly legal fight, we would run out of time and money long before Pillsbury did. The legal action and the negative publicity for Pillsbury worked. The doughboy agreed to stop trying to block sales of our products. The law was on our side, but we were fortunate to have a unique consumer product with a good customer base to advocate for us. Had Pillsbury taken their anti-competitive actions earlier, Ben & Jerry's today might be just a local Vermont treat or, more than likely, not be around at all. Regulations and government restrictions, like the federal antitrust law, help create a level playing field for entrepreneurs and small businesses wanting to grow. They establish the rules of business that allow real competition to work for the consumer and give small businesses a fighting chance. Without regulations and government restrictions, the biggest company wins. It's that simple. Anyone with a dream of starting a business to become the next Ben & Jerry's won't have that chance. That is not the American way. We understand the concept of fairness and that might doesn't make right. That is why the current anti-regulation efforts in Congress are so dangerous. Letting the market determine the rules of the business world means there will be only one rule: The biggest guy with the deepest pockets wins. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ben Cohen.","Ben Cohen: Politicians' mantra is get government out of business, let market forces rule .
Ben & Jerry's ice cream would never have survived in that environment, he says .
Cohen: When his business was small, Pillsbury tried to block sales of Ben & Jerry's .

"(CNN) -- Brazil might be viewed as booming emerging market, but with growth has come problems. Around 50 million Brazilians live in inadequate housing, according to the UN World Urban Forum. A recent UN Habitat report says between 85 and 90% of the deficit is within poor families, who have been hit by soaring real estate prices, sluggish earnings growth and a swelling population. But in ond of Sao Paulo's sprawling suburbs, one former tech entrepreneur believes he has an answer. Andrea Molinari, founder of construction firm Crinale, aims to succeed where government and construction giants have failed. His answer is houses that are quick to build, traditional in construction, and sold direct to consumers for them to develop themselves. Nimble construction . Large construction companies attempting to raise finance for construction and negotiate government bureaucracy have found themselves mired. Molinari explains that a smaller company can move faster. ""I think the core here is that we are operating in a gap where the big ones are not operating, and produce something that has huge demand,"" he tells CNN at the company's development at São João da Boa Vista, 200 kilometers (124 miles) north of Sao Paulo. The company eschews Sao Paulo city center, where Molinari says land prices make development for those on low incomes uneconomical. Instead, it snaps up plots at the rural fringes of the city, or in cities further out into Sao Paulo state. The company aims to stay ""light"" -- outsourcing infrastructure to the land developer, buying ready-to-use concrete blocks, and handing the marketing and sales to a local broker -- so it can concentrate on the construction. In doing so, Molinari claims to reduce the time from development to sale by more than 50%. Traditional values . The houses are built to the same plan. Each is 46 square meters with a living room, two bedrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom. Each is marketed at around 150,000 Reais ($63,000), designed to appeal to families at the bottom end of Brazil's growing middle class. ""We build in the traditional way we do in Brazil, which is bricks and mortar or concrete -- no plastic composites or things like that,"" says Molinari. The old-fashioned brickwork masks the progressive ideas behind it. In addition to an ambition to provide jobs for local people (with traditional building techniques quicker to train to new workers that specialist techniques), Molinari hopes to build houses that aspirant buyers will be able to develop further independently. ""The important thing here is that after they own the asset they improve the asset. They generate more value in the asset,"" he says. So far Crinale has built 4,000 houses. At São João da Boa Vista, there are homes under construction and families already living on site. Molinari describes the ambition to create a ""dynamic neighborhood."" The former banker admits the job might not boast the biggest numbers, but it has something else: . ""It's not the most profitable business you can find. But you can build some decent scale and ... at the same time have a real impact on people's lives.""","In Sao Paulo, Brazil's drastic housing shortages are exploding into violence .

"(CNN) -- Ebola may have faded from the headlines in the United States, but the threat -- to Africa and the rest of the world -- remains. This month, the Senate Homeland Security Committee held a hearing on Ebola, including testimony by Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He noted that the CDC had lowered its estimate of the number of cases likely to emerge in West Africa. Despite this positive news, Ebola remains largely out of control in Sierra Leone. The World Health Organization announced this month that Guinea is ""relatively stable,"" but the recent spread of the virus into Mali only confirms the need for a greater sustained effort to combat Ebola at its origin. That's why many experts are cautioning that declaring the emergency over is premature. And it's why the Obama administration and key members of Congress are requesting $6.1 billion to beef up our ability to eradicate Ebola and prepare for future epidemics. There are two reasons why this emergency is far from over. First, as long as Ebola rages in West Africa, health care systems in the United States and elsewhere will need to remain on high alert. There is no way to assure that Ebola -- or other known and unknown biological threats -- will be contained without the ability on a global scale to identify, manage, eradicate or even prevent these diseases from spreading. Improving our capacity to develop vaccines, respond to crises overseas and develop other countermeasures for dangerous viruses are vital. Second, the death from Ebola of Thomas Eric Duncan in Dallas was a powerful illustration of how unprepared we are to deal with large-scale biological threats. Few of the almost 5,000 hospitals in the United States are at the level of Bellevue Hospital Center in New York, Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, the University of Nebraska Medical Center or the handful of other facilities that have been designated as ready to handle Ebola-like illnesses. Why aren't we ready? Part of the problem is that budget cuts over the last decade have slashed the federally funded Hospital Preparedness Program and special disaster funding for public health agencies. Indeed, since 2008, some 50,000 public health positions have been eliminated due to funding cuts. For many public health agencies, even getting routine work done, never mind responding to crises, is proving a challenge for many communities in the United States. The emergency funds being sought to respond to Ebola here and in Africa are critical to helping protect the American public. The recent U.S. experience of Ebola was a wake-up call. But if the country hits the snooze button once the media coverage fades, we'll have missed a critical moment to deal not just with this deadly illness, but with future disasters, too.","Irwin Redlener: Ebola headlines in U.S. may have receded, but it's mistake to think threat gone .

"Porto Santo Stefano, Italy (CNN) -- Rescuers reached two trapped honeymooners in the interior of a cruise ship more than 24 hours after it ran aground off a picturesque Italian island, killing three people, injuring 20 and leaving dozens unaccounted for. The South Korean passengers, each 29, heard searchers calling out on the Costa Concordia, Italy's ANSA news agency reported early Sunday. They were located in a cabin and taken ashore. Video showed them being taken to a waiting ambulance. The captain of the ill-fated vessel, which turned over on its side after the grounding, was arrested late Saturday and was being investigated for abandoning ship and manslaughter, a local prosecutor said. With perhaps up to 50 people unaccounted for, divers suspended their efforts at dark, with plans to resume the search in the azure waters off the island of Giglio at dawn Sunday. Accounts of the chaos from many of the 3,200 passengers were reminiscent of a maritime disaster 100 years ago this April -- the loss of the RMS Titanic. ""For me, the worst part of the whole ordeal"" was when a lifeboat crew member told those boarding that it was ""women and children first,"" said passenger Benji Smith of Boston. ""All these families who were clinging to each other had to be separated,"" Smith told CNN. Some passengers fell into the chilly waters during the rescue, ANSA reported. Questions abounded: Why was the colossal ship so close to the shore? How fast was it moving? How well did the crew respond? According to many passengers, the evacuation was disorganized and no one seemed in charge. ""Every crew member who walked past shouted instructions, but the instructions contradicted each other,"" Smith said. Concordia's captain, Francesco Schettino, was interviewed earlier Saturday about what happened when the ship struck rocks in shallow water off Italy's western coast Friday evening, said officer Emilio Del Santo of the Coastal Authorities of Livorno. Local fishermen say the island coast of Giglio is known for its rocky sea floor. Schettino said ""that rock was not indicated on the chart,"" according to ANSA. ""Me and the crew, we were the last to abandon ship,"" he said. The ship was 2.5 miles off route when it struck the rocky sandbar. ""There are rocks, they are on the maps,"" said Capt. Cosimo Nicastro of the Italian Coast Guard. ""What we know is the ship went really close to these rocks. ... We don't yet know why."" The ship began taking on water Friday evening and the crew kept going because they believed the vessel could normally keep sailing, Nicastro said. Realizing there was a significant safety problem, the commander steered the Costa Concordia closer toward port. Authorities also were looking at why the ship didn't hail a mayday during the accident. ""At the moment we can't exclude that the ship had some kind of technical problem, and for this reason moved towards the coast in order to save the passengers, the crew and the ship. But they didn't send a mayday. The ship got in contact with us once the evacuation procedures were already ongoing,"" Del Santo said prior to the announcement of the captain's arrest. Giuseppe Orsina, a spokesman with the local civil protection agency, said 43 to 51 people were missing, though authorities are reviewing passenger lists to confirm the exact figure. ""These people could be still on the island of Giglio, in private houses or in hospitals,"" Orsina said. Two French tourists and a crew member from Peru were killed, Port authorities in Livorno said. One of the victims was a 65-year-old woman who died of a heart attack, according to authorities. Nautilus International, a maritime employees trade union, called the accident a ""wake-up call"" to regulators. ""Nautilus is concerned about the rapid recent increases in the size of passenger ships -- with the average tonnage doubling over the past decade,"" said Nautilus general secretary Mark Dickinson in a statement. ""Many ships are now effectively small towns at sea, and the sheer number of people onboard raises serious questions about evacuation."" Gianni Onorato, president of Genoa-based Costa Cruises, expressed ""deep sorrow for this terrible tragedy,"" but said the cruise line was unable to answer all the questions that authorities are now investigating. The vessel, plying the waters from Civitavecchia to Savona, Italy, struck a submerged rock, Onorato said in a statement before the announcement of the captain's arrest. ""Captain Schettino, who was on the bridge at the time, immediately understood the severity of the situation and performed a maneuver intended to protect both guests and crew, and initiated security procedures to prepare for an eventual ship evacuation,"" he continued. ""Unfortunately, that operation was complicated by a sudden tilting of the ship that made disembarkation difficult,"" Onorato said. Rosalyn Rincon, a member of the cruise ship staff, said the captain told passengers there was an ""electrical problem."" Concordia was carrying about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members when it ran aground. ""I'm not surprised that it (the ship) would wind up tipping like this,"" said Neil Gallagher, professor of naval architecture at the Webb Institute on Long Island, New York. ""Something had to go wrong with either the controls or the navigation to get it to this condition."" Chris B. McKesson, adjunct professor of naval architecture at the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering at the University of New Orleans, said, ""from the size of the gash, she must have been steaming at a pretty good pace."" Fear and panic aboard crippled ship . Panic spread as people scrambled to find lifeboats in the dark as the ship quickly leaned to one side late Friday. Access to some lifeboats was hampered by the ship's tilt into the water. With the ship's staircases flooded, Smith and others made rope ladders to climb from the outer fourth deck to the third. They were eventually rescued more than three hours later by a lifeboat that had returned from dropping passengers ashore. At least three lifeboats, each with a capacity of more than 100 people, apparently malfunctioned due to technical or crew error, Smith said. ""The people manning these boats were just cooks and shopkeepers,"" Smith said. Cmdr. Buddy Reams, chief of the U.S. Coast Guard's Cruise Ship National Center of Expertise, said, ""when it comes to cruise ships, in the event of emergency, cabin stewards or others would have safety roles,"" he said. The Coast Guard inspects foreign-flagged cruise ships in U.S. waters twice a year, studying the competency of the crew during fire and abandon-ship drills, Reams said. Many passengers asked why they had not yet received an obligatory safety briefing when disaster struck around dinner time, only hours into their journey. The timing of the safety briefings and muster drills depend on the length of the cruise, Reams told CNN. Many of those rescued in the early hours were taken to small churches and other buildings around the island for shelter. Some were still wearing the pajamas and slippers they had on as the ship went down. Vivian Shafer, a passenger from Maryland, told CNN there was no initial announcement after the vessel began its tilt. Others reported being unable to clearly hear instructions. Once ashore, no one from the crew assisted them, Shafer said. Rather, it was up to islanders. ""There didn't seem to be anybody in charge,"" she said. Costa Cruises, owned by parent company Carnival Corp., said it was focusing on the final stages of the emergency operation and helping passengers and crew return home. ""It is a tragedy that deeply affects our company. Our first thoughts go to the victims and we would like to express our condolences and our closeness to their families and friends,"" the line said on its website. The Concordia, built in 2006, was on a Mediterranean cruise from Rome with stops in Savona, Marseille, Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca, Cagliari and Palermo. Most of the passengers on board were Italian. CNN affiliate America Noticias, in Peru, said a group of 32 Peruvians were also onboard. Brazil's state-run Agencia Brasil said 53 Brazilians were on the cruise ship. An estimated 126 Americans were also on board, according to the U.S. State Department. There were no reports of injured Americans though the U.S. Embassy in Rome said it was unable to account for all U.S. citizens believed to be on board the ship at the time of the accident. Another Costa ship was involved in a deadly 2010 accident when the Costa Europa crashed into a pier in Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh during stormy weather, killing three crew members.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Thousands of pro-democracy protesters jammed the streets of Hong Kong's central business district Saturday night and early Sunday, clapping and cheering just hours after an ultimatum by government leaders: Let city workers back in their offices soon, or else. Demonstrators swarmed the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's Admiralty district to hear nighttime speeches from protest leaders perched on a small spotlighted podium -- all defying city leaders' insistence that they disperse and let Hong Kong's life and commerce return to normal. Even after the rally, many hundreds camped out or roamed the streets early Sunday, stretching the demonstrations into their eighth day and raising the prospect that protesters intend to test the government's latest ultimatum. ""There have been continuous clashes over the past couple days,"" Patrick Kwok, police senior superintendent, said at a Sunday morning press briefing. He said clashes were in the Mong Kok district. ""Police officers are still dealing with the situation. Protesters in those areas have been extremely uncooperative."" Chief Executive C.Y. Leung -- under pressure from protesters demanding his resignation -- took to television Saturday evening to once again demand that protesters disperse immediately. But his demand now came with a deadline: The streets must be clear by Monday so that classes could resume at schools, he said. And entrances to the government headquarters also must be clear then, he said. He said protesters blocked 3,000 government employees from going to work Friday, clogging all entrances to the city's chief executive office building -- something he said would not be repeated Monday. ""The government and the police have the responsibilities and determination to take all necessary actions to restore social order,"" Leung said in his televised address. ""There are numerous social problems to be solved,"" Leung added, ""but the proper way is through rational communication, finding commonalities and preserving differences -- not through resistance on (the) street that worsens the problem,"" he said. Who is C.Y. Leung? Pro-democracy activists, led by student groups, are demonstrating for universal suffrage in Hong Kong and the right to directly choose candidates for elected office -- rather than having China choose the eligible candidates. They've also called for the resignation of Leung, whom the protesters view as a puppet of Beijing. Despite Leung's warning, activists showed no signs of going anywhere soon. Instead of tearing down barricades meant to impede any security forces, participants built them up Saturday night, making piles of metal on the perimeter. Protest leaders said Friday's violence -- scuffles between protesters and counter-protesters in Mong Kok, a nearby district -- reinforced their resolve. They accuse police of standing by and failing to take action when some students were attacked and beaten, and when some were sexually assaulted. Peaceful protests against the government will continue despite provocations, Alex Chow, leader of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, told reporters Saturday afternoon. Throughout the day Saturday, small skirmishes continued with mainly older residents -- appearing in their 40s or 50s -- yelling at the youngsters sitting by the main tent in the Mong Kok protest area. One older man swore at the students, repeatedly cursing at them as ""kids causing trouble."" Protest leaders: Police didn't stop attackers . A source familiar with the Hong Kong government said leaders expect a prolonged faceoff and know the conflict won't resolve itself in two or three days. The government plans to ""wait it out"" and thinks the number of protesters will gradually diminish, the source said. Beijing worries that Hong Kong could become an anti-communist base and that pro-democracy protests could gain traction in other Chinese cities, the source said. Beijing thinks granting Hong Kong the right to nominate candidates is a threat to national security, the source said. Health officials said more than 50 people were injured in Friday's protests, which were punctuated by scuffles between protesters and counterprotesters in Mong Kok, a tightly packed district of shops and residences surrounding one of the city's busiest intersections. At least 19 people were arrested Friday into Saturday, police said, on suspicion of crimes including fighting in public places, unlawful assembly and assault. Protest leaders backed out of negotiations with government officials after Friday's violence in Mong Kok, where protest opponents tore down tents and scuffled with demonstrators; dozens were injured. The attacks have strained relations as demonstrators say police officers failed to protect them when they were assaulted; police accuse protesters of escalating the situation. Critics of the pro-democracy movement, called Occupy Central, say the weeklong demonstrations have hurt the economy and small businesses, and clogged traffic and daily operations of the city. Student leaders say they refuse to negotiate with the government until there is an explanation of police action. Joshua Wong, the 17-year-old leader of student group Scholarism, told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout that the Hong Kong government should ""pay responsibility of this accident."" Meet the 17-year-old student agitating for change . Assistant Commissioner of Police Cheung Tak-keung rejected the protesters' claims, saying the accusations were ""totally unfounded and extremely unfair to police officers who faithfully and diligently performed their duty at the scene."" He said police separated the two parties and set up a buffer area to prevent further injuries. In the seven days of protest, more than 150 people have been injured, and 12 were in a hospital as of 2 p.m. Saturday, the city's information services department said. The U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong issued an advisory, warning U.S. citizens ""to avoid all protest areas due to the potential risk of escalating violence."" Counterprotester: 'It's anarchy' A few dozen people who oppose the protests peacefully walked to a police station Saturday morning with blue ribbons -- which signify solidarity with the officers. ""We need order. We know what they want. Why do they still stay?"" said one of them, retired police officer Yan pak Yu. ""Go to the park. Go the playground. Don't obstruct the daily operations of Hong Kong."" Another resident, Peter Bentley, a retiree added: ""It's anarchy. These are our streets. What I oppose is anarchy."" Hong Kong protests: What's next? What protesters want . Demonstrators are upset with a recently enacted policy giving Beijing veto power on who can run as a candidate for the chief executive role in the 2017 election. A new electoral system will, for the first time, let the city's 5 million eligible voters pick a winner, rather than a 1,200-member committee stacked with Beijing loyalists that has chosen past leaders. But critics argue that the right to vote is pointless if the candidates are handpicked by Beijing. They complain the Chinese government is encroaching too much on the affairs of Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory ruled according to the ""one country, two systems"" policy since Britain handed over Hong Kong in 1997. Beijing condemns the protests as ""illegal acts"" and in a Saturday editorial of People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, dismissed the movement's potential to spread to mainland China as ""no more than a daydream."" CNN's Madison Park and Chieu Luu reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote and reported from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Stephen Colbert -- host of ""The Colbert Report"" and unabashed right wing radical -- is now considering running for President of the United States of America. Simply put: Colbert must be stopped! He is an existential threat to our way of life and to the exceptional nature of our nation. I know some will dismiss the threat posed by Colbert -- these apologists will defend him as ""harmless"" or say he's no more than ""a charismatic speaker"" -- but that is exactly what they said about Hitler. We need to wake up to the fact that Colbert's poll numbers in South Carolina -- the location of the next Republican primary -- are rising. He is now at 5%, placing him ahead of former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman. Yes, some will scoff at Colbert running ahead of Huntsman -- a candidate running below the margin of error in some polls, meaning he may have zero support or may actually owe votes -- but keep in mind that in the recent Iowa caucus, Huntsman received 745 votes. Translation: Colbert is for real. Colbert has not been hiding his extreme views. Night after night (or four nights a week to be exact) Colbert has been spewing his venom. However, for some reason, the media have given him a free pass. But that ends now. Here are Colbert's positions on the key issues -- I warn you, they are scary: . -- Unemployment: ""Suck it up, unemployed. It is your own damn fault that you don't have a job ... So stop scapegoating Wall Street."" Do we really want an American president who sides with Wall Street over workers? -- Corporate taxes: ""If we raise taxes on corporations, what incentive will they have to make money other than the fact that it's the sole reason they exist."" Colbert is clearly in the pocket of big business -- I bet his super PAC is funded by big businesses like hedge funds and casino owners. -- Government helping Americans in need: ""I believe in pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps. I believe it is possible. I saw this guy do it once in Cirque du Soleil. It was magical!"" -- Gays: ""There is nothing wrong with being gay. I have plenty of friends who are going to hell."" Even Rick Santorum would not say this (at least not in public.) -- America's role in world: ""If our Founding Fathers wanted us to care about the rest of the world, they wouldn't have declared their independence from it."" Under a Colbert administration, it appears America would just attack other countries for no valid reason. -- Immigration: ""This is America. I don't want my tomato picked by a Mexican. I want it picked by an American, then sliced by a Guatemalan, and served by a Venezuelan in a spa where a Chilean gives me a Brazilian."" And he advocates arresting illegal immigrants and throwing them in ""jail -- then we can force them to pick our crops as prison labor."" -- Civil rights: ""I just think Rosa Parks was overrated. Last time I checked, she got famous for breaking the law."" Even Ron Paul, whose past newsletters contained racist comments, would be appalled by this callous remark. -- Muslims: ""Every permit granted to a mosque is one denied to an American house of worship."" Colbert is to the right of Newt Gingrich on this issue, and keep in mind Newt has compared Muslims to Nazis. These above quotes are clearly the words of a man with no regard for the values of our great nation. Why do the media coddle Colbert just because he labels himself a ""comedian""? Hitler told jokes -- does that mean he was OK? And not only are Colbert's views on the radical fringe of American society, I don't trust him. Why? Because his positions on the issues have remained constant. He doesn't waver or have multiple opinions on the same issue. In contrast, a person like Mitt Romney has evolved over time and has been on both sides of issues like abortion, gay marriage and health insurance. (Romney should embrace this with the campaign slogan: ""Me, too!"") Colbert has only two qualities I like: 1. He's a friend of Jon Stewart and 2. He has good hair. Besides that, he is a danger to our Republic. And let's not forget that Colbert admitted that he makes up facts to support his own political arguments, as he gleefully boasted once: ""I can't prove it, but I can say it."" America cannot afford a man with the views of Stephen Colbert running our nation. Colbert doesn't belong in the White House, instead he belongs on basic cable right before reruns of ""Scrubs."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Comedian Dean Obeidallah: Stephen Colbert is considering running for president .

"(CNN) -- Time was running out, and Mark Dickinson wasn't sure whether he'd get to see his dying 2-year-old grandson one last time. A long line at Los Angeles International Airport's security checkpoint had kept him from getting to his gate on time. His grandson Caden would be taken off life support in a matter of hours in Denver, Colorado, with or without his grandfather's presence, according to CNN affiliate KABC. ""I was kind of panicking because I was running late, and I really thought I wasn't going to make the flight,"" Dickinson told KABC. That's when a pilot from Southwest Airlines stepped up and held the flight at the gate until Dickinson arrived. The pilot was standing by the jetway waiting for him when Dickinson arrived in socks, so rushed that he just grabbed his shoes at security and ran through the terminal. ""I told him, 'Thank you so much. I can't tell you how much I appreciated that.' And he said, 'No problem. They can't leave without me anyway,' "" Dickinson told KABC. Authorities say Dickinson's grandson, Caden Rodgers, suffered a head injury after his mother's boyfriend threw him across the room. The boyfriend reportedly told police he was drunk and high on marijuana at the time. The child later died and the boyfriend has been charged with first-degree murder, according to the Aurora Sentinel. Dickinson's wife had called Southwest and asked them to hold the plane. After the flight, Dickinson said, he wanted to thank the pilot again for his serious display of empathy but didn't get the chance. Dickinson made it to Colorado in time to say goodbye to his grandson. ""I would just tell him that I can't tell him how grateful I am that he did that for me,"" he said. Most airlines would punish any staff member who holds up a flight, according to consumer advocate Christopher Elliott, who broke the story of the compassionate pilot on his blog. However, a Southwest spokeswoman said the pilot's actions were exemplary. ""You can't hold a plane for every late customer, but I think we would all agree that these were extenuating circumstances and the pilot absolutely made the right decision,"" Southwest spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said. ""I don't think you could ask for a better example of great service for our customers."" Though the airline has identified the pilot who held the plane for Dickinson, the pilot has asked that his name not be released to the public. ""As you're reading the story, you absolutely get tears in your eyes and just an overwhelming sense of pride that our pilot took such an action,"" McInnis said. ""It really makes you proud to work for Southwest.""","A pilot from Southwest held a flight for a man going to see his dying grandson .

"(CNN) -- The presidents of Harvard and Yale universities have expressed interest in ROTC programs after Congress voted to repeal the military's controversial ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy that has banned openly gay and lesbian service members. The universities' statements come five months after Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, then a Supreme Court nominee, came under criticism by Republican senators who complained that she actively tried to block military recruiters from Harvard Law School when she was dean because of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. Kagan and the White House have strongly defended her actions, saying that while she opposed the military's policy, Kagan never kept recruiters off the university. Four months after taking the job as Harvard's dean, in October 2003, Kagan offered students her thoughts in a campus-wide e-mail, saying that to give recruiters equal access to the campus ""causes me deep distress. I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy."" She called it ""a profound wrong - a moral injustice of the first order."" In a written statement, Harvard President Drew Faust called the act to repeal ""don't ask, don't tell"" a ""historic step."" ""It affirms American ideals of equal opportunity and underscores the importance of the right to military service as a fundamental dimension of citizenship,"" Faust said. ""I look forward to pursuing discussions with military officials and others to achieve Harvard's full and formal recognition of ROTC. I am very pleased that more students will now have the opportunity to serve their country."" Yale University President Richard C. Levin said in a written statement that Yale is ""eager to open discussions about expanding opportunities for students interested in military service"" and will discuss the matter with the faculty of the college in the spring semester. ""Meanwhile, I have asked General Counsel Dorothy Robinson, Secretary Linda Lorimer and Yale College Dean Mary Miller to consult with officials in Washington early in the new year to determine the military¹s interest in establishing an ROTC unit at Yale,"" Levin said. ""We are very hopeful that these discussions will enable us to begin a new chapter in the long history of Yale's support of the U.S. Armed Services."" President Barack Obama will sign the repeal on Wednesday morning, the White House has said, setting the stage to allow gay people to serve openly in the military. But the changes aren't expected to take effect for at least a few months. The Pentagon has an 87-page implementation plan for the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell."" Over the next several weeks, military officials need to examine and rewrite a series of policies, regulations and directives related to the current law. Once that potentially lengthy process is complete, Obama, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen will each have to certify that the repeal can move ahead without negatively affecting unit cohesion and military readiness. After the certification, another 60 days will need to pass before the repeal is officially enacted. Even after the repeal, gay and lesbian service members will not have every right and privilege accorded to heterosexual members of the military, largely because of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. A Pentagon study released this month concluded that allowing openly gay or lesbian troops to serve in the military would have little lasting impact on the U.S. armed forces. Opposition to the change was much higher in Army and Marine combat units than in the military as a whole. CNN's Bill Mears, Barbara Starr, Larry Shaughnessy and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","Congress votes to repeal the military's policy banning openly gay and lesbian members .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- With book deals, TV appearances and thousands of readers, moms who detail every moment of their domestic lives online produce some of the Web's most well-read blogs. 'Mommy bloggers' want to stem what they fear is a backlash against their profession. Many of these ""mommy bloggers"" even draw the attention of companies that send them free product samples -- everything from toys to baby strollers to video game consoles -- in the hopes of getting positive coverage. But to some, these freebies aren't necessarily a good thing. Readers have complained they can no longer trust their favorite blogger's advice. Veteran women bloggers grumble that newcomers sully the genre's reputation by demanding free products and trips. Newsweek.com published an article last month headlined, ""Trusted Mom or Sellout?"" ""There has been a turn of goodwill [against mommy bloggers],"" said Liz Gumbinner, the publisher and editor-in-chief of Cool Mom Picks. ""A year ago, bloggers were rising stars. Six months later, really big marketers like Wal-Mart got into the game and started backing bloggers. ""That created a new paradigm: An A-list blogger was not the one who wrote the best and had the most influence, but had the most marketing attention and free products,"" she added. ""It created a new generation of bloggers who blogged to get free stuff."" So Gumbinner and other women bloggers are taking steps to become more transparent and stem what they fear is a backlash against their profession. At last month's fifth annual BlogHer Conference -- a gathering of more than 1,500 women bloggers in Chicago -- Gumbinner and three other bloggers launched Blog with Integrity, a Web site devoted to improving blogger ethics. ""After a spring and early summer of polarizing debates about blogger compensation, sponsored posts and product reviews, an alarming increase in ethical lapses and idea theft, and a growing backlash against poor blogger relations practices, we believed it was time to refocus on integrity,"" the site says. As of Monday, people from more than 880 blogs had signed the site's pledge, in which bloggers promise to disclose material relationships, policies and business practices, and let readers know the difference between editorial content and advertising. Joanne Bamberger, who writes the influential blog PunditMom, was among the first to sign the integrity pledge. In an e-mail to CNN she wrote, ""I signed the pledge to help remind readers, other journalists and government regulators that many, if not most, online writers are committed to honest and ethical writing and that we share the same values as those in the more traditional media."" Trisha Haas, founder of blogging community MomDot.com, organized another campaign to free bloggers who feel inundated by PR requests and overwhelmed with product reviews. MomDot's ""PR Blackout"" asks mommy bloggers to go one week -- beginning Monday -- without writing about products or services. Haas, who claims to get up to 75 pitches a day from PR firms, instead wants mommy bloggers to ""get back to the basics"" and post about their marriages, homes and kids. ""We are not saying down with PR, we are saying let's change how we interact with PR and understand the relationship better,"" she told CNN. ""It is important to get back to brand loyalty, not brand saturation. ""It should not be about free stuff,"" she said, setting up her own joke. ""Unless it is a Lexus."" ""It seems like this is a case where a few bad eggs are spoiling the omelet, or however that old saying goes,"" wrote Caroline McCarthy in a recent post on CNET, the tech news site. ""The problem isn't PR, but bloggers who are working with it in a less-than-sincere way."" Even the federal government is turning its attention to how the mommy blogosphere conducts itself. The Federal Trade Commission is expected to vote this summer on new ethical guidelines for bloggers. While the revised guidelines will apply to all bloggers, FTC public affairs specialist Betsy Lordan told CNN, ""Some of the bigger challenges include the mommy blogger issue and the extent to which the blogger must disclose a relationship with an advertiser."" Massachusetts-based online marketer Susan Getgood believes many bloggers aren't intentionally deceptive -- just confused about what they should disclose. ""There is a lack of knowledge [about ethical rules],"" said Getgood, who runs GetGood Strategic Marketing. ""The FTC did not deliberately set out to confuse everybody but blogging is new for a lot of these women and having that kind of both responsibility and power is new to a lot of bloggers."" Barbara Jones is the founder and CEO of One2One Network, a public-relations firm specializing in marketing to women. She believes mommy bloggers often feel overwhelmed by PR pitches and don't know how to say no. ""Some bloggers just say 'yes' because they like being asked and like the stuff,"" she said. ""But what they don't realize is that they are not going to lose opportunities or not be asked again if they are too busy or overloaded."" This week's PR blackout and the Blog With Integrity campaign may not change the image of mommy bloggers overnight, but they are starting a dialogue. ""Most people want to blog well,"" Gumbinner said. ""We cannot be the wild, wild West. We are instituting a conversation that we all want to be in together. That is the best of what blogging is: a conversation.""","'Mommy bloggers' are fighting what they fear is a backlash against their profession .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Thierry de la Villehuchet, a hedge fund adviser and investor whose firm said he lost $1.5 billion investing with Wall Street adviser Bernard Madoff, was found dead in his office in an apparent suicide Tuesday, police said. Police say Thierry de la Villehuchet's body had cuts on the wrist and bicep. Emergency personnel discovered the body of the 65-year-old French executive at 7:29 a.m. in the Madison Avenue office of Access International Advisors, police said. Villehuchet suffered ""cuts made to his arm, to his wrist and also to his bicep area, with a box cutter,"" New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said at a news conference. He also told reporters there were pills present, though it wasn't clear whether any were ingested, and there was no suicide note. Liliane Bettencourt, the world's richest woman, is believed to have entrusted part of her $22.9 billion fortune with Madoff through Villehuchet, according to reports. The 86-year-old daughter of L'Oreal founder Eugene Schueller is thought to be an investor in a fund managed by Access International Advisors, although her investment isn't public. Calls to Bettencourt's foundation, Foundation Bettencourt Schuelle, were not returned. Bettencourt joins other wealthy individuals from Europe and around the world who have lost money -- thought to include Spanish billionaire Alicia Koplowitz, Steven Spielberg and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel. Villehuchet's body will be examined and a toxicology report issued Wednesday, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the New York medical examiner. Kelly read a statement from Access International Advisors' attorney saying the firm lost $1.5 billion by investing with Madoff, 70, a former Nasdaq chairman who is accused of operating a $50 billion Ponzi scheme. Reached by phone, Madoff's attorney, Daniel Horowitz, had no comment. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission Web site, Access International Advisors no longer registers with the SEC.","Thierry de la Villehuchet was a hedge fund adviser and investor .

"Washington (CNN) -- Sen. John McCain, who has held onto his Senate seat for 30 years, seems hesitant to let it go in the next 2016 election. The Arizona senator, who will be 80 years old that year, told reporters on Thursday that he is ""strongly considering"" and ""leaning towards"" another reelection bid. ""We were talking to our longtime supporters -- many of whom have been with us for many years and we're grateful for their support -- about the options, and what we see as the future of the party in Washington and here in Arizona,"" McCain said after an event at the Ritz-Carlton in Phoenix, according to the Arizona Republic. ""We're getting a lot of their input as to whether I should run for re-election or not. They know that I am seriously considering it, and leaning towards it."" While his supporters think he has enough steam for another term, McCain said it would be ""a very, very tough campaign."" He has been heavily criticized by conservatives for sticking closer to the center than with them. The Arizona Republic reports that the state's Republican Party targeted McCain earlier this year for ""being too liberal,"" especially with immigration reform. If he decides to throw his hat in the ring, McCain knows the campaign trail will be bumpy. ""Oh, I think you can certainly anticipate it,"" McCain said. ""If you're going to win a campaign, you have to plan for all scenarios, including significant primary opposition. I wouldn't like to see it, obviously. Unfortunately, we don't conduct campaigns by unanimous consent."" With a tough primary potentially ahead of him, McCain said he will announce his decision in early 2015. ""We've got to get going early next year,"" he said. ""We have to prepare, as we always do. Every campaign I've been in, I've said, 'Look, this is going to be the toughest.' You have to assume that. We've seen, historically, that people who take anything for granted, then they put that election in jeopardy. I've never done that.""","Sen.

"Washington (CNN) -- ""I'm 6-feet, 3-inches tall and 230 pounds, just like Rodney King. Do I scare you?"" Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, posted a photograph Wednesday of a column he wrote after the brutal 1992 beating of Rodney King, an African-American, and subsequent acquittal of the accused police officers, who were all white. In the newspaper essay, Booker -- one of two African-Americans currently serving in the Senate -- blends his own first-person experience and that of King into a stream-of-consciousness column analyzing American race relations. The tweet was in response to a disheartened tweet from a follower in response to the events surrounding Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Missouri. Booker responded by saying, ""Diana, I wrote this at 22. I remember how angry I was. And yes it was more than that. It was pain/hurt. @Diana_Denis,"" along with the attached image of a yellowed newspaper column. The column is rife with emotions that range from ""rage"" to ""sadness"" as he describes a recent memory of being racially profiled one evening as he was driving. Quickly, his experience escalates into one that many young black men in America are familiar with: five police cars surrounded him, six officers approached him with guns drawn and demanded to see his documents. Why was he pulled over, in his telling? ""Oh, you fit the description of a car thief."" Booker had just graduated from Stanford and was awarded the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship at the time of the incident. He goes on to liken himself to King's physical stature, which is also fairly close to the 6-foot, 4-inch, nearly 300 pound frame of Brown, the unarmed black teenager shot and killed by white police officer Darren Wilson. ""Am I a threat? Does your fear justify your actions? Twelve people believed it did,"" Booker wrote. Similarly to recent events in Ferguson, the National Guard was called into Los Angeles to quell the riots in 1992. ""If I were the powers that be, it would not have taken me three days to call the National Guard,"" young Booker writes. He finishes the piece, written with shaky hands, by saying, ""Dear God.... help us to help ourselves before we become our own undoing."" Booker is already known for his rapid-fire use of the social media site to address constituent concerns and trolls alike, and used the opportunity to discuss what he calls ""transformational criminal justice reform & drug policy reform,"" which he plans to lead with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky.","On Twitter, Sen. Cory Booker recalls a newspaper column he wrote reacting to L.A. riots .

"(CNN) -- ""There's a danger that something that feels easy to do and without risk to yourself, almost antiseptic to the person shooting, doesn't feel that way at the point of impact,"" General Stanley McChrystal, the former U.S. commander in Afghanistan, told the BBC when asked about drone strikes earlier this year. ""There is a perception of helpless people in an area being shot at like thunderbolts from the sky by an entity that is acting as though they have omniscience and omnipotence, and you can create a tremendous amount of resentment inside populations -- even not the people who are themselves being targeted but around -- because of the way it appears and feels."" When the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan is making this kind of warning about the drone program, things must be getting bad. The latest report by U.N. Special Rapporteur Ben Emmerson QC can only add to these concerns. Emmerson cites a whole raft of cases where civilians -- many of them clients of legal charity Reprieve -- have been killed or injured by the misguided and shadowy campaign of drone strikes carried out by the CIA and the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). Read more: U.N. investigator calls for more transparency . The cases highlighted by Emmerson demonstrate the devastating impact of drone strikes on innocent people from all walks of life in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen; and his call for states to publicly respond to the allegations set forth only underlines the total lack of accountability which currently exists for the covert drone campaign. 'Resentment on massive scale' But perhaps more than anything, these cases give force to the concerns voiced by General McChrystal: that the danger of the drone campaign to the U.S. and its allies is that, far from being the easy, ""antiseptic"" fix it may appear, it is in fact creating resentment on a massive scale, and making all of us -- whether we live in Waziristan, Wyoming or Warwickshire -- less safe. Perhaps one of the most devastating examples of this is the case of Saleem Ahmed bin Ali Jaber. Saleem was an imam who locals say was killed along with his nephew in an August 2012 strike in the Hadramout area of Yemen. On the Friday before he was killed, he had given a sermon in the local mosque denouncing al Qaeda. His nephew, Waleed, killed alongside him, was a local policeman. So what did that strike -- that ""thunderbolt from the sky,"" in Gen McChrystal's words -- achieve for the U.S.? It killed the very people it should be supporting in Yemen: a brave religious leader, prepared to use his pulpit to take on al Qaeda; and a government employee who worked to enforce the law. ""Our family are not your enemy,"" wrote Faisal bin Ali Jaber, Saleem's brother-in-law and Waleed's uncle, to President Obama (in a letter sent last year which has yet to receive a response). ""In fact, the people you killed had strongly and publicly opposed al Qaeda ... Our town was no battlefield. We had no warning."" Faisal has been very clear that, while he wants an apology and accountability for the deaths of his loved ones, he ""wish[es] no vengeance against the United States or Yemeni governments."" However, we cannot ignore the destabilizing effect the drone campaign is having on those areas it targets. Yemen vote ignored . How can the West credibly encourage Yemen down the path towards democracy and the rule of law when it ignores both in pursuing its policies inside the country? Both Yemen's Parliament and its National Dialogue -- which is mapping out the country's post-Arab Spring future -- have voted overwhelmingly against the U.S. carrying out drone strikes in the country, yet both have been ignored. The U.S. -- helped by the UK, which shares intelligence and provides communications infrastructure in support of the strikes -- continues to carry out bombing raids with impunity in a country with which it is not at war. The covert drone campaign has produced hundreds of stories of personal tragedy -- many of which remain unknown, due to the intense secrecy which surrounds it. Emmerson's report helps lift the veil on just some of those stories, but the majority will remain in the shadows -- despite the efforts of human rights investigators and journalists -- until the U.S. and its allies accept that, at the very least, there should be some accountability and transparency in this deadly campaign. Yet with the CIA still refusing to even publicly acknowledge that any such campaign is taking place, any such accountability seems as far away as ever. Read more: Obama calls for review of drone use . In the meantime, politicians and public alike should reflect on the warnings of General McChrystal and the story of Saleem bin ali Jaber, and demand to know how it is that this secret campaign, which alienates or incinerates the very people we should be trying to support, really makes any of us any safer.

"(CNN) -- Colombian rebels say they are ready to start the unilateral release of five hostages, according to a message posted Wednesday on a former Colombian senator's website. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, said in the message that ""we hope to disseminate security protocols that surround the operation to unleash the dynamics of the releases."" The message was posted on the website of former Colombian Sen. Piedad Cordoba, who has a history of negotiating the release of FARC hostages. The FARC message, dated Monday, said that the Colombian army has intensified its preparations for the release. In December, the FARC announced its plans to release the five hostages -- a police major, two military service members and two municipal politicians -- as a humanitarian gesture. In the December statement, the FARC criticized Colombia's attorney general for removing and disqualifying Cordoba from serving in the legislature. The attorney general cited her close ties to the group as the basis for her removal from the Senate. The hostages to be freed were identified in December as police Maj. Guillermo Solorzano, Army Cpl.

"(CNN) -- Kurbanjan Samat, a 32-year-old Uyghur photographer, wants to dispel the stereotypes he says many Chinese hold about people from his home region -- an ethnically diverse province in China's far west. He traveled to more than 20 cities to interview and photograph more than 500 people as part of a photography project called ""I'm from Xinjiang"" that aims to bridge the gap between China's Han majority and the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs at a time of heightened tensions between the two groups. Following the conviction of Uyghur extremists for a number of violent attacks in the past year, Samat told CNN that many Chinese outside Xinjiang increasingly associate the province with terrorism. ""The idea occurred to me to tell the real life stories of people from Xinjiang... and show that people from Xinjiang are no different from others,"" he said. A new book will showcase 100 of his best portraits. They include Nefise Nehmat, a Shanghai-based Uyghur lawyer, who is now studying for a master's degree in comparative law at a U.S. university and Zhang Zhiqiang, a Han Chinese adopted by a Uyghur family, who runs a mobile phone business and has converted to Islam. The subjects are shown in a variety of settings -- an office cubicle, praying, in a radio studio and at home, which Samat hopes will dispel a common perception that people from Xinjiang only run kebab stalls or restaurants. Most of the people he approached were willing to have their portraits taken, but some balked at the last minute. Samat, who is based in Beijing and started taking photos in middle school, says he, like other Uyghurs, has faced discrimination, particularly after knife-wielding assailants killed 31 people at train station in Kunming earlier this year -- an attack Chinese media referred to as the country's 9/11. ""During those days, I couldn't even get a cab because I have a face typical of Xinjiang people,"" he said. Samat doesn't expect his book to bring any significant changes but he hopes it will encourage others to understand the people from Xinjiang they encounter in their daily life. Ultimately, he says, he did the project ""not for Uyghurs, not for Xinjiang,"" but for himself. ""If I don't do this, the labels they put on Xinjiang people will be put on me. I don't want to be labeled."" CNN's Zhang Dayu reported from Beijing, Katie Hunt wrote from Hong Kong.","Uyghur photographer wants to dispel stereotypes about Xinjiang.

"(CNN) -- While lying on a thin mattress a few months ago, nursing the symptoms of dengue fever, I watched a huntsman spider leap off of the wall of my wooden shack and onto a hapless cockroach, which the spider dragged away and devoured. I was serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in the rural eastern part of the Dominican Republic. But the spider's ambush -- which gave new meaning to the word ""insecticide"" -- brought me back to another remote corner of the globe, Afghanistan, where I had served in my other beloved corps: the Marine Corps. Ambushes -- by Taliban insurgents rather than hairy spiders -- were regular occurrences in southern Afghanistan. As a Marine officer, I made two deployments there, the second of which was spent testing, distributing, and fine-tuning equipment designed to foil the remote-control bombs the Taliban used to ambush us. Then, in 2011, my active service ended, I turned in my rifle and I joined the Peace Corps, where I spent two years building composting latrines in Dominican communities that lacked access to basic sanitation. I completed my service this month and returned to the United States (I got over the dengue fever just fine). When you join the Marine Corps or the Peace Corps, much less both, you often have some explaining to do. So, on this Memorial Day, permit me to reflect here on the reasons people serve and to describe some of the common threads between these two special American institutions. You might be surprised to hear that the goals of the Marines and the Peace Corps, and the ideals of the volunteers who join them, overlap. You might also be surprised to learn that the Peace Corps has its own legacy of sacrifice, with more of its volunteers killed on the job than Central Intelligence Agency officers. Marines operate as a team, in a strictly defined hierarchy. Peace Corps service is largely an individual effort, and volunteers can go for months without being heard from by staff. Peace Corps training includes learning to teach kids simple science experiments. Marine Corps training includes learning the proper technique for choking someone to death. The essence of the Peace Corps mission is to promote understanding between American volunteers and the people they serve. The Marine Corps mission is to win our nation's battles. But to say the two organizations are opposites would be erroneous. The book that inspired President John F. Kennedy to launch the Peace Corps was the 1958 novel called ""The Ugly American."" I was actually assigned to read it by the Marine Corps, since its practical advice on quelling insurgencies was correctly deemed relevant to the counterinsurgency wars we were now fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. I saw Marines approach problems in Afghanistan as though they were characters in that novel -- or Peace Corps volunteers. Rolando, a young infantryman in our area of responsibility, won over local farmers by spontaneously shedding his equipment and helping them dig irrigation ditches one day while on patrol. Rolando, who'd taught himself Pashto using an MP3 player, chatted amiably with the local men he encountered. The respect he showed them helped to win their support in our fight against the Taliban. While nation-building under fire certainly isn't a Peace Corps mission, I saw enterprising Peace Corps volunteers make a deep impact on the communities where they were invited to serve. Dory was assigned to work on a waste-management project in a Dominican migrant farm worker community. It soon became apparent to her that this project would fail. Rather than move to a different community or continue slaving on a doomed effort, she identified a more serious problem that she wouldn't have seen if she hadn't gotten to know this community in the first place. Numerous locally born kids were refused access to education because of their Haitian descent, denied a basic right that they were legally owed. Dory learned to help people negotiate a discriminatory government bureaucracy, ultimately winning documentation for dozens of community members and helping them achieve access to public high schools and a shot at a better living. The Marines and Peace Corps volunteers with whom I served demonstrated more ingenuity, perseverance, and guts than any other group of people I've known. They also possessed a surplus of something that is vanishing from many other parts of American life: humility. Countless Marines I know had put off careers in business, finance and law to play small, almost anonymous parts in tedious and dangerous places. Sometimes the greatest personal achievement was looking out for fellow Marines by training them extra hard or jolting them from their sense of complacency in the final weeks of a deployment. Those sorts of achievements don't always make for sexy copy on a resume, but they are the achievements that can be savored the longest because they resulted in lives saved. Similarly, many of the Peace Corps volunteers I served with gave up good jobs -- as engineers, teachers, IT professionals -- to leave home for a couple of years and find the enduring fulfillment that comes from leaving your comfort zone and improving the lives of strangers you have grown to know better than your neighbors back home. While nothing compares to the risks our servicemen and women take in combat, the Peace Corps isn't exactly a walk to the local playground. Since its inception in 1961, the Peace Corps has lost at least 287 volunteers to disease, road accidents, crime, and other hazards in their host countries. That's more than twice the number of fallen CIA officers, whose sacrifices are properly commemorated by stars etched into Memorial Wall inside their headquarters. Kennedy, shortly after taking office, spoke of an ""immense reservoir"" of American men and women ""anxious to sacrifice their energies and time and toil to the cause of world peace and human progress."" To see many of the best people from that reservoir -- the ones who stopped dreaming of their potential to serve and took real action -- take a look at those volunteers in the Marines and the Peace Corps. I really believe you can find the best of AmericaÂ´s youth serving in each of these organizations. And neither organization squanders that resource. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Will Aurigemma.","Will Aurigemma joined Peace Corps after his active service in Marines ended .

"(CNN) -- He's the face of motion-capture performance. Whether it's as the nefarious and rather grotesque ""Gollum,"" Tintin's beloved best friend and sidekick, the grouchy ""Captain Haddock,"" or more recently the intellectually enhanced chimp ringleader ""Caesar"" from the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise, Andy Serkis is synonymous with the groundbreaking movie technique. Over the years countless fans and fellow actors -- including Serkis' ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" co-star James Franco -- have called for the motion-capture pioneer to receive an Oscar for bringing his characters to life. So far to no avail. Online devotees argue that Serkis' Oscar ""snubs"" come from the fact that the Academy Awards judges are wary of motion-capture performances. Whether or not that is true, not many truly understand how the British actor and other ""mo-cap"" performers achieve such sincerely emotional portrayals of computer-generated protagonists. ""I think our ability to have actors now on stage playing other creatures or on location on set has been fantastic both for the creatures they're portraying and, you know, perhaps the human characters they're playing off in the scene,"" explains Dan Barret, animation supervisor at Weta Digital, the New Zealand-based digital effects firm that worked on ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,"" ""Tintin,"" ""The Hobbit"" and many other blockbusters. ""It's improved performances and opened up a whole lot of opportunities as far as how much work we can get through, how much motion we can get,"" says Barret. ""Generating all of this stuff with key frames can take a long time. It's been a huge revolution."" The motion-capture process begins with actors dressed in slimline, tight-fitting body suits adorned with over 50 strategically placed tracking markers, which allow computers to detect where various body parts are while following the precise movement of the performer. Unlike traditional animated CGI, motion-capture technology is not a frame-by-frame process. It requires actors to perform in the distinctive body suits to provide a fluid model for animators to tweak and transform digitally. While ""mo cap"" performances offer a new level of authenticity, actors still need to use all their skills and training to enhance and make their performances more believable for cinemagoers. And skilled motion-capture performances were key to creating realistic movement in ""Dawn of Planet of the Apes,"" says Barret. ""Apes have a similar physique to humans and a similar weight. It certainly makes that motion a lot more believable. It's not that we couldn't do it ourselves as key-frame animators. It's just that kid of work takes a long time."" He adds: ""(Motion capture) gives us a believable motion a lot quicker and gives us time to concentrate on what we consider more important things, like maybe facial performances and things like that.""

"(CNN) -- Two days after a Philadelphia woman's abduction was captured on video, police say they have a lead across the state line: Someone used her bank card Tuesday morning in Maryland. A male used Carlesha Freeland-Gaither's ATM card at 6:01 a.m. a bank in Aberdeen, Maryland, about a 75-mile drive southwest from the Philadelphia street where she was forced into a car on Sunday night, Philadelphia police Chief Inspector Dennis Wilson told reporters. Wilson didn't say how the card was used or whether cash was withdrawn. But he said surveillance video showed a male ""similar"" to the man who police say dragged and abducted the 22-year-old woman Sunday night. News of that lead came shortly before Freeland-Gaither's family publicly pleaded with whoever took her. ""Please return her. We just want Carlesha returned to us safely,"" her grandmother Ana Mulero said at a news conference with Wilson in Philadelphia. ""Just return her to us. We're her family. She has a family here. We need her."" Police didn't immediately release the bank video. But authorities earlier released a video that they say shows Freeland-Gaither being accosted by an unknown man in Philadelphia's Germantown-Penn Knox area around 9:40 p.m. on Sunday. That video, released Monday, shows a man approaching a woman near an intersection and then grabbing her and dragging her down a street, toward the camera. The released footage doesn't include audio, but a witness reported that Freeland-Gaither yelled for help, police said. The video shows Freeland-Gaither tussling on the ground with her abductor and being forced into a four-door vehicle, which police say may be a gray Ford Taurus. Her glasses and cell phone were dropped onto the road during the struggle. Just before the vehicle pulled away, Freeland-Gaither broke out one of the passenger side windows, police said. Police described the abductor as an unknown black man of medium-heavy build, 25 to 30 years old. The video shows him wearing a dark jacket with a hood, a dark hat and dark pants. Freeland-Gaither's family told CNN affiliate WPVI that she worked as a nurse and was just blocks from her home when she was abducted. Investigators aren't sure whether she knew her abductor, though there's no indication on the Philadelphia surveillance video that she did, Wilson said. Police haven't publicly talked about a possible motive. Authorities initially said the abductor's car had a Pennsylvania license plate, but Wilson said Tuesday that investigators are looking into whether a Maryland plate was on the car's front. The plate isn't readily legible in the video, and police said no witness gave them a plate number. Mulero said her granddaughter lived with her for four years in Maryland before Freeland-Gaither returned to Philadelphia to be with other relatives and pursue a career. Officials are offering rewards of $42,000 for information leading to the case's resolution, including $25,000 from the FBI, which is assisting in the investigation, Wilson said. CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Police: Card used in Aberdeen, Maryland, less than two days after abduction in Philadelphia .

"(CNN) -- A nurse who was quarantined at a hospital in New Jersey after returning from West Africa was released Monday, her attorney said. Kaci Hickox, who told CNN the quarantine was violating her rights, was discharged after testing negative for Ebola. Also on Monday, a 5-year-old boy who recently visited West Africa and had a fever tested negative for the virus in New York, according to health officials. The boy, who was running a temperature,was with his mother at New York's Bellevue Hospital Center, said Dr. Ram Raju, president of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corp., which oversees Bellevue. Nurse to return to Maine . Hickox was put in isolation Friday after returning to New Jersey from a month in Sierra Leone. Her quarantine, part of a days-old policy the governors of New York and New Jersey instituted for all health care workers who've had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa, has been criticized widely by health care experts. On Sunday, she spoke by phone with CNN's Candy Crowley and Elizabeth Cohen. ""This is an extreme that is really unacceptable, and I feel like my basic human rights have been violated,"" Hickox said. She said she was flummoxed as to how New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has no medical training, could describe her as ""obviously ill."" Hickox will return to Maine, and arrangements for her travel are still being worked out, her attorney, Stephen Hyman, told CNN. Hyman said there's a ""legal basis"" to challenge the quarantine policies in New Jersey and in New York, but the nurse isn't sure she wants to do so. Each state has a different quarantine law, said Steven Gravely, an attorney who helped rewrite Virginia's quarantine law so the state could more easily respond to outbreaks. The U.S. Constitution gives states authority over how to approach health matters, though the federal government has control over what happens concerning public health in airports and shipping ports, Gravely said. Mandatory quarantines -- now what? CDC issues new guidelines . On Monday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released updated guidance for people who might have been exposed to the Ebola virus. ""The new guidelines increase the level of protection by outlining different levels of exposure and outlining different public health actions that can be taken for each of those levels of exposure,"" CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told reporters. Someone who had direct contact of infected body fluids, for instance, would be classified as high risk. Someone would be considered low risk if she traveled on an airplane with a person showing symptoms of Ebola. Frieden has long argued against travel restrictions, saying they could hurt the global health community's effort to tamp down the West Africa outbreak. ""We're far from out of the woods. In each of the three heavily affected countries in West Africa, we're seeing definite signs of progress, but still be a long hard fight,"" he said. What states are doing . The director of the CDC said that active 21-day monitoring began Monday in the six states where about 70% of air travelers enter the United States from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, hard-hit countries in West Africa. Those states are New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey and Georgia. The three-week period marks the maximum incubation time for Ebola. State and local officials will maintain daily contact with all travelers from the three affected countries for the entire 21 days after the last possible date of exposure to Ebola virus, Frieden said. Authorities will require travelers to report their temperatures and the presence or absence of Ebola symptoms aside from a fever, he explained, and they will be required to coordinate with public health officials if they intend to travel and to make arrangements to have their temperatures monitored during travel in a manner acceptable to state and local health officials. Read Frieden's full remarks . New York, New Jersey and Illinois say anyone returning from having direct contact with Ebola patients in West Africa will have to be quarantined for 21 days. Maryland officials will monitor the health of all travelers returning from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, Gov. Martin O'Malley's office said. The effort will build on state and local health departments' outreach and monitoring, according to a statement that explains more about the process. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn's office said the quarantine would be a ""home quarantine."" ""This protective measure is too important to be voluntary,"" Quinn said. On Friday, Cuomo and Christie announced a mandatory quarantine for people who had been in West Africa and had contact there with people infected with Ebola. Christie said such returning health care workers who are New Jersey residents could be quarantinefd in their homes as long as they did not have symptoms consistent with Ebola. Christie said Monday that he was glad that Hickox had been released from quarantine. ""The reason she was put in the hospital in the first place was because she was running a high fever and was symptomatic. If you live in New Jersey, you're quarantined in your home. That's always been the policy. If you live outside the state, and you're symptomatic, we're not letting you go onto public transportation. It makes no common sense. The minute she was no longer symptomatic, she was released."" Virginia is implementing an ""active monitoring program"" for all returning passengers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, ""with a special emphasis on returning health care workers,"" Virginia governor's spokesman Brian Coy has said. Should health care workers be quarantined? Could quarantines backfire? Arguments against the quarantines are that they could deter health care workers from traveling to West Africa to fight Ebola and could greatly hurt their livelihoods. ""I'm concerned of the disincentive for the health care workers"" to travel to West Africa, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. ""If I lose three weeks on my return and don't get to do the work I'm supposed to do ... means this wouldn't be workable for me,"" said Dr. John Carlson, a pediatric immunologist at Tulane University. An expert who has studied Ebola for more than a decade, Purdue University's David Sanders, told CNN on Monday that he feels the policy on mandatory quarantines in New York and New Jersey are ""largely political"" rather than medical fact and that leaders are acting based on the desire to calm a panicked public rather than to do what's most beneficial. Doctors Without Borders was even more direct. ""Forced quarantine of asymptomatic health workers returning from fighting the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is not grounded on scientific evidence and could undermine efforts to curb the epidemic at its source,"" the group said. Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is traveling in Ebola-affected nations in West Africa. ""Ambassador Power and the traveling party were obviously aware of the discussions of potential quarantines by state and local officials prior to departure and will, of course, be prepared to abide by requirements upon return. ""That said, they are also in close contact with the CDC, with medical experts and are taking absolutely every precaution to stay safe and to avoid contracting the disease, a risk that pales in comparison to the risk we take if the international community does not take further action,"" said Jen Psaki, spokeswoman for the State Department. Doctor with Ebola at Bellevue . Bellevue Hospital Center is also where Ebola-positive New York doctor Craig Spencer, 33, is in isolation. He is in serious but stable condition Monday, according to Raju. Spencer arrived home in the United States on October 17 after spending time in Guinea. Because he'd had contact with Ebola patients, Spencer took pains to limit his interaction with others, but he did go places and spend time with friends. Spencer's fiancee, Morgan Dixon, had been under quarantine at Bellevue, but doctors said she did not have the virus and has no symptoms, said Jean Weinberg, the city Health Department spokeswoman. ""We learned a lot from Dallas,"" Raju said, referring to all that went wrong in Texas when a Liberian national arrived from West Africa with Ebola and two nurses treating him contracted the virus. According to a hospital worker with direct knowledge of the situation, there were not enough nurses on staff at Bellevue to handle both ICU and Ebola patients, so patients in the adult and pediatric ICU were transferred to NYU Langone Medical Center for further treatment. Pediatric patients were transferred Monday, while the adult patients were transferred over the weekend. They needed the nurses, not the space, the worker said. Elsewhere, a potential Ebola patient was transferred to the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore. ""They are appropriately isolated and receiving further assessment and care,"" the hospital tweeted on Monday. How the Ebola virus spreads . Ebola and the U.S. military . On Sunday, the Pentagon would not say whether it's willing to still send an active-duty military Ebola response team to states ordering mandatory quarantine for Ebola health care workers. The 30-person team finishes training Monday and will then be ready for deployment on 72 hours' notice. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel would have to approve any deployment. On Monday, CNN learned from military officials that Army Maj. Gen. Darryl A. Williams, who's commander of U.S. Army Africa, and about 10 other personnel are now in ""controlled monitoring"" in Italy after landing there following a West Africa trip over the weekend. Italian authorities met Williams' plane ""in full CDC gear,"" an official said, referring to the type of protective equipment health care workers wear when dealing with Ebola. There is no indication that any team members have the virus. They will be monitored for 21 days at a separate location at a U.S. military installation in Vicenza, Italy, according to military officials. It's not yet clear if family members can visit them. ""The Army Chief of Staff has directed a 21-day controlled monitoring period for all redeploying soldiers returning from Operation United Assistance. He has done this out of caution to ensure soldiers, family members and their surrounding communities including host nations are confident that we are taking all steps necessary to protect their health,"" the Army said in a statement.

"Near Suruc, Turkey (CNN) -- Iraqi-Kurdish Peshmerga fighters began arriving in the besieged northern Syrian city of Kobani from Turkey, two witnesses said Thursday, starting what analysts call a largely symbolic reinforcement of fellow Kurds defending the town from ISIS. About 10 Peshmerga fighters entered Kobani from the Turkish border in two vehicles, an activist and a Syrian Kurd fighter told CNN by phone. The 10 are among about 160 Peshmerga troops that are expected to arrive in Kobani after traveling from Iraq through Turkey, bringing heavy weapons, artillery and gear to help Syrian Kurds in a battle against ISIS for control of the border town. ISIS, the Sunni Muslim extremist militant group, has been fighting to take Kobani for about six weeks, hoping to add it to the territory it already captured in parts of Syria and Iraq for what it calls its new independent Islamic nation. Syria has been embroiled in a three-year civil war, with government troops battling ISIS and other rebels elsewhere, leaving Kobani's ethnic Kurds to defend the city, with U.S. airstrikes -- part of a larger U.S.-led coalition effort against ISIS in the region -- intermittently taking out ISIS targets in the area. The supplies and troops, though roughly an infantry company-sized contingent, would boost Kobani's defenders somewhat, given that they've seen few reinforcements since ISIS' siege of the city began in mid-September. The Peshmerga troops join about 200 Syrian rebels who, according to Syrian rebel commander Col. Abdul Jabar, entered Kobani at dawn Wednesday. Peshmerga troops -- Kurds who defend northern Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region -- are no strangers to ISIS, having battled them often this year as the militant group tries to expand its Iraqi territory. Tens of thousands of civilians fled Kobani and surrounding areas into Turkey to avoid the fighting. What impact will the Peshmerga fighters have? Though the Syrian Kurds will welcome the Peshmerga, the troop movement doesn't necessarily signal a major shift in the fight, analysts say. ""In terms of a major war that's of some significance to U.S. national security, the arrival of 150 militiamen to an area is probably not of tectonic significance,"" Steve Biddle, a senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN Wednesday. Most tacticians consider Kobani to be of little inherent strategic interest in the fight against ISIS, Washington Institute defense fellow Jeff White said Wednesday. The city has attracted a lot of international media attention, in part because it lies just across the border from Turkey, giving journalists a clear vantage point to report on the battle there. ISIS is also reinforcing its contingent in Kobani, White said, setting out the prospect of a protracted fight over the city. But there is some military significance, analysts say. The fight for Kobani continues to give U.S. and allied forces the opportunity to bloody ISIS there, and to keep its forces tied up, White said. ""As long as the city doesn't fall, it works to the advantage of the U.S. strategy,"" he said. ""The ISIS guys who are fighting in the city aren't available to fight somewhere else."" The Turkish role . With ISIS controlling the Syrian land surrounding Kobani, the Peshmerga's easiest path into the city was through Turkey. And Turkey's decision to let the Peshmerga traverse Turkish territory represented a major policy shift. The Syrian Kurdish fighters, part of the People's Protection Units, or YPG, have ties to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has fought a 30-year guerrilla war against the government of Turkey, where about 20% of the population is Kurdish. Turkey, the European Union and United States consider the PKK a terrorist organization. Earlier this month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the Syrian Kurdish and ISIS militants were ""terrorists."" The Turkish government also has bristled at the United States' efforts to parachute weapons, ammunition and medicine to YPG fighters. But while Turkey did nothing to intervene in Kobani, Kurds protested in Turkish streets. More than 30 people were killed in cities across the country this month as ethnic Kurds clashed with Islamist and nationalist groups, as well as Turkish police. CNN's Raja Razek reported from near Suruc, Turkey, and CNN's Michael Pearson and Jason Hanna reported and wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Gul Tuysuz, Ivan Watson and Zeynep Bilginsoy contributed to this report.","About 10 of an expected 160 Peshmerga fighters enter Kobani, sources say .

"(CNN) -- One of the longest-lasting effects of conflict is one that is all too often hidden away, breaking down social fabric and affecting those it touches for the rest of their lives. Rape and sexual violence are easy to overlook -- private tragedies with public stigmas. According to a new report from Save the Children, children bear the brunt of this unseen crisis, enduring the unthinkable when they are most vulnerable. And sexual violence against children is more common than we dare to think. More than half of the victims of sexual violence are children, according to our report. In places of active or past conflict, from Liberia to Colombia to Afghanistan, children -- both boys and girls -- have been afflicted by this horrendous crime. One study cited in the report shows that in post-conflict Liberia, a staggering 80% of victims of sexual violence were children, and the majority of those had been raped. The time has come to change those horrific numbers, and we are glad to see that G8 leaders have taken a step in the right direction As chair of the G8, the government of the UK is making sexual violence a priority, pledging new funds dedicated to preventing rape in places of conflict, and to make sure that those who survive it are given the care and treatment they need and deserve. Read more: G8 nations pledge action to halt sexual violence in war . The scale of the problem is staggering -- in so many conflicts, sexual violence is adding to an already terrifying situation for children. Earlier this week, I spoke to a working group for the U.N. Security Council about the threat of sexual violence facing Syrian children, who have already been uprooted by a bloody two-year old conflict. Save the Children spoke to girls from Mali who saw their friends raped and killed by armed men; children in the Congo subjected to vicious sexual attacks in recent fighting around Goma; and mothers in Colombia whose young children had been raped as the rule of law broke down around them. This problem is not isolated, something happening in just one corner of the world, but instead a troubling pattern that we have seen in too many places. Male victims, often young boys, have been overlooked when it comes to sexual violence, despite evidence that attacks on them, especially in war zones, are significant -- and go unreported. We need to face the full scale of sexual violence so that all children, boys or girls, receive that protection and support. Tackling this problem means shifting attitudes toward sexual violence in war. Where help is available, it is often geared toward the needs of adults. We know in any conflict, children are the most vulnerable, and their needs are unique. Our report cites the devastation -- physical and psychological -- that sexual violence inflicts on the young. With proper support, we can help them heal. The problem is not an easy one to tackle, but it must be done. Funding for protection of children in conflict zones has been difficult to secure. It is not as easy to show as items like food and tents, things that donors can see and grasp easily. Child protection in humanitarian crises is consistently the least funded area of humanitarian response. This pledge will help it get the resources a problem of this magnitude deserves. It is imperative that we continue to demand that this changes. Survivors are often too afraid or embarrassed to speak out on what they have been through, sometimes isolated from their communities and lacking confidence those who abused them will face justice. We must be vocal in insisting that their needs be met. Those needs won't be met overnight, but on Thursday, G8 leaders took a bold step to combat this grave violation of children's rights. Ensuring proper resources and attention are given this critical issue is the first step in fighting this widespread crime against children. The opinions expressed in this commentary are soley those of Carolyn Miles.","Sexual violence is often treated as a private tragedy with a public stigma, Carolyn Miles says .

"New York (CNN) -- Embattled NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell apologized Friday for what he said was his mishandling of the Ray Rice domestic violence scandal but vowed ""now I will get it right and will do whatever is necessary to accomplish that."" Speaking at a Manhattan news conference amid calls for his resignation, Goodell announced a sweeping policy to counter domestic abuse and sexual assault, mandating all players and staff on the league's 32 teams undergo education and training about how to prevent abuse. The announcement came as critics have questioned why Goodell hadn't taken a tougher stand earlier. That would have sent an unequivocal statement about domestic violence in a league that, according to a Sports Illustrated article last week, includes 14 players who have been arrested for violence against women in the past two years. Others have called for his job. But Goodell, in his first public remarks in more than a week, said he would not step down and was committed to ""do the right thing."" Goodell says he won't quit . ""I'm focused on doing my job,"" he told reporters. ""We have a lot of work to do."" The policy is a direct response to a number of high-profile cases, including Rice's, that involve NFL players. Even as Goodell pledged to move ahead and ""get it right,"" questions loom in the Rice case about who knew what when, and who said what to whom. Two security camera videos put the Rice case squarely in the public view, with the one most recently made public showing the former Baltimore Ravens' star knocking out his then-fiancee with a punch inside an elevator last February. A source within the Ravens organization told CNN Friday that hours after that incident at the Revel hotel and casino in Atlantic City, the head of Baltimore Ravens security, Darren Sanders, spoke with Atlantic City police. In that conversation, police described in detail the inside-the-elevator video to Sanders, the source said. ESPN reported that Sanders shared the details of that conversation and the description of the video with team executives in Baltimore. ESPN also reported team executives -- in particular owner Steve Bisciotti, President Dick Cass, and GM Ozzie Newsome -- began extensive public and private campaigns pushing for leniency for Rice on several fronts, from the Atlantic County judicial system to Goodell. A source in the Ravens organization told CNN that team officials never saw the elevator video until TMZ released the recording. The Ravens issued this statement late Friday: ""The ESPN.com 'Outside the Lines' article contains numerous errors, inaccuracies, false assumptions and, perhaps, misunderstandings. The Ravens will address all of these next week in Baltimore after our trip to Cleveland for Sunday's game against the Browns."" Commissioner: 'I got it wrong' Asked Friday about a claim by the Atlantic County prosecutor's office that it has no record of an NFL request for information on the case, Goodell said, ""We gather almost entirely all of our information through law enforcement, and that's something else we're going to look at ... We asked for it on several occasions. According to our security department, we went through it, we asked for it on several occasions."" The commissioner also sought to further distance himself from criticism over his handling of the Rice matter, saying the account of the incident the player gave the NFL was different than what was depicted in a video. ""I'm telling you right now it's inconsistent with what he told us,"" Goodell said, declining to comment further on grounds that Rice's indefinite suspension is under appeal by the players union. Goodell . Goodell said the events of recent weeks highlighted much of what is wrong with the league. ""I got it wrong in the handling of the Ray Rice matter and I'm sorry for that,"" he said. ""I'm not satisfied with the way we handled it from the get-go. I made a mistake. I'm not satisfied with the process we went through. I'm not satisfied with the conclusion."" Katie Ray-Jones, president and CEO of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, told CNN after Goodell's remarks that the league made a multimillion dollar commitment to the hotline. Retired quarterback criticizes NFL . ""He's admitting that he made a mistake and he's working to correct it and they're engaging many voices,"" she said of Goodell and the league. But NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton on CNN Friday said he was doubtful of the league's willingness to deal with domestic violence and other troubles. ""Are we going to allow men to knock out women, abuse women, knock out children and we're going to have to wait six months to get spin control and get some people in here and buy out some more people?"" he said. ""I played for 18 years in this league. I've seen coverups in this league just like we see in Washington and on Wall Street. And it continues."" Goodell, once viewed as a no-holds-barred enforcer who was called in to clean house, levied a mere two-game suspension against Rice, based on an initial video from outside the elevator that only showed Rice dragging Palmer out. Later, the new footage that showed the punch prompted Goodell to suspend the veteran player indefinitely. Last week, amid mounting criticism, the league announced that former FBI Director Robert Mueller will lead an independent inquiry into the league's investigation and how it gathered evidence in the case. NOW: Mueller appointment 'window dressing' Goodell on Friday dismissed questions about whether Mueller's involvement with a law firm that has dealings with the league compromised the former FBI director's investigation. The National Organization for Women called Mueller's appointment ""just window dressing,"" saying it didn't go far enough, and repeated its call for Goodell to resign. It's been a tumultuous week for the man at the helm of the NFL. With Ray Rice suspended indefinitely, the league saw three more of its players come under scrutiny over domestic violence or child abuse allegations. Two of those players were deactivated for their Sunday games. Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings was deactivated after an East Texas grand jury indicted him on a child abuse charge. Peterson's lawyer has said his client is innocent, and the Minnesota Vikings' owners announced that Peterson will return to practice this week and is scheduled to play Sunday. ""While I am disappointed in what Adrian Peterson was involved with, we want to see the facts,"" Goodell told reporters on Friday. ""What we have to do is allow those facts to succeed.""

"Dandong, China (CNN) -- The sun is rising over the Yalu River and North Korea. Revolutionary music pumped through loudspeakers wafts over to China. Back across the river, work groups can be seen stirring for a day's toil in the fields. Over here in China, a tourist tout is trying to sell us North Korean currency. ""Good price!"" he shouts. This is daily life in Dandong, China -- a thriving border town within throwing distance of the Hermit Kingdom. Tourists often do just that when they go right up to the fence that separates the two countries and leave cigarettes, old watches and other goodies for the North Korean border guards. Signs all along the border warn against throwing goods over the fence, as if it's some kind of zoo. And, in a way, that's what it has become. Chinese tourists now flock to Dandong -- which lies along China's western border with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea -- to ogle at their unfortunate neighbors. Some pay a few RMB to borrow binoculars to peer across the river, while the more adventurous take speedboats and pleasure cruises out on the river, which acts a natural barrier between the two neighbors. ""Go inside North Korea!"" a sign for one local boat company proclaims. Perhaps the Chinese come to marvel at how far they have come. With decades of breakneck growth, Communist China has become a testament to capitalism and urban living. North Korea, which also describes itself as a socialist state, is still sealed and secretive -- almost. Lifeline . Dandong is the lifeline, say critics, of the autocratic regime led by Kim Jong Un. Whole neighborhoods in the back streets of the city are lined with trading shops quietly run by North Korean officials. China is North Korea's largest trading partner by a long way, and despite Beijing's official displeasure with the DPRK's pursuit of nuclear weapons, this trade continues to grow. China has rebuffed any attempts to strengthen economic sanctions further against Pyongyang. Up to 70% of all China trade with North Korea runs through Dandong, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, and it takes the form of both legal trade and illegal smuggling. We meet ""Chen,"" a smuggler who makes a midnight run across the Yalu several times a month to trade with North Korean soldiers. ""In China we don't lack food, we don't lack things,"" he says. ""People can eat and have clothes on their backs, but not over there, even the North Korean soldiers have nothing."" Despite North Korean propaganda that paints a picture of their military as an elite fighting force, Chen says the soldiers are desperate for basic food such as bread and rice. They don't have money so they barter with scrap metals, old pots and even ginseng. But Chen says he can never trade with ordinary North Koreans, the soldiers wouldn't allow it. North Korean spies . We can't use Chen's real name, he claims that Dandong is crawling with North Korean spies. ""Don't say anything sensitive around the North Korean waitresses,"" he whispers to us. ""They speak Korean and English."" And you can find them all across Dandong in North Korean themed restaurants, karaoke bars, and musical review shows. We head to one of the more famous ones along the river. If refugees are caught trying to escape from North Korea, they are shot, but in restaurants like this gaudy two-story tourist trap, North Koreans are allowed to work in China on special three-year permits. They are often the children of mid-level Korean Workers' Party loyalists and their movements and earnings are tightly controlled. And as the four-piece all-female North Korean band plays to the Chinese tourists drinking North Korean beer, I think how perfectly it sums up this city: extremely bizarre and perhaps a little tragic.","Dandong is a thriving Chinese border town within throwing distance of North Korea .

"(CNN) -- Gov. Jay Nixon is criticizing the ""over-militarization"" of the police response to protests that have been spurred by the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Nixon appeared on most of the political talk shows on Sunday, calling the tactics of the St. Louis County Police ""aggressive"" and expressed relief that the Justice Department is conducting its own investigation into the young man's death on August 9. ""There are times when force is necessary, but we really felt that push at that time was a little aggressive, obviously, and those images were not what we were trying to get to,"" he said on ABC's ""This Week,"" referring to the policing using heavily armored military vehicles. ""And in those situations where folks are rolling up heavily armored and they're pointing guns at folks, that's impossible to have a dialogue,"" Nixon said. The governor, however, offered praise for members of the community who have been protesting Brown's killing during an encounter with police. Despite a shooting that left one person wounded and the arrest of seven people after a midnight curfew went into effect Saturday night, Nixon said the curfew was implemented peacefully and mostly without incident. ""Thousands of people spoke last night. Thousands of people marched and not a single gunshot fired by a member of law enforcement last night, and the members of community (were) tremendous helpful last night to get through what could have been a very difficult night,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" After days of heavily armed police patrolled the streets of Ferguson with a heavy hand and periodic use of force, Nixon ordered Missouri State Highway Patrol to take over the police response on Thursday. The head of the Highway Patrol, Capt. Ronald Johnson, is African-American and from the area. He took a different approach than police and dramatically softened the aggressive stance. Critical words about harsh tactics . Nixon is the latest politician to criticize police tactics that created a war zone atmosphere in Ferguson, a town of 22,000 near St. Louis. Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill said Thursday the situation needs to be ""demilitarized,"" and on the same day, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is considering a presidential run, released an opinion piece on Time's website saying many police departments around the country are too militarized. Democratic Rep. Lacy Clay, who represents Ferguson in Congress, said on ""State of the Union"" Sunday that ""a militarized police force facing down innocent protesters with sniper rifles and machine guns is totally unacceptable in America."" U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, also agreed that the reaction of police to protests was imbalanced. ""It appears that they may have reacted a little quickly on that force continuum when they decided to deal with ... the protesters,"" he said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation."" While Bernard Kerik, a former New York City Police commissioner, said the show of force was too excessive while protestors peacefully demonstrated, he said the police have a responsibility to protect personal property. ""You can't let thugs take over the city. We saw that the other day. The police had to respond,"" he said on CNN, referring to instances of looting. On police militarization in general, Kerik said the increased militarization of the police started in the 1990s during the height of the war on drugs and continued after the 9/11 attacks and has continued because of mass shootings in schools and public places. ""It's absolutely needed,"" he said. In tense Ferguson, trying to balance security, protesters' rights . The legal process . Accounts of exactly what happened when Officer Darren Wilson confronted Brown on August 9 vary widely. Police said Brown struggled with the officer and reached for his weapon. Several witnesses said Brown raised his hands and was not attacking the officer. Nixon also criticized the Police Department's release of a convenience store surveillance video that shows a man fitting Brown's description allegedly stealing a box of cigars just before Brown was killed. Nixon said he was ""unaware"" the tape was going to be released and ""we certainly were not happy."" Nixon said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" that the tape release is an attempt to ""besmirch a victim"" and ""to tarnish him."" ""It appeared to, you know, cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street,"" he added on ""This Week."" Nixon also raised doubts about the special prosecutor in charge of the case, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, who has been asked by Ferguson community leaders, including Rep. Clay, to step aside because of what people say is his impartiality toward the police. ""He's an experienced prosecutor. And this is his opportunity to step up,"" Nixon said on CNN of McCulloch, who has been in the position since 1991. ""It's important we get this right. This is a big matter."" McColloch has defended the police response and slammed Nixon for sidelining the Police Department and putting the Highway Patrol in charge of security, calling the move ""shameful,"" according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Offering little confidence to the local investigation, Nixon said he is pleased that the Justice Department is conducting its own parallel inquiry, noting that the FBI is sending 40 investigators. ""That's the kind of independent, external, national review and investigation of this that I think will assist everyone in making sure we get to justice,"" he said. Nixon's criticism of the Police Department and shaky confidence of the local prosecutor Sunday comes as the Department of Justice announced a second, independent autopsy would be conducted on Brown's body. The healing process . As the people of Ferguson seek answers and demand a fair investigation, the factor of race has once again become part of a national discussion that cuts deeply. ""We all know there's been a long history of challenges in these areas (of Missouri),"" Nixon said. ""And our hope is that, with the help of the people here, that we can be an example of getting justice and getting peace and using that to move forward."" But Nixon admitted that it will be a challenge because of ""deep, long-term wounds"" that won't be easy to heal. Actor and activist Jesse Williams discussed a dark history that black Americans face. ""Police have been beating the hell out of black people for a very, very, very long time before the advent of the video camera and despite the advent of the video camera there are still a lot of incredible trend of police brutality and killing in the street and justice is never served,"" said the ""Grey's Anatomy"" actor and board member of the civil rights organization The Advancement Project. On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, who was an instrumental figure in the civil rights movement, called on the police chief and Ferguson's mayor to ""literally apologize to the community."" Michael Eric Dyson, professor at Georgetown University, said he wants more leadership from President Barack Obama, the country's first black President who was a community organizer in predominately African-American neighborhoods of Chicago. ""This President knows better than most what happens in poor communities that have been antagonized historically by the hostile relationship between black people and the Police Department,"" he said on CBS. ""We need presidential leadership. He needs to step up to the plate and be responsible."" The White House said the President was briefed on the situation in Ferguson again Sunday morning, and he is scheduled to meet with Attorney General Eric Holder at the White House on Monday.

The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Viewer discretion is advised. (VBS.TV) -- For this installment of the Vice Guide to Film series, VBS co-founder Shane Smith traveled to Texas, Tijuana and Mexico City to immerse himself in the seedy, fast-paced, and vastly prolific and amusing world of films inspired by -- and often funded by -- Mexico's ultraviolent drug cartels, a genre known as narco cinema. Mexico has long been the superhighway of drugs into North America. It supplies most of the meth, marijuana, cocaine and poppy derivatives consumed in the United States, and today the Mexican drug trade is a $100 billion a year industry. About 30 percent of this figure is reported to be repurposed as bribes to government officials and law enforcement. It's really no surprise at all that drugs permeate every level of Mexican society, from religion (yes, there is a patron saint of drug trafficking) to music, and film is by far one of the most naturally gratifying mediums for the fictitious high-flying antics of outlaw traffickers. Today there is a constant flow of B-movie releases featuring drug dealers, good cops, bad cops, women, cocaine and a lot of big trucks. These films love big trucks. See the rest of Mexican narco cinema at VBS.TV . Narco cinema was born in the 1980s, taking a cue from the B-movie tradition of the Mexican cinema of the '60s and '70s. The movement soon turned to action, guns, trucks, cars, explosions, women, and drugs. Because 82 percent of the Mexican population can't afford to see these films, cheap, straight-to-video accessibility helped it become increasingly popular. Watching these films is now a national pastime. Shane decided he needed to be in one of these movies. In time he found Enrique Morillo, one of the biggest directors in the industry, who happened at the time to be shooting two sequels to his hit ""Chrysler 300"" (while the eponymous vehicle is a sedan and not a truck, it does get chased by a lot of trucks in this franchise). Morillo invited Shane to the shoot and to play a role. Shane accepted, picked up a python-skin jacket and cowboy hat and hired a band to sing drug-running songs about him for moral support. Narcocorridos, as these types of songs are called, are the musical equivalent of narco cinema, and are often the basis for many popular films.","VBS crew explores ""seedy"" film genre funded by Mexican drug cartels .

"Washington (CNN) -- The tight Senate race in Iowa just won't budge. The race opposing Republican Joni Ernst and Democrat Bruce Braley is still locked in a dead heat according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday. Ernst just barely edges out her Democratic rival by two points 45-43, a lead that keeps her within the poll's margin of error. The contest could tilt the balance of power in Washington in a year when Republicans are favored to take back the Senate. The results from the survey of 967 likely voters in Iowa echoes the two other nonpartisan polls in this month which also showed Ernst with a razor-thin one- to two-point edge. In Iowa, a fight for 2014's early voters . Now, the two candidates will fight for undecided voters and the 10 percent of likely voters who said they could still change their mind before Nov. 4. And while the overall numbers don't appear to be shifting, Braley's camp can look to the pulse of Independents for a campaign pick-me-up less than three weeks away from Election Day. The poll revealed a big swing in independent support, with Braley converting a seven-point deficit in Quinnipiac's September poll into a five-point lead among the key voter bloc. Braley now leads with independents 48% to Ernst's 43%. Green issues at the center of closely watched debate in Iowa Senate race . Braley also continued to pick up support among women, who favor him over his female GOP foe by a 13-point margin. Ernst, meanwhile, kept her lead among men at a 56% to Braley's 39%. ""Voters are choosing partisanship over gender when it comes to making their ballot choice,"" Quinnipiac University Polling Director Peter Brown said in a release. Ernst will look to pick up on the benefits of votes voting for the same party down the ballot as Republican Gov. Terry Branstad is expected to slide cleanly through the polls. Branstad has a 15-point lead according to the Quinnipiac poll. Hambycast: Branstad's mustachioed superstition exposed .","The latest poll in the Iowa Senate race shows the contest is still a dead heat.

"(CNN) -- ""Let me be clear: I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me,"" Apple CEO Timothy D. Cook wrote in an essay published early Thursday by Bloomberg Businessweek. Within hours, the announcement was headlining newspapers all over the world (""Fier d'Ãªtre gay,"" proclaimed Le Figaro) and trending on Twitter. Cook's news caps a year of achievements for the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community and its supporters: Gay marriage is now legal in 32 states and the District of Columbia; the NFL drafted its first openly gay player; and a trans woman graced the cover of New York magazine as the nation's highest-paid female executive. Even the Pope praised committed gay relationships. Yet workplace discrimination and its ripple effects remain daunting hurdles for many LGBT individuals. Despite advances in workplace acceptance, over half (53%) of LGBT workers remain closeted at the office, according to a 2014 Human Rights Campaign survey. While many companies excel at publicizing pro-LGBT policies and positions externally, there's an ongoing need for company leaders to promote and act on them internally. After all, the enduring key to the success of LGBT employees is organizations' underlying cultures. Research from the Center for Talent Innovation shows that allies -- people who support LGBT colleagues or work as advocates -- play a decisive role in creating an inclusive community where individuals are comfortable being themselves. CTI data finds that LGBT employees are 1.2 times more likely to be out at companies where straight senior executives express their support publicly (that's 47% versus 21%). In fact, 24% of LGBT workers surveyed attribute their decision to come out professionally to a strong network of allies. Although the ally phenomenon is widespread and growing -- 70% of men and 83% of women consider themselves allies, according to the CTI survey-- far fewer people qualify as ""active allies,"" willing to openly support LGBT colleagues in the workplace. Employers have numerous opportunities to help strengthen ""the ally effect"" by creating networks that invite straight colleagues to support their LGBT co-workers, by sponsoring LGBT individuals and groups, participating in company events, or simply displaying some sort of ally identification in their workspace. Openly gay senior executives being visibly out at work makes a difference as well. LGBT employees are 85% more likely to be out at companies where senior executives are out (24% versus 13%). Being able to be out has measurable benefits. Earlier CTI research found that out LGBTs are more satisfied with their rate of career advancement and more engaged at work; conversely, closeted employees are 73% more likely to say they plan to leave their companies within three years. LGBT employees aren't the only beneficiaries of an inclusive workplace. Employers benefit, too. With LGBT buying power comprising $830 billion in the U.S. alone, companies bolster their bottom line by building and sustaining connections to this large and expanding market. Inclusive companies find that publicizing their support of LGBT equality boosts their standing among consumers across the board: 71% of LGBT adults said they are likely to remain loyal to a brand they believe to be very friendly to the LGBT community even when less-friendly companies may offer lower prices or be more convenient. Further, three-quarters of heterosexuals and 87% of LGBTs said they would consider choosing a brand known to provide equal workplace benefits. LGBT employees are crucial to reaching this market, as CTI's recent research on Innovation, Diversity, and Market Growth reveals. Companies that employ and leverage diverse talent, including employees with LGBT smarts and an understanding of the LGBT global market, better understand their end-users and produce novel solutions for diverse consumer -- if there are allies on the team who make that representative feel secure about raising ideas and sharing insights. The ultimate dividend: the combination of a diverse workforce and leaders who get that diversity makes companies measurably more innovative. Employees are 75% more likely to see their ideas implemented in the marketplace, according to the CTI study. In addition, firms are 70% more likely than non-diverse publicly traded companies to capture new markets. Tim Cook's announcement signals a fundamental -- and welcome -- shift in our attitudes toward LGBT issues at work. Still, as he points out in his essay, ""... there are laws on the books in a majority of states that allow employers to fire people based solely on their sexual orientation. There are many places where landlords can evict tenants for being gay, or where we can be barred from visiting sick partners and sharing in their legacies. Countless people, particularly kids, face fear and abuse every day because of their sexual orientation."" In short, we can't declare victory until announcements like Tim Cook's are not considered headline news.","Sylvia Hewlett: Tim Cook announced he's gay, capping year of LGBT achievements .

"Washington (CNN) -- The White House continued to rebuff demands from Republican lawmakers to name an Ebola ""czar"" Monday, saying the current strategy headed by a top adviser allows the government to more effectively prevent the virus' spread. Even on the Columbus Day federal holiday, the White House was keen to demonstrate its handle on the Ebola crisis, scheduling a briefing for President Barack Obama with senior officials on a new case of Ebola in Dallas and inviting cameras to document it. On Sunday, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, became the latest in a line of lawmakers to insist that Obama appoint a single person in his administration to shepherd federal resources toward combating Ebola, which health officials said over the weekend had infected a second person in Dallas. McCain told CNN's Candy Crowley on Sunday that ""there has to be some kind of czar"" focused on preventing Ebola from spreading in the United States, a markedly different stance from the Arizona Republican's 2009 view that Obama had ""more czars than the Romanovs."" ""My constituents are not comforted,"" he said on ""State of the Union."" ""There has to be more reassurance given to them. I would say that we don't know exactly who's in charge."" A senior administration official on Monday said no plans were in place to make such an appointment. Obama's top homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, remains responsible for coordinating the administration's response to the Ebola crisis, the White House said. ""Our response needs to be as nimble and as bureaucratically lean as possible in order to bring the overseas epidemic under control and respond efficiently and effectively here at home. We will make any adjustments we feel to be necessary,"" the official said. Over the weekend, Monaco briefed Obama on the latest Ebola case in Dallas, where a nurse contracted the disease after treating an African patient who later died. Obama also phoned Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell, insisting that federal officials reiterate proper safety protocols to hospitals. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials have said the latest Ebola infection in Dallas could have stemmed from the improper use of protective equipment. Liberal group 'cuts' midterm Ebola ad blaming GOP . After the new case was revealed, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee said patients in the U.S. should all be transferred to specialized biocontainment centers that have been rigorously prepared to treat Ebola cases. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi said the circumstances surrounding the nurse in Dallas raise the question of ""whether ordinary hospitals that may not have had specialized training on caring for seriously ill patients safely should be responsible for the long-term care of an Ebola patient when there are beds available in one of our nation's biocontainment units."" ""That's a decision we're leaving to the medical professionals,"" the administration official said of Thompson's proposal. ""We plan to follow their recommendations. To date, they have not made such a recommendation.""","Obama is set to meet with senior officials Monday to discuss the latest Ebola case .

"(CNN) -- One American defense contract worker was killed and another was lightly injured in a shooting at a gas station in Saudi Arabia's capital on Tuesday, a U.S. State Department official said. The two were at a gas station in Riyadh when a gunman opened fire on their car, the country's official news agency reported, citing police in the city. The Saudi Embassy in the United States identified the suspected gunman as Abdulaziz Fahad Abdulaziz Alrashid, 24, a dual Saudi-American citizen who had worked at the same U.S. defense contractor as the victims. He was recently dismissed from the job ""due to drug related issues,"" the Embassy said. Alrashid was reportedly taken into custody following a shootout with security forces, which left him injured. Neither the Americans' names nor information about a possible motive was immediately released. The injured American was taken to a hospital, the Saudi Press Agency reported. The Americans worked for Vinnell Arabia, a U.S. defense contractor supporting the Saudi Arabia National Guard, and were about a half-mile from a Vinnell base when the shooting happened, the State Department official said. Vinnell Arabia, partly owned by U.S.-based Northup Grumman Corp., has helped to train Saudi national guard troops since 1975. It says it has more than 1,250 employees, some of whom are former U.S. troops. More than half of the employees are Saudis, the company says on its website.

Spinello, 77, told the Huffington Post that he needs $25,000 in oral surgery. ""John has had a good life, but has admitted to us that he is struggling to pay his bills and is in need of a medical procedure without sufficient insurance coverage,"" professional game inventors Tom Walsh and Peggy Brown wrote on Crowdrise. ""We launched this Crowdrise fundraiser to call on anyone who has ever played and loved Operation to send John a note and maybe, a monetary gift of appreciation."" Fans can also purchase an autographed copy of the classic game in honor of its upcoming 50th anniversary. Spinello was paid $500 for ""Operation,"" which he sold to a toy invention firm, according to the website ILoveOperation.com. Because of the deal he cut, Walsh says, he was not entitled to royalties from the game. ""Operation"" was originally licensed to Milton Bradley. The fundraiser page has surpassed its $25,000 goal by more than $4,000. We just hope Spinello's doctors are better at his game than we ever were. x .","NEW: Hasbro has offered to purchase John Spinello's original ""Operation"" prototype .

"(CNN) -- In case you've avoided reading what may be the more depressing reports in the history of the natural world, the awful take-away is basically this: Half the animals of planet Earth have disappeared since 1970, and much of it is the fault of humans. Yep, you read that right. Half of the world's vertebrate animal populations are gone. And it happened in only the span of two generations, according the Living Planet Report, which was published on Tuesday by the environmental group WWF, in collaboration with the Global Footprint Network, Water Footprint Network and the Zoological Society of London. ""In other words,"" the report says, ""vertebrate species populations across the globe are, on average, about half the size they were 40 years ago."" ^%&*! That's mind-blowingly infuriating. And it's worse for some species and regions, in particular. The report overall considers 10,380 populations of 3,038 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish, and says populations have declined by 52% between 1970 and 2010. But for freshwater fish and other species, the drop is 76%. And for for species in the Neotropics, which includes Central and South America, the decline is 83%. Just wow. Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF, writes that, ""This has to make us stop and think."" He's correct, of course. But we can't stop at the thinking. We need prompt, dramatic action. The report says that we need 1Â½ Earths in order to ""meet the demands humanity currently makes on nature."" That means we need to consume less, waste less, farm more efficiently, use water in a much smarter way and reduce our overall footprint. We need to stop chopping down forests and work to repair those that are gone. The majority of people now lives in cities (54%, according to the World Health Organization), which is a fine enough trend, but those cities need to become drastically smarter. Sprawl must be left in the rear-view mirror of our former SUVs. All that, and we must take swift action to curb carbon pollution. The massive rallies around the recent UN climate summit should make that clear. ""Climate change has already been linked to the population decline and possible extinction of a number of amphibian species in the Neotropics and in Australia,"" the Living Planet Report says. ""In the Arctic, the effects of a rapidly warming climate have been suggested as likely causes of decline in body condition and numbers in many polar bear and caribou populations."" This stuff is depressing, but the report does offer signs of hope. It relays a case study from Belize, for example, which started estimating the financial value of protecting ecological resources, particularly those along the coast. ""Belize's coastal and ocean ecosystems provide services worth up to $559 million per year -- equivalent to 43% of GDP,"" the report says. Facts like that make it clear why there's a financial as well as moral incentive to protect our remaining natural resources. The authors cite wind farms in Denmark as another success. ""December 2013 marked a significant milestone, when wind power provided an equivalent of 57.4% of Denmark's electricity consumption -- the first time ever that wind power supplied more than half of a country's electricity needs for a whole month. December 21 set another record, with wind turbines generating the equivalent of 102% of Danish electricity consumption,"" the authors write. I'm glad those positive notes are included -- because there's a real risk of reading too much doom and gloom into this report. I called up Stuart Pimm, Doris Duke professor of conservation ecology at Duke University, and found he shares that point of view. Pimm is an author of a study, published earlier this year, that found species are disappearing at a rate ""1,000 times faster than they should be,"" as he put it. But things aren't as bad as the WWF report makes it sound, he said. ""Overall, there is no question that the status of biodiversity is going down -- that things are not improving,"" he told me. ""That said, I'm not a fan of this Living Planet Index. The reason is it sort of mixes up apples and oranges and lots of other fruit, too, for that manner. It's a little difficult to unpack exactly what it means. There are many people in the media who assumed it means 50% of species have gone extinct in the last 40 years -- and that's not true."" Instead, the report claims 50% of some vertebrate populations have disappeared. But a single species could still exist with a smaller population size. Assessing individual ecosystems and species is more useful, he said. The risk of considering so many species -- and so many types of data -- in a single report, Pimm said, is that it can make action seem impossible. And, for him and others, that's not the case. There's much to be done. We can set aside protected habitats, put firm caps on carbon emissions, break up gangs that trade in illegal wildlife parts and continue to fund scientific exploration to ensure their safety and continued viability. Pimm highlighted a number of conservation success stories, including the fact that Brazil has reduced deforestation drastically in recent years -- and that the world has made strides in protecting ecosystems. The world has set targets to protect 17% for ""terrestrial and inland water"" ecosystems, and 10% for ""coastal and marine areas."" We should move urgently in that direction. The point is that we know which direction to move in. It's bad out there, but it's sure not hopeless. We need to celebrate the species that remain -- from the penguin to the pangolin (especially the pangolin) -- and commit to a path of global economic development that embraces the intrinsic and economic value of the natural world. This report -- and a host of others -- shouldn't be a total downer. They should be read as a clarion call for action.","WWF report: Vertebrate populations decline by 52% since 1970 .

"Swiftwater, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Scared. Anxious. And more than a little surprised. That's how residents of northeast Pennsylvania are feeling some six weeks into the search for suspected cop killer Eric Matthew Frein. Frein, 31, is accused in the September 12 ambush shooting that left Cpl. Bryon Dickson dead and Trooper Alex T. Douglass wounded outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove. He has eluded capture despite a massive manhunt around Canadensis, Pennsylvania, where his family has a home. Late last week and early this week, Frein was reportedly spotted in a wooded area in the town of Swiftwater, about 8 miles southeast of the Canadensis area. ""It's kind of scary -- a little bit nerve-wracking -- because we live so close to it,"" said Marissa Labarre, who rode the bus to school with Frein when they were children. Now, she drives a bus for the Pocono Mountain School District, which closed schools Tuesday because of the search for Frein. Labarre remembered him as quiet, but not ""weird,"" and definitely not the type of person you'd expect to kill a cop. ""You hear of stuff like this, but you never know the person, or it's like hours from you. You know, it's on the news but it's not ever close to home. So it's a little bit scary,"" said Labarre. 'Ready for a fight' The hunt for Frein has turned life upside down for people inside the search area. Helicopters buzz overhead and police seem to be everywhere, all the time. ""Every night, every day, but mostly at night, the helicopters would be flying over our house, waking us up at 1 o'clock in the morning,"" said Cory Batzel, in Swiftwater. He said he's not afraid, except at night, when he believes Frein might be on the move. ""During the day, there's too many police around and too much action going on,"" Batzel said. Michael Myron described the presence of law enforcement in Swiftwater as ""constant."" The area is typically quiet. ""Big armored cars, and the police have all their vests and stuff on so they're, like, ready for a fight it looks like to me,"" he said. Police have not spoken about a possible motive, other than that Frein has talked and written about hating law enforcement. Authorities have said a review of a computer hard drive used by Frein shows that he had planned the attack for years. The manhunt has already cost several million dollars. It has involved as many as 1,000 officers at times, some from other states. ""I didn't expect him to last out there this long,"" Myron said about Frein, a self-styled survivalist. ""But he must be, you know, prepared more than I thought or, you know, a lot of people thought. We didn't think he would make it this long. We didn't think it'd go this long."" 'Rather ... safe than sorry' The search for Frein landed on one Swiftwater resident's doorstep. Adam Caprioli arrived home from work recently and found his woods flooded with law enforcement. He said officials told him dogs had tracked Frein's scent to Caprioli's back door, but that's as far as it went. ""Supposedly they got the scent to my house, so that does make me feel a little scared but, I mean, the way those guys looked, they were ready to go, so I know if I called 911 and they came here, I'd be safe,"" he said. Frein is familiar with the Swiftwater area, having attended the high school and worked summers at a camp just to the west. Fearing his possible presence, nearby Barrett Township postponed a Halloween parade and canceled trick-or-treating, urging children to celebrate at a local high school instead. Officials who canceled school in the Pocono Mountain School District similarly chose not to take the chance. Parents, in large part, seem to agree that's the right move. ""They could have called us last night and told us, you know, hey school is closed. I could still be laying in bed for another hour,"" a parent of a fifth-grade boy told CNN affiliate WBRE on Tuesday. But, he added: ""I'd rather them be safe than sorry. I mean, if he's in the area they should keep the kids home."" Alexandra Field reported from Swiftwater, Pennsylvania. Dana Ford reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Michael Pearson, Jason Hanna and Shimon Prokupecz also contributed to this report.","Eric Matthew Frein is suspected in the September 12 ambush of two officers .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Well that's that. After one week of mingling with elite Party loyalists, China's Communist leaders have wrapped up their 18th National Congress. The next will be in five years time when the presumptive new president -- Xi Jinping -- delivers his thoughts on the challenges, ambitions and threats facing the world's most populous country. Read our live blog for the latest on China's new leaders . His predecessor Hu Jintao fired a flare on the first day of the Congress about the threat of corruption and its power to potentially bring down China's Communist regime. ""If we fail to handle this issue well, it could prove fatal to the party, and even cause the collapse of the party and the fall of the state,"" he told delegates. China's next leaders: Who's who . CNN asked five experts to explain what they see to be China's most pressing challenge. It's by no means a complete list, presented in no particular order. 1. Factional divisions . Plenty of analysis has accompanied this year's Congress as to the fine -- and not so fine -- lines that split the ideologies and loyalties of the members of the Politburo Standing Committee. But will any fracture lines be enough to tilt the Party towards reform? China commentator Willy Lam weighs in, noting that ""even before the birth of the People's Republic in 1949, factions within the party had fought over the future direction of the country."" The ""struggle between two lines"" during Mao's rule has morphed into divisions according to family ties to revolutionary leaders and guidance from powerful mentors. ""Since the early 1990s, three major factions have emerged within the party: the Shanghai faction led by ex-president Jiang Zemin, the Communist Youth League (CYL) faction led by President Hu Jintao, and the ""Gang of Princelings"" -- a reference to the offspring of party elders -- led by president-in-waiting Xi Jinping. What's the potential for one to win out?  Lam explains. 2. More spending, less saving . In 2011, a team of researchers led by economist Li Gan started asking questions to compile the most comprehensive study so far of household wealth in China. They found that the top 10% of income earners are sitting on most of the wealth. The low savings rate of most Chinese households surveyed suggest they simply don't have the money to spend. To move toward a consumer-based economy, therefore, raising the income -- and spending -- levels for the poor is key. Gan explains here what China needs to do. 3. Pouring water on disputes . Don't expect China to turn the other cheek when it comes to regional disputes, writes Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt from International Crisis Group. ""Beijing is keen to prevent the world from concluding that China has discarded the notion of a peaceful rise,"" Kleine-Ahlbrandt writes. She says China's going down the path of ""reactive assertiveness."" One example is China's attitude in response to Japan's purchase of islands disputed by both countries in the East China Sea. Find out whether Kleine-Ahlbrandt thinks the country's new leaders are likely to change tact. 4. Too many men . Faced with a surging population, China attempted to put the brakes on procreation in the late 1970s by implementing a controversial policy limiting couples in some areas to just one child. Since then, a cultural bias towards male children has led to a skewed child sex ratio where millions of men, or ""bare branches"" face an uncertain future due to the lack of potential female partners, writes evolutionary biologist Rob Brooks. ""It would be difficult to overstate the urgent need for China to emulate South Korea in eliminating sex-biased abortion and neglect,"" Brooks writes. Studies show, he says, what can happen if it doesn't. 5. Learning the three Rs . The legacy of China's powerhouse of cheap, labor-intensive exports is a natural environment tainted by the pollutants of economic growth. Author Geoff Hiscock says securing the food, water and air security of China's 1.35 billion people is one of the leadership's biggest challenges. ""Beijing and other parts of northeastern China are already water-stressed, the air quality in inland mega-cities such as Chongqing and Chengdu is abysmal, farming land is being poisoned by toxic runoff from mining and industrial activities, acid rain blights large parts of south China, contagious disease is an ever-present risk among its livestock, and unscrupulous makers sell tainted foodstuffs,"" Hiscock writes. So what can China do about it? More from Hiscock. CNN's Kevin Voigt and Paul Armstrong contributed to this report.","Experts explain what they think is China's biggest challenge .

The huge hunk of bullion went on public display Thursday, piquing the interest of hundreds who flocked to the show to get a peek.

"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) -- Mike Knox, owner of Freestyle Barber & Beauty in Ferguson, Missouri, said police have pulled him over twice for what he calls ""DWB"" -- driving while black. When he questioned why he was stopped, officers pressed him for insurance information -- not something a driver should be pulled over for, he said. ""People are just tired of that happening,"" Knox said. ""Why should we get pulled over every time we get in the car?"" Knox wouldn't be surprised if Michael Brown, 18, smarted off to Officer Darren Wilson. ""He probably did. It happens quite often,"" Knox said. It's common for black people to give police attitude in the area, he said. Wilson, a white police officer, fatally shot the unarmed, African-American Brown on August 9 -- the event that started protests and violent street clashes in the town of about 22,000 people. Dozens of people have been arrested as Ferguson became a flash point of racial conflict. Black residents of Ferguson say there's been friction for years with the overwhelmingly white police department. White residents also complain the police are heavy-handed. The department was formally accused of using excessive force Tuesday in a federal lawsuit. The family of Jason Moore says he died of cardiac arrest September 17, 2011, when police fired Tasers at him, according to the lawsuit. The family says that Moore, who they say suffered a psychological disorder, was walking around naked and posed no threat to police. The public relations firm handling media inquiries of the Ferguson police did not immediately respond Wednesday to CNN's request for comment on the suit. To locals and longtime observers, tension has been brewing since the 1970s, when school desegregation and white flight changed Ferguson's demographics. Today, two-thirds of Ferguson's population is black, but arrest statistics don't reflect that. According to a 2013 report released by the Missouri attorney general, African-Americans are highly over-represented in crime statistics. They accounted for 93% of arrests after traffic stops, 92% of searches and 86% of traffic stops. Michael Brown shooting, protests highlight racial divide . The police chief is white. There are only three African-Americans on the 53-person police force. The mayor is white, and so are five of the six city council members. Police chief defends department . Police Chief Tom Jackson has come under heavy criticism for the way police have handled protests and looting, but he defends the department against accusations of racism. When CNN asked him about the perception that police stop blacks more than whites, Jackson said, ""Well, if that is the perception out there, then that's something we have to work on."" When asked if it's more than a perception, he said, ""I don't think so."" But African-American residents say it's more than perception. Marquita Rogers, 27, said she believes race played a factor in Brown's death. ""I'm not saying that every white police officer in Ferguson is racist like that, but some are"" she said. ""First time I seen a black cop is when they blocked off the street,"" she said, referring to recent turmoil in her city. 'They all got a power trip problem' Tom Steigerwald, 31, has lived in Ferguson since 1994. When he was 20, an officer came to his house because he was playing music too loud, he said. The officer told him to open his door but he stuck his head out the window instead, he said. After an exchange of words, the officer smacked him in the head, he said. His father talked him out of filing a report. ""They all got a power trip problem, a lot of them,"" he said. Arvid Wilkerson, 22, said, ""Police do what they want,"" he said. ""They abuse that badge."" He thinks that's exactly what happened with Brown. ""They get trained to use their night sticks and Tasers, and they get trained to fight. There's no reason to pull out a gun and definitely no reason to kill him, or overkill him is what they did,"" he said. ""That could've been me."" A traffic case brought Henry Davis into conflict with Ferguson police. Davis filed a federal lawsuit against the city and four police officers in 2010, alleging the police used excessive force against him in the jail cell after arresting him in 2009. Last March, a federal judge ruled in favor of the city and the officers. Davis is appealing. In the lawsuit, Davis says officers wrongly arrested him in the first place, thinking he was another person by the same last name. Lawsuit alleges excessive force . At the jail, police beat and kicked him so badly he suffered a concussion, the lawsuit says. ""I shouldn't have been there, I was the wrong person,"" he told CNN. ""They beat me for no reason while I was handcuffed."" To top it off, police charged him with four counts of property damage, saying he had bled on their uniforms. He also was charged with driving while intoxicated, speeding, failure to drive in a single lane, no proof of insurance and failure to obey a police officer. Police tell a different story in their responses to Davis' lawsuit, saying Davis acted intoxicated, belligerent and aggressive toward arresting officers. One officer claims he suffered a broken nose. In a 2010 plea bargain in municipal court, Davis pleaded guilty to two counts of property damage, careless driving, speeding, failure to obey a police officer, and two non-moving violations, according to a U.S. magistrate's summary of the case. Two counts of property damage were dismissed. After Davis filed his lawsuit in August 2010, police charged Davis with felony assault on a police officer. That charge was dismissed in 2013. Chief says he improving department . Jim Schottel, Davis' attorney, said he's not shocked by the Michael Brown case. ""Ferguson had a policy and custom for its officers to use excessive force at will,"" Schottel said in the lawsuit he filed for Davis, who like Brown is African-American. Chief Jackson, who was hired in March 2010, told CNN he's trying to improve the department. ""I wasn't here when that happened,"" he said of the Davis case. ""All I can say is that from the time I got here I've been working on improvements to make this a very professional police department."" Schottel said Jackson is trying to improve the department, but ""the culture in the police department was one where there was no fear of punishment."" Meanwhile, one of the four officers Davis sued, Kim Tihen, left the police department and ran for city council, reported The Daily Beast. She won election in 2012. Schottel doesn't know if the Michael Brown case will help his appeal of the Davis lawsuit. He expects the case to be heard the week of December 8. ""I've been told by other lawyers the appeal now stands a better shot,"" he said, ""but I don't speculate."" Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests .

"Washington (CNN) -- The fate of the controversial Keystone pipeline wasn't the only thing at stake during a crucial vote in the Senate on Tuesday. The vote blocking legislation that would have authorized the pipeline's construction previews a new era of animosity between resurgent Republicans in Congress and President Barack Obama. It could also seal the fate of embattled Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, who had made pushing the measure a focal point in an uphill battle to fend off a GOP challenger in a runoff election next month. Landrieu fell one vote short of securing the support necessary to advance the legislation. All 45 Republicans voted for the measure and 14 Democrats did, too. But she needed one more Democrat to join her to reach the critical 60 vote threshold. The failure to muster enough Democratic votes occurred even though Landrieu had insisted for days that she had the votes she needed. ""I feel very comfortable,"" she said Monday night. In a three hour-long Senate floor debate Tuesday in advance of the vote, Landrieu was a bit more tentative. ""This is one of the first debates in eight years where the outcome is uncertain,"" she said. ""We usually know the outcome of the vote before we take it because the deals are all cut."" In her speech, Landrieu made an aggressive case in favor of approving the pipeline while other Democrats dissented. ""To everyone who thinks this pipeline is the end of the world -- we already have 2.6 million miles of pipeline in the United States,"" Landrieu said. ""We're only completing basically 1,000 miles. What is everyone upset about? "" California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer pointed out the potential health risks of laying the pipeline, including heart disease, increased hospitalization, and a higher prevalence of chemicals that ""penetrate deeply into the lungs."" ""The facts are the facts are the facts,"" she said. ""If you're not a scientist, then be humble and listen to the peer-reviewed scientists. They don't have a special interest. They have an interest in giving us information we should base our decisions upon. "" Boxer also referred to the project as the ""Keystone Extra Lethal Pipeline."" Keystone protesters have message for Democrats . The GOP-led House on Friday approved a measure that will skip the conclusion of the six-year-old State Department review of the pipeline and authorize its construction. Though the Senate blocked that bill Tuesday, incoming Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said afterward that the newly-elected GOP majority will make it an early priority once the new Congress is in place in January. If the Senate ultimately approves the measure, Obama could be poised to issue what would be just the third veto of his nearly six year presidency. At a news conference last week, Obama made clear that he doesn't want Congress to interfere with the State Department's process. ""Understand what this project is: It is providing the ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else. It doesn't have an impact on U.S. gas prices,"" Obama said at a Friday news conference in Myanmar. The showdown comes as Obama and congressional Republicans appear to be on a collision course over immigration. Republicans are considering how to respond if Obama follows through with a pledge to revise immigration policies by the end of the year. Some GOP lawmakers have talked about potentially shutting down the government if Obama keeps that promise. On Keystone, Senate Democrats had moved toward a vote largely in an effort to help Landrieu, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources chairwoman. She is facing off in the December runoff against Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy, who sponsored the House's Keystone bill and has been promised a seat of his own on the energy panel. The measure offered Landrieu a final chance to demonstrate her clout before voters return to the polls. Already, Landrieu was joined by 10 Democratic co-sponsors: Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor, Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, Montana Sen. Jon Tester, Montana Sen. John Walsh, North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. Three more Democrats had pledged last week to support the measure: Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Delaware Sen. Tom Carper and Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey. But by Monday night, it was clear that the list of Landrieu's potential Democratic allies to provide the final vote had dwindled. One of Landrieu's top targets, West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller, said he wouldn't support the measure. Another potential backer, Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, told CNN Tuesday he would vote against the bill. Landrieu's entreaties to other Democrats had also been rejected. Outgoing Michigan Sen. Carl Levin would not support the pipeline, a spokeswoman said Monday. Nor will New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who tweeted his opposition over the weekend. Also confirming their opposition to the measure to various news outlets were Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez and Colorado Sen. Mark Udall. Retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa said he wouldn't be voting for the pipeline. ""I've come to this conclusion: every dollar that we spend on fossil fuel development and use is another dollar we spend digging the graves of our grandchildren,"" he told reporters Tuesday. ""And I'm not going to be a part of it anymore. I'm through. That's just how strong I feel. I know we can't solve it overnight, but we have to be on a steep glide path in getting rid of fossil fuels as a source of energy for our planet."" Even Landrieu's Democratic supporters were facing pressure. Anti-Keystone activists, including college students, were trying Tuesday to convince Carper and Bennet to change their minds, protesting at the senators' Capitol Hill offices.

"(CNN) -- Crowd disorder caused a top of the table Euro 2016 qualifier between Italy and Croatia Sunday to be delayed as flares were thrown on the pitch. The match was deadlocked at 1-1 in the famous San Siro stadium in Milan when referee Bjorn Kuipers briefly held up the match before leading the players off the pitch for over 15 minutes. Most of the flares, coming from the Croatian supporters in the stadium, appeared to be aimed at Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. The match eventually did come to a conclusion with the score staying unchanged. Antonio Candreva had put Italy ahead early in the match, but Ivan Perisic soon leveled after an assist from Barcelona's Ivan Rakitic. The result leaves Croatia top of Group H on goal difference from the Italians. Norway stays third after a 1-0 win in Azerbaijan. Hiddink breaths easier . Earlier, there was relief for under pressure Dutch coach after his side beat Latvia 6-0 in Group A. Hiddink had indicated he might resign after another disappointing result after four defeats in his first five games in charge. The Dutch, who reached the semifinals of the World Cup under Louis van Gaal, at last showed some of that form as Arjen Robben and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar both scored twice with captain Robin van Persie and Jeffrey Bruma also on target for the Oranje. But the Czech Republic kept up the pressure at the top of the group with a fourth straight win, beating Iceland 2-1 in Prague. Bale shines for Wales . In other key clashes, Gareth Bale's Wales maintained its unbeaten start to Group B by holding favorites Belgium goalless in Brussels. Real Madrid's Bale came closest for the visitors with a first half free kick and a low shot which went narrowly wide after a typical surging run. Nicolas Lombaerts hit the post for the home side, who piled on the pressure at the end. But the match had a controversial note as Belgium's Marouane Fellaini appeared to deliberately elbow Joe Allen, who was left with blood streaming from his face. Israel later went top of the group with a 3-0 home win over Bosnia and Herzegovina.","Italy - Croatia clash held up by crowd trouble at San Siro .

"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) -- Two weeks after a police-involved shooting sparked violent protests in a St. Louis suburb, the mood turned more tranquil Saturday with smaller crowds and lots of music. Gone were police in riot gear glaring at defiant protesters. The tear gas, rubber bullets and Molotov cocktails were nowhere to be seen, either. In their place were clusters of officers, hanging around businesses, chatting with one another. Shops reopened by late Friday and residents gathered for ribs at a local barbecue restaurant boarded up with plywood, a visible reminder of the violent protests and looting just a few days ago. A van rolled down the streets with men grilling hot dogs in the back and handing them out to passersby. Amid the vibrant noise of a heartbroken city slowly coming back to life, a preacher hollered, ""Praise Jesus!"" as a choir on a flatbed belted out hymns, leaving pauses for his exaltation. The change in mood comes two weeks to the day after Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old. Protesters have taken to the streets daily in the mostly black city, sometimes clashing violently with officers. Hundreds of people walked the streets later Saturday in a march in Brown's memory, organized by the NAACP. Despite the calm, slivers of earlier tension hovered. A vendor sold T-shirts adorned with the words, ""It's time to start the healing"" as a small group marched down the streets chanting, "" Hands up! Don't shoot!"" and ""No justice, no peace."" 2-year-old protester . Before calling it a night on Friday, Tonja Bulley, 49, of nearby Jennings, made one last march along the protest route with her grandson, Tyler Randall Foster, 2. The toddler carried a sign that read, ""You don't have to shoot. I'm unarmed."" Bulley has been to the protests daily since Brown was killed. This was the second time she'd brought Tyler. ""He might not understand why I'm out here, but I'm out here for him,"" she said. ""One day he'll read about this movement, and he'll know he made this change right along with his granny. I want to make things better for my grandson. I want things to change. ... I really don't want my grandson to be another Mike Brown."" Race has been at the forefront of the tensions; Brown was African-American and the officer who shot him is white. St. Louis authorities Friday released details of the racial and gender makeup of the grand jury handling the case. It comprises six white men, three white women, two black women and one black man, said Paul Fox, the administrator for the St. Louis County Circuit Court. St. Louis County is 70% white and 24% black, according to last year's estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau. Obama orders review of military equipment to police . State and federal cases . The release of the details of the jury comes amid a key complaint among Brown family supporters, who've said the man whose office is tasked with making the case to the grand jury -- St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch -- is too cozy with law enforcement. Protesters have said he does not have a good relationship with the African-American community and should be replaced. McCulloch has indicated he won't recuse himself. Crucial grand jury . Unlike a jury in a criminal case, which convicts someone if jurors are convinced of guilt ""beyond a reasonable doubt,"" a grand jury decides if there is ""probable cause."" They decide whether to charge someone with a crime based on testimony and evidence presented in the absence of a judge. In Missouri, they don't have to be unanimous to press such an indictment, as long as nine of the 12 agree on a charge. The federal government is conducting a separate investigation. FBI agents have knocked on more than 400 doors in Ferguson and interviewed more than 200 people as part of the U.S. Justice Department's civil rights investigation, according to law enforcement sources. The federal probe must prove there was an element of ""racial hostility"" in the shooting. That's a higher standard than the one before the St. Louis County grand jury. The 12 members of the grand jury are crucial. They may be the first to reach a decision on whether the case will be defined as a murder charge, a lesser charge or no charge at all. Will calm last? And as the focus shifts to the investigation, authorities hope the calm is there to stay. ""Tonight is proof good things are happening at Ferguson. ... The whispering winds of change continue,"" said Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol. ""I continue seeing citizens and officers making eye contact and smiling at each other."" Johnson said there were no Molotov cocktails thrown, no shootings and no tear gas Saturday. And for the first time in days, there were no arrests, either.","Streets remain calm for protest march .

"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) -- Ever since it happened, race has been front-and-center in the vigorous debate over the fatal shooting of African-American teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer. Could it also factor into those 12 people now deciding whether that Ferguson, Missouri, officer will face charges in the 18-year-old's death? We may never know. That's because the St. Louis County grand jury weighing the case meets, per established rules, in private. Still, at least we found out Friday about a little more about those on it -- including their race. St. Louis County Circuit Court administrator Paul Fox said there are three African-Americans -- one male, two females -- and nine whites -- six males, three females -- on the 12-member panel. There are a total of seven men and five women. No information was given about the ages or occupations of any on the grand jury. This information on the jury's makeup comes as a key complaint among Brown family supporters continues: that the man whose office is tasked with making the case to the grand jury -- St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch -- is too cozy with law enforcement, does not have a good relationship with the African-American community and thus should be replaced. For his part, McCulloch has indicated he won't recuse himself, saying he's simply doing the job he was elected to do. The county grand jury was randomly selected from an approved pool and has been seated since May according Paul Fox, the director of judicial administration for the St. Louis County Circuit Court. In many locales, grand juries hear numerous cases during their terms, which cover a specified period of time instead of the duration of a specific case. Unlike a jury in a criminal case, which convicts someone if jurors are convinced of guilt ""beyond a reasonable doubt,"" a grand jury decides if there is ""probable cause"" -- based on testimony and evidence presented, in the absence of a judge -- to charge someone with a crime. In Missouri, they don't have to be unanimous to press such an indictment, as long as nine of the 12 agree on a charge. Notably, these grand jurors aren't the only ones with a pivotal say in whether or not Officer Darren Wilson is charged. The federal government is also on the case -- FBI agents canvassing the Ferguson neighborhood where the shooting happened have knocked on more than 400 doors and interviewed more than 200 people, according to law enforcement sources -- as part of the U.S. Justice Department's civil rights division's investigation. The federal probe, as currently set up, must prove there was an element of ""racial hostility"" (as explained by CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin) in the shooting. That's a higher standard than the one before the St. Louis County grand jury. This is one big reason why the 12 people on it -- including who they are, what they hear and what they believe -- matters so much. They may be the first to reach a decision on whether Officer Wilson will get justice, whether that's defined as a murder charge, a lesser charge, or no charge at all. FBI probing cyberattacks on police in Ferguson . As the grand jury hears testimony and sees evidence in private, tensions and protest continue to play out in a very public way on the streets of Ferguson. Protesters demanding Wilson's arrest have ripped law enforcement for what they call an overly militarized, heavy-handed response; on the other side, police called out criminal elements for fomenting unrest and said they simply wanted to protect people, safeguard property and keep the peace. Whoever is to blame, many nights since the August 9 shooting have been marred by large-scale arrests and violence. But that was not the case Thursday night into early Friday. There were no Molotov cocktails thrown, no shootings, no fires, no tear gas. Instead, a sense of much-welcomed calm prevailed. This came hours after Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon ordered the withdrawal of Missouri National Guard troops -- who had been dispatched to protect he police command center, which officials said had come under threat -- from the St. Louis suburb. That may not have been the only threat -- real or virtual -- to police. Three U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN on Friday that the FBI has opened an investigation into hacking attacks directed at the personal computers and accounts of police officers who have been part of the response. The attacks are believed to be the work of hackers affiliated with the group Anonymous, the officials said. It's not clear how much personal data was compromised by these alleged cyberattacks, but it's one reason why officers working the streets of Ferguson aren't displaying their names on their uniforms, according to the officials. Credibility of key witness challenged . Supporters of Wilson have used reports this week that the teen broke the cop's eye socket during an altercation as justification for the use of deadly force. Those reports are not true, a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN. Wilson had a swollen face and was treated at the hospital, but his eye socket was not fractured in the reported scuffle with Brown, the source told CNN. The shooting has prompted multiple investigations, but already -- before any charges have been filed or conclusions reached -- the credibility of those linked to the case is being scrutinized in the court of public opinion. Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown's who was walking with him at the time of the incident and a key witness, said the officer shot Brown once by the police car and again as he ran away. According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting. Other witnesses have said Brown's body jerked as if it had been hit from the back, but an autopsy shows that all the entry wounds were in the front of Brown's body. This, together with reports that Johnson had a criminal record that including lying to police, has put his credibility in question. Johnson's version was contrasted by the version of events described by a woman who told a St. Louis radio show she was a friend of the officer: that Brown taunted Wilson and charged at him before the shooting began. The radio caller's account matches what Wilson has told investigators, a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN. In the event there is a criminal trial, any potential juror who hears Johnson's version might take his past into consideration but must remember that the FBI and police were aware of his past when they interviewed him initially, said Freeman Bosley, one of Johnson's attorneys. Another of his lawyers, James Williams, defended his client's credibility Friday morning. ""His credibility in this case has nothing to do with what he's been charged with in the past. It has to do with what he saw here, seeing his friend get murdered, in cold blood, by a police officer,"" Williams told CNN's Chris Cuomo. ""We have two young men chased after to be hunted down by a police officer, one of them murdered in the street, and this becomes about their past? Or this becomes about what happened at a store? None of this is what it should be about,"" Williams said. 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting . Magazine: The aftermath in Ferguson .

"(CNN) -- To many outsiders, cricket can seem like a pedestrian pursuit. But the tragic death of Australian batsman Phil Hughes has prompted the ""gentlemen's game"" to ask itself serious and searching questions about safety. The 25-year-old was struck on the head by a ball from fast bowler Sean Abbott during a state match in Sydney and died on Thursday from his injuries. Tributes have flooded in for Hughes but the cricket family has also shown acute concern for Abbott, who, at just 22, has been shattered by his inadvertent role in a former teammate's death. And a pair of former England fast bowlers are united in the hope that Abbott, who recently made his debut for Australia in the limited overs format, can eventually rebuild his career. ""I don't think there's anybody on this planet that could understand what Sean Abbott is going through,"" Steve Harmison, who took 222 Test wickets for his country, told CNN. ""You can be told, told and told it's not your fault but what that kid is going through is heartbreaking. From a bowling point of view, how does he do his job? ""He's 22-years-old, he's doing something he loves to do. Probably all he's ever wanted to do is play cricket and represent Australia. Deep down as an individual, is he going to be able to pull his boots on again and bowl a cricket ball? ""It would change my approach as a fast bowler if it was me. It would have to. You'd be frightened to let go of the ball. That's natural. We're not dealing with robots, we're dealing with human beings. ""It is just a freak accident. He'll never get over it but I hope for his sake that he can live a life that comes close to what he was expecting before what happened two days ago."" Harmison carved out a reputation as a formidable pace bowler during his seven-year international career with England, regularly hitting speeds of 90mph plus. The native of Ashington in the north east of England earned the nickname 'Grevious Bodily Harmison' thanks to ferocious spells that included plenty of short balls. He and Simon Jones were part of a venerated 2005 England attack that helped the country win a first Ashes battle against old foes Australia for 18 years. And while both Harmison and Jones were united in their grief at Hughes' death, the pair believe the art of fast bowling -- built on aggression and intimidation -- should remain unchecked. ""The mindset of bowling is almost like you are going to war,"" Jones explained to CNN. ""It's my job when I'm representing my country to do my job to the best of my ability and it's the same for the opposing batter. I want to try and impose myself on the opposition. ""If you see a batter getting comfortable that's when you bowl him a short ball. Yes, you are aiming for the throat or the head but you don't mean to hurt anyone. ""It's aggression but controlled aggression. You bowl to a methodical plan, try and work a batter out and use whichever ball you have in your armory to get them out. ""When people make mistakes they do get hit but then that is what the helmet is for. Unfortunately in this instance Phil Hughes has been hit on the back of the head."" Part of cricket's allure is the age-old battle between fast bowlers and top level batsmen, with short pitched bowling an electric facet of the tussle. The tactic emerged during England's 1932-33 Test series with Australia when it began bowling short into the body to try and combat the prowess of Don Bradman, arguably the game's greatest ever batsman. After a hostile West Indies pace attack utilized the short ball to become the most feared bowling unit in the game in the 1970s and 1980s cricket's governing body, the International Cricket Council, tweaked the laws to allow only one bouncer per batsman per over. Despite this change, and the advent of better protection for batsmen in the form of helmets complete with a grill to cover the face, accidents still occurred. With reaction times to a 90mph delivery spanning just half a second, some batsmen have been unable to live with the pace both Harmison and Jones can generate. ""I hit a guy in the head on a tour of India in 2003,"" Jones explained. ""He went down, his leg was twitching and his eyes rolled back into his head. It's the most frightened I've ever been in my life. ""I honestly felt I'd done some real damage. I went to check if he was alright but panic stations set in because you don't want to see a fellow human being in that sort of state."" Harmison has also been in the same position. ""I've hit people numerous times in my job as a fast bowler over an 18-year period. Some were serious, some not so serious,"" he said. ""You don't like that but you have to understand that's what comes with being a fast bowler. You bowl this hard ball between 78mph and 100mph from 22 yards away. ""You get it slightly wrong and people get hurt but never in a million years would you think to the extent that it's been over the last 48 hours."" Hughes, despite being diminutive in stature, was known as an aggressive player, fond of taking on the short ball and trying to hook or pull it to the boundary. The 25-year-old had reached 63 not out playing for South Australia against New South Wales on Tuesday before being struck by Abbott's delivery. Hughes was wearing a helmet but the blow to his neck split his vertebral artery and caused massive bleeding on his brain. He never regained consciousness. It has led in some quarters to calls for a change to the game's laws to offer batsman more protection, or for protective equipment to be tweaked to cover more parts of the head. But Harmison thinks any change to existing helmets might prove cumbersome and restrictive. ""There's a lot of people talking about it and having protection on that part of the body,"" he said. ""I'm not sure many top end batsmen would want that much protection in and around that area because from their point of view there is a fine balance between being protected and being able to do your job. ""If you make that a rigid area, and you can't move your head, arguably you are a bigger target. That would be a concern. On the other hand no-one wants to see anything come close to what has happened here. ""If you can change the game of cricket in a way that makes it better, makes it safer, then I'm happy and I will champion it because I love this game but I can't see that happening because this is a freak accident."" Jones, who took 59 Test wickets for England, shared a dressing room with Hughes when the Australian played a season with Hampshire. ""He was such a great kid -- he was only 21 then,"" Jones said. ""The energy he had for the game, the energy in the changing room -- he was good fun. His work ethic was second to none and he was a pleasure to be around. ""As a young lad coming into a pretty strange environment on the English county circuit, he came in with open eyes and an open mind. He fitted in and grasped his chance. ""You look at cricket over the last 100 years and I can't think of any cases like this -- that shows how much of a freak accident it was. It's so sad he's passed away at 25."" Having played 26 Tests for his country, the last in July 2013, Hughes was thought to be on the verge of a recall to the national side for its Test series with India that begins on December 4. ""He was a fine player,"" Harmison added. ""You don't play Test cricket at 20 and you don't become the youngest player to get a hundred in each innings in international cricket if you're not a special talent. ""When he faced a bouncer he would be aggressive -- he would take it on. He was fighting for a chance to get back into the national side and to be cut down like this is ridiculously sad. ""As a family orientated person the thing I can't see past is there is a mother and father in Australia who have lost a 25-year-old son, and that is heartbreaking.""","Former England fast bowlers express sympathy for Australian Sean Abbott .

"(CNN) -- As outrage flares and more questions are raised over the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, President Barack Obama increasingly finds himself drawn to the center of the discussion. Obama has spoken publicly twice about the August 9 shooting of the unarmed African-American teen by a white police officer in the St. Louis suburb, as well as the resulting clashes between protesters and law enforcement. He also released a written statement shortly after Brown was killed. But he's so far been cautious about wading too deeply into the controversy that is the subject of a local criminal investigation and a separate civil rights probe led by the Justice Department. Concerns about prosecutor in Brown case . He has spoken with elected and other leaders, and his public statements have been measured. No presidential visits to Missouri are planned for now although Attorney General Eric Holder is due in Ferguson on Wednesday. ""I have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed. Because, although these are, you know, issues of local jurisdiction -- you know, the DOJ works for me,"" Obama told reporters on Monday. ""And then when they're conducting an investigation, I've got to make sure that I don't look like I'm putting my thumb on the scales one way or the other."" Should Obama be more forceful? But some believe Obama should be more forceful, especially following community and political criticism of the initial police response to street protests as excessive, and with those demonstrations becoming more violent. ""This President knows better than most what happens in poor communities that have been antagonized historically by the hostile relationship between black people and the police department,"" Georgetown University professor Michael Eric Dyson said Sunday on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" ""It is not enough for him to come on national television and pretend there is a false moral equivalency between police people who are armed and black people who are vulnerable constantly to this. He needs to use his bully pulpit to step up and articulate this as a vision,"" Dyson said. CNN political commentator and Morehouse College African-American studies professor Marc Lamont Hill wrote in an op-ed for CNN.com that Obama has ""placed the highest priority"" on people remaining calm. ""While this may seem reasonable on its face, particularly against the backdrop of rioting and looting, his words failed to acknowledge the legitimacy of black anger,"" Hill said. The White House argues a big speech from Obama on race relations would be difficult right now. ""Pouring gasoline on a fire and lighting the match?"" one senior White House official said. Administration officials said in their discussions with mayors, civil rights leaders and the Congressional Black Caucus, that they've been told Obama is doing the right thing. Obama talked to governor . In his statement on Monday, Obama noted that he has been in touch with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, and the state's two senators, Claire McCaskill and Roy Blunt. The White House emphasized supportive statements it has received from both McCaskill, a Democrat, and more notably, Blunt, a Republican. ""I explained to the President that I've been pleased with my conversations with the attorney general and civil rights division regarding their helpful understanding that they aren't taking over this investigation, but are conducting a parallel review of the events that led to Michael Brown's death,"" Blunt said in a statement on Monday. ""I continue to believe that this is the best possible way to arrive at a transparent explanation that would be largely acceptable to all of those who have been impacted in the community by this tragedy."" Will Obama visit Ferguson? Obama also has skirted the question of whether he plans to travel to Ferguson. A senior White House official said such a visit is not in the cards now, but it has not been ruled out. A visit by the President would tax law enforcement resources necessary for his protection instead of devoting those resources to calming the situation, the White House official said. The Department of Justice's community policing program director, Ronald Davis, will be on the ground to advise law enforcement on how to deal with the protests peacefully, this official said. The White House also views what is happening in Ferguson as partly a policing issue. Better policing practices in working with the community and organizing the response to the protests could calm things down, the official said. Calls for Obama to visit Ferguson aren't likely to ebb soon. On Tuesday, rapper and business mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs released a video on Instagram calling for such a step. ""Obama, for real, get on a plane. It's serious,"" he said. Magazine: The Aftermath in Ferguson .

"(CNN) -- London property and gold -- the two safest places to put your money, or so the saying goes in recent years. For the past several years, owners of London property have watched with delight as the values of their homes have spiked annually well into double digits. With gold, as has been the case for thousands of years, it has provided a tradable commodity which investors have turned to in uncertain times. It's a safe haven, the asset of last resort. But with quality gold ore becoming increasingly hard to find, a Canadian company has ventured 125 kilometers (78 miles) into the Arctic circle to build Europe's largest gold mine. Otherwise known as a place for tourism and skiing, the town of Kittila, in the Lapland region of Northern Finland, is an unforgiving environment to run a mining operation. Average temperatures in winter usually only reach -23 degrees Fahrenheit. But that hasn't stopped the mining or the growth of the area. Global demand . That growth is possible because global demand for gold is high, said Sean Boyd, president and CEO of Toronto-based Agnico Eagle Mines, which runs Kittila's gold mine. ""Demand is continuing to grow in a part of the world that's growing population-wise and is growing from a wealth perspective,"" said Boyd. Recent reports from the gold industry development group World Gold Council (WGC) show that consumer demand in China has skyrocketed, and India and the United States have a big appetite for gold, too. While it may be culturally important to own gold in parts of the world, Boyd also said central banks still feel the need to own it. ""That's not going to go away. Central banks are still buying it. It trades like a currency on most days,"" added Boyd. Or as a recent WGC report put it: ""With many economic and geopolitical wounds still open, central banks once again sought the protection and diversification of gold."" Shanghai has built a gold exchange over the last dozen or so years, and having just opened it up to international players its goal is to make that the largest physical bullion market in the world; Boyd says ""that's a sign that the market continues to move to the East."" Digging deep . Logistically, however, Boyd says it's necessary to go further afield to find quality ore deposits. ""The easy stuff's been found now. You look at the industry average, gold grade is a little over one gram per ton, and so the gold reports in minute particles and as a result of that you're having to move much more rock than you used to, to get the same amount of gold,"" said Boyd. It's a laborious process that uses chemicals to extract tiny particles of gold. The Kittila mine is expected to remain open until at least 2036, as Agnico Eagle has already discovered the gold reserve is in excess of 7-8 million ounces, much higher than its original estimate of 1.5 million ounces. In order to achieve this, the company will have to take the mine down at least 900 meters (over half a mile) below the surface. But one thing is for certain: gold's popularity has not waned. ""I don't think gold's going to go away, I think it still has an important role to play,"" said Boyd.","Gold has been a commodity that investors have relied on in uncertain times .
Northern Finland is the site of Europe's largest gold mine .
Central banks and consumers have kept the demand for gold strong ."
"(CNN) -- The recent opening of the world's first peak-to-peak suspension bridge in Switzerland is yet another example of how footbridges -- once simply built to provide passage over challenging obstacles -- are increasingly being designed with thrill seekers in mind. Here's a closer look at this new Swiss beauty and other amazing footbridges around the world. Peak Walk by Tissot (Bernese Oberland, Switzerland) In October, the world's first pedestrian suspension bridge to connect two mountain peaks opened on Glacier 3000 in Switzerland's Bernese Oberland. The 107-meter (351 feet) bridge connects View Point peak with Scex Rouge peak. Famed alpine peaks Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn, Eiger, Monch and Jungfrau can be all be seen from the bridge's observation deck.

Hanging Bridge of Ghasa (Nepal) It's not just humans who use this bridge -- donkeys, cows and goats use it, as well. In fact, it was built specifically for animals, as a solution to the congestion caused by cattle being herded up and down Ghasa's narrow roads. Today, animals remain the biggest users of the Hanging Bridge of Ghasa, prodded along by the farmers who also use it to deliver produce to local families. Ghasa, Annapurna circuit, Nepal . Trift Bridge (Gadmen, Switzerland) This Swiss suspension bridge, which can only be accessed via a cable car, hangs above the Trift Glacier and has a length of 170 meters (557 feet). It was built as a response to global warming -- until recently, the mountaineering hut at the top of the glacier could be reached on foot, but when the glacier started to shrink, the bridge became the only route of access. The structure is based on traditional Nepalese rope bridges and is the longest and highest in the Alps. Trift Bridge, Grimselworld Trail, Gadmen, Switzerland . El Caminito Del Rey (Malaga, Spain) One of many bridges on the El Caminito Del Rey (meaning ""the king's little pathway""), this cliff-hugging path in Spain was built to provide workers at the hydroelectric power plants at Chorro Falls and Gaitanejo Falls with a way to cross between them. It quickly became a tourist attraction, although it's only recently reopened after major renovations.

"(CNN) -- Election Day demolished the notion that New York state, which tends to vote Democratic in presidential elections, is a bastion of the brand of progressive politics embodied by Andrew Cuomo's sometime-rival, the high-profile mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio. Andrew Cuomo, New York's governor, won re-election with 53% of the vote on the same day gubernatorial candidates were getting trounced in Democratic strongholds, including Massachusetts, Illinois and Maryland, which is a solid victory he can brag about. In fact, his victory sets the stage for what Cuomo's aides have quietly hinted could be the prelude to a run for president. But at the same time, New York Republicans flexed political muscles -- and Democrats engaged in destructive infighting -- in a way that suggests the Empire State, which might seem solid Democratic blue on the outside, has deep streaks of Republican red on the inside. Even as Cuomo and his Democratic ticket mates for lieutenant governor, attorney general and state comptroller were racking up wins, the GOP flipped three congressional seats from Democratic to Republican -- nearly a quarter of the estimated 14 to 18 seats Republicans added to their House majority nationwide -- and unexpectedly came so close to ousting Rep. Louise Slaughter, a 14-term Democrat, that the race remains too close to call. Equally important, Republicans deposed enough state legislators to take firm control of the New York Senate. That will make it hard, if not impossible, for de Blasio to win an increase in the minimum wage, college scholarships for undocumented immigrants, legal limits on rent increases, equal-pay legislation and other state-controlled policies loudly championed by the New York City mayor and his allies among labor leaders and community activists. Cuomo, a centrist in many respects, shows no signs of objecting to this state of affairs. Although the governor pushed through New York's same-sex marriage law and a tough gun-control measure, he remains a fiscal conservative dedicated to tax cuts and limited government spending. That hasn't sat well with progressives, such as de Blasio's allies. Earlier this year, Cuomo fended off a challenge from the left wing of the Democratic Party when an upstart law professor, Zephyr Teachout, came from nowhere to win 30 of New York's 62 counties. Cuomo ignored Teachout, going to sometimes comical lengths to avoid debating her, speaking her name or shaking her hand. The governor also went on to publicly disparage and weaken the influence of the Working Families Party, the political organization that recruited Teachout. And in a masterpiece of political payback, Cuomo created a new ballot line, the Women's Equality Party, that siphoned off votes from the Working Families group and clearly gave Republicans a chance to take advantage of Democratic infighting. ""Governor Cuomo promised to take back the State Senate. Instead, he squandered millions on a fake party, and left millions more in his campaign account as New York Democrats in the legislature and in Congress withered on the vine,"" said Bill Lipton, the executive director of Working Families, in a blistering statement hours after election results became clear. Cuomo will now face a tough legislative session, with angry liberals clamoring for an agenda that the Republican-dominated state Senate will likely stall or block altogether. Cuomo will also be pressed by progressives who believe that de Blasio's management of New York City represents a national turning point. In an article titled ""The Zeitgeist Tracked Down Bill de Blasio,"" one of the mayor's labor allies claimed that New York City progressive politics were in tune with the spirit of the age (the zeitgeist), and that ""shifting demographics and the social liberalism of young people portend a long period of Democratic dominance in national politics."" The midterm elections results suggest that judgment may be premature. As Cuomo, the victorious centrist, has been saying all along.","Errol Louis: Election upended idea NY is bastion of de Blasio-like progressive politics .

"Washington (CNN) -- With less than a month until Election Day, Sen. Mary Landrieu is changing her reelection campaign's leadership. The Louisiana Democrat shook up her campaign staff, bringing in a new campaign manager and calling up former and current Senate staffers to help her beat back challenges from two Republicans in the state's jungle primary-style election, the New Orleans Times-Picayune first reported Wednesday. The changes come as Landrieu faces slimming odds that she will win 50% of votes to avoid a runoff election. Ryan Berni, who ran her brother New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu's reelection campaign earlier this year, is now leading the reelection bid, and Landrieu also rang her former chief of staff Norma Jane Sabiston to advise the campaign. Current campaign manager Adam Sullivan will stay on as a senior adviser to the campaign. Landrieu campaign spokesman Fabien Levy would not say why specifically Sullivan was replaced. ""As Senator Landrieu has done in all of her races, she is bringing on some of her long-time and trusted advisers to assist during the last month of the race to lead us to victory on November 4.,"" Landrieu campaign spokesman Fabien Levy told CNN in an email. Senator reimburses federal government more than $30,000 in travel . Two Landrieu Senate staffers, her state director and Washington communications director, are also taking leaves of absence to bolster their boss's campaign. Landrieu has faced an uphill climb in her reelection bid this year and the challenge for her new staff will be to help Landrieu crack the 50% threshold needed to avoid a December runoff. That seems unlikely according to the latest CNN/ORC poll, that showed her support stood at 43%, with Rep. Bill Cassidy coming in a close second with 40%. A runoff election between the two could favor Cassidy, who would be able to regain votes lost to the third candidate, tea party Republican Rob Maness. That election would be close though, with the CNN/ORC poll giving Cassidy just a 3-point lead in an eventual runoff with the incumbent Senator.

"Washington (CNN) -- Did the FBI make the right decision in reading the suspected underwear bomber his Miranda rights and placing him in the civilian court system only hours after he was detained for trying to blow up a Northwest flight on Christmas? That question has been at the heart of heated discussions on Capitol Hill. This is what we know about the interrogations: . FBI Director Robert Mueller said suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab was interviewed twice by what Mueller called some of the best FBI agents. Officials said the first interrogation lasted about 50 minutes, and the second was shorter. AbdulMutallab provided information that ""has already proved useful in the fight against al Qaeda,"" Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. It was after the second interrogation that AbdulMutallab was read his Miranda rights -- rights under U.S. law that are read to individuals before arrest. At that point, he stopped talking to the agents. Though Mueller acknowledged that he was not consulted about the decision, he said the Justice Department and others in the administration were contacted before the second interview. Choices in how to proceed . Law enforcement officers did have choices in how to proceed with AbdulMutallab: . -- They could have read him his Miranda rights, placing him in the civilian judicial system. -- He could have been designated an enemy combatant and held for a military trial. -- He could have been held and interrogated for a longer period before they decided how to proceed. At a series of congressional hearings on the handling of the AbdulMutallab case, senior intelligence and Homeland Security officials testified that they were not consulted on how the suspect should be handled. Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair said a newly created high-value, detainee-interrogation group, or HIG, should have been brought into the loop. ""That unit was created exactly for this purpose: to make a decision on whether a certain person who is detained should be treated as a case for federal prosecution or for some of the other means,"" he said. However, Blair later discovered that HIG was not yet operational, a revelation that surprised many senators. Some in Congress incredulous . Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, called the decision to place AbdulMutallab in the federal judicial system ""a terrible, terrible mistake when it's pretty clear that this individual did not act alone."" Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut likened it to ""a kind of 'Alice in Wonderland' turning of the world of common sense on its head."" And Thomas Kean, who led the investigation into the 9/11 terrorist attacks, said he was ""shocked and upset"" that AbdulMutallab received all his rights before being fully questioned. FBI Director Mueller defended his agents' actions. ""In this particular case, in fast-moving events, decisions were made, appropriately I believe, very appropriately, given the situation,"" the director said. Mueller added, ""There was no time to get a follow-up group in there."" Those comments prompted a sharp rebuke from Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama. ""I don't think you can say it's appropriate,"" Sessions said. ""We don't know what that individual knows and learned while he was working with al Qaeda, and we may never know, because he's now got a lawyer that's telling him to be quiet."" Sessions went on to say, ""if he were properly interrogated over a period of time, we may find out that there are other cells, other plans, other AbdulMutallabs out there boarding planes that are going to blow up American citizens."" Others in Congress defend decision . Some, such as Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wisconsin, were mystified by the reaction to the decision to try AbdulMutallab in federal court. The senator cited the example of Richard Reid, the so-called Shoe Bomber, who was successfully prosecuted in civilian courts and is now serving a life sentence. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, chimed in, ""Very successful interrogations have been conducted and very significant intelligence information has been obtained from suspects who have been Mirandized."" Whitehouse said he was not convinced that advising someone of Miranda rights is a ""sort of per-se inhibition on our ability to collect intelligence from an individual."" Justice Department spokesman Miller defended the FBI's decision, touting the bureau's success in handling terrorist suspects since the 9/11 attacks. ""Those who argue that a different action should have been taken in this case were notably silent when dozens of terrorists were successfully prosecuted in federal court by the previous administration,"" Miller said. He said ""results, not rhetoric"" will guide the department's actions. A bipartisan group of senators on the Homeland Security Committee has introduced legislation that would require U.S. intelligence officials to be consulted whenever a suspected foreign terrorist is detained in the United States. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the ranking Republican on the committee, said the FBI action ""may have prevented the collection of valuable intelligence about future terrorist threats to the United States."" Committee Chairman Lieberman said, ""This bill forces the law enforcement and intelligence community to recognize that preventing the next attack should be the first priority."" Lieberman and Collins also have written a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, urging the Obama administration to transfer AbdulMutallab to military custody and charge him as an enemy combatant. The American Civil Liberties Union is disturbed by the congressional efforts to treat terrorism as an act of war. ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said, ""To abandon due process in terrorism cases turns the rule of law on its head and flies in the face of the values that we are fighting to protect in the first place."" As the congressional hearings demonstrated, the nation's leaders still have not come to grips with how to handle terrorism suspects. There has not been the degree of high-level coordination -- among the White House, the intelligence community and law enforcement -- that one might expect more than eight years after the 9/11 attacks.","FBI read suspected underwear bomber his Miranda rights just hours after being detained .

"(CNN) -- Confidence -- on the court and off it, Venus Williams is finding her mojo again. A year ago the tennis star was diagnosed with a debilitating auto-immune disease during the U.S. Open, but next week she will step back on the courts of her home grand slam tournament boosted by her recent results and the relaunch of her fashion label. Williams defended her women's doubles gold medal at the recent Olympic Games alongside younger sister Serena, who has roared back from her own health problems to win both the Wimbledon and London 2012 singles titles. ""The Olympics really built my confidence,"" the 32-year-old Venus told CNN. ""I wasn't able to play a lot of matches beforehand -- just three matches in about two months, which is not a lot. ""So going to the Olympics I didn't have a lot of matches, but I made the best of it and I played I think some of my best tennis of the year."" Clijsters ready for U.S. Open farewell . The former world No. 1's passion, fashion, is also on the upswing following the recent relaunch of her label EleVen at an event in New York -- which also hosts the U.S. Open. ""EleVen is about being better than a 10,"" said the current world No. 47. ""So it's about being a personal best, it's about not accepting any limits, that anyone puts on you or that you can even put on yourself, because sometimes we do. ""It's about expressing yourself for who you are. So EleVen means a lot of things but it just means bringing out the best in you. ""I feel that when I wear EleVen, I feel my best. So I want people to feel their best when they wear EleVen, confident and good about themselves."" Throughout her career, the seven-time grand slam champion has been as well known for her striking outfits as she has her powerful tennis strokes. Some of them pushed the boundaries of sporting design, and Williams said she is reining in her more experimental urges. ""Some of my favorite things were the goddess dress that I wore at Wimbledon, I think it was 2007,"" she said. ""And one of the craziest ones was the can-can dress. ""That was my idea of having lace on skin. For me it was fun, and it was experimental because at that time it was just me wearing it. But at that time I was like, 'What can I do that can be worn on the court? Can you wear lace? Yes. Can you wear fringe?' ""Because I did this fun dress after Tina Turner, and it was so fun, but at this point the experiments are over and it's about bringing classic designs."" Tennis legends tip Murray for grand slam glory at U.S. Open . Williams' obsession with design is such that she took time away from playing tennis to gain a fashion degree. ""To get my degree was important to me, mostly because of how I grew up -- my parents always chose education -- so for me it felt like an achievement to be able to do that,"" she said. ""But also I love fashion, and I knew it was something that I wanted to do, and I wanted to bring credibility to it, and I have to say the education helps a ton, so it's served me very well."" Williams said she is excited about all the elements of her life coming together again. ""I'm very excited about my game, I'm excited about tennis, I'm excited about wearing all the new EleVen clothes,"" she said. ""There are so many wonderful things coming up so I think between great tennis and great fashions on the court, it's going to be an amazing U.S. Open for me."" Williams is, however, still coming to terms with her battle against Sjogren's Syndrome -- which can cause extreme fatigue among its symptoms. ""I've come a long way, and I've gone through a lot of ups and downs for sure,"" she said. ""When you have an auto-immune disease, you can't expect everything to be the way it was before. You have to take the set of circumstances you have, and work with those. ""I'm working on it every day, but I know that I can live this dream and I think it gives a lot of other people hope, because it's not easy, but you know I'm working on it."" The story of the Williams sisters' rise to prominence, their dominance of the women's game and the struggles they have both experienced in recent years -- with Serena surviving potentially life-threatening blood clots -- has captivated tennis fans. They have won a combined total of 33 singles and doubles grand slam titles, so what lies ahead as they approach the twilight of their tennis careers? ""There's a lot more clothes to design,"" Venus said. ""Serena and I both want to play the Rio 2016 Olympics, we think that'd be a great place to shine for us and for the U.S. and everything. ""So we're not done yet, we still have great tennis in us, and it's amazing to do this every day.""","Venus Williams recently relaunched her clothing label EleVen in New York .

"(CNN) -- A time capsule hidden for more than a hundred years at one of Boston's most popular tourist attractions was opened on Friday in Boston. According to the Bostonian Society, which maintains the 1713-built Old Massachusetts State House, the rectangular copper box containing a variety of artifacts from 1901 was sealed inside one of two iconic statues -- a lion and a unicorn -- that have been a familiar site atop the Old State House for a couple of centuries. The Bostonian Society didn't -- or couldn't -- fully divulge the 113-year-old time capsule's contents, explaining that ""the process of extracting documents that are old and probably fragile will need to be slow and careful."" But a Boston Globe article from February 24, 1901, detailed what went into the box, which the story predicted would ""prove interesting when the box is opened many years hence."" According to the Globe, the box included the photographs and autographs of local statesmen such as Massachusetts Gov. Winthrop M. Crane and Boston Mayor Thomas Norton Hart, as well as news clippings of the day from several city newspapers and even a ""letter to posterity from the reporters of the Boston Daily newspapers assigned to City Hall."" It also included a photograph of the ""5th Massachusetts Regiment on its way to Framingham to be mustered in as U.S. volunteers for service in the war against Spain,"" as well as ""campaign buttons for McKinley, Roosevelt and John D. Long for vice president."" The box was sealed inside the lion's head by Samuel Rogers, a local coppersmith who was part of the crew renovating the nearly 200-year-old State House. Although the occasion was detailed in the city's largest newspaper, the Bostonian Society said its current staff was unaware of the time capsule until they received a letter from a descendent of Rogers alerting them to it.","Time capsule hidden since 1901 in Boston is discovered .

"Gary, Indiana (CNN) -- Darren Deon Vann was no stranger to police. Even before police caught up with him this weekend, Vann's record was well-established. He had gone to jail at least twice before on felony convictions. But -- if authorities are to be believed -- his time behind bars didn't prove much of a deterrent. Authorities went after the 43-year-old Vann this weekend in connection with the death of 19-year-old Afrikka Hardy at a Motel 6 in Hammond, Indiana. Not only did he confess to that killing, but police said Vann also admitted to six other women's deaths. Police said he led them to the women's bodies in abandoned structures in Gary, Indiana. ""It disgusts me, because it's seven bodies,"" said Ronnie Williams, a resident of the Gary neighborhood where most of the victims were found. Police: Abandoned structures searched . Vann had an initial court appearance related to Hardy's killing on Wednesday morning, but was held in contempt of court when he refused to answer the judge's questions. Vann was represented by a state-appointed public defender, Matthew Fech. There's much more that's not known publicly about Vann, in fact, than is known. Like, what is his background? What did he do for a living? Why -- if it is proven he killed these seven women -- would he do such a thing? What is known that Vann was born in Indiana but didn't stay there his whole life. Records, for instance, show he was arrested on unspecified charges while living in Cherry Point, North Carolina, in 1993. It was in the 1990s that Edward Matlock first got to know Vann. Vann had married Matlock's mother, who was about 30 years older than Vann. Matlock said he wasn't comfortable or happy with his mother's marriage, which lasted 16 years. Part of it had to do with the age difference between the couple. Then there were Matlock's observations that Vann talked to himself or sometimes seemed lost in thought, in addition to stories he heard about Vann spending time in a rough part of Austin, Texas, where the pair had moved. ""The guy is a nutcase. He is. And I'd watch him,"" Matlock told CNN's Ashleigh Banfield. ""I'd never allow him near my kids or in my home, because he just freaked me out."" Matlock said things ""went downhill"" for Vann after he got fired from a temp agency, adding he had trouble finding good work after that. Eventually, Vann and Matlock's mother moved from Austin to Gary, Indiana, where Matlock said he found them ""living in poverty."" Gary was where Vann had his first major brush with the law: in April 2004, with a woman (who wasn't Matlock's mother) who police described as Vann's girlfriend. According to a police affidavit tied to that incident, Vann threatened to burn down or blow up the home of a man who he believed was sheltering his girlfriend. Then, in front of police, he ""grabbed (his girlfriend) and told the police to back up or he would burn himself and (the girlfriend),"" the affidavit stated. With his left arm around the woman's neck and his right hand holding a gasoline can and lighter, Vann refused her requests for freedom -- right up until police grabbed and arrested him. Vann was charged with a class D felony, and spent 90 days behind bars after his conviction. At some point after his release, Vann went back to Austin. That's where, in December 2007, he was arrested again, this time for aggravated sexual assault. According to the affidavit out of Travis County, a 25-year-old woman responding to ""a service call from her employer"" met Vann and the two went to an apartment. After they got inside, ""Vann asked her if she was a police officer and she told him that she was not,"" the affidavit said. ""Vann then attacked her."" The court document details how Vann choked, repeatedly struck and raped the woman. A grand jury indicted him in July 2008. He pleaded guilty and was convicted in September 2009 and sentenced to five years in prison. That led to -- accounting for time served -- his release on July 5, 2013, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark. Again, Vann didn't stay put for long after getting out of jail. He registered as a sex offender in prison, then told officials there that he would move back to Gary, Indiana. Texas authorities alerted their colleagues in Lake County, Indiana, that Vann was to be considered a ""low risk"" sex offender, which is based on experts' assessment of the likelihood that a person will commit another sexual offense. In the 15 months since Vann left Texas, police said, Vann killed seven women, with six of their bodies found in some of the estimated 10,000 abandoned structures in Gary. There may have been more victims, police said. After Hardy was found strangled in a Motel 6 bathtub, authorities used cellular phone records to track down Vann on Saturday, along with the blue Jeep he'd been driving. Police said Vann also had Hardy's pink phone and other potentially key pieces of evidence. Police said Vann confessed, telling them he ""messed up"" and expressing surprise he had been found so quickly, Hammond Police Chief John Doughty said. A short time later, he led authorities to the six other victims. Authorities have not detailed what relationship, if any, Vann had with the victims. (In fact, police have only identified four of those killed so far.) As for why, Doughty said, ""I don't have a specific reason he does this."" Vann's next court appearance is scheduled for October 29 at the Lake County jail in Crown Point. CNN's Poppy Harlow, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Ed Payne, Marina Carver, Sonia Moghe, Stephanie Gallman, Haimy Assefa and Renee Wunderlich contributed to this report.","Police say Darren Deon Vann admitted to killing 7 women in northern Indiana .

"(CNN) -- As its relationship with the West worsen, Russia is pivoting east in an attempt to secure business with China. Chinese premier Li Keqiang is in Moscow for a meeting with his Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev. Medvedev said ahead of the meeting China was Russia's ""first foreign trade partner,"" adding the volume of bilateral trade between the two countries doubled in the last six years. The two are hoping to sign dozens of trade pacts, including a huge gas deal agreed in May. Under the 30-year gas deal, Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom will supply 38 billion cubic meters of gas to China each year starting 2019. That is around 10% of all Gazprom's sales. The price was not made public, but is estimated at around $456 billion over the 30-year term. The deal was sealed at the height of the crisis in Ukraine. Europe is dependent on Russian energy, as around 30% of Europe's gas comes from Russia. A disruption to the flow would cause a major problem for Europe. Russia is hoping its economy will get a boost from its relationship with China. Sanctions imposed on Russia by Western countries in the light of the conflict in Ukraine have slowed down its economic growth. Russia's Central Bank said the country's growth rate will most likely drop further towards the end of 2014. The IMF says that the Russian economy is in recession, and has lowered its growth forecast to just 0.2% for the year.","Chinese premier Li Keqiang is meeting his Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev .

""There were some stops and starts to it since it started yesterday (Wednesday) morning at 7 a.m., but I do know it originally started through a customer,"" said Starbucks spokesperson Linda Mills. Participant Lucy Ramone went through the line twice on Wednesday. ""I was number 57 this morning,"" Ramone said to the drive-through barista, according to Bay News 9. ""What number am I now?"" Ramone asked the barista. ""Number 297!"" Ramone raised her hands in victory. She had brought her son as a passenger to experience the second round of beverages. ""I think it just puts a smile on people's face,"" she said. ""We are greatly humbled by the generosity of our customers and store partners in the organic Pay if Forward movement happening in St. Petersburg, Florida,"" said Mills. ""It's truly a testament to the goodwill of our customers and our store team."" The hundreds of acts of kindness had at least one public critic. St. Petersburg blogger Peter Schorsch asked that readers don't call him a ""grinch"" for allegedly ending the pay it forward chain. ""In case any of you are caught up in the Pay It Forward baloney at Starbucks. I just drove through the line, bought a venti mocha frap AND DID NOT PAY IT FORWARD. The chain is broken and this silliness should stop. (P.S. I tipped the baristas $100, just so you can't call me a grinch.),"" Schorsch posted on his Facebook account. In a post on his website Schorsch wrote ""customers were being told that they had had their drink paid for and then asked would they like to pay for the drink of the person next in line. That's not generosity, that's guilt."" Mills said participation was voluntary. ""More than 750 people have participated in it at this one store, which is so amazing to see. Naturally, not everyone chose to participate, which is completely fine,"" Mills said.","More than 750 customers buy coffee for a stranger .

"(CNN) -- Fifty years ago, America's living rooms were interrupted with images of peaceful protesters in Selma or Washington or Chicago being bitten by police dogs, sprayed with fire hoses and pummeled by batons. Fifty years later, Americans again are witnessing similar images, this time from Ferguson, Missouri, near St. Louis. The shooting death of Michael Brown and the subsequent police clampdown on protests in 2014 is frighteningly similar to how law enforcement treated civil rights marchers and the media in 1964. This time, their tools are stun grenades and assault weapons. And again, the press is not just the witness, we have also become the victims. Wesley Lowery, a reporter from the Washington Post who just accepted the National Association of Black Journalists' Emerging Journalist Award, and Ryan J. Reilly of the Huffington Post, were camped out in a local McDonald's, simply recharging their phones and laptops, when several St. Louis County police officers dressed in full combat gear decided -- allegedly for safety reasons -- they had to go. When Reilly and Lowery apparently did not move fast enough, they were arrested. They were released a short time later without charges. Yes, law enforcement officers from America's heartland, sworn to protect American citizens -- black and white -- apparently saw it necessary to defy the first amendment by arresting reporters who were simply doing their jobs. And that is wrong. 2014, meet 1964. Fifty years ago, the mainstream media failed miserably because its virtually all-white reporting corps did not have the life experience to explain the reasons behind the protest marches. And stories of the attacks on protesters too often were told from the viewpoint of the police. This created an atmosphere of distrust and hostility and eventually it became unsafe for white reporters to venture into the black community. So media companies responded by hiring Black reporters to cover what became known as the ""Long, Hot Summer"" of 1967 -- where more than 100 race riots rocked the United States. By the way, that decision eventually led to the creation of the National Association of Black Journalists. Fast-forward to 2014, when a police officer fired on an unarmed Brown -- who reportedly had his hands raised in surrender. He died of multiple gunshot wounds. The community erupted. Ferguson police brought in St. Louis County Police to investigate the shooting and to handle the protests. And then all hell broke loose. Wednesday night, the police used tear gas, smoke bombs and stun grenades to break up what reporters described as a peaceful crowd. Perhaps they were too busy with their assault weapons and tactical vehicles to get around to the dogs and fire hoses. I have covered dozens of protests. I have always worn my press credentials. I have experienced the acrid, sweet smell of tear gas during the Occupy Oakland demonstrations in 2013. Police have manhandled me. Yet, I have never been arrested. What planet are these police officers on? Where did they get their training? In what manual is it spelled out that it's OK to arrest and manhandle peaceful demonstrators, much less exhausted reporters simply trying to file their stories and recharge the cell phones at a McDonald's? Journalists are there to report on the protests. We document those people who break into Foot Locker and beauty supply stores for whatever reason. We report on those protesters who bring backpacks filled with bottles, rocks, hammers and spray paint cans, as well as those who march peacefully through the streets to bring attention to a perceived injustice. We also report on police behavior, some of which does not always comply with their own police policy. During Occupy Oakland, reporters documented violations of police procedure. The police department later used our reporting as justification for re-training officers. We can't do our jobs if the police look at us the same as a guy wearing a ski mask throwing rocks. We can't do our job if we are arrested for shooting video of police behavior. And one note to the St. Louis County Police: You do not have the right to tell reporters to turn off their video cameras. Read the law, please. What is happening in Ferguson is disturbing for many reasons. Forget that the police in Ferguson used chemical weapons and blunt force to break up a peaceful demonstration. Forget that Reilly and Lowery were released without charges after being detained. They also said they had been roughed up. Their arrests should send chills up and down the backs of every citizen ... and news manager. If the police felt it was OK to arrest two reporters for not moving fast enough, you can only imagine how they are treating the residents of Ferguson when the reporters are not there and the cameras are not recording. This is America in 2014. We can do better. Complete coverage on the Ferguson shooting and protests .

"(CNN) -- A South Carolina woman whose husband tried to find a donor kidney for her for nearly a year by wearing a sandwich board on the streets of their city has gotten one -- and it's working ""A-OK,"" her husband told CNN. Jimmy Sue Swilling's donor, a retired Navy lieutenant commander, had one request, though, before the transfer. She wanted the surgery to take place on September 11, to honor the men and women who have sacrificed their lives for their country. The donor's wish was granted. Larry Swilling, Jimmy Sue's husband, said the woman, who they only met the day before the surgery, was up and walking hours after the procedure last week. ""It's pretty hard for someone who don't know you to do something like that. She's a hero,"" Swilling said of the donor. ""Being in the service for 21 years, she is a true American and she's what America is built on, heart and soul."" The donor heard about the couple from news reports about Swilling's efforts to find someone willing to give up one of their kidneys. ""NEED KIDNEY 4 WIFE"" said the sign he wore on a sandwich board over his shoulders as he walked the streets of Anderson, South Carolina. The same message was plastered on his pickup truck. Jimmy Sue Swilling was born with only one kidney, and late this summer, it was failing. Her husband wasn't a match. When Larry's campaign to find her a donor was picked up by local and national media, dozens of people got tested to see if their kidney was suitable for Jimmy Sue. The eventual donor contacted the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, where the surgery was performed last Wednesday. Jimmy Sue Swilling will leave the hospital Friday, her husband said, although they'll have to go to Charleston every month for the next four months to make sure the kidney is working properly.

"(CNN)  -- The former transit police officer accused of shooting an unarmed man at a California train station went to Nevada with his family ""to clear his mind"" after receiving death threats, his lawyer said Wednesday. Hundreds of people took to the streets of Oakland, California Wednesday night to protest the shooting. The lawyer's comments came after Johannes Mehserle was arrested on a fugitive warrant in Nevada. Leads led investigators to Johannes Mehserle, 27, in Zephyr Cove, Nevada, on Tuesday, authorities said. He was contacted through his attorney and then surrendered. ""He was always prepared to surrender himself in the case,"" Christopher Miller, attorney for Johannes Mehserle said. Mehserle waived extradition, and police officers were transporting him back to California on Wednesday. Miller said his client may face arraignment as early as Thursday morning. The lawyer spoke of Mehserle, 27, as ""a fine officer with an excellent work history"" adding ""this case is not just about a video."" Miller was referring to a cell phone video that captured the shooting. ""As this case moves forward through the justice system and all the circumstances of that chaotic night become clear, I fully expect Mr. Mehserle to be cleared of the charges against him,"" Miller said. Miller's statements were a stark contrast to comments made by district attorney Tom Orloff earlier Wednesday at a news conference announcing they were charging Mehserle with murder. ""What I feel the evidence indicates is an unlawful killing done by an intentional act,"" Orloff said. ""From the evidence we have, there's nothing that would mitigate that to something lower than a murder,"" he added. ""The murder charge was the appropriate charge given the state of the evidence."" Hundreds of people in Oakland, California, continued to express their outrage about the shooting by taking to the streets in a protest at City Hall Wednesday night. It was the first major demonstration after more than 100 people were arrested during violent protests in Oakland that followed the victim's funeral last Thursday. The protesters gathered on the front lawn of city hall, where police blocked the front entrance, at about 4 p.m. (7 p.m. ET) before marching down to City Hall. While many in Oakland, California have been vocal about the shooting, Mehserle himself has remained mum. Orloff said Mehserle's attorney has invoked his client's right to remain silent. ""In terms of an interview at this point in time, our hands are tied,"" he said.  Watch Orloff speak about the murder charges » . He is accused of the shooting of Oscar Grant III at an Oakland, California, station on New Year's Day. The incident was captured on video by several witnesses and spurred violent protests in the northern California city. Mehserle, 27, was taken into custody in Douglas County, Nevada at about 7 p.m., Sgt. Dan Coverly of Douglas County Sheriff's Office told CNN affiliate KGO-TV in San Francisco. Referring to Mehserle's arrest, BART said, ""This comes after the BART Police Department conducted a thorough investigation that involved nine detectives, which BART Police turned over to District Attorney Thomas Orloff on Monday, January 12."" Jail staff report that Mehserle has cooperated and is in a segregated area and on a precautionary health and welfare watch. Mehserle resigned from his job as a BART police officer days after the shooting. Grant, a 22-year-old father, was killed on New Year's Day in a crowded BART train station. Police had been called to the Fruitvale station after passengers complained about fights on a train and took Grant and several other people off the train once they arrived. Videos from witnesses show Mehserle shooting Grant in the back as another BART officer kneeled on the man. The shooting spawned public outrage and a string of protests that led to more than a hundred riot-related arrests. Police have not said whether Grant had been involved in the fight. The Oakland Police Department is running its own investigation into the killing, at the request of Mayor Ron Dellums, Officer Jeff Thomason said Wednesday.","NEW: Officer went to Nevada to ""clear his mind"" after death threats, lawyer says .

"Washington (CNN) -- CNN's John King and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each Sunday on ""Inside Politics"" to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days, weeks and months ahead. Some late chess moves in House races, a rush to lawyer up, and some early vote tallies that suggest Democratic struggles -- those were part of our trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table to close our Sunday conversation. 1. The candidates give way to the voters -- and then the lawyers . Eight or nine Senate races are dead heats entering the final week, so can you predict with any certainty who will win? Yes: the lawyers will. Politico's Manu Raju shared reporting that both parties, even as they make late spending and schedule decisions in the big races, are also looking past Election Day to the likelihood that so many close races will mean recounts and runoffs -- and therefore a need for legal teams. ""Here in Washington, both the party committees are already talking to lawyers on the ground. They are already planning to send people into those close states -- like potentially Alaska or Colorado or Iowa -- if they go down to the wire, to have people ready to fight, because this is an Election Day that could last for potentially months."" 2. Early voting is Democrats' ace in the hole -- until it isn't . Election Day isn't what it used to be. With more and more states adopting more liberal early and absentee voting rules, some of the closest races this year will actually be settled before poll closings a week from Tuesday. And throughout Campaign 2014, Democrats have told us that it is their not-so-secret weapon. As they see it, they won that battle in 2008 and 2012 and have the nuts-and-bolts infrastructure in place in the states where it could make a big difference in 2014. Colorado and Iowa, for example. Maybe New Hampshire and North Carolina, too. But The Atlantic's Molly Ball says the numbers, so far anyway, don't appear to be adding up the way the Democrats had hoped. ""This past week, for the first time in history, Republicans returned more early votes than Democrats in Iowa,"" said Ball. ""This is a big danger sign. Now Democrats are saying: 'Oh, those are just those people who would have voted on Election Day anyway.'"" But she notes that in the past two elections, the GOP has won Election Day voting in Iowa by more than 9 percentage points, so for Republicans to also be leading in the early vote should be a warning to Democrats about what might happen on November 4. 3. The 2014 race with the most personal 2016 implications . Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin is a conservative favorite and could be a formidable GOP presidential contender. Former Gov. Scott Walker -- well, not so much. So winning his tough 2014 re-election campaign is priority No. 1 for Walker, and Robert Costa of The Washington Post took a few moments to share his reporting about what could be the cycle's marquee gubernatorial race. ""This week you're going to see President Obama go to Milwaukee,"" said Costa. ""Democrats really think they have an opportunity there, if they can get the turnout in the state's biggest city, to put a Democrat, Mary Burke, over the top and take out one of the top candidates for the GOP in the next cycle."" 4. The war for women: Democrats looking to widen the gender gap . Democrats readily concede a giant gender gap is imperative if they are to win the big Senate races this year. Just look at Hillary Clinton's weekend appeal for Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan in North Carolina. So NPR's Juana Summers says gender politics -- and the war for women's votes -- are her big focus in the final full week of the midterm campaign. ""I saw this interesting poll last month that shows most women prefer a Republican-controlled House to a Democratic-controlled House,"" said Summers. ""I'll watch that trend in close states like in Colorado, where certainly reproductive choice issues and women have been a battleground, and in Iowa of course, while also looking to see whether or not Republicans are able to close the diversity gap in the House. And I think that will be a very important story as we are moving ahead to look forward to in 2016 as well."" 5. The margin matters: plenty of late House chess . Even most Democrats concede Republicans are likely to add to their House majority this year, but there's a big debate about how many seats are in play, and some fascinating final week chess being played. Democrats are mostly playing defense -- feeling better, for example, about two Democratic seats in New Hampshire that remain competitive to the end. On the flip side, any seats Democrats can take away from Republicans would offset losses elsewhere; it's considered a bit of a long shot, but some Democrats believe they have a shot at one in the Denver suburbs, if Democrats can meet their early voting targets. Republicans currently control 233 seats. Democrats want to keep them below 240; GOP hopes are to get to 245 or more. Two Democratic-held seats where pro-GOP forces are making a late spending push: the 6th Congressional District in Massachusetts and the 26th in Florida.","Lawyering up for potential runoff contests in Louisiana and Georgia .

"(CNN) -- Twitter just made it a little bit harder to be a troll. In the wake of reports about death and rape threats as well as other abuse targeting women as part of the so-called Gamergate movement, Twitter announced Tuesday that it has improved its reporting and blocking features. The changes, Twitter said in a blog post, will make it easier to police, and respond to, bad behavior among its roughly 284 million active users. Particularly on mobile, abuse will be easier to report, requiring less information and simplifying the way a user flags accounts or specific tweets for review. It also will become easier for users to report abuse that they see but were not the targets of themselves. Survey: 40% of Web users have been harassed . The blog post also says Twitter has improved its ""behind the scenes"" procedures to make reviewing and responding to abuse reports faster. Unlike Facebook, which requires that users create accounts using their real names, Twitter allows anonymity. That's why Twitter is sometimes the forum preferred by people who want to harass others. The service has at times come under fire for not doing enough to clamp down on such abuse. In the past few months, Gamergate has been the driving force behind a new wave of nasty, and widely reported, abuse on the site. Ostensibly an effort to improve ethical standards in video-game journalism, it quickly devolved into ugliness, with Web users identifying themselves with the movement targeting female game developers and journalists online.","Twitter has improved tools for reporting abuse .

"(CNN) -- ""Agitators"" triggering chaos and violence amid the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, aren't all locals. Of at least 78 people arrested overnight, about one in four came from outside the St. Louis area, according to the St. Louis County jail. Nearly all the arrests were for refusal to disperse. Two people, both locals, were charged with unlawful use of a weapon. And one man, from Rockton, Illinois, was charged with interfering with an officer. Among those arrested are residents of Chicago, Brooklyn, Washington, San Francisco, Austin, Des Moines, and Huntsville, Alabama, according to jail records. Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson -- who is in charge of security in Ferguson -- had a lower number of arrests, telling CNN there were 50 and 60 late Monday and into Tuesday. ""There are some outsiders, but there are (also) a lot of people who live here,"" Johnson told CNN on Tuesday. ""... So we can't blame (everything) on outside agitators."" Some say the arrests do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing. In recent days, numerous people including journalists have faced arrests after what they described as taking part in a peaceful protest or simply observing it. People from around the country and even other parts of the world have come to Ferguson to express outrage over the police shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown. But all sides agree there are a select number of people -- distinct from the majority of protesters -- who are fomenting violence. ""There is a dangerous dynamic in the night. It allows a small number of agitators to hide in the crowd and then attempt to create chaos,"" Johnson said late Monday. ""Protesters are peaceful and respectful,"" he said. ""Protesters don't clash with police. ... It is criminals who throw Molotov cocktails and fire shots that endangers life and property."" Those stirring up trouble are ""fools,"" said State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal. ""They are a disgrace to this entire movement."" ""What we are trying to address is the intimidation and harassment of police officers onto young people,"" she told CNN. But by shooting guns, throwing Molotov cocktails, and looting stores, these so-called agitators are making conditions unsafe and spurring a crackdown by authorities. ""It completely changes the narrative,"" she said Monday. ""We don't need these antagonizers out here,"" said protester Jerrell Bourrage, who said he grabbed a bottle-hurling demonstrator and told him to stop. ""We need people who can stand out here to the side and still let your word be known."" Michael Brown's parents spoke out against the violence Tuesday. ""It is a distraction, but we won't let it distract us to the point where we lose focus,"" Lesley McSpadden told NBC's ""Today."" ""We have to remain focused and we have to remain strong and the violence needs to stop. When justice has prevailed, it may regain the trust in the locals, but right now it's really out of control."" Complete coverage of the Ferguson shooting and protests . Participants in the protests also blame the authorities for violence. Police have fired tear gas and used stun grenades, angering some who believe the tactics are too heavy-handed and a sign of the dangers of police militarization. The situation presents a difficult challenge for police, said Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director who is now a CNN law enforcement analyst. The ""normal, after-midnight clientele of the police -- these hooligans"" mix in with the crowd, he said. ""So, that is what the police have to contend with."" The police tried putting away the heavy weaponry at one point last week, Fuentes noted. But then, as late night violence broke out in recent days, ""they had no alternative, and they brought them back out."" Retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, who famously defused tensions in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, said there's one tactic authorities should be sure to use. ""They have to continue to walk with the people as opposed to walk against them,"" he said. But quelling these protests will require a political and judicial solution, he said. ""The political and justice in this country need to find a way out of this that convinces people the right things will be done,"" he said. Some protesters, meanwhile, are trying a tactic of their own. On Monday night, a group of community leaders formed a human chain and walked hand-in-hand -- hoping not only to provide a buffer between police and peaceful protesters, but also to block the agitators.

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) -- Centro. Alba. Zombie Burger. The dining scene in Des Moines is pretty hot these days. So why did nearly a thousand Iowans pay $100-a-pop last Saturday night to chew wilted salads and poke at dried-out chicken breast with a bunch of strangers inside a drafty conventional hall? Politics, of course. It was the Iowa Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, the party's big annual fundraiser and final cheerleading session before next Tuesday's midterm elections. We were there for this week's edition of ""Hambycast."" Even as modern developments like Twitter, super PACs and micro-targeting erode the the quaint traditions of politics, the ""rubber chicken circuit"" endures. It's a durable fixture of campaign life, as time-honored as the gaffe and gotcha question. Democrats have their J-J Dinners, and Republicans convene at Lincoln Day Dinners or Reagan Day Dinners. There are variations of the form depending on local traditions: My favorite political banquet name is the Ruby Laffoon Dinner, held yearly by the Hopkins County Democratic Party in Kentucky and named in honor of the state's 43rd governor. But the pageantry is the same wherever you travel: Candidates and elected officials speak, rally faithful partisans and raise cash for the party organization. In places like Iowa and New Hampshire, the dinners take on an added importance: Ambitious pols with their eyes on the White House come here to test drive their national appeal and forge relationships in crucial early nominating states. On Saturday, we heard Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Senator and possible presidential candidate in 2016 or 2020, speak at the J-J in Des Moines. She was hardly the first White House aspirant to do so. ""He hadn't said he would run in 1972, but there he was on the rubber chicken circuit, glad-handing county chairmen and looking for early commitments,"" the legendary AP scribe Walter Mears wrote four decades ago in a profile of Ed Muskie, the Maine Senator who never made it to the Oval Office. The rubber chicken phrase surfaces across the decades in political journalism, and with good reason — the chow ain't grand. On Saturday, the menu was roughly the same as any J-J Dinner — or Lincoln Day Dinner or Reagan Dinner on the GOP side — you'd find in counties and states from Maine to Hawaii. There was some kind of mass-produced chicken breast, slathered with some indistinguishable sauce, accompanied by a passel of steamed vegetables. There was the all-important ""vegan option,"" for those rare Iowa herbivores in the audience. And attendees could choose from an assortment of cake slices that had been sitting out on their banquet tables for several hours before the first speaker even took the stage. But the food isn't why people come. That would be weird. ""If we lose this concept of having political parties, where people can gather and have a platform and join together, we really lose what's been at the core of democracy,"" Klobuchar said when we asked her about the importance of these dinners. ""What's missing of course if when people get there and get elected is their ability to put that aside some and work together.""","Iowa Democrats held their Jefferson-Jackson Dinner last weekend .

"(CNN) -- The stories coming out of Ferguson, Missouri, paint an increasingly worrying pictureâ€”that of a Middle America city like most any other being turned into a war zone. It began with the shooting death of Michael Brown by a local police officer. The shooting seemed questionable, but the feeling in the community was that the police could not conduct a real, impartial investigation. When the police department declined to identify the officer involved, protests began. 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting . If a listener didn't know any better, he would think the description of events unfolding in Ferguson must surely be taking place in Iraq or Afghanistanâ€”combat-armored shock troops shoot tear gas into crowds while snipers train high-powered rifles on groups of civilians from atop heavily armored MRAP (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected) assault vehicles rolling through and blocking off city streets like tanks. This is America, but it doesn't look like it anymore. Republican Rep. Justin Amash of Missouri tweeted in the morning, ""Images & reports out of #Ferguson are frightening. Is this a war zone or a US city? Gov't escalates tensions w/military equipment & tactics."" Michael Brown shooting, protests highlight racial divide . Pictures and videos tweeted out of the ""war zone"" show what appear to be camouflaged units of soldiers occupying and subduing the outraged civilians of Fergusonâ€”but these are not soldiers, they are police officers. How could a small local police force act like an occupying military force? Under what is called ""Program 1033,"" the Department of Defense has been doling out military surplus to police departments for use in causes like the domestic ""wars"" against drugs and terrorism. Billions of dollars of military arms and armament have been distributed to local police departments since the program started in the late 1990s. Ferguson violence: Police slammed for 'escalating the situation' This misguided policy leads to inevitable consequences like what we're witnessing in Ferguson. As early as 1999, the Cato Institute warned in a briefing paper, ""Warrior Cops: The Ominous Growth of Paramilitarism in American Police Departments"" that Program 1033 is a terrible idea. First, dressing police officers as soldiers is dangerous because the mindset of a soldier is entirely inappropriate for a police officer. Soldiers fight a military enemy; police officers deal with citizens, who are protected by the Bill of Rights. Opinion: Why Ferguson is your town . Second, dressing a cop as a soldier does not make him a soldier, it makes him a more dangerous cop. SWAT teams are not military special forces even if they try to act like them. Police officers simply do not have the training that military troops have, and giving them the arms, armament and attitude of being warriors is simply dangerous. Third, if cities really need a SWAT unit, that should be reserved for extraordinary situations beyond the capability of the ordinary patrolman, such as a hostage scenario. Such SWAT units should not be deployed for routine policing calls. Complete coverage on the Ferguson shooting and protests . The escalation of conflict in Ferguson didn't have to occur. If the Pentagon hands local cops millions of dollars' worth of hammers, it should be no surprise when suddenly everything looks like a nail. We can only hope the situation ends without more violence.

"(CNN) -- ""Birdman"" is flying high. The Michael Keaton film, about a former superhero-playing actor who tries to revive his career with a Broadway show, earned six Independent Spirit Awards nominations Tuesday, including best feature, best director (Alejandro G. Inarritu) and best actor for Keaton. The other nominees for best feature are ""Boyhood,"" ""Love Is Strange,"" ""Selma"" and ""Whiplash."" Three films earned five nominations -- ""Boyhood,"" ""Selma"" and ""Nightcrawler"" -- and two earned four: ""Whiplash"" and ""Love Is Strange."" Though not necessarily an Oscar indicator, getting picked by the Independent Spirit Awards -- which are open to American films with budgets below $20 million -- doesn't hurt in creating awards season buzz, and many do go on to win the big trophy. In fact, as GoldDerby.com observed, several of last year's Independent Spirit winners -- including Matthew McConaughey (""Dallas Buyers Club""), Cate Blanchett (""Blue Jasmine""), Jared Leto (""Dallas Buyers Club"") and Lupita Nyong'o (""12 Years a Slave"") -- went on to win Oscars in their respective categories. And the Oscar for best picture went to ""12 Years a Slave,"" which was also named best feature at the Independent Spirit Awards. ""Boyhood,"" the Richard Linklater-directed film that follows a boy for a dozen years as he grows up, is considered a strong contender for best picture this year. The 30th Independent Spirit Awards are scheduled for Saturday, February 21, the day before the Oscars.","""Birdman"" earns six Independent Spirit Award nominations .

"(CNN) -- America's painful struggle with racism has often brought great satisfaction to the country's rivals, critics, and foes. The killing of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, and its tumultuous aftermath has been a bonanza. ""Protests spread across U.S."" announced Iran's state-run Press TV. Russian government-controlled media showcased the dramatic pictures, ""huge explosions,"" ""mayhem unraveling,"" and what might look like the wholesale collapse of social order in America. Countries hostile to the U.S. ignore this key aspect: Behind the TV images of violence and the stunningly excessive, counterproductive police response, is that America is engaged in a profound, honest and what will prove to be a constructive debate about racism, law enforcement tactics, the weapons police use, and what life is like for minority teens. In countries where law enforcement is a tool to keep the regime in power and suppress political opposition, countries that have been on the receiving end of American and Western criticism, Ferguson was a propaganda godsend. Michael Brown's killing is an event with many layers. First, the killing itself, as details slowly emerge. Second, the people of Ferguson's reaction, which points to a reservoir of real grievances beyond the specifics of the Brown case. Then, the police response to the killing and to the protests. Ferguson has become a symbol of America's continuing struggle against racism, and the extremely serious and very urgent issue of police shooting to kill -- and killing. And there is the matter of their attitude and treatment of minorities. Any coverage that deliberately ignores the context, that ignores the debate, is incomplete, and there is a good chance that it is deliberately misleading. Responsible journalists covered the story with nuance and perspective. But that wasn't the case everywhere. The government of Russia didn't even try to hide its efforts to gain political advantage. In Rossiskaya Gazette, the official government daily, under a picture of what is presumably an African-American man wearing leg shackles, readers learned of a Russian Ministry report condemning the U.S. government's ""uses of such inhumane methods as testing medicines on inmates, forced sterilization of minority women, abuse of power by police."" The Kremlin clearly relished the opportunity to clobber the U.S. on its prison system in response to the West's sharp criticism, particularly after members of the group Pussy Riot spent time behind bars  and made Russia's prison conditions the subject of international condemnation. Russia's RT, a government-controlled network whose reporters have been resigning in protest against its biased coverage, had fun mocking America's media freedom after Ferguson police arrested reporters covering the story. In Iran, where opposition leaders languish in prison for years and human rights violations at the hands of the government are well-documented, authorities used Ferguson to undermine America's criticism. Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht Ravanchi slammed the U.S. for ""its racist behavior and oppression of the protesters in Ferguson."" Speaking to reporters in Tehran, he condemned the ""racism of Western societies ... those who claim to be advocates of human rights."" Even in Venezuela, the government of Nicolas Maduro, heir to anti-American firebrand Hugo Chavez, portrayed the events in Ferguson as something close to an uprising against the government. The state-owned television network TeleSur, which broadcasts throughout Latin America, said the Ferguson demonstrations confirm ""the presence of profound systemic problems with human rights and democratic norms in America society."" Just to be clear, this is Venezuela, Iran, and Russia, criticizing the U.S. for the weaknesses in its democracy and its handling of human rights. They were not alone in outrageous irony. The government of Egypt, which killed thousands of protesters, urged the U.S. to exercise restraint. And Chinese media twisted the State Department spokesperson's words when she called Ferguson a ""domestic affair"" outside her purview, to make it sound like Beijing's defense against criticism of its human rights abuses, which it calls domestic affairs, should be off limits to foreign critics. Even the terrorist group ISIS got in the game, urging Ferguson protesters to embrace radical Islam. ""How is democracy treating you guys?"" it asked. To be sure, undemocratic, human rights violators criticizing the U.S. does not exempt America from blame. Clearly, Ferguson points to serious problems which need to be addressed, and are being addressed, with the rapt attention of the entire country. Less cynical coverage can be readily found in other countries. The respected Dutch newspaper NRC delves not just into the problem of race and policing in America, but into the debate Ferguson has sparked in the United State. Spain's El Pais noted how the lingering racism undercuts America's moral stance in judgment of rights violators. Many describe the inequality and prejudice that persists, but makes it a point to include the progress that has been made in race relations and the race conflicts that have surfaced in the author's own country. In the end, for all the intensity of emotions and wall-to-wall domestic and international coverage, the Ferguson protests were limited in scope. Another unarmed black man was shot and killed in St. Louis, and there was no uprising. The killing of Brown was a tragedy, but nobody died in the ensuing protests despite high-powered rifles and dramatic fireworks. America is hardly alone in experiencing racism, as the Pakistani-born Canadian writer Tarek Fatah pointed out. News coverage of the events in Ferguson are a reminder for all of us of the importance of looking at the full context when viewing what happens in any country and protecting ourselves from political manipulation as we follow the news.","Frida Ghitis: Critics, foes of U.S. making hay with Ferguson, to portray U.S. in flames .

"London (CNN) -- In recent months, much ink has been spilt exploring why some young British Muslims abandon a comfortable life in the UK to join one of the most brutal and blood-thirsty terrorist groups in recent history, namely the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Sadly, much of this commentary has struggled to move beyond clichés that revolve around hate preachers and extremist websites. In order to arrive at a more nuanced understanding of why a group like ISIS is able to attract hundreds of young British Muslims, we must examine a wide range of factors that contribute towards creating a ISIS narrative that has resonance and appeal. This involves facing up to some uncomfortable truths about contemporary Muslim political discourse and coming to terms with the negative impact of the recent lurch towards vacuous literalism within British Muslim communities. There is a fundamental cognitive dissonance in the minds of many young Muslims in Britain today. On one hand a conservative religious upbringing informs individuals that they alone have the true holy book, the true God and, of course, the true religion. This gives rise to lofty expectations for Muslim societies globally. However, the reality of contemporary Muslim societies, mired in poverty, illiteracy, violence and corruption as they are, stands in stark contrast to such grand expectations. This perturbing juxtaposition requires an explanation that neither denies the perceived reality nor challenges Muslim exclusivist tendencies. Such an explanation or narrative needs to take into account the sense of victimhood and humiliation some Muslims feel and seek to externalize. It also needs to offer a program for restoring much-needed collective pride. In essence, groups like ISIS are filling this gaping void, a void other post-colonial nationalist movements have failed to fill. In the eyes of the jihadists, Muslim societies around the world are struggling today because they have been systemically undermined by western neo-colonialism and strayed from the true Islam. The solution, therefore, is to expel any semblance of western influence, along with their local stooges and puppets, and introduce a strict and harsh interpretation of Islam. The attraction for some is then obvious since by this narrative a struggle to understand complex geo-politics is replaced with a simplistic ""one size fits all"" framework. It does not require one to expend energy in difficult and searching introspection since all blame can be shifted to the perceived enemy and sinister anti-Muslim conspiracy theories. It replaces the quest for a firm sense of identity in an increasingly globalized and, at times, disorientating world with a militant and aggressive Muslim identity that seeks conflict rather than co-existence in order to distinguish itself, be relevant and create tribal cohesion. Some Muslims who don't subscribe to the tactics and ideological world-view of groups like ISIS still buy into the broad narrative such jihadist and Islamist groups purvey. The adoption of this broader narrative has become the default anti-establishment politics of today. It is a means of expressing solidarity and asserting a bold new identity while being a vehicle for seeking the restoration of pride and self-dignity. Of course, for most British Muslims the ISIS narrative has no resonance whatsoever and alternative narratives to ease the cognitive dissonance are sought. However, the steady increase in ultra-conservative Islamic mores in recent years, backed by petro-dollars from Gulf Arab States, has meant the number of young Muslims that do sympathize with the ISIS narrative is alarmingly high. After all, the ISIS reading of scripture deviates very little from the Wahabism aggressively promoted by certain Gulf States. The hundreds of British nationals did not abandon their families in the UK to join ISIS in a vacuum. The proliferation of literalist and austere strands of Islam combined with the inability of mainstream Muslim commentators to articulate a political narrative that does not reinforce the victimhood status and perceptions of grand anti-Muslim conspiracies have paved the way for ISIS propagandists. In the meantime, the over-reliance of Western states on law and war as a means of combating what is ultimately an ideological threat has meant extremist recruiters have yet to encounter a direct ideological challenge. As things stand, British and other Western-born Muslims will continue being recruited to groups like ISIS as long as we fail to diagnose the problem correctly. A correct diagnosis needs to be followed by a direct and robust ideological challenge that is accompanied by alternative models and narratives for explaining the decrepit state of Muslim societies. Of course, positive political models that young Muslims can aspire to also need to be articulated in a fashion that does not alienate or patronize. In the absence of this, dark forces that rely on unprecedented levels of brutality will continue to rise and fill a void we failed to identify.","We must examine why ISIS narrative has resonance and appeal, writes Ghaffar Hussain .

"(CNN) -- Police in New Zealand say they're powerless to arrest two boys who've caused outrage with online boasts about raping underage girls too drunk to fight back. The alleged offenses happened two years ago but were only made public this week after local media came across a Facebook site, which named and ""slut-shamed"" girls the boys had allegedly attacked. Her face and voice disguised, one of the alleged victims told 3 News: ""I just kept blacking out 'cause I had drunken too much... You could say I got raped. I had sex with three guys at one time."" The alleged offenders -- a group of then school-aged boys -- call themselves the ""Roast Busters."" Until this week police say they'd been boasting of their exploits on a number of websites, including Ask.fm and Twitter, as well as the Facebook site which has been shut down. In a video posted to YouTube, two boys made no attempt to hide their faces as they told the camera: ""We don't choose the roast, the roast chooses us ... They know what we're like; they know what they're in for."" Opinion: Don't blame women's drinking for rape . Prime Minister John Key described the boys' comments as ""extremely disturbing and disgusting,"" but appeared to sympathize with police who say they're unable to file charges until one of the alleged victims makes a formal statement. And despite one of the girls appearing on TV, police say no one is willing as of yet to file an official complaint. Police say they have been actively monitoring the group since the alleged offenses were committed in 2011. They say the Facebook site appeared for the first time for a couple of months earlier this year, and reappeared a few weeks ago. Officers had been monitoring the site for enough evidence to warrant an arrest but were unable to find any before 3 News informed Facebook of its existence and had the page shut down. Police say they've spoken with the boys but they have not admitted anything that constitutes a criminal offense. ""We have interviewed two of the boys [on Monday] again but we're still not in a position to take immediate action,"" Waitemata police District Commander Superintendent Bill Searle told CNN. ""The online claims themselves are not enough to warrant a prosecution. They might be morally inappropriate and unacceptable to us but we have to deal with evidence that would be admissible in a court of law and we haven't got to that stage yet,"" he said. Searle refuted allegations that no action had been taken because one of the boys is an officer's son. The other is said to be the son of a Hollywood actor, according to local press reports. ""NZ Police take any allegations of criminal offending by any of its officers or their families extremely seriously and recent cases have highlighted that police will not hesitate to thoroughly investigate staff facing allegations of a criminal nature and will put them before the court if there is a case to answer,"" Searle said in a statement. Police declined to confirm how many boys were involved in ""Roast Busters,"" but said the two ringleaders led a ""core group,"" as well as ""an associated group."" The boys were attending at least two different schools at the time the alleged offenses were committed but all have since graduated, police said. It's believed they're now around 17 to 18 years old. Police also declined to confirm how many victims were involved but said it was ""a relatively small number"" and confirmed at least one had attempted suicide. ""There's no doubt they've been severely traumatized by their involvement,"" Searle said. Police have been counseling the girls since the alleged offense was reported but have yet to convince any to come forward and file a formal complaint. ""We understand it's a very difficult situation for them -- and it would be a very difficult situation for them if they were to come forward for a court case,"" Searle said. The case has inspired a number of online vigilante groups. Police said they are monitoring online death threats made against the boys and that action would be taken if ""anybody oversteps the mark."" Student op-ed argues 'drinking responsibly' may reduce risk of rape . On 3 News on Tuesday evening, a group of five girls aged between 16 and 19 defended the boys as ""good guys."" ""People know that they are Roast Busters and they go hang out with them and do stuff [... ] I don't think they're rapists, they're actually pretty cool dudes,"" one said. Asked whether ""drunken group sex"" was normal behavior, another said: ""It's normal in west Auckland... Not for everybody though it's just the young ones 13 to 15 year olds -- that's what they do."" New Zealand Police Minister Anne Tolley told CNN she was satisfied that ""police are doing everything in their powers to resolve this case."" Efforts are also underway to tighten the laws on cyber bullying in New Zealand. On Tuesday, a new bill was introduced to parliament which proposes a three-year prison sentence for posting material online with an ""intent to cause harm"" as well as other measures to stop cyber bullying. ""No longer is bullying confined to the classroom or playground -- the digital age has meant tormenters can harass their target anywhere, at any time and the trails of abuse remain in cyberspace forever,"" Justice Minister Judith Collins said in a statement. ""The Harmful Digital Communications Bill sends a strong message to those who continue to harass and harm others online -- time's up."" CNN's Tim Hume and Elizabeth Joseph contributed to this report.","Teenage boys in New Zealand have boast online about raping drunken underage girls .

"(CNN) -- A Las Vegas art coordinator's planned charity sale of serial killer John Wayne Gacy's paintings is under fire from the very crime victims group that is supposed to benefit from the proceeds. The National Center for Victims of Crime is demanding that its name not be associated with the exhibit, entitled ""Multiples: The Artwork of John Wayne Gacy,"" saying it did not agree to be a beneficiary of the sale. In a written statement Thursday to CNN affiliate KTNV, the crime victims group said it sent a cease-and-desist letter to the gallery owner. Since word spread that Gacy's work would be displayed at the Arts Factory beginning this month through September, the event has been surprisingly controversial in a city where very little surprises. Westly Myles, the owner of the Arts Factory, said he opted to coordinate the show because he believed Gacy's work would provoke discussion and provide financial help to those who have been hurt by crime. ""People can think what they like, I see it as an opportunity to help from something that was bad,"" Myles said. Gacy was convicted of raping and killing 33 boys and young men during a six-year span that culminated with his capture in 1978. Most of his victims were buried in and around his home. He was dubbed ""the Killer Clown"" because he often performed as ""Pogo the Clown"" at events for children. While awaiting execution, Gacy began painting. After his execution in 1994, his attorney auctioned off his artwork. Some of it was purchased and destroyed in a bonfire attended by 300 people, including some family members of Gacy's victims. Gacy's paintings have often generated controversy in galleries across the nation. ""Multiples: The Artwork of John Wayne Gacy,"" is meant to reflect the multiple aspects of his life, according to johnwaynegacyart.com, a website set up to promote the show. ""We are familiar with multiple aspects of Gacy's story. He worked multiple jobs, lived multiple lives and committed multiple crimes,"" the site said. ""What we are unfamiliar with is the art Gacy created while awaiting execution: multiple paintings."" Seventy-four pieces will be put up for sale at the Las Vegas exhibition. They include pencil drawings and audio recordings, and paintings of skulls, clowns and the seven dwarves from the Snow White fairy tale. Included among the collection is an oil painting entitled ""Dahmer Skull,"" which is price at $2,000 and was inspired by serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. But perhaps the most controversial piece is a self-portrait entitled ""Goodbye Pogos"" listed at $4,500. Gacy reportedly gave these portraits to ""close pen-pals at the end of his life,"" according the website. Also for sale, according to the site, are reproduction and merchandising rights to Gacy's artwork. Myles said the proceeds would be divided evenly among the charities. If the crime victims group doesn't want the money, Myles said he would find another organization to donate the proceeds. Meanwhile, two other organizations named as beneficiaries of the sale say they are reconsidering accepting the money. . ""I think anyone would be pretty creeped out by it,"" Anne Mulford, the board president of the Contemporary Arts Center, told KTNV. The Contemporary Arts Center, a nonprofit gallery, is among those to receive monies from the sale. ""I'll just be honest with you, that's how I feel, I don't want to see the art,"" Mulford said.","Exhibit coordinator: ""I see it as an opportunity to help from something that was bad""

"London (CNN) -- Even a king can get them. Researchers working with the remains of King Richard III said on Wednesday that he was infected with roundworms in his intestines. They know because they found multiple roundworm eggs in soil samples from around his pelvis, where his intestines would have been, according to a study published online in the journal Lancet. New mystery: A coffin inside a coffin . Eggs were not found in a sample taken from near the king's head, and a sample from around his grave showed only scant contamination, the researchers said. Last year, archaeologists unearthed a body buried beneath a nondescript parking lot in the city of Leicester. In February, they confirmed the remains were those of Richard III, the last king of England to die on the battlefield. Is this the face that launched 1,000 myths? The news drew global attention, thanks in part to Richard's bloodthirsty reputation -- as immportalized in William Shakespeare's play ""Richard III."" As many as 1.2 billion people in the world are thought to be infected with Ascaris lumbricoides, the kind of roundworm eggs found in the king's remains, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ascaris lives in the intestine and eggs are passed in the feces. Some people infected show no symptoms, but some can have abdominal discomfort. In severe cases, the infection can cause intestinal blockage and stunt growth in children, the CDC said. Cases in present day Britain are rare, according to the National Health Service, with most cases now diagnosed occurring in people who have traveled from parts of the world where roundworm is present. War of the Roses . King Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, at age 32. It was the last fight in the War of the Roses, which ended with Henry VII of the Tudor line on the throne. The Leicester site is where a church, known as Greyfriars Friary, once stood. Back from the grave, King Richard III gets rehab . Over the centuries, the whereabouts of the friary's remnants were forgotten, but it remained in the records as the burial place of Richard III. Last year, archaeologists began to excavate the parking lot site, and in February announced that they were convinced ""beyond reasonable doubt"" that the skeleton found there belonged to Richard. Mitochondrial DNA extracted from the bones was matched to Michael Ibsen, a Canadian cabinetmaker and direct descendant of Richard III's sister, Anne of York, and a second distant relative, who wished to remain anonymous. Experts said other evidence -- including battle wounds and signs of scoliosis, or curvature of the spine -- found during the search and more than four months of tests afterward strongly supported the DNA findings. The king's remains are due to be reburied in Leicester Cathedral, close to the site of his original grave, next year. CNN's Dana Ford wrote in Atlanta and Laura Smith-Spark in London. Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","Multiple roundworm eggs are found in samples from where his intestines would've been .

"(CNN) -- Here we go again. Yet another supposed crisis in the ongoing soap opera between the Obama administration and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon, visiting Washington last week, was snubbed by top U.S. officials. Jeffrey Goldberg, writing in the Atlantic under the headline ""The Crisis in U.S.-Israel Relations Is Officially Here,"" anonymously quoted a senior Obama administration official calling Netanyahu a ""chickenshit"" and said the Prime Minister ""has told several people ... that he has 'written off' the Obama administration, and plans to speak directly to Congress and to the American people should an Iran nuclear deal be reached."" We should be used to these by now. And that's why those who are interested in these matters ought to lie down, take a deep breath and wait until this one passes. The U.S.-Israeli relationship isn't in crisis, and it's not on the verge of failing. Indeed, unlike Lehman Brothers, it's too big to fail -- despite the every real dysfunction at the top. And here's why: . First a little perspective and comment on the paradoxical nature of the travails of this very Odd Couple. This isn't by a long stretch the worst patch in the ties between these two countries. In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened actual sanctions against Israel and Britain if they didn't stand down from their attack against Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser and the Suez Canal. In 1975, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger recalled U.S. Middle East ambassadors to reassess U.S.-Israel ties to pressure Israel to accept the second Sinai disengagement agreement with Egypt. President Ronald Reagan withheld fighter aircraft to Israel over Israel's policy toward Lebanon. Former Secretary of State James Baker in 1990 banned Netanyahu from the State Department for anti-U.S. remarks. President George H.W. Bush denied Israel loan guarantees over Israel's settlement policies. And in 1996, Bill Clinton frustrated after his first meeting with then Netanyahu, exploded, ""Who's the f--g superpower here?"" The difference in the tensions between now and then are twofold. First, in many of these cases, the U.S. actually threatened to take consequential action or did act. Second, in many of these former relationships, Israel and the U.S. cooperated on important matters regarding peace and war and actually achieved much. Today, we seem to have the worst of both worlds -- it's just talk, and Obama and Netanyahu aren't getting much done. So why the blow up? We just had a supposed crisis over the Gaza war, right? The fact is the problem between Obama and Netanyahu is chronic. Several factors sustain it, driven by deep frustration and even anger reflected in the Obama' official's comment. First, these two don't get along. Bibi is gruff on the outside and unsure of himself on the inside. Obama is mellower in his exterior and supremely confident of himself inside. Bibi is persuaded that Obama is unforgiving on the issue of understanding his politics and bloodless when it comes to Israel's security needs as a small power. And Obama is persuaded that Netanyahu thinks not a whit about U.S. interests and cares nothing about reciprocity. And then there's the fact that Obama thinks Netanyahu is exaggerating the downsides of a nuclear deal with Iran, and Netanyahu believes the President really doesn't get the severe risks of one. Indeed, it might well be that the current tensions are related to the looming deadline next month for a comprehensive agreement with Iran on the nuclear issue and how each side will react if there's an agreement -- or if one doesn't materialize. One thing is clear: There's no getting off this roller coaster ride so long as Obama and Netanyahu are around. Their personalities won't change and neither will the issues -- settlements, a two-state solution, Iran -- that divide them. But neither is there the need to rush to the conclusion that the U.S.-Israeli relationship is on the verge of a profound crisis that its friends fear and its detractors long for. First, neither Netanyahu nor Obama is looking for an open fight. This behind-the-scenes trash talk is one thing; a sanctioned public campaign to question Netanyahu's manhood and competence is quite another thing. Obama has been reluctant to go beyond words because he knows there's no profit in it. He can't stop settlements, promote a two-state solution or even marshal support for an Iran deal without Israel's acquiescence. And with midterms coming, what possible reason is there for a fight with Israel? To show Iran that Obama's a tough guy? That's a good one. As for Netanyahu, even if he were really popular at home, he can't afford to mismanage the U.S.-Israeli relationship. But he might have concluded that the administration is so bogged down in its own problems and the Middle East is so rife with extremism and jihadi violence that Washington wouldn't dare go after Israel right now. Second, the reality is that American public support for Israel remains high. And the behavior of ISIS, Hamas, Hezbollah, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the chaos in Iraq and Syria make the turmoil in Arab nations the best talking points to support a strong U.S.-Israeli relationship. This isn't likely to change anytime soon. Finally, there are productive and unproductive fights to have with Israel. An unproductive one is done out of frustration, anger and with no strategy to actually get anything done. A productive one is done with purpose because there's some problem that is worth pressing a close ally to solve; and when the smoke clears, that fight leads to a result that everyone can claim as a success. Henry Kissinger fought with Yitzhak Rabin over disengagement agreements following the 1973 war; Jimmy Carter with Menachem Begin over Camp David and James Baker with Yitzhak Shamir over getting to the Madrid conference. And everyone won. The irony about the current ""crisis"" between two close allies is that there's really nothing worth fighting about. And that makes for soap opera, not good policy.","Israel's defense minister is snubbed by top U.S. officials, who also speak negatively about Prime Minister .

"(CNN) -- Dubbed ""Ghana's Bob Marley,"" reggae sensation Rocky Dawuni is known not only for bringing his upbeat vibe to audiences across the world, but also for promoting social issues through his extensive humanitarian work. The acclaimed singer-songwriter first fell in love with reggae at a young age when he heard a Ghanaian military band play a Bob Marley song. He was instantly hooked. ""I remember totally being drawn to the words and also the message and the intentions of the music,"" he told CNN's Isha Sesay. Now based in Los Angeles, Dawuni has recorded five albums and performed alongside global stars such as Stevie Wonder on some of the world's biggest stages. But perhaps his most impressive feat so far has been the creation of the Independence Splash festival in Ghana, an annual event that attracts thousands of music lovers and also raises awareness for a series of social causes, including provision of clean water and education for girls. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: Can you describe the first time you ever heard reggae and the feeling it created in you? Rocky Dawuni: The first time I heard reggae music was (in) Michel Camp, which is a military barracks in Ghana where I was born. There was a military band called Hot Barrels which used to ... do covers. I was interested in music, so every time I used to hang out at their rehearsal. And then one time, they started playing covers, Bob Marley, and I remember totally being drawn to the words and also the message and the intentions of the music. It was really love at first sight. And since then I also realized that my calling too was in that direction, using music as that tool to articulate all that I see around me. CNN: When did you first realize you could sing? RD: Right from the onset, because our environment in Africa, everything is music. When a child is born, everybody's singing, when there's celebration, everybody's singing. So at that time, I just joined in everywhere and I realized that I could ... make up melodies, I was like, this could be an interesting path for me. Then I started growing in my confidence, I started researching about it and then it just took off from there. CNN: You grew up being motivated by spreading a message -- how was that received as you were playing your first concerts? RD: The thing that I believe about messages is that you have to understand that the message is always higher than the messenger. So you always have to put the message in such a way that you don't become preachy, because we're all on this journey together, everybody who's part of this human family. Me having that platform doesn't mean that it makes me a person that can be able to point people in the right direction -- I just open options and I create the environment, and that environment creates dialogue. And it's just like, when we start talking amongst each other, we'll figure it out. So I believe in the subtlety of the message. CNN: Which is more important to you, critical acclaim or commercial success? RD: All of it has its place, but in the long run, my intention ... is that I want the music to be in the hands of everybody, so I don't look at it more as a commercial thing, I look at it in terms of the message and the communication. I want everybody to experience what I have experienced, I want to communicate with everybody. I want everybody to feel and understand what message I'm trying to carry across. I want everybody to be part of this new brotherhood of all of us. I call it the brotherhood of all of us because everybody is part of it. It doesn't matter what your background is, what's your religion, what's your cultural background, what's your gender. It doesn't matter. We are all together in this world. We are sharing the same space, we are breathing the same air. CNN: Every year you put on a concert called the Rocky Dawuni Independence Splash, talk to me about it. RD: Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to be independent. So I realized that Ghana's independence day, its importance was not only a matter of celebrating the day, its importance was that this day could be a day we could use to reflect on where Africa is. And right now ... Ghana has really taken the leadership role when it comes to having democratic institutions, stability and even economically. So Ghana has really been able to do all things that I feel ... we need to share with the rest of Africa as we were the first independent country. So I felt that the concert was a means to start this celebration whereby all Africa comes and in doing so, there's the music and there's also all the dimensions of us interacting with each other. So every year, no matter where I am, I go back and then have this event and then also I started using it for social causes. We've worked on everything from water issues to girl child education issues, to hand washing, sanitation issues, HIV/AIDS. For me, I feel that my talent, whatever God has given me, my abilities that God has given me, is for me to utilize for that purpose.","Rocky Dawuni is a reggae musician and spokesman for social causes .

"(CNN) -- Scott Brown knows how to stay in the spotlight. And for a politician who's sitting on the sidelines, possibly waiting to make his next move, staying in the spotlight is smart politics. Some out-of-office politicians write books, some host cable TV or radio talk shows or serve as pundits. Brown's following a different playbook. The former U.S. senator from Massachusetts, who recently moved to New Hampshire and is considering a GOP challenge this year to Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, is once again in the headlines. Brown jammed on stage this past weekend at a concert in Lynn, Massachusetts, with longtime rock group Cheap Trick, joining the band in playing ""Surrender,"" one of its biggest hits from the 1970s. ""Hope you all enjoy this as much as I did,"" he said in a Facebook post, which links to the YouTube video of Brown singing and playing guitar. The story played across New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and grabbed some national coverage as well. This was the second high-profile jam session for Brown, who started to play guitar about year ago. In December, he rocked with his daughter, Ayla, of ""American Idol"" fame, and Mike Huckabee on the former Arkansas governor and 2008 GOP presidential candidate's Fox News Channel program. A few weeks ago, Brown made the front page of the ""Union Leader,"" New Hampshire's largest newspaper, as he stripped down to his bathing suit for the annual Penguin plunge at Hampton Beach. The event raises money for the Special Olympics. Brown famously stripped down years before, as a Cosmopolitan centerfold during his years as a law school student. From the State House to Capitol Hill . In January 2010, the little-known Republican state senator in Massachusetts pulled an upset in a special election to serve the final three years of the late Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy's term. Brown lost his 2012 re-election bid to Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren. Since leaving Capitol Hill, Brown took an on-air contributor gig at Fox News, served as a colonel in the Army National Guard's office at the Pentagon, and is an attorney at the global law firm of Nixon Peabody, which has offices in Boston. Last year, he passed on running in a special election in Massachusetts to fill the term of John Kerry, who left the Senate to become secretary of state. And at the time, Brown also announced that he wouldn't make a 2014 bid for an open governor's seat in the Bay State. Brown last year made a number of speaking appearances at GOP events in the Granite State. And last fall, in another hint about a possible run for the Senate in New Hampshire, Brown dropped the 'MA' from his Twitter handle. A few months later, he sold his home in the Bay State and moved his residency north to New Hampshire. A brand name . Brown's well known in New England, which gives him many advantages. ""He can be an undeclared candidate and make news. He doesn't need to build his name ID,"" a Republican strategist who's been in contact with Brown told CNN. ""That gives him the luxury to wait longer than a new and unknown candidate. He already has a brand name and has the ability to raise resources to launch a campaign,"" the strategist said. Brian Walsh, a GOP strategist and communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee the past two election cycles, said Brown's cementing his image as a regular guy. ""The main reasons candidates announce early is to raise money, boost name ID and to have an edge in their party's primary. But Scott Brown already enjoys the unique position where those aren't necessarily major factors if he decides to run in a state with a late September primary and where he's already well-known and well-liked among many New Hampshire voters,"" Walsh said. Brown's strong name ID is definitely a plus, but it also may be a minus. After a couple of outside conservative groups ran TV commercials in support of Brown, Shaheen started fundraising off the threat of a Brown entry into the race. And some outside pro-Democratic groups targeted Brown, including the Senate Majority PAC, which went up with attack ads, charging that he's a favorite of the Wall Street crowd. Will Brown run? The strategist in contact with Brown, who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely, says Brown's looking to make a decision about a Senate bid in the next few weeks. ""I think he understands the opportunity in 2014 to win, but he's facing a number of family concerns that are weighing on this decision. I think he is genuinely conflicted and he first needs to figure out if he has the ability to run a political campaign given the family concerns. Among those concerns is his mother's in declining health. Plus, he's helping to plan two weddings right now, as both of his daughters are getting married this summer,"" the source said. Some New Hampshire Republicans who at first didn't take Brown's flirtations seriously have changed their minds. ""I've gone from a skeptic to a convert on the possibility of a Brown candidacy. He appears to be considering this race very seriously, which clearly makes Sen. Shaheen and her team nervous. His favorable poll numbers plus the activist encouragement he is receiving only helps,"" GOP strategist Jim Merrill told CNN. ""Either way, voters hope he decides soon as they're anxious for the primary field to be set, with other GOP candidates out there working hard,"" added Merrill, who was a senior adviser for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. As Brown continues to mull his options, CNN has confirmed he will speak next month at the Northeast Republican Leadership Conference, a high-profile event in New Hampshire. This latest move keeps Brown in the spotlight, and sparks more speculation he'll run for Senate.

"(CNN) -- A Canadian woman accused of stalking Alec Baldwin began sending ""a series of annoying and unsolicited communications"" to the actor after having dinner with him in fall 2010, according to a criminal complaint filed Monday. Genevieve Sabourin, 40, was arrested by New York police Sunday on five misdemeanor counts of harassment and stalking after she appeared at Baldwin's Manhattan home. A judge released Sabourin on her own recognizance after a court appearance Monday, but ordered her to return for a May 14 hearing. Until then, she must keep away from Baldwin, 53, and not send him any e-mails or text messages, the judge ordered. Their encounters, including an incident Friday night, during which she showed up at a Lincoln Center movie screening hosted by Baldwin, has caused him to suffer ""anxiety, annoyance and fear,"" the court filing said. She sent Baldwin a dozen e-mails last week that added to his stress, the complaint said. ""I NEED TO START MY NEW LIFE, WITH MY NEW NAME, WITH MY NEW CARRIER IN MY NEW COUNTRY HELP MY NEWLY HUSBAND, YOU!"" an April 4 e-mail said. ""I NEED YOU NOW, PLEASE ALEC COME AND PICK ME UP NOW. I AM LESS THAN 10 MIN AWAY FROM YOU TONIGHT. SAY I DO TO ME,"" another message the same day read. ""I'M EXISTED ABOUT THAT PORTION OF THE PROCESS, CREATING GENEVIEVE BALDWIN AND GET ALL OF WHAT I WANT IS THE BEST PART,"" she wrote, according to the court document. Two days later, Baldwin got this e-mail: . ""I HOPE I DID GOOD ENOUGH LAST NIGHT FOR ALL YOUR EFFORTS. I HOPE I DID NOT RUIN EVERYTHING BY MY LACK OF FREEDOM AND PASSIVE ACTIONS...IHATE MYSELF FOR BEING SO PASSIVE. BUT I AM EXHAUSTED AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO, THEN PROTECT MYSELF, I AM VERY WEAK NOW AND VULNERABLE...AND SO, I PLAYED DEFENSIVE INSTEAD OF GOING FOR IT. I AM SO SORRY, I DID NOT KNOW."" A e-mail sent to Baldwin Saturday read in part: . ""THERE ARE VERY CRUCIAL/VITAL THINGS I NEED HERE AND TODAY, I WANT YOU TO BE THE ONE GIVING THEM TO ME. I NEED TO SEE YOU NOW."" The complaint described Baldwin's previous relationship with the woman as limited to their meeting ""briefly for dinner in the fall of 2010."" However, she served as a unit publicist for the 2002 Eddie Murphy movie ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash,"" in which Baldwin had a cameo role. It was not immediately clear whether Baldwin and Sabourin met on the set. Sabourin is described in several media reports as an actress; however, her online LinkedIn resume lists her current occupation as a film producer in Montreal. Police confirmed she is from Montreal. The stalking suspect's acting resume is sparse, with a handful of small roles in Canadian TV productions, the last in 2007, according to the Internet Movie Database. Her biggest film acting credit appears to be in Tom Sizemore's ""Swindle,"" a 2002 crime thriller, according to the IMDb. ""As you know, stalking is a serious issue, so we've turned this matter over to the New York Police Department,"" Baldwin's publicist told CNN on Monday. Baldwin is engaged to marry Hilaria Thomas, a 27-year-old yoga instructor. CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.","NEW: Genevieve Sabourin is free until a May 14 hearing, but she must stay away from Baldwin .

"(CNN) -- Over the past two days, President Barack Obama has finally weighed in on the tragic shooting of Michael Brown, as well as the wave of protests that emerged in its aftermath. In an official White House statement on Wednesday and a brief speech from Martha's Vineyard on Thursday, the President played his usual role of ""the uniter,"" preaching calm and healing to the American public. I wish he'd just said nothing. To be clear, I didn't have any unrealistic expectations for Obama. I didn't expect him to pump a black fist in solidarity or scream ""fight the power"" from the makeshift press room. I didn't even need him to take a clear side on the issue. I did, however, expect him to tell the truth. Instead, the President delivered a polite but ultimately dangerous message to the American public. Noticeably absent from President Obama's remarks was the issue of race. Despite Ferguson being 68% black, Ferguson's police force is nearly all white. Blacks in the town comprise 86% of all vehicle stops and 85% of all arrests. Over the past week, black residents of the town have complained of racial harassment from law enforcement. That, combined with the trend of unarmed black men being the victims of extrajudicial killings, makes the racial implications of Brown's death quite strong. Even if one were to believe that Michael Brown's killing had nothing to do with race -- a naÃ¯ve position at best -- the wave of protests and debates that emerged after it happened have been undeniably racial. By not mentioning this racial dimension, the President reinforced the immature notion that racism can be defeated simply by pretending it doesn't exist. Full coverage on Ferguson shooting . Rather than leading the nation into a new level of racial understanding and dialogue, the President took the safe path through the door of post-racial rhetoric. Obama has also placed the highest priority on remaining calm. While this may seem reasonable on its face, particularly against the backdrop of rioting and looting, his words failed to acknowledge the legitimacy of black anger. Black people die violent deaths way out of proportion to their numbers, sometimes killed by rogue cops and even more often each other. Why would we not be angry? Opinion: Obama needs to lead on racial profiling legislation . But unlike black-on-black violence, which is tragic but typically punished through proper legal channels, killings of unarmed young people by law enforcement continue to happen with impunity. Instead of acknowledging the legitimacy of black anger over this, the President simply told us to calm down and stop looting. In doing so, he joined the chorus of far too many politicians and civil rights leaders who understate and trivialize righteous anger in order to show the public that they have ""the people"" under control. Perhaps most frustrating, however, was the president's insistence on using the language of equivalence when describing the rioting. Similar to his ""Philadelphia Compromise"" speech on race back in in 2008, where he ignored the legacy of white supremacy and placed the racial frustrations of white and black Americans on equal historical tiers, Obama chided both black rioters and Ferguson police with the same moral tone. The President ignored the fact that the militarized Ferguson police force were the antagonists of the unrest, in both shooting the unarmed Brown and then using excessive force during the protests. In doing so, he (perhaps unwittingly) supported the narrative in some quarters of well-intentioned police officers whose hands were forced by violent natives.","In Brown shooting, Obama preached calm. Marc Lamont Hill would rather he'd said nothing .
He says Obama left out mention of race, a clear factor in police antagonism in Ferguson .
He says extrajudicial killings of blacks undeniable; Obama comments left this out .
Hill: Obama chided protester, cops in same moral tone; equivalence gave cops cover ."
"(CNN) -- Much has changed for Fresno State student body President Pedro Ramirez since he made news in November for admitting to being an undocumented immigrant. For one, he says he's been threatened countless times. ""My cell phone info was public since I'm the (student body) president and so that was leaked out and people were calling me at night leaving me very -- let's say passionate voice mails,"" he said. The worst was the voice mail of gunshots and someone laughing in the background, he said. He received phone calls from as far away as Utah from someone who said they were coming to California to make a ""citizen's arrest"" because he was ""illegal."" They never showed up, he said. Ramirez moved with his parents from Mexico when he was 3. He has little memory of living anywhere other than Tulare, California, located about 45 miles outside Fresno. ""I wanted to go to the military, but then I started asking questions and found out I wasn't a citizen. And then I found out I was undocumented,"" Ramirez told CNN in November. ""I knew I was born in Mexico, but I was under the impression that we fixed our legal residency. So when I found out that wasn't the case, I was a little taken away."" For four years, Ramirez did not reveal his undocumented status. When he started college at Fresno, he told a few friends about his illegal status and hoped they would keep his secret. That all changed in November after an anonymous tip to the Fresno State newspaper, The Collegian, leaked his undocumented status. Reaction to the news was mixed. While a small, but vocal group came out against Ramirez, Fresno State President John D. Welty emerged as one of Ramirez's most high-profile supporters. ""I commend (him) and other AB 540 students who are following the statute as they seek higher education despite a great many difficulties that undocumented immigrants face,"" Welty said in a statement to CNN. AB 540 is a California state law that allows qualified undocumented students to pay in-state tuition, instead of out-of-state tuition, at California's public higher education institutions. ""When (his) immigration status was made public ... there was some campus controversy and it occurred at the same time when the Student Senate voted to endorse the Dream Act,"" Welty said. ""My support of their efforts stems from a hope that our campus and community will remember that diverse colleges and universities better prepare students for the diverse workplace of today and tomorrow."" Welty was referring to legislation that calls for offering a path to citizenship for some illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children. In December, the Dream Act was defeated by a Republican filibuster in the Senate after winning passage in the House. Despite his support for Ramirez, Welty said the controversy and conflict surrounding the student is understandable. Still, he lauds Ramirez for ""encouraging students to strive to change laws in our nation that may be unjust."" Fellow Fresno State senior Neil O'Brien -- who describes himself an Argentinean-American citizen born to legal immigrant parents from Argentina -- became Ramirez's most vocal critic. ""There is a process to become a citizen. There is a path. My parents emigrated here from South America. They took the path Pedro should have taken. That's the process in place and that's the process he should have applied to. He shouldn't be a special case. He shouldn't be granted special treatment,"" O'Brien said in a phone interview with CNN. O'Brien created a website called www.TheRealPedro.com, which he uses to ""expose"" Ramirez, he says on his website. ""I agree with diversity. This is nothing against diversity,"" O'Brien told CNN. ""This is not about race or anti-diversity. Everybody knows this country was built by immigrants. But we are a nation of laws. The reason this country is so great is because we have laws."" In recent months, other college students have come forward as undocumented immigrants. This month, U.S. immigration officials decided that an undocumented immigrant in Georgia apprehended by authorities after driving without a license can stay in the United States for another year. Reached by phone as she rushed to class last week, Kennesaw State University student Jessica Colotl told CNN the decision was ""like a big present."" Mariano Cardoso, 23, a Capital Community College student in Hartford, Connecticut, is also undocumented. Much like Ramirez, the Mexican college student has lived in the United States since his family entered the country illegally when he was a toddler. In late April, Connecticut's governor and two U.S. senators announced they had won the fight against Cardoso's deportation and that he would be allowed to stay in the United States, for now, and graduate this month with his classmates. ""I think that's great,"" Ramirez said Cardosa's case. ""I believe that he's a student like me. It shows that people support us. Just like the polls show, (the U.S. would) rather have students who want to stay in the country. They want to find a path for them rather then deport them."" For Ramirez, his dream is still very much alive. He's looking into continuing his education to get a master's in public administration and policy. To those who criticize his still illegal status, he said, ""Until Congress decides to act, there's no process"" to become a citizen. He understands he is a divisive character, but said he's received more support than attacks in the six months since his immigration status was released. He is scheduled to graduate on May 21.","Pedro Ramirez is Fresno State student body president .

"(CNN) -- Afghanistan's recent signings of strategic partnerships with the United States and other countries have provided a measure of reassurance to Afghans about the international community's sustained engagement in the country beyond 2014, when the drawdown of NATO combat forces will be complete. But these documents are short on specifics and do not fully tackle the political, economic and regional challenges that need to be addressed so the Afghan army and police can take responsibility for the security of the country. To give this transition a real chance of succeeding, Afghanistan and its partners need to concentrate on the risks and challenges in the critical next two years. At the NATO summit in Chicago beginning Sunday, the withdrawal timetable of international forces from Afghanistan and future commitments to support the Afghan government and army after the drawdown will be key areas of discussion. A user's guide to the Chicago NATO summit . The U.S. political strategy in Afghanistan remains largely focused on talks with the Taliban, and a chorus of voices inside and outside the government is optimistically making the case that the Taliban have reformed and can be ""reconciled."" While there is general consensus among Afghans that a broad-based and inclusive reconciliation is necessary to end the conflict, key questions remain about the political order that may emerge from such a process. This lack of discussion has amplified fears among the Afghan population of a grand bargain either between the United States and Pakistan or between the Afghan government and a resurgent Taliban -- tacitly endorsed by NATO countries seeking a face-saving exit -- that could undo the social gains and ethnic pluralism in current Afghan politics. These concerns are already creating fractures in the fragile political balance among Afghanistan's various ethnic powers and exacerbating fears of a civil war once the international troops exit. NATO invites Pakistan to Chicago summit . Afghans also remain concerned about the 2014 presidential elections, when President Hamid Karzai is due to step down. The absence of an ""inevitable"" candidate and political trust are likely to lead to an enormously challenging electoral environment, rife with legitimate worries about voter fraud. To instill confidence in the process, the international community needs to assist Afghan efforts to ensure credible elections through technical and diplomatic support. All Afghan political actors need to be on board for changes planned in the electoral process. This will also be an opportunity to offer any reconcilable Taliban a chance to be part of the election process. The most critical element to securing peace in Afghanistan will be convincing Pakistan to close down Taliban sanctuaries. While Pakistan and Afghanistan have set up joint mechanisms aimed at establishing more firm control over Taliban contacts, Afghans continue to believe that Islamabad's policy gurus will continue to use its control over the Taliban as bargaining chips in order to retain maximum leverage on reconciliation and the post-2014 political order in Afghanistan. NATO's post-Afghanistan future unclear . A jittery Iran, incensed by the U.S.-Afghan partnership, also has the potential to foment instability. China, the central Asian republics, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are other key regional players that are anxious about the form the post-2014 political order will take. If more is not done to address their concerns, these regional actors may revert to supporting competing factional elements in Afghanistan and feed the conflict as they did during its 1990s civil war. Afghans are trying to soften the blow to the economy that will follow the NATO drawdown and to move toward sustainability through regional economic cooperation, agricultural development, mining and associated infrastructure improvement. While this strategy is necessary for the long-term, Afghans want to see clear signs that steps are being taken to avoid repeating the lawlessness and violence that followed when Moscow cut billions of dollars of aid to the Najibullah regime in 1991. To bolster confidence in the economy's sustainability, the international community will need to pace the reduction of aid, work with the Afghan government to create an enabling environment for foreign investment and support economic projects in the areas of mining, infrastructure and trade. It will also have to ensure that the tools for allocating and managing aid money are improved to minimize the possibility that these vital resources will be squandered through corruption and wasteful spending. Afghanistan -- located in the heart of the most dangerous neighborhood in the world -- still matters, and the security concerns of the United States and the international community will continue to be affected by instability in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The task ahead, in Chicago and later this summer at a conference on Afghanistan in Tokyo, is to focus concretely on how best to restructure and reprioritize international efforts to strengthen the prospects for a successful political, economic and military transition to a sovereign and stable Afghanistan. That will be the real test facing a fatigued international community and concerned Afghans. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rina Amiri and Omar Samad.","Afghanistan's future will be a focus at the NATO summit in Chicago on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge on Monday dismissed the latest lawsuit filed by champion cyclist Lance Armstrong aimed at halting the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's case against him. ""This Court cannot interfere, contrary to both the will of Congress and Armstrong's agreement to arbitrate, on the basis of a speculative injury,"" U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks wrote. The USADA -- a quasi-government agency recognized as the official anti-doping agency for Olympic, Pan American and Paralympic sports in the United States -- has accused Armstrong of using, possessing, trafficking and giving to others performance-enhancing drugs, as well as covering up doping violations. Lance Armstrong refiles suit against anti-doping agency . The seven-time Tour de France winner asked the court for action against the USADA for a host of reasons, having maintained he's never tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs and accusing the USADA and its CEO, Travis Tygart, of being out to get a ""big fish"" to justify the agency's existence. Armstrong did not post any reaction to Monday's decision on his Facebook or Twitter pages, which he often updates several times daily, and his representatives did not respond to CNN requests for comment. In his ruling, Judge Sparks ruled that Armstrong's assertions that he unfairly didn't have the right to due process ""fail as a matter of law, and must be dismissed."" The judge also refused to side with the cyclist on his other claims, including that the USADA should not have jurisdiction in his case. He noted that federal law dictates that eligibility questions for cycling and other such sports should ""be decided through arbitration, rather than federal lawsuits."" Armstrong, the judge pointed out, ""has not exhausted his internal remedies, namely ... procedures in the USADA protocol."" ""Even if the Court has jurisdiction over Armstrong's remaining claims, the Court finds they are best resolved through the well-established system of international arbitration, by those with expertise in the field, rather than by the unilateral edict of a single nation's courts,"" stated Sparks, a judge in the U.S. district court based out of Austin, Texas. Armstrong had filed a lawsuit against the USADA in July, only to have it thrown out a day later by Sparks. At that time, the judge wrote that the cyclist's case was was full of legally irrelevant claims ""included solely to increase media coverage of this case"" and stir up hostility toward the USADA. The suit was refiled the following day, once again urging the court to file an injunction against the USADA but 55 pages shorter than the original. The 40-year-old Armstrong faces a lifetime ban and could be stripped of his Tour de France victories if found guilty by the USADA. Armstrong won the tour each year from 1999 to 2005, most of those for a team sponsored by the U.S. Postal Service. He retired twice from cycling -- first in 2005, for four years, and again in 2011. 3 former Armstrong associates banned for life . In a June letter to Armstrong, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, the USADA said it collected blood samples from Armstrong in 2009 and 2010 that were ""fully consistent with blood manipulation including EPO use and/or blood transfusions."" EPO, or erythropoietin, boosts the number of red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the muscles. Armstrong isn't the only one challenging the USADA and its case. The International Cycling Union -- whom the Texan has said should be the arbiter in his case -- has opposed the American agency's actions by claiming it has jurisdiction. That position has been recently backed by USA Cycling, the official cycling organization recognized by the U.S. Olympic Committee. Sparks, the U.S. federal judge, acknowledged ""the appearance of conflict on the part of both organizations creates doubt the charges against Armstrong would receive fair consideration in either forum."" But that doesn't mean U.S. courts should intervene, the judge said, adding ""these matters should be resolved internally, by the parties most affected."" ""If these bodies wish to damage the image of their sport through bitter infighting, they will have to do so without the involvement of the United States courts,"" Sparks said. Armstrong has been dogged by allegations of drug abuse in recent years, with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was found guilty of doping in the 2006 Tour de France, resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year. Armstrong came out fighting in May 2011, in the face of fresh allegations made on CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" show by another American, Tyler Hamilton. In the CBS interview, Hamilton -- who retired in 2009 after twice testing positive himself and who, earlier this month, was stripped of his 2004 gold medal by the International Olympic Committee due to doping -- said he first saw Armstrong use EPO in 1999. ""I saw it in his refrigerator,"" Hamilton said. ""I saw him inject it more than one time like we all did, like I did many, many times."" The latest lawsuit filed by Armstrong, and dismissed Monday, claimed that Armstrong hasn't had ""a single positive test"" in the 500 to 600 drug tests he's taken in his over two decades in cycling. In February, Justice Department prosecutors said they closed a criminal investigation after reviewing allegations against Armstrong. They had called witnesses to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles, but they apparently determined they lacked evidence to bring a charge that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong has won two half-distance Ironman events this year, and he is suspended from World Triathlon Corporation competitions. The world championships will be held in October in Hawaii. He was a U.S. triathlon champion as a teenager. Judge blasts Armstrong, tosses lawsuit against anti-doping agency . Tour de France cyclist Remy Di Gregorio arrested amid doping claims .

"London (CNN) -- Aung San Suu Kyi appealed for international support for Myanmar's process of democratic reform Thursday as she gave a historic address to both of Britain's houses of parliament. This is her nation's time of greatest need, Suu Kyi told lawmakers, saying the help of Britain and other nations is needed if Myanmar is not to lose this opportunity to embrace true democracy. Her first trip to Europe after years of house arrest signals the progress toward reform in Myanmar, also known as Burma, over the past year. Suu Kyi is the first figure who is not a head of state, the first woman from abroad and the first person from an Asian nation to address both houses of Parliament in Westminster Hall, House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said as he introduced her. He paid tribute to her as a ""legendary"" figure, who had ""withstood unimaginable suffering"" during the dark days of her long house arrest and political oppression. Suu Kyi meets DJ who made house arrest 'bearable' Addressing an audience that included current and past British prime ministers, Suu Kyi appealed for ""practical help"" from Britain in the days to come, saying international aid can help give her people a better life through education and training, as well as supporting civil and economic progress. The Nobel laureate praised the ""sincere"" efforts of President Thein Sein, a former general, to promote political reform in Myanmar since his military-backed government was elected in 2010. But she also called for international support to ensure Burma does not waver as it follows the path to a full, free and open democracy. ""We have an opportunity to re-establish true democracy in Burma. It is an opportunity for which we have waited many decades. If we do not use this opportunity, if we do not get this right this time round, it may be several decades more before an opportunity arises again,"" she warned. It is also important that a permanent political resolution is found to ethnic conflicts and violence in the north, west and east of the country, she said. Suu Kyi met with British Prime Minister David Cameron at Downing Street ahead of her speech to lawmakers, where they appeared jointly before reporters. Cameron said it was a huge honor to welcome Suu Kyi to Britain, saying she has been ""inspirational in her courage in fighting for democracy"" in Myanmar. Britain is a ""resolute friend"" to Myanmar and will ""remain staunch in its support, just as it has been through the long period of darkness you and your people have lived through,"" he said. The prime minister also backed Suu Kyi's warning against ""reckless optimism"" over political reforms in Myanmar, saying his country will ""remain vigorous in our questioning until those changes have been made irreversible."" At the same time, Cameron defended the decision to invite Thein Sein to Britain, saying the visit signals the United Kingdom's willingness to engage so long as the president remains committed to reform. Britain's sanctions against the regime are only suspended, not lifted entirely, he pointed out. Suu Kyi, who was recently elected to parliament as her National League for Democracy won dozens of seats in by-elections, said she supports the invitation to Myanmar's president because ""we don't want to be shackled by the past."" She said it is by strengthening and empowering the people of Myanmar that a genuinely democratic society can be built. She also called for responsible investment in Myanmar to aid its economic development. The country's future should lie in the hands of all its people, rather than those of the military or a small elite, she said. What Suu Kyi's moment teaches us . Suu Kyi also spoke on the need for a ""clean, efficient civil service"" to help run the nation even as governments change. Cameron said British lawmakers will visit Myanmar in July to scrutinize its progress toward full democracy, and will continue to support the country up to its planned elections in 2015. Britain, which is the biggest aid donor to Myanmar, will also offer aid to support peacemaking in parts of the country torn by ethnic conflict and back responsible investment in the country, Cameron said. Suu Kyi said she was moved by the warmth and kindness with which she had been welcomed to Britain. During a four-day visit to Britain -- her first since 1988 -- Suu Kyi has also visited Oxford, the city where she studied from 1964 to 1967 and lived with her late husband, Michael Aris. She received an honorary degree Wednesday at Oxford University, her alma mater. Suu Kyi was awarded the honorary doctorate in civil law in April 1993, the university said, but until now has been unable to receive it in person. ""'The most important thing for me about Oxford was not what I learnt there in terms of set texts and set books we had to read, but in terms of a respect for the best in human civilization,"" she is quoted as saying at the ceremony. Visiting London on Tuesday, Suu Kyi described how supporters around the world had given her strength while she campaigned against Myanmar's military regime. She also paid a visit to the BBC's Broadcasting House, where she met DJ Dave Lee Travis, whose BBC World Service music show made her confinement ""much more bearable,"" she said. On Saturday, Suu Kyi finally gave her Nobel acceptance speech in Norway, more than two decades after she won the peace prize. She was unable to accept the Nobel when it was awarded in 1991 because she was under house arrest in Myanmar. Her husband and two sons collected it on her behalf. She has also visited Ireland, where a music concert was held in her honor Monday, and Switzerland. The elections that gave her party seats in parliament, albeit in a minority, marked a turning point for the country after decades of oppression by its military rulers. A military coup in September 1988 put Gen. Saw Maung in power, setting off anti-government demonstrations and a crackdown that left hundreds dead. Suu Kyi -- whose husband remained in England when she returned to Myanmar in 1988 -- became a leading activist and co-founder of an opposition group, the National League for Democracy. She was placed under house arrest for the first time the following July on charges of trying to divide the military. She spent much of the next two decades confined to her home by the ruling junta. When her party won the 1990 general election in a landslide vote, the military rulers -- in power since 1962 -- refused to let the National League for Democracy serve, nullifying the results. The military rulers have recently loosened their grip on power, allowing a series of democratic reforms. Her house arrest ended in 2010, and she was able to travel around the country during her party's election campaign this year.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkish police detained dozens of people in a wave of raids targeting suspected members of the ""press and propaganda wing"" of a banned Kurdish separatist group accused of committing acts of terrorism, the semi-official Anatolian Agency reported Tuesday. In a move that alarmed human rights organizations, journalists' associations and press freedom activists, police swept up a number of journalists in the raids. ""Thirty-eight colleagues have been detained,"" announced the Freedom for Journalists Platform, an umbrella group that represents dozens of Turkish journalist associations and unions. ""Detentions, arrests and trials of journalists revive crimes of thought in this country. Turkey follows China as the country where the highest number of journalists are in prison,"" the Platform concluded. Hours after the arrests, hundreds of Turkish journalists took to the streets in Istanbul, conducting a hastily organized protest march down the city's main pedestrian thoroughfare. ""You cannot silence free press,"" read one of the banners carried by demonstrators. ""It basically looks like all pro-Kurdish media... have been targeted in this operation,"" said Emma Sinclair-Webb, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, who spent the morning watching police search the Istanbul office of the pro-Kurdish newspaper Ozgur Gundem. ""And if you crack down on those kinds of dissenting voices, you are really closing the door on healthy criticism and dissent in a democratic society,"" Sinclair-Webb added. As the sun set over Istanbul, police were still searching the downtown offices of Dicle News Agency, another pro-Kurdish media outlet. Six Dicle employees, five reporters and an accountant, had been arrested from their homes on Friday, said Silan Ozhan, a Dicle journalist. Turkey has been battling a Kurdish separatist insurgency led by guerrillas from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) since the 1980s. The conflict has claimed more than 30,000 lives, most of them members of the country's long-oppressed ethnic Kurdish minority. Over the last year, Turkish authorities began rounding up suspects accused of being affiliated with a PKK-linked organization referred to as the Union of Communities in Kurdistan (KCK). In addition to Ozgur Gundem and the Dicle News Agency, police also raided the homes of several main-stream Turkish journalists, including a staff photographer for Agence France Presse. A lawyer for AFP photographer Mustafa Ozer confirmed to CNN that police were searching the journalist's apartment in Istanbul Tuesday. ""They are in the process now,"" said Sibel Tokaoglu, in a brief phone call with CNN. AFP later reported Ozer was detained by police. Meanwhile, an executive from the leftist daily newspaper Bir Gun told CNN that Zeynep Kuray, a staff reporter whose beat includes human rights, was arrested after her home in Istanbul was raided on Tuesday. ""We consider this a witch hunt and a threat to anyone who is in opposition,"" said Ibrahim Aydin, chairman of Bir Gun's executive board. Turkey is among the bottom 40 countries of the world on the press freedom index of Reporters Without Borders, dropping from 102 to 138 since 2008. According to the Turkish Journalists Union, Turkey currently holds at least 63 journalists in prison. That number is likely to grow before the day's end. A growing number of writers and academics have been detained in conjunction with several sprawling investigations into alleged coup plots and terrorism plots. Many of these suspects spend months in detention without charge awaiting trial. Last October, police detained outspoken publisher and freedom of expression activist Ragip Zarakolu as well as Busra Ersanli, a political science professor at Marmara University, as part of an operation against suspects accused of links to Kurdish terrorist groups. Meanwhile, in November, prominent investigative journalists Nedim Sener and Ahmet Sik appeared in court for the first time some nine months after they were arrested in conjunction with an alleged plot to overthrow the Turkish government. Their trial was adjourned until December 26 after defense attorneys argued the presiding judge, Resul Cakir, could not rule impartially since he was a plaintiff in a separate case against one of the defendants. Sener is a recipient of the World Press Freedom Hero award from the International Press Institute for his investigative book about the 2007 assassination of Turkish-Armenian newspaper editor Hrant Dink and alleged involvement of state security officials. Sener predicted he would be targeted as part of a growing government crackdown on voices of dissent in an interview with CNN several months before his arrest. ""The important thing is not that I am in prison,"" Sener said in a subsequent written interview from prison with CNN last month. ""What is important is to find the truth and, regardless of the cost, to write it. I am willing to pay any price for that."" Among the growing chorus of voices reacting in outrage to police raids on Friday was Turkey's Contemporary Journalists Association, which announced in a written statement that its member Kenan Kirkaya had been detained. ""Pressure on the press and freedom of expression is increasing day by day,"" the association wrote. ""These pressures and attacks on journalists and media organizations increase fear and the heavy climate of auto-censorship, while also putting Turkey in a second-class category internationally."" ""This ongoing clampdown is all about using terrorism laws very widely and indiscriminately against people who are not terrorists,"" said Sinclair-Webb of Human Rights Watch. ""You've got bad laws and at the moment a government that shows no sign of slowing down in its support of these types of operations which are basically against ordinary people, civil society and journalists. It's hard to see how this is a legitimate fight against terrorism.""","Police raids target journalists; dozens of people detained .

"(CNN) -- Editor's Note: Christina Blanch is a comics scholar. Cofounder of CAPE, she recently taught a new online course on Gender through Comic Books. Gender issues are strewn throughout the comics industry and have been for decades, from the way this particular branch of pop culture portrays traditional male and female roles, to the treatment of costumed attendees (""cosplayers"") at Comic Cons, to the disproportionately small number of women working in the comic book world. The study of gender is as misunderstood as comic books are; while gender is thought of as a topic for women, comic books are thought of as a boy's club. Of course, neither characterization is accurate; gender is about men and women just as comic books are also for men and women of all ages. Gender as shown in popular media is not reflective of ""real"" life. Think about American media, and the portrayal of women not just in comics but in magazines, films and other mediums. Esthetic standards have changed over the decades from the hourglass ideal to size zero models, from looking naturally physically fit to using medical treatments and/or Photoshop to modify bodies. These media standards can be attributed to the male gaze. The ""male gaze,"" as students of film know, is a term coined in the mid-1970s but timeless in meaning; the tendency of pop art to default to a heterosexual male point of view because, by and large, that's who makes it. This unconscious ""entitlement"" where men are watchers and women are watched (and exploited) creates a sense of entitlement. One that is alienating and excludes anyone who is not a straight white male. Caped crusaders on patrol - meet the real life superheroes . When people think of comic books, they generally think of its predominant genre, superheroes. And it should come as no surprise that many of the superhero comic books have major gender issues. In superhero comics, both men and women are portrayed with near unattainable bodies; men are massively muscular while women can make lingerie models look bashful. When women comment negatively on how comics females are sexualized, the common reply from men is, ""Hey, guys aren't realistically portrayed either, so what's the big deal?"" The difference, of course, is that superhero men in comics look like body builders and athletes while most female superheroes today look more like porn stars. The women athletes of today do not look how superheroes portray them. Why is this? Because the superhero industry caters to an audience of adolescent males. Or, is the ""male gaze"" simply the unintentional norm in comic books? Are superheroines victims of the ""male gaze""? Are feminine superheroes those who embody the traditional male-defined ideas of femininity or those that espouse the ideal of liberated, empowered women? Or are they simply women who dismiss all tropes of ""femininity"" and are simply themselves? Think about Wonder Woman, one of the oldest and best-known female superheroes. She is seen as a feminist icon, featured on the cover of the first issue of Ms. Magazine. Yet she runs around in a bathing suit. And even though her clothes never change, depending on who draws her, she can look family-friendly on a toy you wouldn't hesitate to buy your daughter or like a pole dancer on the cover of a graphic novel. Superman and Spider-Man don't suffer this. It's almost impossible to sexualize Superman, who in the current movie 'lost' his strong man underpants making him less sexualized, and in my opinion completely impossible to sexualize Spider-Man. In fact, Spider-Man is often drawn swinging through the air in flexible poses in a skintight costume and I have never once thought of him as sexualized. There should be room for all kinds of bodies in comic books, not just the ones that are currently culturally celebrated. The problem of the notions of beauty extends far beyond comic books. The male gaze, intentional or not, is present in comic books. Comic books can be powerful, and I argue that the way comics represent women affects the way people view women and how they view themselves. The only way to stop this is to talk about the issue, even if it is uncomfortable. In order for something to change, it has to be acknowledged. My 'Gender through Comic Books' class was one step in that direction. As a comic book fan, for every powerful female superhero like Supergirl or Batgirl, there are so many more that are only eye candy for male readers. The real power of Wonder Woman and other female superheroes is that they rise above the pin-up girl quality to be inspirational to young women. The Opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christina Blanch .","Gender Through Comics was a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) taught in spring 2013. It looked at how to explore gender-related questions through comic books.
Christina Blanch says that gender is about men and women just as much as comic books are for both sexes.
She argues the sexualized media standards can be attributed to the 'male gaze', which is the tendency of pop art to adapt to the heterosexual man's point of view."
"New York (CNN) -- A New York college professor was beheaded and her body dumped outside an apartment building by her son, who later killed himself by stepping in front of a commuter train, police said. The woman has been tentatively identified as Patricia Ward, a 66-year-old assistant professor at Farmingdale State College on Long Island, Detective Lt. John Azzata of the Nassau County Police told reporters Wednesday. She was decapitated shortly before 8 p.m. Tuesday by Derek Ward, 35, with a kitchen knife in the second-floor apartment they shared, Azzata said. Patricia Ward had multiple stab wounds and broken ribs, police said. The son either carried or dragged his mother's body down the stairs, through the lobby and left it on the street, Azzata said. Her head was found about five feet from the body, leaving some neighbors to think the gruesome scene was a Halloween stunt. ""I literally thought it was a prank,"" one resident said, according to CNN affiliate WCBS. ""We saw the body on one side and saw the head on the other side. I thought everything was a prank."" Less than a half hour after his mother's body was found, Derek Ward apparently jumped in front of a Long Island Rail Road train heading east from Penn Station in Manhattan, police said. ""It appears that this is a murder-suicide,"" Azzata said. Patricia Ward was an assistant professor of language arts at the college's Long Island Educational Opportunity Center, which helps high school students prepare for college. ""Patricia Ward was a member of the campus for 28 years,"" Patrick Calabria, the college vice president for institutional advancement and enrollment, said in a statement. ""She was well-known, well-liked and well-respected. The campus is a very sad place today."" Derek Ward, who was unemployed, had a history of psychiatric problems dating back 10 years, his condition exacerbated in the last years after the death of his maternal grandfather, according to Azzata. Police said there were no reported domestic incidents at the Ward home. Derek Ward had a 2003 arrest for criminal mischief and received a fine and probation, Azzata said. In 2006, Derek Ward was arrested for criminal possession of a 9mm Smith & Wesson handgun as well as a drug charge, Azzata said. He received a 45-day sentence and three years' probation. ""It's insane,"" a Farmingdale resident said of the murder-suicide, according to WCBS. ""You never think something like that's going to happen right outside your doorstep."" The motive is under investigation. ""We did not know anything about her family life,"" Calabria told CNN. ""We are all in shock.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Everybody it seems has to wait in line -- at the airport gate, the grocery checkout or the opera recital. The question before the Supreme Court on Wednesday: if it occurs on the job site, should you get paid for it? In one of the most closely watched business cases of the term, the justices appeared split during oral arguments, on whether time spent going through after-shift security screenings for warehouse employees is compensable under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The company, which provides staffing for Amazon.com, justifies the policy for contract employees, to prevent workplace theft. But labor rights groups say the waiting is ""integral and indispensable"" to workers' overall job activities and deserving of overtime payment. The financial stakes are huge, since those hours of overtime for potentially tens of thousands of employees can add up to billions, say both sides. The law in question does not allow workers to be paid for ""pre- or post-liminary"" activities not directly related to core employment duties. Defining those limits has been vexing Congress and the courts for nearly eight decades. Discussions of principal activity . ""What's a principal activity?"" requiring compensation, asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor of the anti-theft measures. ""How is it defined? And so I think, isn't a principal activity work that benefits the employer in some way?"" Integrity Staffing Solutions of Las Vegas provides employment contracting and storage services for a variety of companies, including mega online retailer Amazon.com. Laurie Castro and Jesse Busk are two former Integrity warehouse workers whose responsibilities included taking items form shelves and fulfilling them for delivery. They brought suit, claiming having to regularly wait nearly a half hour at the end of their shifts to go through mandatory security checks. Employees had to remove personal items like keys and wallets, and allow purses, coats, and backpacks to be searched. They also had to go through electronic and metal detector screening, to ensure no company property was being smuggled out, called ""shrinkage"" in the retail world. Integrity argues heightened security is a workplace reality in the post 9/11 world, and that measures designed to keep workers safe -- and preserve the financial bottom line -- are necessary, but not subject to a larger paycheck. The workers say screening here took time because many shifts ended at the same time, causing a mass exodus of employees seeking to leave the warehouse at the same time -- when they had already punched the time clock. The company cited its data showing the waits were minimal most of the time. What role does staffing levels have? During the one-hour arguments, the court debated about what the case really comes down to: money. ""Because there are not enough security checkers and because all the shifts get out at the same time, what could be a five-minute [screening] process turns out to be 25 minutes,"" said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. ""And 20 of those allegedly would not occur if the employer had provided sufficient staffing."" Added Justice Anthony Kennedy. ""Why isn't the long line caused by very few checkers for the benefit of the employer? It's for the benefit of the employer to hire fewer checkers."" Nothing wrong with that, countered Justice Antonin Scalia. The employer ""could move his plant, for example, to be closer to the city where the employees live, right? "" he said. ""It's his fault that it takes them an hour instead of just 10 minutes, and he should move his plant? It's just a matter of cost, right?"" Now about that grapefruit judge . Justice Elena Kagan offered a more personal example. ""There was a [federal] judge ages ago in the Southern District of New York who had his clerks,"" in addition to their primary judicial duties, ""come early in order to cut his grapefruit and otherwise make breakfast for him. And would that be compensable?"" ""Well, setting aside the question of whether the law clerks were covered by the FLSA to begin with,"" Justice Department lawyer Curtis Gannon started to say in his best legalese. ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,"" replied Kagan, smiling, who herself personally hires and employs four law clerks for prestigious one-year terms. The grapefruit judge was left otherwise unidentified. The Obama administration is backing the company in the current dispute, although government lawyers said there may instances where some security searches would be compensable. Questions over how to read old law . Several on the bench suggested the screening activity was not subject to payment, because of its very nature. ""No one's principal activity is going through security screening. The employer doesn't hire somebody: I need somebody to go through employee screening,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts. ""He hires them to do something else."" But the Integrity workers' lawyer Mark Thierman replied, ""Their overall function is to move merchandise without losing it. If they don't -- if they ship to the wrong address, if they drop it in the wrong bin and it can't be received, it's not there the next day they look for that particular item in that particular bin, then they haven't done their job. And if they steal, it's the same thing."" Roberts, tersely: ""Well then, I guess I don't understand what 'principal' means."" The Supreme Court in 1956 concluded, ""Activities performed either before or after the regular work shift, on or off the production line, are compensable under the portal-to-portal [door-to-door] provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act if those activities are an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered workmen are employed."" That case involved factory workers who were ordered paid for the time needed to shower after their assembly line shifts handling toxic chemicals. Subsequent appeals dealt with whether miners had to be paid for the time spent traveling on trams, miles down the shafts to the coal seams; or loggers being transported long distances in buses to remote forest sites. The justices in January said union workers could be paid for the time it takes to ""doff and don"" safety equipment, as part a collective bargaining agreement. Other things like walking from the company parking lot, or attending a company picnic would not typically be compensable, even if they occurred on work property, or were activities sponsored by the employer. The case is Integrity Staffing Solutions v. Busk (13-433). A ruling is expected in the next few months.

"(CNN) -- (CNN) -- Malaysia Airlines flight carrying 239 people from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing disappeared Saturday after air traffic controllers lost contact with the plane, the airline said. ""At the moment we have no idea where this aircraft is right now,"" Malaysia Airlines Vice President of Operations Control Fuad Sharuji said on CNN's ""AC360."" Subang Air Traffic Control lost contact with Flight MH370 at about 2:40 a.m. local time (1:40 p.m. ET Friday), Sharuji said. ""We tried to call this aircraft through various means,"" he said. The airline checked reports that the jet had landed in several places, but determined that none of the reports was true, he said. The Boeing 777-200 departed Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 12:41 a.m. and was expected to land in Beijing at 6:30 a.m., a 2,300-mile (3,700 kilometer) trip. It was carrying 227 passengers, two of them infants, and 12 crew members, the airline said. At the time of its disappearance, the plane was carrying about 7.5 hours of fuel, Sharuji said. The passengers are of 13 nationalities, the airline said. They were from China and Taiwan (154), Malaysia (38), Indonesia (12), Australia (7), France (3), United States (4), New Zealand (2), Ukraine (2), Canada (2), Russia (1), Italy (1), Netherlands (1), Austria (1). One infant from the United States and another from China were included in the tally. By CNN's math, that adds up to 228 passengers, one more than the total cited by the airline. There was no immediate explanation offered. ""Malaysia Airlines is currently working with the authorities who have activated their Search and Rescue team to locate the aircraft,"" the statement said. The public can call +603 7884 1234 for further information. ""We deeply regret that we have lost all contacts"" with the jet, said CEO Ahmad Juahari Yahya in a statement. Efforts to contact the plane in the hours after it disappeared were fruitless. China deployed two rescue ships in the South China Sea to begin a search, state-run broadcaster CCTV said. Family and friends of those missing on the flight gathered at a hotel complex in the Lido district of Beijing. People were being led in through a throng of reporters, with those friends and relatives saying nothing to the media. One woman had her hand to her face. As the door opened, a man inside looked anxious as he talked on a cell phone. The airline's website said the flight was piloted by Cap. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, a Malaysian. He has 18,365 total flying hours and joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981, the website said. The first officer is Fariq Ab.Hamid, 27, a Malaysian with a total of 2,763 flying hours. He joined Malaysia Airlines in 2007. The airline said in a statement that its representatives were contacting the relatives of those aboard. ""Focus of the airline is to work with the emergency responders and authorities and mobilize its full support,"" it said. China's state-run Xinhua News Agency said the flight lost contact and its radar signal as it was flying over the Ho Chi Minh air traffic control area in Vietnam. China's embassy in Malaysia formed an emergency team headed by the Chinese ambassador to deal with the incident, it said. ""We're closely monitoring reports on Malaysia flight MH370,"" Boeing said in a tweet. ""Our thoughts are with everyone on board."" ""It doesn't sound very good,"" retired American Airlines Capt. Jim Tilmon told CNN's ""AC360."" He noted that the route is mostly overland, which means that there would be plenty of antennae, radar and radios to contact the plane. ""I've been trying to come up with every scenario that I could just to explain this away, but I haven't been very successful."" He said the plane is ""about as sophisticated as any commercial airplane could possibly be,"" with an excellent safety record. ""The lack of communications suggests to me that something most unfortunate has happened,"" said Mary Schiavo, former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation, in an interview with CNN International. ""But that, of course, does not mean that there are not many persons that need to be rescued and secured. There's still a very urgent need to find that plane and to render aid."" There is one recent blemish for the Boeing jet: An Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 carrying 291 passengers struck a seawall at San Francisco International Airport in July 2013, killing three people and wounding dozens more. Malaysia Airlines operates in Southeast Asia, East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and on the route between Europe and Australasia. It has 15 of the Boeing 777-200 planes in its fleet, CNN's Richard Quest reported. Part of the company is in the private sector, but the government owns most of it. Malayan Airways Limited began flying in 1937 as an air service between Penang and Singapore. A decade later, it began flying commercially as the national airline. In 1963, when Malaysia was formed, the airline was renamed Malaysian Airlines Limited. Within 20 years, it had grown from a single aircraft operator into a company with 2,400 employees and a fleet operator.","NEW: China deploys two rescue ships to search South China Sea .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli airstrikes pounded targets in Gaza, killing scores of people Wednesday as dozens of militant rockets streaked into Israel. The continued Hamas barrage prompted Israel's Prime Minister to step up the offensive against the militant group. ""The operation will be expanded and will continue until the firing at our communities stops and quiet is restored,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. He did not detail what the expansion would entail but said Israel's military ""is prepared for all possibilities."" President Shimon Peres, whose role is largely ceremonial and is not involved in setting policy, said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Becky Anderson that he believed a ground offensive ""may happen quite soon"" unless Hamas stops firing rockets at Israel. ""We warned them. We asked them to stop it,"" Peres told Anderson. ""We waited one day, two days, three days and they continued, and they spread their fire on more areas in Israel."" While Peres was speaking on his own and his position may not outline an official government policy, Israeli Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz earlier told CNN that a ground operation ""might become necessary."" Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, meanwhile, convened an emergency meeting of his Cabinet to discuss the crisis. ""This war is not against Hamas or another political party but it is against the Palestinian people,"" he told the media afterward. ""What do you call this crime? What is this crime known under international law? To kill entire families, is this collective punishment? ""This is called collective genocide."" A Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zuhri, said Israel's threat to launch a ""stupid"" ground offensive didn't scare anyone, and fighters from Hamas' military wing were ready to face off with Israel's ""coward"" soldiers in Gaza. More deaths in Gaza . The comments came as the death toll rose in Gaza, where the Israel Defense Forces had struck at 550 Hamas targets since launching its offensive Monday. The IDF said the targets included 60 rocket launchers, 31 tunnels and the homes of 11 senior Hamas leaders, which the IDF described as ""command centers."" At least 61 Palestinians have been killed and more than 550 injured in the airstrikes, according to Palestinian medical sources and Health Ministry officials. Among the dead were eight women and 11 children, including an 18-month-old baby and an 80-year-old woman, according to a list provided by Palestinian medical sources and Health Ministry officials. In one airstrike Wednesday, two children and their mother were among five people killed when Israeli forces targeted their house. Some members of the family are believed to have links to Hamas, Palestinian security sources said. A driver for a Gaza news agency was killed Wednesday night when an Israeli missile hit his car, witness told CNN. Three people were wounded, witnesses said. The IDF said it uses phone calls and drops empty shells on roofs -- what it calls ""roof knocking"" -- to warn civilians that airstrikes are imminent. The Israeli Cabinet has authorized the military to call up 40,000 troops if needed. That is 10,000 more than were called up during Israel's offensive into Gaza in November 2012. Only about 1,000 have been mobilized so far. Teens' deaths sparked new violence . Tensions in the region reached a fever pitch after three Israeli teens, including one with dual U.S. citizenship, were kidnapped last month on their way home from school in the West Bank. Their bodies were found last week. Israel blames Hamas, but the group has denied any involvement. ""Hamas said it clearly. ... We don't have information about what had happened,"" Osama Hamdan, a foreign policy spokesman for Hamas, told CNN's Michael Holmes. Only days after the bodies of the Israelis were discovered, a Palestinian teen was abducted, and then found dead, within an hour in Jerusalem. Israel has arrested suspects and says there's ""strong indication"" it was a revenge killing. Hamas political leader Khaled Meshaal blamed Netanyahu for the wave of violence. ""It is as if we started the problem in Gaza,"" he said. ""As if a rocket was fired from Gaza so the Zionist enemy was forced to respond to it. This is not true."" ""I say to the American and European administrations and the United Nations and our Arab neighbors: Were the Palestinian people supposed to break and surrender and die a slow death?"" he said. ""What is left of our lands and our holy sites? What life is left?"" But with rockets flying over his country's cities, Netanyahu seemed in no mood to back down. ""Our military is strong, the home front is steadfast and our people are united,"" he said. The region has many depressing precedents when it comes to violence. Palestinians have revolted twice against Israel's occupation of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Israel conquered and occupied those territories in the June 1967 war. In late 2008 and early 2009, Israel carried out airstrikes and then a ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza that killed hundreds of Palestinians. The November 2012 Israeli offensive sparked a bloody eight-day conflict that ended in a cease-fire. Flare-up in Israeli-Palestinian violence: Why now? New threat . The IDF said 72 rockets rained down on Israel on Wednesday. Some came down in unpopulated areas, while others were intercepted by the country's Iron Dome defense system over Tel Aviv, Ashkelon and Dimona, the IDF said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Dimona is home to a nuclear plant. Israeli media reported the facility was not hit. The U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv said it would close Thursday. Embassy staff had to take shelter Tuesday during a rocket warning, and the facility was already operating with minimal staff. Hamas is believed to have 10,000 rockets of varying ranges, said Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a military spokesman. Israel said some 3.5 million residents live in areas within reach of the rockets. Has the Middle East crisis reached a tipping point? Was teen's death a revenge killing? Palestinian teen burned alive, autopsy shows . Israel resident: What I don't want to happen at my daughter's wedding . CNN's Diana Magnay reported from Jerusalem, Michael Pearson, Steve Almasy and Ed Payne reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Kareem Khadder, Ben Wedeman, Tal Heinrich, Amir Tal, Salma Abdelaziz, Josh Levs, Talal Abu Rahma and Jason Hanna also contributed to this report.","At least 61 Palestinians killed, more than 500 injured in Gaza, Palestinian officials say .

"Washington (CNN) -- As military operations against ISIS continue, there is a less visible, but no less important, diplomatic front, as the United States seeks to recruit new international members and keep Arab nations committed and willing to help strike both within Iraq and Syria. U.S. officials acknowledge this next, nonmilitary phase will be in some ways harder to implement, and even harder to measure. But they say the Arab support without hesitation to military action, traditionally a harder sell, gives them encouragement that the region is committed to putting its various rivalries aside to concentrate on the fight against ISIS. On Tuesday, retired Gen. John Allen, the newly appointed envoy to the global coalition, and his deputy, Brett McGurk, head to the region, where they will press nations to stop the flow of foreign fighters across their borders to join ISIS' ranks and to stem financing, both considered the lifeblood of the military group. The ranks of the coalition have swelled since its formation began in earnest last month, although is unclear how many have signed on. Speaking at the United Nations last week, U.S. President Barack Obama claimed more than 40 nations, though a day earlier Secretary of State John Kerry put the number at more than 50. Now the State Department points to more than 60 coalition partners, including the European Union, the United Nations and the Arab League. John Kerry: The fight against ISIS is 'going to go on' Obama: U.S. misjudged ISIS threat . As of Friday, the coalition had carried out more than 200 strikes in Iraq and 43 in Syria, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters. The United States had done the lion's share of the bombing, although Arab states have contributed significantly. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Jordan all participated in last week's strikes in Syria. France carried out an airstrike in Iraq earlier this month. The American-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq grew by four on Friday -- including Belgium, Britain and Denmark. The U.S. got a major boost when Prime Minster David Cameron of Britain won approval from Parliament, after describing the militants as ""psychopathic terrorists who want to kill us."" British lawmakers approved a limited deployment, but only in Iraq. Syria wasn't even on the table, to avoid the same embarrassing defeat the British Prime Minister experienced last year when Parliament rejected his call to join the United States in strikes against Syria, casting doubt on Britain's reputation as America's closest ally during times of crisis. More than a military effort . Contributors to the effort go well beyond taking part in military operations. Some nations are contributing planes, while others are sending ammunition and weapons to Iraqi and Kurdish forces and special forces to train the Iraqi army. Still others are offering refueling assistance. Canada, Australia, Italy, Germany, Hungary, Estonia, Albania and the Czech Republic all have made contributions to the military effort. But the bulk of the donations is directed toward the campaign against ISIS in Iraq. As in Britain, public opinion in many European nations does not support an air campaign in Syria, out of fear of either starting a wider regional war or helping Syrian President Bashar al-Assad cement his brutal grip on power. U.S. officials say they are not bothered, and suggest the discrepancy is overblown. While support for strikes in Syria is symbolically important, they insist American military might, supported by Arab manpower, is more than sufficient. Moreover, they add, the effort to dislodge ISIS from Iraq, for which they have considerable support from partners, is equally important. Still, the administration does hold out hope that many of its coalition partners will follow Washington's own playbook -- starting with the effort in Iraq, while building public support for wider involvement to include Syria. Cameron seemed to suggest as much by telling Parliament there was more he wanted Britain to contribute to the coalition effort in time. U.S. aims to cut ISIS oil revenue . The effort to cut off funding to terrorist groups is an area where cooperation is much less tangible. Since 9/11 the U.S. has urged its Gulf allies to crack down on private financing to extremists in the region, with mixed results. And since the Syrian conflict began more than three years ago, funding to various Syrian opposition groups has often ended up in the hands of more extremist elements. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Kerry said the threat ISIS poses to the region has been a wake-up call for nations to get serious about stopping the funding, including to Syrian groups. ""State-sponsored support of these groups, I believe, is over -- is ended. There are still individuals within certain countries who have been funneling money to these groups. The theory back in the beginning by many of these people were, well, we're going to get rid of Assad and then we'll focus on these bad apples,"" Kerry said. ""They realized it morphed into something more ominous, more threatening, and so I think people have really pulled back."" Today, ISIS is not just one of the most dangerous organizations, it is also one of the richest. Beyond private donations, the group has emerged as a ruthless terror corporation, earning millions of dollars every day from black market sales of oil in areas it controls. Oil is smuggled out of Syria by ISIS tankers, driven along secret routes in Turkey's southern corridor and sold by middlemen and local tribes. Airstrikes against some of the organization's refineries have sought to limit ISIS' own use of the crude, but an important new phase of the U.S. coalition effort is focused on getting neighboring countries to clamp down on black markets and networks handling the sale of oil, which is fueling its reign of terror. Looking for new coalition partners . Turkey is central to all these efforts. Ankara committed last week to joining the anti-ISIS coalition, but it has provided no details on what it will do. Turkey stayed on the sidelines while ISIS held 49 Turkish hostages, but those hostages were freed September 20. U.S. officials say they expect Turkey to play a major role going forward in many aspects of the campaign, but its role remains far from clear. Russia, too, has been vague about what role it could play. Last week, Moscow said it would join in the fight against ISIS, but did not mention the coalition and has opposed the strikes in Syria, saying the U.S. should have sought permission from al-Assad. One often overlooked, but critical, aspect of the fight against ISIS is the communications battle. The U.S. is looking for Arab states to undertake a major effort to, in the Kerry's words, ""reclaim Islam by Muslims, by those to whom it belongs."" The U.S. is urging countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt to get their clerics to speak out against the group and Arab networks like Al Jazeera and Al-Arabiya to counter ISIS' sophisticated media machine. The success or failure of that communications effort could ultimately have repercussions for the resolve of a coalition that depends so heavily on buy-in from Arab states. ""I'm absolutely convinced the coalition is on board. There's no question about it. And they proved that in the air, in their willingness to join -- historically, to many people's amazement, they all came together,"" Kerry told Amanpour. ""There's a sense of purpose now in this focus.""","Top American generals and diplomats are headed for Arab countries .

"Hudson, New Hampshire (CNN) -- When Scott Brown was fighting to keep his Senate seat in Massachusetts two years ago, he was forced to keep his distance from a former colleague who also happened to be his party's top gun at the time, Mitt Romney. Now, Brown is battling for the Senate again. This time, his arms are wide open for Romney. The 2012 Republican presidential nominee campaigned for Brown on Wednesday for the second time this year, returning to a venue in Hudson where Romney held his own event more than two years ago. ""This is the guy who ought to be the next United States senator, and you're going to make him the next United States senator,"" Romney told the audience Wednesday. So, why is more Brown more comfortable pairing up with Romney this time around? What changed? The state. The election. The big players involved. In 2012, Brown was trying to fend off an aggressive challenge by a progressive favorite in a reliably blue state. He cast himself as an independent and was more likely to tout his work with President Obama than his relationship with Romney. When he was asked about Romney, he would sometimes give a short answer, then change the subject. ""Bringing in a Republican like Romney to talk about you is not what you want to do when you're running as a perceived independent in Massachusetts,"" said Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. Now Brown is mounting his own challenge, trying to take down incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in neighboring New Hampshire, a more politically mixed state. Romney, who's perhaps more popular than ever at the moment, is practically an adopted son of New Hampshire. He has a vacation home here and won the 2012 GOP primary by a wide margin. And campaigning in a state where he's not ""carrying the baggage"" as a former governor -- as is the case in Massachusetts -- can help make things less complicated, Smith said. So, strategically, it's common sense that Brown would welcome Romney in this state, in this year. Jim Merrill, a GOP strategist who led Romney's New Hampshire campaign, said ""it's natural"" for the two men to want to ""link arms"" this cycle. Romney's ""campaigned here, he's fought hard,"" Merrill said. ""I think since the 2012 election, what we've seen is a real appreciation among the electorate on issues Mitt campaigned on."" With no clear potential frontrunner in the 2016 GOP presidential race, calls have surged for Romney to make a third White House bid. He insists he's not running, but he hasn't entirely ruled it out. His wife, Ann Romney, told the Washington Post Tuesday that it's a ""no"" for her husband ""at this moment."" On stage Wednesday, Brown echoed sentiments that are fueling renewed interest in Romney. ""He was right on Russia. He was right on Obamacare. He was right on the economy,"" Brown said. ""I can tell you, governor, if you were in the White House, the country and the world would seem a whole heck of a lot different. "" For Brown and Romney, their political past go back more than a decade. When Brown was running for the state Senate in Massachusetts in 2004, Romney, who was governor at the time, helped Brown raise big money. And during Brown's 2010 Senate race, Romney showed support. The two northeast Republicans are also known to share advisers. But is it awkward for them to pair up now after keeping their distance two years ago? ""I don't think there would be any awkwardness -- they're pros,"" said Neil Levesque, the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics and Political Library at Saint Anselm College. ""They know how this all works,"" he continued. ""They're going to do what they can to get as many votes as possible."" And with the Senate race being neck and neck in the final sprint to Election Day, turnout will be a big factor. ""Romney is popular now, and he's going to help Brown get on that front page tomorrow,"" Levesque said. That might help deflect attention from Shaheen's big-name visitors. Former President Bill Clinton headlines a dinner here Thursday night, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is slated to be in the state on November 2. At the end of the day, it's the candidates themselves who become the closers of their own race, not their visitors. But having top-of-the-list supporters in town certainly doesn't hurt. ""You're looking for these pivotal points that might help you get half a percentage here, half a percentage there,"" Levesque said.","Mitt Romney and Scott Brown kept their distance in 2012 .
The two are now campaigning together as Brown seeks a new Senate seat .
Experts say it's all about political strategy ."
