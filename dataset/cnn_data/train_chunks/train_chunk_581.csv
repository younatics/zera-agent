The sun’s fiery surface is captured in incredible detail from 93million miles away. The stunning shot was taken by  71-year-old Dave Tyler, a photographer and amateur astronomer. Streaks of superheated plasma rising across the sun's surface - as seen from Wycombe . The back garden astronomer: The dome in David Tyler's garden, containing the equipment used to take pictures of the sun . Like many of us Mr Tyler has the odd pot . plant and a shed in his back garden. But, where we might have the . compost heap or a vegetable patch, he has installed a 5-inch refracting . telescope, equipped with a hydrogen-alpha solar filter. The filter allows him to safely observe and photograph the high-energy activity on our nearest star.Mr Tyler said: ‘When you look at the Sun you are looking at a star in high-magnification and detail – it is fascinating. It is about understanding our existence and our place in the solar system.’ Mr Tyler, from High Wycombe, in Buckinghamshire, pieced together thousands of frames using computer software to create the picture.

They are formed by short-lived . magnetic loops hundreds of thousands of miles long that hold dense gas . suspended thousands of miles above the 6,000C surface of the Sun. Mr Tyler photographed the Sun from February 15 to 19, but was unable to follow it any further because of cloudy weather. The retired engineer, who lives with . wife Wendy, a teacher, and son  Thomas, 18, has been a keen  astronomer . for the last 40 years. He built his first telescope when  he was 29 and has been an  enthusiast ever since. After taking the pictures, Mr Tyler pieced the images together like a jigsaw puzzle using computer software.

A violent mother-of-two who chewed off a love rival's ear in a jealous attack has been jailed for three-and-a-half years. Disabled Danielle Slater, 33, sat on victim Tammy Baldwin and pulled out 'enormous clumps' of her hair just weeks after writing on Facebook that she would love to see her 'bleeding on the floor'. Lewes Crown Court in East Sussex heard the victim is now permanently scarred with half her lobe missing. Evil: Danielle Slater, of Newhaven, East Sussex, bit off the ear of love rival Tammy Baldwin and pulled out enormous clumps of her hair. She has been jailed for three-and-a-half years . She also had to undergo HIV and hepatitis B tests when doctors feared she could have contracted the illnesses after being bitten. The court was told Slater, known as Danni, chewed through the lobe and cartilage in the attack which took place in Newhaven, East Sussex, on May 5 last year. Jennifer Gray, prosecuting, said the pair had originally been 'close friends'. But they fell out after Slater and her then partner's relationship broke down following reports he had been having an affair with chip shop worker Tammy in 2011. In April last year violent Slater wrote on her Facebook page: 'What I want is you bleeding on the floor while I PMSL (p*** myself laughing).' The pair bumped into each other in a local pub in Newhaven, where they both live, while out separately with friends and a scuffle began. When numerous members of the public tried to help Tammy, a friend of housekeeper Slater forced them away. Miss Gray told the court a taxi driver, named only as Mr Gandhi, saw what happened. She said: 'He saw the defendant punch her (Tammy) to the floor. 'She sat on her. She could not move at all. 'Miss Baldwin said the pressure of Miss Slater sitting on her meant she could not move at all. She wet herself. 'She said she felt her teeth upon her earring. 'She pulled out several enormous clumps of hair. 'There were kicks to the stomach and her head was bashed against a car.' Crime scene: The attack happened in the The Ship Hotel in Newhaven . Miss Gray said Tammy had been left with a 'permanent disfiguration' after she got an infection and reconstructive surgery proved unsuitable. She said: 'She does not like to go out and is very conscious. She cannot wear earrings or her hair up.' Edmund Fish, defending, said Slater had been provoked after learning her former friend had been with her partner of 18 years. He said: 'She felt an enormous sense of betrayal.' Sentencing Slater to three and a half years in jail Judge Michael Lawson said the message was 'chilling'. He condemned the mum, who admitted grevious bodily harm, for using her teeth as a weapon. Speaking after the hearing Tammy, who did not attend court, said the situation was still too raw. 'I don't want to gloat,' she added.","Danielle Slater, 33, from Newhaven, East Sussex, ripped out hair of friend Tammy Baldwin .

Telecom giant Orange still offers the worst customer services for broadband users in Britain, according to the latest quarterly report from industry regulator Ofcom. The company attracted more complaints over its broadband service than any of its rivals between October and December last year. Orange first replaced TalkTalk as having the most complaints when previous figures were released at the end of the year. 'Getting worse': Regulator Ofcom claimed Orange was the worst for complaints about broadband service and that customer anger is increasing . Coming second: TalkTalk was overtaken as the 'most complained about' service but is still second on Ofcom's table .

Dating can be a nightmare for many, so dating websites for people with sexually transmitted infections (STIs), can save embarrassment and rejection. The most difficult thing about Herpes and HIV is that it carries a social stigma, says dating website UK Positive Singles. When it comes to dating, you may have fewer choices because of your condition. Also, if you are dating with other singles without an STI, you are most likely to be rejected by them after telling the truth. Matchmaker: STI dating website users can enter their age and sexual preference. Then they can search for people with a specific sexually transmitted infection . UK Positive Singles has 30,000 members in the UK, accumulating 100,000 new members last year worldwide - and DatePositive, which has more than 6,000 profiles, allow users to search for people with almost any sexually transmitted infection. Other websites such as H-YPE or H-Date, are aimed specifically at people with the most common types of incurable STIs, such as herpes and HPV, which causes genital warts. ‘If you have just been told you have herpes or HPV and you feel like your life is over, well, we are here to prove to you that it's not. In fact, it's a whole new start,’ it says on H-YPE. Once logged on to the websites, users enter age and sexual preference. Then they can search for people with a specific sexually transmitted infection. The rise in these dating sites coincides with increasing rates of STIs. In the UK there was a two per cent rise in new cases from 2010-2011, according to the Health Protection Agency's latest statistics. More than 100,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with genital herpes or HPV every year. Meanwhile, there are about 20 million new STI cases each year in the US, and about 110 million in total, says the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Drug resistant strains: There are more than 100 types of HPV, (human papilloma virus) of which more than 30 affect the genital area . ‘[Some people] feel like freaks, like lepers,’ Max, 44, who set up dating site H-YPE., told BBC News. Kate, 36, from Manchester, who has herpes, thinks the stigma attached to STIs also means ‘people assume you've slept around’. In reality, many people contract STIs from long-term partners - and some people only discover they've contracted an infection at the same time they find out their partner has been unfaithful. Kate recalls how a promising relationship was ruined by the disclosure of her herpes. ‘It came up in conversation and I was petrified. It broke us. He didn't want to take any chances.’ On most of these dating websites, users can write honestly about their feelings and no longer have to be secretive about their condition. Heartbreaker: Promising relationships can be ruined by the disclosure of a sexually transmitted infection . There’s also a sense of community and support, and often there’s online counsellors and blogs from people sharing their experiences . But some people are concerned about the message STI dating websites could send. ‘These sites can make people think 'now I am a leper I need to find a leper to date',’ says HVA (Herpes Viruses Association) director Marian Nicholson. ‘People shouldn't narrow their pool of potential partners.’ ‘Just because you have the same STI as someone else, it doesn't mean they're the same as you in other respects,’ says Dr Pakianathan. ‘One STI doesn't preclude the presence of others.’ For HIV sufferers, there's the risk of a ‘super infection’ from a drug-resistant strain carried by someone else, he says. And there are more 100 strains of HPV, of which more than 30 affect the genital area. More than 15,000 under-16s were diagnosed with diseases including gonorrhoea, chlamydia and genital herpes in the last three years.

It is the world's most remote group of islands, 6,173 miles from Britain, and has more birds and penguins than human residents. But there is one thing missing from the lives of the Tristan da Cunha islanders - it cannot find a vicar to give them spiritual guidance. The volcanic British territory in the South Atlantic has been without a parish priest since Father Chris Brown left in 2010. Rugged: The island of Tristan Da Cunha which is still looking for a parish priest for the 262 inhabitants almost three years after the last vicar left . Advert: The vacant position for a parish priest is displayed on the Tristan Da Cunha website with skills the ideal candidate should have . The post has been advertised several times, according to the Church Times, but so far no one has agreed to make their home 1,750 miles from the nearest landmass of Africa. Now the residents, who number 262, could have a woman as their next priest as the Cape Town diocese steps up its attempts to fill the vacancy. Lorna Lavarello-Smith,  who was born on the . island, is training in Peterborough to be a priest and is helping the search. She is and is due to be ordained this summer before serving a curacy in Northamptonshire. Penguin population: Northern Rockhoppers on the nearby Gough Island . Ms Lavarello-Smith, the descendant of Italian Gaetano Lavarello, who was shipwrecked on the island in 1892, hopes to return to live on Tristan da Cunha 'one day', the Independent on Sunday reported, . She described the island as a 'very special' place in which to serve, adding: 'If you are looking for a ministry . where you want to be close to God and close to nature, then Tristan da .

'There is something about being in . the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean, reliant on a community of people . with whom you live. You hear the sound of God's voice much more . clearly.' According to Tristan da Cunha's website, the new vicar of St Mary's will ideally play a musical instrument and teach at the school. The advert said: 'Applicants . should be active and energetic. A keen interest in church . music and the ability to play an instrument would be an asset.' Tristan da Cunha is a close-knit . community with just seven surnames among its inhabitants, but some of . its priests have found life depressing and lonely there. The Reverend Edwin H Dodgson, younger brother of writer Lewis Carroll, grew so unhappy at the 'unnatural state of isolation' he told of his despair four years after arriving as a teacher and missionary in 1880. He wrote: 'It has been my daily prayer that God would open up some way for us all to leave ...There is not the slightest reason for this island . to be inhabited at all.' There was a 13-year time lapse between a vicar's appointment when the Rev Graham Barrow quit the island in 1909. The archipelago, first sighted in 1506, consists of the main island of Tristan da Cunha itself, which measures about seven miles across. Settlers arrived in 1810. It has an area of 37.8 sq miles, along with the uninhabited Nightingale Islands and the wildlife reserves of Inaccessible Island and Gough Island. There is no airport and only nine ships are scheduled to visit from Cape Town, the nearest major port. Television arrived only in 2001, but there are only two terrestrial channels. During World War Two, It  was used as a listening post to monitor German ships while the entire population was evacuated from 1961-63 over a threatened volcano eruption.","Volcanic British territory has been without a priest for three years .

The dark green stones were purchased by meteorite dealer Stefan Ralew, who sent samples of NWA 7325 to researcher Anthony Irving of the University of Washington, a specialist in meteorites of planetary origin. Irving found that the fragments contained surprisingly little iron but considerable amounts of magnesium, aluminum, and calcium silicates. This matches with observations from Nasa's Messenger spacecraft of the surface crust of Mercury. However, the rock did have higher than expected amounts of calcium silicates, leading Irving to speculate the fragments of NWA 7325 could have come from a deeper part of Mercury’s crust, excavated by a powerful impact event and launched into space, eventually finding their way to Earth. A recent high resolution image of the surface of Mercury: Researchers now believe they may have found the first confirmed meteorite from the planet on Earth . 'It might be a sample from Mercury, or it might be a sample from a body smaller than Mercury but [which] is like Mercury,' said Irving, who unveiled the new findings this month at the 44th annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas. Irving thinks that the meteorite was created and eventually ejected from a planet or other body that had flowing magma on its surface at some point in its history. Evidence suggests that the rock could have been formed as 'scum' on the top of the magma, Irving said.","The unusual green rock, called NWA 7325, .

The dazzling moons and rings of Saturn have long been one of the most mesmerising spectacles in the solar system. But now NASA scientists believe they may also hold the key to understanding the origins of our universe. New research based on data gathered from the Cassini spacecraft, which is orbiting Saturn, suggests these bodies date back more than 4 billion years. Scroll down for video . The effects of the small moon Prometheus loom large on two of Saturn's rings in this image taken a short time before Saturn's August 2009 equinox . They are from around the time that the planetary bodies in our neighborhood began to form out of the protoplanetary nebula, the cloud of material still orbiting the sun after its ignition as a star. Writing in the Astrophysical Journal, Gianrico Filacchione, a Cassini participating scientist at Italy's National Institute for Astrophysics, Rome, said: 'Studying the Saturnian system helps us understand the chemical and physical evolution of our entire solar system. 'We know now that understanding this evolution requires not just studying a single moon or ring, but piecing together the relationships intertwining these bodies.' Data collected from Cassini's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer (VIMS) have revealed how water ice and also colours -- which are the signs of non-water and organic materials --are distributed throughout the Saturnian system. The spectrometer’s data in the visible part of the light spectrum show that colouring on the rings and moons generally is only skin-deep. Using its infrared range, VIMS also detected abundant water ice – too much to have been deposited by comets or other recent means. The authors deduce that the water ices must have formed around the time of the birth of the solar system, because Saturn orbits the sun beyond the so-called 'snow line.' The Cassini spacecraft observes three of Saturn's moons set against the darkened night side of the planet . Out beyond the snow line, in the outer solar system where Saturn resides, the environment is conducive to preserving water ice, like a deep freezer. Inside the solar system's 'snow line,' the environment is much closer to the sun's warm glow, and ices and other volatiles dissipate more easily. The coloured patina on the ring particles and moons roughly corresponds to their location in the Saturn system. For Saturn's inner ring particles and moons, water-ice spray from the geyser moon Enceladus has a whitewashing effect. Farther out, the scientists found that the surfaces of Saturn's moons generally were redder the farther they orbited from Saturn. Phoebe, one of Saturn's outer moons and an object thought to originate in the far-off Kuiper Belt, seems to be shedding reddish dust that eventually rouges the surface of nearby moons, such as Hyperion and Iapetus. These two global images of Iapetus show the extreme brightness dichotomy on the surface of this peculiar Saturnian moon . A rain of meteoroids from outside the system appears to have turned some parts of the main ring system – notably the part of the main rings known as the B ring -- a subtle reddish hue. Scientists think the reddish colour could be oxidized iron -- rust -- or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which could be progenitors of more complex organic molecules. One of the big surprises from this research was the similar reddish colouring of the potato-shaped moon Prometheus and nearby ring particles. Other moons in the area were more whitish. 'The similar reddish tint suggests that Prometheus is constructed from material in Saturn's rings,' said co-author Bonnie Buratti, a VIMS team member based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. 'Scientists had been wondering whether ring particles could have stuck together to form moons -- since the dominant theory was that the rings basically came from satellites being broken up. The colouring gives us some solid proof that it can work the other way around, too.' 'Observing the rings and moons with Cassini gives us an amazing bird's-eye view of the intricate processes at work in the Saturn system, and perhaps in the evolution of planetary systems as well,' said Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist, based at JPL. 'What an object looks like and how it evolves depends a lot on location, location, location.'","Bodies date back to time when our planetary neighbourhood was formed .

Clive Palmer has ordered more than 100 mechanical dinosaurs from China, to install in his Palmer Coolum Resort. He already has a life sized T-Rex, with a 20-metre long and 3.5-metre high Deinosuchus, a crocodile-like creature, due to arrive by the end of next month. The 20-metre long, 3.5-metre high Deinosuchus undergoing final construction in China. It will be one of 165 robotic dinosaurs shipped to the Australian Palmer Coolum resort. A life sized T-Rex has already been installed at the resort, where the Australian PGA is set to held later this year. The Deinosuchus, whose name . translates as ‘terrible crocodile’, was one of the biggest prehistoric . crocodiles that ever lived. Apart from its sheer size, the Deinosuchus . is very similar to today’s crocodiles, illustrating how little evolution . has taken place in the species over millions of years. Today’s saltwater crocodiles possess the strongest bite of any living animal with a maximum force of over 16,000 newtons. The bite force of the fearsome Deinosuchus is believed to have exceeded 18,000 newtons. The animals, which will be displayed in the woodlands around the resort, will sway their tails, heave their chests and blink. 'At . @PalmerCoolum resort we'll have the world's biggest dinosaur exhibit, . with 165 animatronic dinosaurs,' the mining magnate tweeted. Mr Palmer made an application to the . Sunshine Coast Council last year to turn part of the Coolum resort's . golf course into a dinosaur park. The first dinosaur to be installed, called Jeff, widely seen as a dig at Deputy Premier Jeff Seeney, oversaw  the 2012 PGA Championship at Coolum. Mr .

Internet giant Google is facing a major probe by the privacy watchdog over allegations it is abusing users’ personal data. The search firm could face fines of hundreds of thousands of pounds if it is found guilty of breaching data protection rules. Britain’s Information Commissioner was one of six European data protection regulators who launched investigations into the search company yesterday. Google is facing legal action across Europe as regulators try and force the company to overhaul practices they say let it create a data goldmine at the expense of unwitting users . There are concerns Google’s privacy . policy is creating a data goldmine at the expense of unwitting users - . and poses a ‘high risk’ to privacy. The firm is accused of collecting . excessive amounts of information on users’ internet activities, keeping . it for too long and not giving users enough control over how it is used. The current row revolves around Google's decision to pool of anonymous user data across Google services. For Google, this is a big advantage when selling online ads. Google and other large internet . groups like Facebook provide free services to consumers and earn money . from selling ads that they say are more closely targeted than . traditional TV or radio campaign . Privacy campaigners said the firm was . guilty of ignoring consumers’ rights. But a spokesman for the company . insisted it was in full compliance with European law. Nick Pickles, director of privacy . group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘Google has repeatedly put profit ahead . of user privacy and the way that the company ignored concerns from . regulators around the world when it changed its privacy policy showed . just how little regard it has for the law. ‘Just because Google is a big business . does not put it above the law. The company has ignored the authorities . and refused to make any meaningful changes to how it collects and uses . people’s data. ‘Consumers are increasingly concerned . about how their data is being used and it is essential that those . breaking the law are properly punished. It is essential regulators find a . sanction that is not just a slap on the wrists and will make Google’s . think twice before it ignores consumer rights again.’ Google launched a new combined privacy . policy for all its services in March 2012. It allowed the company to . combine data on individual users from across its services, which include . video-sharing site YouTube, Gmail and social network Google+. Users . have no right to opt out. The move prompted a joint privacy . investigation commissioned by 29 European agencies, including the . Information Commissioner in the UK. Successful legal action would hurt Google's image and could block its ability to collect such data until it addresses the regulators' concerns. Carried out by France’s watchdog, . CNIL, it concluded in October that the policy posed a ‘high risk’ to the . privacy of individuals. It found users were not given enough . information on what data was being collected and used for. Even looking . at particular websites was automatically recorded and kept for 18 . months. The company also refused to say how . long data would be held for. Google was given until February to suggest . changes, but the firm failed to comply. It was accused of providing . ‘incomplete or approximate’ answers to questions. Yesterday national investigations were launched in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Holland and Italy. It is only the latest privacy scandal . to hit the company, which is being investigated by the Information . Commissioner over the collection of huge amounts of data from open Wi-Fi . networks. A Google data center in Douglas Country, Georgia, where the firm holds vast amounts of data on its user's behavior . Google’s Streetview cars harvested . Street View cars harvested vast swathes of personal information as they . took pictures of the country’s streets. It claimed the collection was a . ‘simply mistake’ but an investigation by US regulators found that a . company software engineer explicitly designed the Street View programmes . to collect the data and warned his bosses repeatedly about privacy . implications. A spokesman for the Information . Commissioner’s Office said: ‘The ICO has launched an investigation into . whether Google’s revised March 2012 privacy policy is compliant with the . Data Protection Act. ‘The action follows an initial . investigation by the French data protection authority CNIL, on behalf of . the Article 29 group of which the ICO is a member. Several data . protection authorities across Europe are now considering whether the . policy is compliant with their own national legislation.’ ‘As this is an ongoing investigation it would not be appropriate to comment further.’ A Google spokesman said: ‘Our privacy policy respects European law and allows us to create simpler, more effective services. ‘We have engaged fully with the DPAs . (Data Protection Authorities) involved throughout this process, and . we’ll continue to do so going forward.’ Google's battle has been running since 2011 - here are the key moments: . March 30, 2011: The Federal Trade Commission announces a settlement with Google. The search and advertising company agrees to adopt a comprehensive privacy program to settle federal charges that it deceived users and violated its own privacy policy when it launched a social-networking service called Buzz. Jan. 24, 2012: Google announces a plan to link user data across its email, video, social-networking and other services. The company says the move will simplify its privacy policy, improve the user experience and help advertisers find customers more easily, especially on mobile devices. Critics raise privacy concerns. The plan takes effect March 1. Feb. 28: France's regulator says a preliminary analysis finds that Google's new policy appears to violate European data-protection rules. April 13: The Federal Communications Commission fines Google $25,000, saying the online search leader ""deliberately impeded and delayed"" an investigation into how it collected data while taking photos for its Street View mapping feature. April 26: Google disputes the FCC's characterization of that probe and says the FCC was the party that took its time. Google argues that the 17-month inquiry would have gone much more quickly if the FCC hadn't dawdled so much. Google says it accepted the fine to close the case. Aug. 9: The FTC announces that Google has agreed to pay a $22.5 million fine to settle allegations that it broke a privacy promise by secretly tracking the online activities of millions of people who use Apple's Safari web browser. Oct. 16: European regulators ask Google to clarify its new privacy policy and make it easier for users to opt out. March 12, 2013: Google says it has agreed to a $7 million fine to settle a probe over Wi-Fi data collection connected to its canvassing for street-level photo. The settlement covers 38 states and the District of Columbia. April 2: Led by the French, organizations in Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and Italy agree on legal action against Google over the 2012 changes to its privacy policy.","Possibility of imposing fines or restrictions on operations across the entire 27-country European Union .

But the 27-year-old was outraged when a female pharmacist then smacked the three-year-old and told her off. Angela Cropley said her daughter Lora froze in shock when she was smacked by the Boots shop assistant . Boots bosses have apologised after Ms Cropley complained about the incident at the store in Spalding, Lincolnshire . A woman named Michelle smacked the three-year-old and told her she was 'being naughty' for breaking the bottle of Dettol . Miss Cropley was asking the woman, . aged in her 50s, for advice when Lora began playing with some bath toys . and knocked over a bottle of disinfectant. Embarrassed, the mother-of-two quickly . apologised and offered to pay for any damage. But, as she bent down to . pick up the bottle from the floor, the pharmacist smacked Lora on her . bottom and said she was a ‘naughty girl’. When Miss Cropley complained to the store in Spalding, Lincolnshire, the  manager told her: ‘It was only a tap.’ Yesterday she said: ‘Nobody has the . right to punish my own daughter – just me and her dad, but we would not . do it like that. If she didn’t have clothes on, she would have had a . mark, it was enough to shove her forward. I would not even let my . grandmother do it. ‘If I went in there and “tapped” her, I’d get arrested. She can call it what she likes, she put her hand on my daughter.’ Miss Cropley had gone to the store to . buy soya milk for her son Toby, eight months, who was with her in a . pushchair. Only that morning, she had found out he was lactose . intolerant and so was asking the pharmacist for advice on which brand to . buy. ‘We went over to where they were,’ she . said. ‘We were talking about which one to get and Lora got a bit bored . and started playing with bath toys on the shelf and knocked a few things . off. ‘There was a Dettol sterilising spray . and she’d broken one of the lids.

She said: ‘The woman said she had not . done anything wrong.’ Becoming frustrated at the response, she went to . police, who said they could not take the matter further.

She said: ‘It said sorry but . the only explanation was that the staff member’s actions were a gesture . of empathy. ‘I found it a bit insulting. I relied on Boots.

Mark Hynes says it took bungling officers over a fortnight to check CCTV footage, which proved they had the wrong man . A disabled man with a severe limp was wrongly arrested and jailed for over two weeks after he was accused of robbing a betting shop - and running off. Mark Hynes - who also wears a catheter - told police his disability made it impossible to clamber onto the counter and make a quick getaway. But he says it took bungling officers over a fortnight to check CCTV footage, which proved they had the wrong man. In that time, Mr Hynes, 37, had been hauled before a court and even remanded in custody for two and a half weeks at HMP Winchester. He was accused of threatening staff with a knife at Corals in Leigh Park, Havant, Hampshire. He is now demanding an apology and compensation from the police, saying people living near his Leigh Park home have 'turned on him'. Officers have since arrested another suspect. Mr Hynes was at home when officers came round to search his premises following the robbery. He was wrongly identified as the culprit and - after appearing at Portsmouth Magistrates' Court - was sent to prison while officers investigated further. He said prison exacerbated his ill health and has caused problems with his catheter. He added: 'It's affected my life. Everyone in Leigh Park thinks I'm an armed robber.

It was then that it became clear Mr Hynes was not a suspect. He added: 'My arrest came out of the blue - it was the last thing I expected. 'I've lost two and a half weeks of my life because of this.' A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said at the time of Mr Hynes arrest: 'A man entered the premises and showed a knife to a member of staff before asking him to put money in a bag.

A woman had to be rescued from her burning home after a pair of hair straighteners were left switched on her wooden floor and started a blaze. The woman collapsed in the fire this morning, after the hair straighteners had been left turned on and were lying on a wooden laminated floor. She had to be rescued by firefighters, who discovered her on the first floor landing in the north London property. Charred: The straighteners were left switched on, and are believed to have cause the potentially fatal blaze . Firefighters took a picture of the twisted, charred remains of the straighteners, after they overheated and caught fire. The electrical hair straightening appliances are extremely popular across the world, and can reach temperatures of 200C. But they are increasingly blamed for burn marks and injuries by customers who accidentally touch the red-hot plates against their skin. They can also burn through materials when left on. Finchley fire station Watch Manager Tony Keating said: 'We believe the fire was started by hair straighteners being left on. 'Fortunately the woman was woken by a smoke alarm and dialled 999. When crews arrived they found her unconscious and not breathing on the first floor landing. 'She was brought out of the property and firefighters started resuscitation before ambulance crews arrived. The fire brigade were called to Morton Way, in Southgate, after a blaze began when the hair straighteners were left on (general view) 'You should never leave hair straighteners switched on and they should always be used cautiously and with care. 'The incident also highlights the importance of a working smoke alarm which sounded and this helped save her life.' Two fire engines from Finchley fire station with 14 firefighters and officers tackled the blaze on Morton Way, Southgate, north London which badly damaged the loft conversion. The fire started at 5am and was put out at 6am today. The woman was treated by the London Ambulance service and taken to hospital. It is the second time in a week that hot hair straighteners have been linked to the cause of a fire with potentially fatal consequences. Two young boys were rescued from a bedroom in a house in Pinner, north London, last Thursday by firefighters after a fire was started by hair straighteners. The children, aged 4 and 5, were taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation by the London Ambulance Service and a woman escaped from the house before the fire crew arrived. Two fire engines from Northolt with 14 firefighters tackled the blaze. It’s thought the woman had been using her hair straighteners and accidentally left them switched on when she answered the phone and then went downstairs to open the door for a takeaway pizza. It's believed she went down to collect the food, leaving the hot straighteners on a pile of clothes, which then caught fire. In December last year, High street stores stopped selling children’s hair straighteners after a dramatic increase in burns injuries. The brightly coloured straighteners – decorated with pictures of princesses, fairies and cartoon characters – are high on Christmas lists. But doctors became concerned by the increasing number of girls suffering burns and scars from the electrical appliances, which are being marketed with images more suitable for a toy. The stores – Argos, Tesco and Asda – acted after worrying figures from the National Burns Injuries Database were released. The statistics revealed the number of children aged under 15 admitted to serious burns units in England and Wales with injuries from adult appliances increased from 162 in 2009 to 252 in 2011. But these figures are merely the ‘tip of the iceberg’ and could be at least ten times higher, according to University Hospital South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, which collated the figures.","Straighteners were left turned on and lying on a laminated wooden floor .

A former Goldman Sachs trader pleaded guilty to wire fraud on Wednesday, admitting that he caused his company to lose $118 million in 2007 when he put $8 billion at risk. Matthew Marshall Taylor, 34, said he took the position on a futures contract traded electronically through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in December 2007 to enhance his reputation and boost his earnings. That year he made $150,000 in salary and $1.6 million in bonuses while working at Goldman Sachs in lower Manhattan. Surrendered: Matthew Marshall Taylor, 34, a former Goldman Sachs trader leaves Federal Court after surrendering in connection with a federal securities fraud probe in New York . According to court papers filed in Manhattan, Taylor entered fictitious information in trading account records and lied to company representatives to cover up the fact that he had put 10 times more money at risk in the trade than he was allowed. He claimed that the $8 billion at risk was actually only $65 million, the papers said. U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III said he was miffed that the government in a plea deal was holding Taylor responsible for no more than $2.5 million in losses. The amount of money lost in financial crimes usually plays a significant role in the length of any prison sentence. Beginning: Taylor was working at Goldman Sachs in lower Manhattan making $150,000 in salary and $1.6 million in bonuses when he took a position on a futures contract traded electronically in December of 2007 . Fraud: Court papers say he entered fictitious information in trading account records and lied to company representatives to hide the fact that he had put 10 times more money at risk than allowed . The judge also said he could not understand why the government was not making a legal finding that Taylor had used 'sophisticated means' to carry out the crime. Such a designation would again likely increase the length of any prison sentence. Pauley also noted that the government could have claimed that the crime endangered the financial health of Goldman Sachs, a designation that also could increase a prison sentence. A prosecutor said he did not believe either enhancement was appropriate because Taylor carried out the fraud in a manner similar to his usual work patterns and the company's financial stability was not threatened. 'The court's puzzled by the lack of any enhancements in this case with the loss of $118 million,' Pauley said. 'He created fictitious interactions and then lied about them for a period of time. I don't understand how that doesn't involve the use of sophisticated means.' Reality: Taylor was freed on $750,000 bond but could face up to 20 years in prison at a July 19 sentencing . Pauley added: 'He cooked the books and that's not sophisticated?' Goldman itself paid $1.5 million last year to settle charges that it had failed to appropriately supervise Taylor. The bank has since put in place procedures to catch wayward trading activity more quickly. Taylor was freed on $750,000 bond. He could face up to 20 years in prison at a July 19 sentencing. After the plea, prosecutors released copies of the written plea deal in which lawyers agreed that Taylor should receive a punishment of about three years in prison and up to $75,000 in fines. Pauley cautioned both sides that he was not bound to sentence according to the terms of their deal. Outside court, defense attorney Thomas C. Rotko said the 'unfortunate events of 2007 were an aberration' for his client.

Jeffrey Campbell's best-selling platform ankle boot, Lita, has been labelled 'the world’s ugliest shoe' - more so than Crocs, UGG Boots and even Celine's recent mink-lined sandals. But is the title deserved? Last week, the Los Angeles-based brand released a wedding range of Lita boots, called Cold Feet, prompting The Daily Beast to describe the shoe as 'hideous,' and 'the Clydesdale hoof of modern footwear.' But the opinion of fashion industry experts is divided; and with the Lita being sold everywhere from Nordstrom to Urban Outfitters, the shoe's popularity may just speak for itself. The Lita Boot: Jeffrey Campbell's best-selling platform ankle boot, Lita, has been labelled 'the world¿s ugliest shoe' - more so than Crocs, UGGs and even Celine's recent furry mink sandals. But is the title deserved? The Lita boot, with a  two-inch platform and five-inch heel, . retails for between $160 and $190. First introduced in 2010, the shoe style was initially offered in mustard yellow, but has since been produced in 164 different colors and 65 different versions so far - selling nearly 160,000 pairs. The Daily Beast's Misty White Sidell described Jeffery Campbell as 'best known for producing cheaper imitations of runway shoes,' adding that they are 'probably Instagram’s favorite . shoe (tagged over 47,000 times on the app), but that doesn’t mean . they’re attractive in real life.' Named after Lita Ford of the Seventies band, The Runaways, the shoe's popularity is undeniable. 'Jeffrey . Campbell Lita's in your closet? You're golden' Miss White Sidell explains that he majority of Lita wearers wore the shoe in black, 'which . they’d often pair with American Apparel chiffon maxi skirts and some . sort of sweater.' But then . come the . shoe's eclectic prints: from cosmic stars, to the American flag and even . cat tapestry, the shoe was soon seen on every New York style blogger.

While there are many fashion insiders that agree (in a Lita-dedicated post titled 'Shoe Vom,' Ceriselle, a fashion and lifestyle blog based in Bristol by Hayley Constantine, called them 'offensive'), there are many more who disagree. Rachel Schwartzmann, a New York City-based fashion blogger who contributes to The Huffington Post, recently wrote: 'Have . a pair of eye-catching shoes, you're set. Have a pair of Jeffrey .

She went on to discuss the brand's 'fabulous and groundbreaking . designs in footwear,' saying: 'Even a little rain and wind won't . stop me from living and loving in my Litas.'

High profile fans: Jersey Shore star Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi teams a yellow and black leopard print shirt with mismatched black and white zebra print Lita shoes .

'This bold shoe boasts a hidden . platform - which makes it comfy without forsaking an edge - and comes in . around 40 different colors and materials, from army green to red . glitter.'

For decades, Biggles has held children in thrall with his fictional exploits as a dashing Royal Air Force pilot. But now it has emerged that his unlikely adventures may have been based on fact – in the shape of a real airman from the First World War. A 1918 combat report by a pilot called Major James Bigglesworth has been found at the RAF Museum in a collection of papers that once belonged to Biggles author WE Johns. The full name of the Biggles of the books was exactly the same – James Bigglesworth. The vital document was kept in the manuscript of a book Johns published in 1953 as Biggles in the Gobi. The museum’s researchers have been combing through their files to find further evidence of Bigglesworth’s career in the services. Adding to the mystery, none has turned up so far. Peter Elliott, who is in charge of the museum’s archives, said: ‘The WE Johns archive fills the curators with dread as his handwriting is famously terrible. ‘The combat report was tucked into a manuscript and would not have been found if we hadn’t been reviewing our material for the First World War. ‘RAF record-keeping was pretty thorough, but there is some evidence of Bigglesworth’s name having been removed from other sources, possibly for security reasons when he moved to the Special Air Police later in his career.’ Combat reports were filled in by all pilots at the end of an engagement to help their superiors assess the damage inflicted on the enemy. Adventurer: Biggles encapsulated the daring attitude and traditional Imperial values of the time . The one written by Bigglesworth . describes a fight over Hazebrouck in Northern France in 1918 that . resulted in a ‘hostile machine’ being shot down. It will be displayed as part of an . exhibition about Biggles at the museum for its First World War centenary . exhibition next year. Captain William Earl Johns, who died . in 1968, was a pilot in the RFC – the forerunner of the RAF – before . creating the Biggles adventures in the 1930s. Johns was shot down and taken . prisoner by the Germans in the latter stages of the war. He had switched . to the flying corps following service as an infantryman and then as a . machine-gunner. Discovery: It seems that author Captain William Earl Johns used James Bigglesworth as inspiration for his legendary character . Although the author himself has been . suggested as the model for  Biggles, Johns stated that it was composite . character based on a number of real people. Biggles first appeared in the story The White Fokker, which was published in the first issue of Popular Flying magazine in 1932. His adventures saw him serve in both world wars along with stints in the secret service and air police. The series continued until the author’s death and ran to nearly 100 . volumes – including novels and short stories. Still in print, the books . have been published in dozens of languages. Firm favourite: The character was immortalised in the 1986 film 'Biggles' The RAF Museum tells the story of the air force through its people and collections at a former airfield in Hendon, North London. Its archive contains more than 1.2million items including letters, diaries, photographs, log books and combat reports. Many of the First World War records are being digitised to make them more accessible to the public. The Royal Air Force was founded on April 1, 1918, by combining the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service.","The RAF Museum has found evidence that the literary hero was a real pilot .

Female prisoners at some of the toughest women only jails have been putting their names on waiting list for copies of Fifty Shades Of Grey after prison chiefs bought copies of the novel, it has been claimed. According to a Freedom of Information request revealed today, taxpayers' cash has been spent stocking at least five prison libraries with the 'mummy porn'. Now prison sources say the inmates, desperate to read the book, are putting their names on library waiting lists to get hold of it. The book is stocked at HMP Foston Hall in Derbyshire - a 310-capacity jail, which was previously home to Soham killer Ian Huntley's partner Maxine Carr . A jail source added: 'Fifty Shades of Grey has proved massively popular throughout the female prison estate. 'Women . were constantly requesting the book from prison libraries but were told . it was not available, so in the end it was decided to get some copies . in.' It comes as Justice Secretary Chris Grayling orders all X-rated films must be removed from jails, but the crackdown does not include books. The prison libraries which currently stock the novel include, HMP Low Newton in Durham - a 336-capacity jail which is home to Rose West and Tracey Connelly, mother of 'Baby P' Peter Connelly. Prison sources say the inmates, desperate to read the book, are putting their names on library waiting lists to get hold of it . The book is also stocked at HMP Foston Hall in Derbyshire - a 310-capacity jail, which was previously home to Karen Matthews, who faked her daughter Shannon's kidnap,  and Soham killer Ian Huntley's partner Maxine Carr. The 500 capacity HMP Holloway prison, in north London, where Chris Huhne's ex-wife Vicky Pryce was briefly held, also confirmed it had the book on its prison shelves, as did HMP Askham Grange in York - the 128-capacity jail, which has been home to a string of notorious inmates, including child killer Mary Bell. Other prisons stocking the best-seller, which features sado-masochistic scenes, include 446-capacity HMP New Hall in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. It is not suggested that any of the women have borrowed the book. The current female prison population is around 4,100. The Ministry of Justice - which oversees Britain's jails - faces £2billion cuts from its £9billion-a-year budget. A Prison Service spokesperson said: 'A huge number of prisoners struggle with reading. 'Better they read this than nothing at all.' The Fifty Shades trilogy, written by ex-TV executive Erika Leonard using the pen name EL James, has sold more than 65 million copies worldwide.","Inmates, desperate to read the book, putting names on library waiting lists .

Chief Constable Phil Gormley has spoken of his 'disappointment' after one of his officers began legal action to seek damages from a petrol station owner after she reportedly tripped on a kerb while attending a suspected break-in . The policewoman suing a garage boss after tripping over a kerb was publicly humiliated by her own chief constable yesterday. Norfolk chief Phil Gormley said the actions of WPC Kelly Jones had undermined the public’s trust in the police. Her claim is a ‘disappointment’, he insisted, and does not represent the attitude of the ‘vast majority’ of officers. Mr Gormley was under pressure to discipline WPC Jones as critics said her personal injury claim ‘brought discredit’ on his force. She was last night considering abandoning the claim after talks between senior officers and her Police Federation representatives. Mr Gormley made it clear he does not support WPC Jones, who is on sick leave over an unrelated  medical problem. He said: ‘This doesn’t typify the attitude and behaviour of police officers either in Norfolk or nationally. ‘I’ve got hundreds of officers who perform first-class work across the county, responding to hundreds of thousands of calls a year. ‘So it is a disappointment to us and I do understand why it has caused such a public reaction. ‘In 27-and-a-half years in the  service, this is the first time I have ever personally come across a set of circumstances like that. ‘The vast majority of officers perform . their work brilliantly well, they are aware of the risks, and in fact . many people are attracted by the risk and the variety of a police . career. It is surprising and disappointing I think for the majority of . our staff that an incident like this has undermined confidence in how we . do our job.’ WPC Jones, a divorced mother-of-two, remains in hiding at her parents’ home in Thetford, Norfolk. WPC Kelly Jones, left, is suing burglary victim Steve Jones, right, after she tripped on a 6in kerb at his garage, pictured, while investigating a break-in . She triggered the row by asking a top London law firm to sue a garage . owner after she fell over a 6ins kerb while answering a midnight call. The officer hurt her wrist and leg and hopes to receive compensation . after her lawyers accused Steve Jones of failing to ensure his premises . was ‘reasonably safe’. The businessman, who is not related to her, has . passed her claim to his insurers and fears his premium may rise as a . result. A former colleague of WPC Jones said: ‘We do not know how serious her . injuries were. But she was  certainly able to finish her shift.’ Further questions also remain over the role of the Police Federation in brokering the civil legal action by one of its members. The national Federation pointed the finger at the branch which . represents constables, while local representatives said they simply . passed paperwork to lawyers. But yesterday the Daily Mail revealed . frontline officers are receiving millions of pounds every year from . personal injury claims from a Police Federation-backed service. Lawyers behind the free claimline boast they have recovered £42million . in the last two years alone after suing over slips and trips, workplace . accidents and negligence. Stephen Bett, Norfolk’s police and crime commissioner, said WPC Jones’s behaviour was ‘appalling’ and ‘leaves me cold’. WPC Jones tripped while investigating the break in at the Nuns' Bridges Service Station in Thetford, Norfolk. Owner Steve Jones said it is example of the 'fallacy that someone is to blame for every accident' He said: ‘Of course, there are officers who deserve to receive help when . they are injured in the course of duty and the public would readily . support this. WPC Jones, I suspect, is not one of them.’ Henry Bellingham, Tory MP for North West Norfolk, called on the Home Secretary to ‘get a grip’ of the situation immediately. He said: ‘Will a firefighter sue because they don’t like flames or a . paramedic because they can’t stand blood? This threatens the fabric of . our emergency services. ‘The public need to know they can have confidence that the police will investigate a crime without trying to sue them.’ Keith Vaz, left, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, has demanded urgent Home Office guidelines while Norfolk MP Norman Lamb, right, said the Thetford case was unacceptable .","Chf Con Phil Gormley reveals disappointment over Kelly Jones's case .

A grandmother put the lives of train passengers on the line by getting stuck on a level crossing as the barriers came down, a court heard. Susan Anderson, 55, escaped death when the train driver spotted her vehicle and was able to put the brakes on just in time. The council worker reversed her Ford Fiesta off the line and got out of the way in Rackheath, near Norwich, last year. Danger: Susan Anderson, 55, reverses her car out of the way as a train just avoids hitting her. The picture was taken from the train's cab which is just feet away from her vehicle . Anderson was not banned from driving but was instead fined just £400 when she appeared before magistrates yesterday. Her car got stuck inside the half-barriers once the arms had gone down after she apparently ignored the red flashing light, the court was told. But luckily for her, the train driver had good visibility as it was a long straight section of track and he was able to slow down just in time. Anderson, who admitted careless driving, was given eight points on her licence along with the fine for going onto the line at around 8.30am on December 6 last year. Jeremy Guy, mitigating, said that she was making no excuses for the incident. Mr Guy said: 'She works for Norfolk County Council and it was a stressful time for her, as she had to reapply for her own job. 'She has kept her job and, in fact, has been promoted. She's clearly normally a good driver and has a clean driving licence after 27 years.' Level crossing danger: A train goes past the crossing where the incident happened. It has single barriers on each side (file photo) He said Anderson was based in Norwich and needed to drive for work. 'Because of cutbacks, if she were banned from driving, it would impact on her colleagues,' stressed Mr Guy. 'She also has to drive to Thetford once a week to babysit for her daughter.' Chairman of the bench, Paul Allen, warned Anderson: 'Potentially this could have been a very serious matter. 'But we are not going to disqualify you from driving. 'It must have been a frightening experience to find yourself the wrong side of the barrier with a train coming.'

Criticism: The three men who steered HBoS to the brink of collapse today face calls for a lifetime ban on working in the City . The three men who steered HBoS to the brink of collapse today face calls for a lifetime ban on working in the City after their ‘catastrophic failures’ saddled taxpayers with a £28billion bill. More than four years since the lender had to be rescued by Lloyds and a massive government bailout, the ‘reckless’ bankers at the top have been slated in an official report into the debacle. But as the  blame game escalated today, former Labour treasury minister Lord Myners took aim at Gordon Brown, claiming the former PM who gave him a job in government 'got it wrong' on opposing tougher rules in the City. The Government’s Commission on Banking Standards examined the roles played by former HBoS chairman Lord Stevenson and former chief executives Sir James Crosby and Andy Hornby, and its damning report today accuses them of presiding over a lending spree which led to the bank’s downfall at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. Like Northern Rock, HBoS – created in 2001 by a merger of Halifax and Bank of Scotland – fell to the brink of collapse after relying on risky short-term loans from other banks to fuel its own lending to customers. When banks became too scared to lend to each other during the financial crisis in 2008, HBoS – saddled with £238billion of debt – had to be rescued by Lloyds. All three men at the top of the company have moved on to lucrative positions since leaving HBoS, but the commission found their actions so ‘deluded’ it has called on the City watchdog to consider banning them from working in the financial sector ever again. It also singled out former chairman Lord Stevenson as being ‘incapable of facing up to the reality of what placed the bank in jeopardy’. In its devastating report, the Commission says: . Last night critics also called for Lord Stevenson and Sir James Crosby to be stripped of their honours, after former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Fred Goodwin was relieved of his knighthood last year. Paul Moore, the former head of risk at HBoS who was sacked in 2004 shortly after he raised the alarm on its reckless lending, said: ‘These former bosses have been proved to be incompetent and willfully reckless, maybe even dishonest. 'They need to be stripped of their knighthoods and peerages.’ He . added: ‘We’ve got here very rich people with great power who have not . been held to account – finally someone from the establishment has taken . off their gloves and is telling it how it is.’ Scroll down for video . Under scrutiny: The report examined the role played in the HBoS collapse by former chairman Lord Stevenson, left, and former chief executives Andy Hornby, right, and Sir James Crosby . The City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, is also slammed by the Commission for ‘box ticking’ and failing to prevent the collapse of HBoS, despite warning the lender’s board in 2004 that it was ‘an accident waiting to happen’. It says: ‘The FSA was ‘not so much the dog that didn’t bark as the dog barking up the wrong tree.’ Lord Myners, a former NatWest executive brought appointed City Minister by Mr Brown in 2008, praised the 'brilliant' and 'forensic' report but said politicians made a mistake in opposing stricter regulation of the industry. Lord Myners said: 'I wasn't in the government at the time, but I probably was part of a consensus that missed what was happening. 'Gordon Brown was wrong in what he said; his judgement has proven to be wrong, and I’ll put my hand up and say that I was with the consensus in thinking that the City was doing probably quite a good job,' he told BBC Radio 5Live. 'I had been on the court of the Bank of England at that time and had been urging the Governor to look at the issues of risk and poor risk management. But I think Gordon Brown got it wrong.' Shareholders, including pension savers, have seen their investments wiped out, while more than 35,000 staff at Lloyds and HBoS have lost their jobs since the bailout in 2008. Bailed out: During the financial crisis in 2008, HBoS ¿ saddled with £238billion of debt ¿ had to be rescued by Lloyds . Andrew Tyrie MP, chairman of the Commission, describes ‘the history of HBoS as a manual of bad banking’. He added: ‘Consumers and the wider economy, as well as shareholders and taxpayers, have paid a heavy price for the blunders of the HBoS board.’ In its 90-page report, the commission catalogues the ‘toxic’ and ‘incompetent’ decisions made by the management at HBoS. The report added: ‘We are shocked and surprised that even after the ship has run aground, so many of those who were on the bridge still seem so keen to congratulate themselves on their navigational skills.’ The Commission criticises the regulator for only punishing former director Peter Cummings. Known as the banker to the stars, Cummings headed the corporate division which dished out huge loans. He was fined £500,000 last year and received a lifetime ban from working in the City. The FSA has this week been replaced by two new watchdogs, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority. A spokesman said: ‘The Government has done away with the discredited system that failed to sound the alarm as the financial system went wrong, and put in its place a new system that puts the Bank of England back in charge.’ Lord Stevenson . Former HBoS chairman Lord Stevenson is accused by the Banking Commission of being ‘delusional’ and ‘incapable of facing the realities of what placed the bank in jeopardy’. A series of telling exchanges between the 67-year-old peer – who is a friend of Lord Mandelson – and the City watchdog shortly after the run on Northern Rock in September 2007, are highlighted in the Commission’s report. When asked how HBoS was coping with the crisis on November 13, 2007, Stevenson insisted that the management team had scaled-back its high-risk behaviour. ‘Without wishing to sound hubristic, management has done a superb job-a-job (sic) that started five years ago…’, he said. Stevenson also accuses the Financial Services Authority of being ‘paranoid’ about the health of HBoS, adding on March 17, 2008, just months before the lender’s collapse: ‘My soberly considered view is that given the extraordinary external environment, HBoS in an admittedly uncertain and worrying world is in as secure a position as it could be.’ The Cambridge-educated peer, who once described himself as ‘an unreconstructed 1960s Guardian-reading liberal’ and an ‘intellectual snob’, received £815,000 in annual pay and perks at HBoS. But despite this, in December he stunned the Commission by claiming he only worked there part time and was not responsible for its risky lending. Commission member and former chancellor Lord Lawson accused him of ‘living in cloud cuckoo land’. Despite Stevenson’s attempts to portray himself as a fringe player in the downfall of HBoS, the Commission points out he was at the helm from ‘its birth to its death.’ The keen violinist became chairman of Halifax in 1999 and assumed the top role two years later when it merged with Bank of Scotland. Since leaving HBoS after it was rescued by Lloyds, Stevenson has worked for a private equity firm and he recently quit as a non-executive directorship of a venture capital firm based in tax haven Guernsey.","HBoS saddled with £238billion of debt had to be bailed out by Lloyds .

The boss behind the controversial Cadbury’s takeover has been awarded a 31.5 per cent pay rise – despite being accused of tax dodging and poor performance. Irene Rosenfeld sparked fury when, as head of American processed cheese firm Kraft, she took over the much-loved British company in a £11.6billion deal. America’s second highest-paid woman has now seen her pay package jump from £14.4million to £18.9million. The businesswoman, who received a £6.6million bonus, also claimed she needs to travel by private jet to be ‘productive and efficient’. This was despite a 36 per cent fall in net income at her firm Mondelez – which now owns Cadbury’s. Miss Rosenfeld provoked anger at Cadbury’s historic Bournville site after her ruthless takeover of the confectioner in 2010. She became a hate figure for breaking her promise to keep Cadbury’s Somerdale factory open only weeks after the takeover. And she repeatedly refused to account for her actions to politicians on the Commons business, innovation and skills committee. Indian tax authorities have even accused her firm of pretending to make chocolate bars at an imaginary factory in order to dodge extra levies. Despite all of this, she has been held up as an example of a model career woman in America. After rising through the ranks at Kraft over a 20-year period, Miss Rosenfeld left to lead rival food group Frito-Lay in 2004. Criticism: Irene Rosenfeld came under fire for the decision to close the Cadbury's factory in Somerdale . She engineered a return to Kraft as chief executive in 2006, but even big-name investors like Warren Buffett questioned her acquisition of Cadbury’s in 2010. In 2011 she confirmed her critics’ worst fears by announcing plans to lay off up to 200 people at Cadbury’s birthplace. Despite pledging not to make any plant closures or compulsory redundancies until March 2012, she ended up wielding the axe a few weeks later. After masterminding a plan to split Kraft in two, Miss Rosenfeld remained with the snack business that makes Oreo biscuits, Ritz crackers and Dairy Milk bars, while spinning off the larger cheese-based business which kept the Kraft name. However, since the split in October, Mondelez has disappointed. In its first two quarters, revenue growth fell short of its own forecasts, with net income down 29 per cent and 36 per cent respectively. But the poor results do not seem to have had any impact on Miss Rosenfeld’s huge pay rewards. She received a £6.6million bonus for splitting the businesses in two, basic pay of £1million, and a performance-based bonus of £1.3million – down from £2.7million in the previous year. The scandal-hit boss also received £10.2million in stocks, £1.6million in share options and a £4.47million lift in the value of her pension.","Irene Rosenfeld, head of American owners Kraft, gets 31.5 per cent pay rise .

The oldest surviving inmate of the Dachau concentration camp has died at the age of 100. Leon Stepniak, a Polish priest, was arrested by the Gestapo in 1940 in the village of Klebowiec. He spent the next five years in Dachau, a site in south-east Germany which was the first concentration camp to be opened by the Nazi goverment. After being released at the end of the Second World War, he returned to Poznan in Poland, where he died over the weekend. The clergyman was well-known for a speech he made at a commemoration to mark the liberation of Dachau. He told the audience that the camp's legacy should not be as a demand for revenge or recrimination, but as a sign of reconciliation. Mr Stepniak also said that Dachau's continued existence should serve as a reminder to ensure that no similar atrocity ever happens again. KZ-Dachau was established near the town of Dachau in Bavaria in March 1933. Heinrich Himmler, then Munich's chief of police, described the site as 'the first concentration camp for political prisoners'. During the war, it was a leading centre for the extermination of the Nazis' enemies, with around 32,000 people believed to have been killed there in total.

The camp was originally set up to hold political prisoners and Jews, but after the annexation of Poland it began to hold more Poles than any other category of prisoner. It was also the main centre for Christian prisoner who were arrested because of their opposition to Adolf Hitler's regime. Mr Stepniak was one of at least 3,000 Catholic priests and bishops imprisoned at Dachau. The camp was liberated by U.S. troops in April 1945. The Americans were so disgusted by the cruelty they found at Dachau that they summarily executed more than a dozen of the Nazi guards working there.","Leon Stepniak was interned at Dachau from 1940 to end of WWII in 1945 .

Three staff at one of Britain's top children's hospital have been suspended and interviewed by police after the death of a baby girl, allegedly from a massive morphine overdose. A probe was launched following the death of eight-week-old Hanna Faheem who was admitted with breathing difficulties, and died in her mother's arms. The investigation is over the administration of a controlled drug and detectives are waiting for the results of pathology tests. As her family prepared for her funeral, detectives arrived to halt the ceremony and Hanna's body was seized for a post-mortem examination. Baby: South Yorkshire Police are investigating the death of eight-month-old Hanna Faheem in December last year . Investigation: Staff at Sheffield Children's Hospital have been suspended following the death of eight-week-old Hanna Faheem . Her mother Naseem Akhtar, from Sheffield said she initially believed her daughter had lost the fight for life against rare genetic condition Edwards' Syndrome, with which she had been born less than two months earlier. But she was later told detectives were investigating whether Hanna was given 10 times too much morphine in Sheffield Children's Hospital, a 3.5mg dose instead of the correct 0.35mg. 'I feel as if my whole life has been turned upside down,' said 38-year-old Ms Akhtar. 'When the police came to the house and stopped the funeral that was the first we knew anything suspicious had happened. Tragic: Hanna was born in Sheffield in October but died two months later at the well-known hospital . 'They said she may have been given too much morphine, 10 times more, and it had been realised an hour later.' Hanna was born on October 21 last year at Sheffield's Jessop maternity wing, and soon afterwards doctors found she had Edwards' Syndrome. The rare genetic disorder occurs when a child is born with three copies of chromosome 18, rather than the usual two. Most babies die before birth, and the condition often causes trouble with feeding and breathing. 'They told me she had a limited lifespan, and that she needed to go home and spend time with her family,' her mother said . 'She was such a beautiful baby, and very much loved.' Nearly two months later, at around 10.30pm last December 16, Naseem noticed Hanna had a chesty cough and sore throat, so called an ambulance as she had been advised. 'One of the doctors said she was really poorly,' said Naseem. 'I said to the nurses, 'Can't you give her something to take the mucus out?'. 'One of the drugs was morphine, and the other was to relieve congestion in her chest.It seemed she was getting better, but at around 4am we were taken on to the ward. I picked Hanna up, and I was crying, because I knew there was something wrong happening. She died in my arms. 'When Hanna was born I was told that her life would be short. I was mentally prepared for that but she should not have died that morning. 'I knew my daughter's life would be short but she was loved just as much as if she would have lived a normal life. 'If the hospital had not made the mistake I would have had more time with her and they robbed me of that. The police told me that the hospital admitted they had given her too much morphine. 'But why didn't they tell me what had happened me she died? Instead I was allowed to take Hanna for her funeral which was arranged for later the same day. 'Then the police arrived and said it could not go ahead. It was heartbreaking. People need to be aware of what went wrong because mistakes like this should not happen.' Hanna died at 5.30am the following day, and within hours the funeral was arranged at the Madani Masjid Mosque in Wincobank, with hundreds of mourners expected. But at 12.50pm CID came to the family home and stopped the funeral.' An inquest has been opened and a police spokesman confirmed: 'South Yorkshire Police is currently investigating the death of a two-month-old child following admission to Sheffield Children's Hospital. 'The investigation regarding the administration of a controlled drug is ongoing, and officers are waiting for the results of a pathology report.' A hospital spokeswoman said: 'We have been notified by the police that they are investigating a death at the hospital on December 17.

A schoolgirl was raped twice outside a nightclub after police spoke to the drunk victim and one of her attackers but failed to intervene, it emerged today. Two officers approached the teenage girl and one of her rapists, Darren Carr, after they were told there were 'people having sex' in Newcastle city centre in full view of passers-by. Instead of taking action they told the 17-year-old to go home, but left her with Carr, who has now been jailed for subjecting her to a brutal four-hour ordeal on the street. The details emerged as Carr, 26, and Edward Fowler, 25, were each sent to prison for seven and a half years for her rape. Rapists: Darren Carr (left), who has been jailed for seven and a half years along with fellow rapist Edward Fowler (right), was spoken to by police before attacking his victim . Northumbria Police has now launched an investigation - and its chief constable has already been questioned  - after it was alleged officers missed the chance to save the teenager from the rapists' clutches. A court heard that the girl was thrown out of Digital nightclub for being too drunk and taken by a stranger to an alcove off Times Square in Newcastle, which at the time was packed with drinkers. She claimed she was raped by this man, but after he pleaded not guilty in court the case against him was dropped. While she was in the alcove Darren Carr came over and began raping her, asking the man 'if he could have a go on her'. The stranger allegedly said yes, because she 'wasn't his lass'. At this point, the defence said in court, Carr was approached by the police after a passing witness stopped two PCs to say they had seen people having sex in Times Square. The officers, Newcastle Crown Court heard, approached the victim while she was  with Carr, spoke to her and left her in the early hours. She went on to be raped by both Carr and Edward Fowler. Horror: A police van marks where the teenage victim was found sobbing after being attacked twice . The county's Police Commissioner Vera Baird has already spoken with chief constable Sue Sim and has ordered her to provide a full report of the incident, 'including how her officers were involved'. She added: 'If there are lessons to be learned, I will ensure that action is  taken.' Ms Baird, the former Labour MP for Redcar, who is now the woman in . charge of policing in Northumbria, said she started asking questions of . the force the moment she heard about the attack. The officer who approached the victim, Ms Baird said, told the teenage girl to  go home. She said: 'Legally, any female - or male - who is as drunk as . everyone says  this teenager was hasn't got the capacity to consent to . sex. 'So officers, who know that a man has just had sex with a woman in the . street,  should take a great deal of notice of her condition. 'A man has raped her and an intervention is called for.' Scene: Police guard cordoned off areas of Newcastle upon Tyne after a teenage girl was raped by two men during a four hour ordeal last October . Ms Baird added: 'I must add my personal praise for the bravery displayed . by this teenager in working with both the police and CPS to ensure that . these vile rapists were convicted and sent to prison for long periods.' Northumbria Police have said there was nothing to suggest that the girl was at  risk when they approached her. A spokeswoman said: 'Earlier in the evening officers on patrol in Newcastle had reason to speak to the young woman and a man in Times Square. 'At this point there were no offences apparent or disclosed to the officers and no signs of distress to the victim. 'We are satisfied that the actions the officers took at the time were appropriate to the circumstances they were presented with.' The spokeswoman added: 'The victim has shown tremendous bravery and courage in working with police to help secure these convictions. 'Fowler and Carr are vile, dangerous predators and Newcastle is a safer place with these men behind bars. 'We acknowledge that lessons need to be learned and we are keen to work with  the local authority, licensed premises and door staff to ensure the safety of all women socialising in the city.'","Officers spoke to pair after being told of couple 'having sex' in a doorway .

"By . Helen Lawson and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 10:28 EST, 8 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:56 EST, 8 April 2013 . Police in Hamas-ruled Gaza have started grabbing young men with long or gel-styled spiky hair off the streets, bundling them into jeeps and shaving their heads, two of those targeted have said. It is the latest sign that the Islamic militants are imposing their strict practices on the population, reported the Associated Press. Hamas has been slowly forcing its fundamentalist interpretation of the religion on already conservative Gaza since it overran the territory in 2007. Ayman al-Sayed, 19, right, says he had long hair before encountering Hamas police, while his friend Mohammed Hanouna, 18, left, said he was also targeted . Hanouna, left, still has a hair style that could get young men in trouble if the police carry on . But the new crackdown on long hair and tight or low-waist trousers - in several cases accompanied by beatings - appears to be one of the most aggressive phases of the campaign so far. The crackdown began last week, and two of those targeted said they were rounded up in separate sweeps in Gaza City that included more than two dozen young men. House painter Ayman al-Sayed, 19, had shoulder-length hair before police grabbed him and shaved his head on Thursday. 'The only thing I want to do is leave this country,' said the teenager, who despite his ordeal defiantly wore stylish but outlawed narrow-leg tan khakis yesterday. 'I am scared. They just take you from the street without reason. I don't know what they are going to do next.' Tareq Naqib, a 17-year-old high school student, said he was also targeted by police on Thursday. He said he was seized outside his home and put in a police jeep along with four young men who had come to Gaza City from the southern town of Khan Younis. On the way to the police station, police insulted them and warned them that Gaza is Islamic, he said. 'They . said, ""we want you to respect our tradition."" They made a cross on our . heads and asked us to leave and finish the shaving at a barber shop.' Hamas . officials played down the campaign - a stance adopted in the past that . allows the group to distance itself from a controversial crackdown while . at the same time instilling fear in those it targeted. Ziad . al-Zaza, the deputy prime minister of Gaza, said the head-shaving 'was a . very limited, isolated behaviour of the police and is not going to . continue.' Young men show off their tight trousers, which are said to be the subject of a crackdown by Hamas . The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights called on Hamas to investigate the 'arbitrary detentions and violations of civil rights of civilians'. The hair crackdown came just days after the Hamas-run parliament in Gaza passed an education bill mandating separate classrooms for boys and girls from the age of nine. Since seizing Gaza six years ago, Hamas has moved gradually in spreading its ultra-conservative version of Islam. It has issued rules restricting women or requiring them to cover up in the traditional Islamic dress of long robes and headscarves, but relented if met by protests. Last month, the Hamas government barred girls and women from participating in a UN-sponsored marathon, prompting a UN aid agency to cancel the race. Hamas activists have also exerted social pressure to get all school girls to wear Islamic dress.","Police said: 'We want you to respect our tradition', claim teenagers .

Verdict: British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford has lost her appeal against her death sentence in Bali for drug trafficking . British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford has lost her appeal against her death sentence in Bali for smuggling £1.6 million worth of cocaine in to the Indonesian island. A spokesman for Bali High Court announced that the court had rejected an appeal from the 56-year-old from Cheltenham. She was convicted by a district court in January and sentenced to face a firing squad. The court spokesman said the verdict was decided last week and Sandiford has 14 days to appeal to the national Supreme Court. Drugs mule Sandiford was caught . smuggling cocaine in the lining of a suitcase from . Bangkok to the island last year. She . got a death sentence despite taking part in a sting after her arrest . which resulted in the arrest and conviction of the smuggling plot’s . alleged masterminds, who got lighter sentences. When the death sentence was first delivered, the judges said Sandiford had damaged the image of Bali as a tourist destination and weakened the government's anti-drugs programme. As it was read out, there were gasps of surprise in Denpasar District Court as not even the prosecution had been seeking the death penalty.In her witness statement, Sandiford said: 'I would like to begin by apologising to the Republic of Indonesia and the Indonesian people for my involvement. 'I would never have become involved in something like this but the lives of my children were in danger and I felt I had to protect them.' During the trial, her lawyer read out a statement from her son which said: 'I love my mother very much and have a very close relationship with her. Scroll down for video . Lindsay Sandiford was caught smuggling cocaine worth £1.6million in her suitcase from Thailand . Death sentence: The court told the grandmother she had shamed Bali's tourism reputation by smuggling cocaine in the lining of her suitcase through the island's international airport . 'I know that she would do anything to . protect me. I cannot imagine what I would do if she was sentenced to . death in relation to these charges.' Briton Julian Ponder, 43, the plot’s . alleged mastermind, was sentenced to six years for possessing cocaine . after initial accusations of conspiracy to traffic drugs were reduced. His . partner Rachel Dougall, 38, got one year for failing to report a crime . while a third Briton, 40-year-old Paul Beales, jailed for four years for . possessing drugs. Sandiford . claims she only agreed to carry the cocaine because of death threats to . her son and says Ponder, Beale and Dougall organised her smuggling run . from Bangkok to Bali. Caught: Sandiford was arrested at Bali's international airport with 10.6lb of cocaine in her possession . The British grandmother is being kept in Kerobokan jail in Bali, Indonesia. A court official confimed his office had received the appeal request from the prison . She . is on death row in the Bali’s notorious Kerobokan jail with Dougall, . Ponder and Beale and claims to have been subjected to death threats for . sneaking on them to police. Dougall, . whose six year-old daughter with Ponder, Kitty, is being cared for by . her parents in Brighton, is due to walk free in May after completing her . one-year sentence. The Government has said it is disappointed Sandiford has lost her appeal. The Foreign Office also reiterated . the UK's opposition to the death penalty and said it had repeatedly made . representations to the Indonesian government about this case. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We . are disappointed to hear that Lindsay Sandiford's appeal has been . refused by the High Court in Bail. 'The UK strongly opposes the death penalty and has repeatedly made representations to the Indonesian government on this matter. 'We will continue to provide consular assistance at this difficult time.' 'King of Bali': Ponder, 43, seen in the grounds of Kerobokan Prison, had previously bragged that he would not receive a death sentence . Jailed: Ponder's partner, 39-year-old Rachel Dougall, was sentenced for her part in the plot, which involved smuggling £1.6million worth of cocaine into Bali . Let-off: Dougall, left, got a one-year sentence for her part in the plot, and Ponder, right, believes his sentence will also be low . The decision follows Foreign Secretary William Hague's earlier plea not to execute the grandmother from Cheltenham. Last . month Mr Hague has sent a strongly-worded appeal to the three judges . through the Foreign Office arguing Sandiford’s death penalty is . 'unwarranted because it is an excessive punishment'. The . 14-page submission, shown to the Mail on Sunday by a court insider, . says the British government has 'serious concerns' over Sandiford’s . case. 'The government . requests that the court takes into account the violations of Mrs . Sandiford’s fundamental rights and decide that in these circumstances . the death penalty would not be appropriate,' it says. Foreign Secretary William Hague has urged Indonesia not to execute drug smuggling grandmother Lindsay Sandiford . 'Allegations . of mistreatment of Mrs Sandiford during the initial period in detention . have been raised. This includes threats with a gun and sleep . deprivation. 'The UK . government also has serious concerns at the absence of immediate – and . prolonged delay of – consular notification. This is all the more . concerning given the absence of legal representation and a translator . during the period of detention.' The . document – known as an Amicus Brief  – says Sandiford’s death penalty . should be reduced to a jail term and implies her execution would have . diplomatic repercussions. 'Mrs . Sandiford is a 56 year old woman. She has two sons and an infant . grandchild who would plainly be seriously affected were Mrs Sandiford to . be executed,' it says. 'Mrs Sandiford cooperated with the authorities with a view to detaining others who were involved in the drug trafficking. 'The High Court should take into account this cooperation, especially given that the others involved have now been convicted.' British . embassy officials in Indonesia did not learn of Sandiford’s arrest for . nearly two weeks after her initial arrest as she cooperated in the . drawn-out police sting. 'The . (British) government wishes to draw the attention of the court to the . allegations of mistreatment by officials when Mrs Sandiford was first . detained,' says the document. 'This . mistreatment constituted violations of Mrs Sandiford’s fundamental . rights under international law and Indonesian constitutional law. 'Mrs . Sandiford was also not provided with a lawyer during the period of . interrogation and in addition concerns have been raised about the . adequacy of Mrs Sandiford’s legal representation during parts of the . trial process.' Criticising . the January sentence in the district court in the island capital . Denpasar, document argues: 'It is not apparent that the court took . account of these considerable mitigating factors when making its . decision. 'The fact . that the prosecution did not seek the death penalty gives weight to the . inappropriateness of the death sentence in Ms Sandiford’s case.' Human rights organisation Reprieve has previously said it believes there is evidence to show that Sandiford was threatened and coerced into acting as a courier. Indonesia has an estimated 114 prisoners on death row. Most of the more than 40 foreigners among them have been convicted of drug crimes, according to a March 2012 report by Australia's Lowy Institute for International Policy. Five foreigners have been executed since 1998, all for drug crimes, according to the institute.

While many may see the glass as half-empty, photographer Ernie Button sees it as a thing of beauty - especially when it’s stained by whisky. The Phoenix, Arizona-based artist says he was putting some dishes away one night when he noticed that some of the residue on the bottom of a glass had left a peculiar design. Mr Button realized that when single-malt whiskey dries, various patterns can be created, and his collection, 'Vanishing Spirits - The Dried Remains of Single Malt Scotch,' was born. Water on mars? Ernie Button used various types of single-malt whisky to create these amazing images that look like planetary landscapes . Landscape: The dried whisky gives the appearance of clouds or rivers on a planetary surface . Designs: Mr Button uses lights of various colors to create memorizing images . Bottom of the glass: Some may just relegate such a glass to the dishwasher, but Mr Button saw something else entirely . Watery: The effect can be used to give the appearance of a sandy landscape, or the depths of an ocean . Each of the images have their own unique design, and give the viewer the impression that they are looking at an image from the Hubble Telescope or on the surface of a planet like Mars. Using various colored lights, he was able to create different scenes, making images that appeared to show various interstellar landscapes. Some may just relegate such a glass to the dishwasher, but Mr Button saw something else entirely. Cosmic: The images look like something the Hubble Telescope would take far off into space . View from the bottom: Mr Buttons discovered the images created by dried whisky by accident as he was putting a glass into the dishwasher . Cloudy: This image gives the illusion of a cosmic vortex . The mesmerizing images can all be seen in Mr Button's collection 'Vanishing Spirits - The Dried Remains of Single-Malt Scotch . He says on his website: 'Some of the . images reference the celestial, as if the image was taken of space; . something that the Hubble telescope may have taken or an image taken . from space looking down on Earth. 'The circular image references a drinking glass, typically circular, and what the consumer might see if they were to look at the bottom of the glass after the scotch has dried.'

Jailed: Julie Faulkner, 67, tried to smother her mother with a cushion in a row over Christmas dinner in her sheltered accommodation in Blaby, Leicstershire . The daughter of a frail 97-year-old woman smothered her with a pillow for asking to be cooked Christmas dinner, shouting: 'You've lived too long and you're a nuisance.' Julie Faulkner, 67, has now been jailed for five years for the assault, which almost cost the life of her mother, Connie Goodman. Mrs Goodman, who suffers from mobility problems but is mentally alert, managed to call for help by pressing an emergency alarm on her bracelet. Her daughter later confessed to the attempted murder, telling police: 'You try looking after a 97-year-old who is going out of her brains.' The attack happened on December 23 last year at Mrs Goodman's sheltered accommodation flat in Blaby, Leicestershire. Leicester Crown Court heard how an argument had broken out between the pair after Mrs Goodman, a grandmother, asked her daughter whether she would be cooking their Christmas dinner or if a carer would be delivering a meal instead. Faulkner, who had been drinking brandy, reacted angrily, pulling her mother's favourite cushion from behind her head while she was seated and holding it on her face. She told her mother she was a 'nuisance' and had 'lived too long' but Mrs Goodman managed to activate her emergency bracelet device, which put a call through to a call handler. The court heard how the person who answered the phone heard the commotion, with Mrs Goodman managing to wriggle free and shouting that she needed the police. Faulkner then gave up her fight, telling the handler: 'I put a pillow on her head like she asked me to do. Goodnight.' When later arrested at home, she told officers: 'I only did what she wanted me to. I promised her when it got too bad I'd put a pillow on her face.' Dawn Pritchard , prosecuting, said Mrs Goodman was shaken and had suffered a cut to her nose. She has asked for her favourite cushion, the attempted murder weapon, to be returned to her. Locked up: Judge Michael Pert, sitting at Leicester Crown Court, gave Faulkner, 67, five years behind bars . The elderly lady said her daughter was . often drunk, telling officers she had 'made a mess of her life' but had . never hurt her before. She had a number of carers, including . her granddaughter and daughter, who visited two evenings a week and . would often cook her Sunday lunch, which she had done on the day of the . attack. Faulkner, also of Blaby, was jailed for five years on Thursday. Judge Michael Pert said: 'The fact . your mother was so vulnerable and you were in a position of trust and . power over her is an aggravating feature. 'The act of trying to smother her was brief and not persisted with. I accept it wasn't planned.' Alwyn Jones, defending, said the case was a 'tragedy' as the mother and daughter had previously had a strong bond. He said Faulkner, who had no previous convictions, was remorseful and had described her actions as 'losing control'. Mr Jones said: 'It wasn't a case of gain and there's no suggestion of any financial motive.' He said Faulkner's daughter believed . alcohol problems had affected her mental health and that she struggled . with the slightest stress. Mr Jones added: 'She was finding it hard to cope up to and during this incident. 'She admits she had had a brandy, as she would normally during the course of the day.' The court heard the victim no longer wanted to see her daughter and had changed her locks, but would speak to her on the phone. Miss Pritchard added: 'She'd like to know why her daughter did this to her. She also wants her favourite cushion back.'","Connie Goodman, 97, fought off daughter and pressed emergency alarm .

Lt Gen Carter told the Independent: 'It . would be unforgivable if we allowed the gains of the last three years to . be lost because we were not able to provide the Afghans with the . support to take this through into 2014. 'Our judgment is we have to manage this . in a way that retains confidence. Precipitating withdrawal that is not . in line with the current plan will damage Afghan confidence.'

Lynda Spence, who disappeared two years ago, was abducted, tortured and murdered by Colin Coats and Philip Wade, a jury decided . Two men have been jailed for life for abducting, torturing and murdering businesswoman Lynda Spence, who disappeared two years ago. Colin Coats and Philip Wade taped the financial adviser to a chair in a flat in Ayrshire, in Scotland, in April 2011 and assaulted her every day for more than a fortnight, then killed her. Her body has never been found. Trial judge Lord Pentland said Coats was the 'prime mover' behind the 27-year-old’s kidnapping and that he is convinced of his 'devious and cruel personality'. Coats and Wade, both 42, forced Ms Spence into a car in Glasgow, on April 14 2011 and drove her to West Kilbride, Ayrshire, where friends David Parker and Paul Smith let them in to Parker’s flat in Meadowfoot Road. When she arrived, Ms Spence was wearing sunglasses which were taped on the inside, and Coats gripped on to her waist. Wade carried in a tool bag which was referred to during the trial as 'the torture kit', containing garden loppers, surgical tape and vinyl gloves. They immediately whisked the woman upstairs to the attic area and taped her to a leather chair by the arms and waist. In the days that followed, the two men would arrive every day to hurt her, as a way of trying to extract financial information. She was burned with an iron, hit with a golf club and they crushed her toes, cut off her thumb and severed her pinkie finger. Ms Spence was not allowed to move from the chair for the 13 days she was there, and had to urinate and defecate where she sat. During the trial the court heard how Ms . Spence and Coats were involved in a land deal at Stansted Airport, . organised by Ms Spence, in which Coats claimed to have invested all of . his money. She was portrayed in court as a con artist who spent other people's money like it was her own. Parker told how he originally believed . the arrangement was to help somebody that needed to get out of Glasgow, . but as the situation 'snowballed' he could see no way out of it. He . and Smith were also charged with Ms Spence’s murder but were cleared . after pleading guilty to a reduced charge of holding her against her . will and assaulting her. Colin Coats, left, and Philip Wade, right, taped Ms Spence to a chair for 13 days and assaulted her every day before they killed her. Her body has never been found. Coats, 42, was jailed for a minimum of 33 . years at the High Court in Glasgow, while his co-accused, Philip Wade, . also 42, was ordered to spend at least 30 years behind bars. It became clear during the trial that Ms Spence dreamed up fictitious characters who were supposedly in charge of a large-scale land deal at Stansted Airport, said to be 'worth millions'. She made up email accounts for someone called 'Uncle Ben', allegedly the main investor, using the internet connection serving Rio Cafe in Glasgow which was known to her friends as 'Lynda's Partick office'. 'Uncle Ben' replied to emails from Colin Coats who invested £85,000 - all of his money - in the fake Stansted deal. Ms Spence strung Coats along for the best part of a year, promising him a return of more than £3million when the deal went through. He asked for it in overseas bearer bonds as a way of evading UK tax. She came up with the bonds but they were worthless, nothing more than a novelty forged on fake Danish government-headed paper. It was Ms Spence's financial dealings with Coats that eventually led to her brutal and untimely death. At the time of her disappearance in . April 2011, she was being investigated by Strathclyde Police over claims . that she defrauded about 30 people in Glasgow. She . was in the process of becoming a police informer for the Scottish Crime . and Drug Enforcement Agency which authorised her to report back about . the apparent criminal conduct of former partner Sokal Zefaj and three . others. David Parker, left, and Paul Smith, right, were cleared of murder. They had let Coats and Wade into Parker's flat where Ms Spence was taped to a chair and tortured . Ms Spence forged overseas bonds to present to Coats as part of a business scam . Ms Spence got the seal of approval from the agency on April 14: the day she was abducted. Thirteen days later, Parker and Smith were dismissed by Coats and Wade, who told them: 'Yous (sic) can go.' Wade was described as his 'right-hand . man' in the killing and later told a friend, Pamela Pearson, that he . helped dispose of a woman’s body. In a bid to cover up the killing, Coats and Wade ordered a mass clean-up of Parker’s flat. It . was scrubbed with bleach, while furniture, crockery and bedding was . removed and floorboards and carpets ripped up and replaced. The . court heard evidence that the two men drove to Wade’s friend’s caravan . in Tighnabruaich, Argyll, where they expressed a desire to 'get rid of . something'. Crown witness . Lee Winyard said he believed the car they arrived in was the same as the . one that featured in a missing person poster relating to Ms Spence’s . disappearance. The silver Vauxhall Astra, which had a broken wing mirror, was hired for Ms Spence about two weeks before she vanished. A phone used by Ms Spence was discovered in a bin outside a mile away from where Wade lived in Glengarnock. Lynda Spence was taped to this chair in an attic at a flat in West Kilbride, Ayrshire before her death . The jury found Coats unanimously guilty of murdering Ms Spence, as well as disposing of her body. Wade was also convicted of both charges, but he was cleared of cutting off the missing woman’s head. Coats, . from Glasgow, was further found guilty of three other charges relating . to his threatening behaviour towards two other men to extort thousands . of pounds from them, as well as stealing a car from Burns on May 18 2011 . after Coats said he would stab him with a pen. As the jury’s verdicts were read out, Coats and Wade sat in the dock and made no sound. They were led back down to the cells with their heads bowed. The packed public gallery, where some of the men’s family members sat, was also silent. In a statement after the verdict, Ms Spence’s parents, James and Patricia, thanked police and the prosecution. They said: 'There is no verdict that will bring our daughter Lynda back or spare her the terrible ordeal that took her life. 'We will never begin to imagine her suffering or comprehend the cruelty of any person who would do that to another human being. 'We cannot begin to understand or forgive what they did to our daughter, Lynda. No words can begin to describe the heartache and pain we are suffering. Ms Spence was held for two weeks at this flat in Ayrshire, which belonged to a friend of Coats and Wade . 'Lynda was a warm, kind and thoughtful daughter and was someone who always had time for others. 'We miss her so much.' Following the verdict, the officer in . charge of the murder investigation, Detective Superintendent Alan . Buchanan, said: 'I hope in some small way this will . bring some satisfaction to Lynda’s parents who have had to endure the . pain of hearing the graphic details of the horrific torture and terror . inflicted on Lynda in her final days. 'Although satisfied with the verdict, . the pain for the Spence family continues as due to the actions of the . accused, Mr and Mrs Spence have been unable to lay their daughter to . rest. 'At this time I would appeal for those . convicted to show some common decency and tell us where Lynda is in . order that we can get her back to her parents and allow them to grieve . properly and move some way towards rebuilding their lives.'","Lynda Spence, a 27-year-old financial adviser, went missing in April 2011 .

Andrew Mitchell has complained to the police watchdog about the Metropolitan Police . Britain's top police officer is set to be hauled back for questioning by MPs over claims that Scotland Yard ‘spun’ its Plebgate inquiry. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, had promised a ‘ruthless search for the truth’ after officers were accused of trying to frame Andrew Mitchell, the former Cabinet minister. But now senior Tories have described as ‘disgraceful’ selective briefings suggesting there was ‘no evidence’ of either lying or collusion by the police. Mr Mitchell was forced to resign as Chief Whip following an altercation in Downing Street in which he was alleged to have called officers ‘******* plebs’ – which he strongly denies. The force began an inquiry into the officers’ claims and the leaking of police logs backing up their account of the incident to newspapers. The saga took a further twist late last week when it emerged that police had briefed newspapers on the inquiry before a report about it was handed to the Crown Prosecution Service, and that the investigation exonerated the officers. On Saturday an angry Mr Mitchell made a formal complaint to the police watchdog over the affair, accusing the Met of a campaign to ‘blacken my name and destroy my career’. Yesterday, one of his friends, Tory former shadow home secretary David Davis, said the briefings were ‘disgusting and improper’. He continued: ‘These discussions when they go from the Met to the CPS are classified as restricted. ‘To release them, even in an accurate form, would be misconduct in public office. To release a spun variant is extremely bad. ‘The police cannot be judge and jury in their own trial, which is what this is. Who approved these briefings? The behaviour of spinning this is incredible and disgraceful.’ The latest alleged leak causes acute embarrassment for Sir Bernard, amid mounting controversy over his force’s investigation into journalists’ payments to public officials. This is now targeting police officers . accused of leaking information to the media even if there is no question . of them being paid. Last . week Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick defended the force’s tactics . in a strongly-worded letter to the Society of Editors. Yesterday a member of the influential . Commons home affairs select committee said Sir Bernard should be . questioned again over the leaks. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe may be questioned by MPs again over claims Scotland Yard 'spun' its Plebgate inquiry. MP David Davis said the briefings were 'disgusting and improper' James Clappison, a Tory MP, said: ‘We . had a meeting in January with Hogan-Howe and he said there would be an . above board process and indicated he took the issue of leaks very . seriously. ‘I don’t think the leaking of the results has been helpful in creating the impression of a completely above board process. ‘He needs to be recalled and explain what’s happened and he should be as concerned to get to the heart of it as we are.’ Mr . Mitchell has apologised for swearing during the altercation with . officers from the Diplomatic Protection Group when they asked him to . take his bicycle via a side entrance at the Downing Street gates last . September. But he denies using the word ‘plebs’ or saying they should . ‘know their place’. Three . officers from the group, which protects government officials, were . arrested and statements were taken from all 800 members. In January Sir Bernard told the committee that he had believed the officers without seeing the police log of the incident. Three officers were arrested as part of a Met Police investigation into claims made by police officers that Andrew Mitchell called them plebs during an altercation in Downing Street, pictured . But he said the allegations against them were ‘extremely serious’ and promised ‘a ruthless search for the truth – no matter where the truth takes us’. Mr Mitchell has now written to Deborah Glass, deputy chairman of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, to lodge an official complaint against the Met. ‘This was an enquiry into a dishonest and illicit attempt to blacken my name and destroy my career,’ he wrote. ‘It would appear that this police enquiry continues precisely that process. ‘I am deeply dismayed that the Metropolitan Police appear to have leaked part of their report prepared for the CPS… and spun it to the advantage of the police officers involved.’ The CPS said: ‘We have received initial papers but we have not received a full file of evidence. We now await the conclusion of the police investigation before considering charges.’","Andrew Mitchell was forced to resign over claims he called police 'plebs'

If you've ever fancied the dress Kate is wearing or the hat Zara Phillips has chosen to complement her attire, then soon you could find it in the click of a button . Shazam, the company behind the idea, shot to fame after designing a mobile phone application that could identify the name of music tracks on the radio or television. Now they claim they could revolutionise the way that we use mobile devices to shop and consume information. Andrew Fisher, CEO of the company, told The Observer: ‘We have the ability to identify the product in a TV show so that when somebody ‘Shazams’ it, they could find out where a presenter’s dress is from in one click. ‘We are focused on creating a new category which we call media engagement. ‘We make it easier for consumers to engage with a brand or a piece of content they are interested in, without having to go through search engines, then mining the results. ‘That works with both TV programming and advertising: a 30-second slot can be turned into a three-minute brand engagement – and more.’ Their current mobile phone application that allows people to find out the names of songs they like has been downloaded 20 million times. When users ‘tag’ music or a TV programme, the Shazam application takes a fingerprint spectrogram sample of the audio content and matches it to a cast database. Currently, image recognition isn’t functional, but the unique sound content on TV output (at the time of broadcast) would be enough to drive users to the relevant Shazam content on their mobile device.Mr Fisher hopes that image recognition is the next step but said more needed to be done to comply with Ofcom. A mobile marketing company is set to create a revolutionary tool that allows its users to find out where an item of clothing is from when it appears on the television . Ofcom said the proposed service was still ‘hypothetical’ in the UK and that ‘all broadcasters must comply with rules on sponsorship and product placement to ensure that audiences are protected’. The company has already adapted its audio-recognition technology to identify adverts specially adapted to the service. Last year ITV signed a deal with Shazam which enabled adverts on the television to be complemented with interactive adverts on viewers’ mobile phones. The technology identifies audio fingerprints of jingles on television ads and brings up related content including extra information, online shops, and further promotional offers. The company, which employs 125 people in its Hammersmith headquarters and another 40 overseas, claims to be adding two million users a week worldwide. In the US, where Shazam’s market penetration is also claimed to be a third of the population, the currenty app is used as a ‘companion’ app, delivering extra content to support programming on 160 channels, 24 hours a day. In the UK, the technology is currently being used to provide supplementary content for limited Shazam- enabled programming, for example the Brit awards where users gained behind-the-scenes access and links to engage directly on Twitter and Facebook.","Shazam .

A man who has spent more than four decades in prison for a Tucson hotel fire that killed 29 people, including some who jumped from windows to escape the searing heat, is expected to be released Tuesday as part of a deal with prosecutors. Louis Cuen Taylor was convicted of murder as a teen but has maintained his innocence in the December 1970 fire at the Pioneer Hotel. The Tucson man, who turns 59 this week, is scheduled to plead no contest to murder in an agreement that sets aside his original conviction and gives him credit for time served, the Arizona Daily Star reported. To be free: Louis Cuen Taylor, 59, who has spent more than four decades in prison for a Tucson hotel fire that killed 29 people, is expected to be released Tuesday as part of a deal with prosecutors . The fire came during a Christmas party for employees of an aircraft company and left many guests trapped in their rooms. The building had no sprinkler system, exits were locked to prevent theft, and fire truck ladders were too short to reach the higher floors. Those factors led some people to jump from windows to their deaths. Others burned to death in their rooms. Most died of carbon-monoxide poisoning while waiting for rescue. In total, 29 lives were lost to the blaze, including one victim who died months later in a hospital. Taylor, then 16, was in the hotel that night watching the festivities. After the fire broke out, he and a hotel custodian tried to extinguish the blaze, then Taylor helped some of the trapped and injured guests escape. Hours later, he was taken into custody, interviewed by police without parental consent and charged with starting the fire. He was convicted in 1972 and sentenced to 28 concurrent life terms. Judge Charles L. Hardy, who presided over Taylor's 1972 trial, publicly expressed skepticism about the jury's decision to convict the Tucson teen. In one letter he sent Taylor in the early 1980s, the judge, who died in December 2010, said he was negotiating with Arizona lawmakers to have the sentence commuted, but the deal was predicated on Taylor admitting guilt, which he refused to do. A scanned postcard from the Pioneer International Hotel, which Taylor was convicted for burning down . In October, attorneys with the Arizona Justice Project, a volunteer legal group that attempts to evaluate cases on behalf of inmates who believe they were wrongfully convicted, asked a court to dismiss the case or hold an evidentiary hearing. The attorneys said several defense experts, using modern forensic fire science, would testify they would not have ruled the blaze arson. The defense team also alleged a prosecutor engaged in misconduct by not giving defense attorneys a laboratory report that said no accelerants were found and by talking to the judge without defense attorneys present. Michael Piccarreta, one of the Arizona Justice Project lawyers advocating on behalf of Taylor, said Taylor maintains his innocence but will plead no contest as a way of getting out of prison quickly. Piccarreta said Sunday that Taylor's lawyers believe he would have eventually prevailed, but thought the process could have taken another 18 months. An investigator with the Tucson Fire Department recently reviewed the available evidence in the case and was unable to determine what caused the blaze. However, prosecutor Rick Unklesbay said the original fire investigator for the prosecution still believes the blaze was purposely set, and the fire investigator who recently reviewed the case lacked access to a great deal of evidence. Much of the evidence in the case was destroyed in the 1990s or disappeared after civil attorneys took possession of it when they sued the hotel. Unklesbay said in an interview last month that even though defense experts were unable to determine the fire's cause, that doesn't mean it wasn't arson. The prosecution's original fire investigator stands by his 42-year-old report, and other evidence presented at the 1972 trial indicated the fire was arson.

Taking precautions: Harris County District Attorney Mike Anderson now has a round-the-clock security detail because other lawmakers have been targeted by assassins . The district attorney for Houston is now being trailed by a 24-hour security team after a fellow Texas lawmaker and his wife were assassinated on Saturday. Authorities have said little about the investigation into the deaths of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, whose bodies were found Saturday. The couple's slayings came less than two weeks after Colorado's prison chief was shot to death at his front door, apparently by an ex-convict, and a couple of months after Kaufman County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse was killed in a parking lot near his courthouse office. No arrests have been made in Hasse's January 31 killing. The highest-profile official to accept the protection has been Mike Anderson, the district attorney for Harris County, which includes Houston. 'Mike has accepted additional security offered by Sheriff Garcia, just in case there are any immediate threats in Harris County,' his spokesperson Sara Marie Kinney told The Houston Chronicle. 'This danger is present every day. They put bad people behind bars everyday, and prosecutors and investigators carry this with them every day. 'It's sad, it's tragic. It weighs heavy on Mike, but it's not going to let it stop him, or anyone in this office, from doing their job.' Kaufman County district attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia. were found murdered in their home Saturday . Authorities have yet to prove a connection the killings but are assuming one exists until evidence shows otherwise . Deputies escorted some Kaufman County employees into the courthouse Monday as other officers were seen patrolling one side of the courthouse, one holding a semi-automatic weapon, while others walked around inside. 'I don't want to walk around in fear every day... but on the other hand, two months ago, we wouldn't be having this conversation,' County Judge Bruce Wood, the county's top administrator, said Monday at a news conference. Assistant DA Mark Hasse was gunned down in January, and had recently pursued cases involving the Aryan brotherhood . Law enforcement agencies throughout Texas were on high alert, and steps were being taken to better protect other DAs and their staffs. In Harris County, which includes Houston, District Attorney Mike Anderson said he accepted the sheriff's offer of 24-hour security for him and his family. Anderson said he also would take precautions at his office, the largest of its kind in Texas, with more than 270 prosecutors. 'I think district attorneys across Texas are still in a state of shock,' Anderson said Sunday. McLelland, 63, was the 13th prosecutor . killed in the U.S. since the National Association of District Attorneys . began keeping count in the 1960s. Kaufman . County Sheriff David Byrnes would not give details Sunday of how the . killings unfolded and said there was nothing to indicate for certain . whether the DA's slaying was connected to Hasse's. El . Paso County, Colorado, sheriff's spokesman Sergeant Joe Roybal said . investigators had so far found no evidence connecting the Texas killings . to the Colorado case, but added: 'We're examining all possibilities.' Colorado's . corrections director, Tom Clements, was killed March 19 when he . answered the doorbell at his home outside Colorado Springs. Evan . Spencer Ebel, a white supremacist and former Colorado inmate suspected . of shooting Clements, died in a shootout with Texas deputies two days . later about 100 miles from Kaufman. Crime scene: Law enforcement officers investigate the scene of Mark Hasse's killing in January . In an Associated Press interview shortly after the Colorado slaying, McLelland himself raised the possibility that Hasse was gunned down by a white supremacist gang. McLelland, elected in 2010, said his office had prosecuted several cases against such gangs, particularly one known as the Aryan Brotherhood. The groups have a strong presence around Kaufman County, a mostly rural area dotted with subdivisions, with a population of about 104,000. After Hasse's slaying, McLelland said, he carried a gun everywhere around town, even when walking his dog. Suspect: Evan Spencer Ebel (left) is the main suspect in the murder of Colorado prison's chief Tom Clements (right) and he was killed in a shootout with police in Texas two days after the murder . He figured assassins were more likely to try to attack him outside. He said he had warned all his employees to be constantly on the alert. 'The people in my line of work are going to have to get better at it,' he said of dealing with the danger, 'because they're going to need it more in the future.' The number of attacks on prosecutors, judges and senior law enforcement officers in the U.S. has spiked in the past three years, according to Glenn McGovern, an investigator with the Santa Clara County, California district attorney's office who tracks such cases. For about a month after Hasse's slaying, sheriff's deputies were parked in the district attorney's driveway, said Sam Rosander, a McLelland neighbor. The FBI and the Texas Rangers joined the investigation into the McLellands' deaths.","Kaufman County, Texas, district attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were found murdered in their home Saturday .

Sylvia Britton-Prior, 50, and son Adam Britton-Prior Junior, 21, had a tearful reunion following his frantic appeal for her whereabouts. Mrs Britton-Prior, who lost her daughter Amber, 29, in a tragic road crash three years ago, got in touch after reading how concerned her family were. 'Worried': Sylvia Britton-Prior, 50 (left), disappeared after she travelled to Southampton to mark the third anniversary of her daughter Amber Mattingley's (right) tragic death in a road accident . She rang her brother, who then shared the good news that she was safe and well with the rest of the family. Mrs Britton-Prior had been staying . with an old friend in Botley, Hampshire, who then drove her to see . relatives for an emotional catch-up. Mr Britton-Prior Jnr, who is staying . with his paternal grandad in Portswood, Southampton, said: 'I'm over the . moon to have Mum back with us - we are all massively relieved. 'She got in touch as soon as she read about how worried we all were, and says she wasn't thinking straight when she went missing. 'When I saw her again I just gave her the biggest bear hug I have ever given in my life and we were both close to tears. 'Once I could speak, I said 'Mum, what on earth were you playing at?' and she replied that she hadn't been thinking properly. Agitated: Sylvia Britton-Prior's son Adam, 21, and the rest of his family were 'worried sick' about his mother who disappeared for a week . 'Mum's been through a lot in the last few years and it's a huge relief to know that she's safe and well. 'She says she was in a bit of a state last week and felt like she needed a break, a breather.' Mrs Britton-Prior, who had six children including Amber, vanished on March 25. She says after leaving Mr .

He took care of her at his home for the week. Mr Britton-Prior Jnr, who works at a recycling company, added: 'When Mum starts walking she will keep going for miles. 'After I'd seen her, we went round to . visit her six sisters and brother, and some of their children - there's . been an awful lot of hugging going on. 'I rang my dad, brothers and sisters . to let them know and they were all so glad to hear Mum was safe too. It's a huge relief to have her back.' Amber was killed when she collided with an articulated lorry while cycling to work in the city in March 2010. Her mother had returned to the city . to remember her eldest daughter with relatives and friends, but suddenly . disappeared at around 9am on Monday March 25. Her son Adam Britton-Prior, from . Nottingham, who had travelled to Southampton along with his mother and . his father Adam Sr on the annual pilgrimage to Amber's grave, said the . family were 'worried sick' when his mother went missing. The 21-year-old, a site operator at a . recycling company, made an emotional appeal for anyone who might . have seen his mother to come forward. He had described how Mrs Britton-Prior had laid flowers on her beloved daughter's resting place. 'We all went to put some flowers at Amber's grave, like we do every year,' he said. 'Very often we will stick around and spend ages there, to be close to Amber. 'But . this year Mum didn't seem too well when we went down to the grave - you . could see there was a tear in her eye but she couldn't stick around. I think the grief hit her for some reason.' The . group returned to a relative's house and Mr Britton-Prior travelled . back up north without his mother, who said she wanted to stay longer. He said Ms Mattingley's death had hit their mother badly and that her grief was compounded when she lost her own mother the following year. Her father had died when she was young. Mrs Britton-Prior, nee Mattingley, grew up in Southampton, and her six sisters and one brother still live in the area. Her son had put up posters around the city appealing for information on her whereabouts, with the support of a bus company and local taxi firm. Amber Mattingley was riding to her cleaning job at a fire station in a cycle lane before the fatal crash on March 23 2010, while wearing headphones. Investigators could not rule out the possibility she was listening to music, something her mother had warned her not to do.","Mother-of-six Sylvia Britton-Prior, 50, was not seen for a week .

That is the critical element,' he said. 'These . reforms, yes they are about holding back on the costs. But really . critically this government will look back and people will say this is . modernising a welfare system.' As . well as the 'bedroom tax', welfare reforms coming into effect this . month include a 10 per cent cut in council tax benefit, a rise in most . benefits limited to just one per cent, and an overall cap on total . benefits of around £26,000.

The 34-year-old reversed the Fiat Punto straight into Durham Constabulary's Deputy Chief, Michael Banks' Mercedes, after which he attempted to headbutt the senior officer in a bid to avoid arrest. On March 9, Mr Beard, from Bowburn, County Durham, was on his way home following his appearance at Peterlee Magistrates’ Court over the alleged harassment. Enroute to his house he allegedly grew tired of walking and entered a village pub. He rifled through an unattended jacket on a coat stand, taking a customer's car keys and mobile phone, Jonathan Walker, prosecuting, told Durham Crown Court yesterday. He used the keys to steal the Fiat, but reversed straight into Deputy Chief Constable Banks' Mercedes, parked just yards away. The senior police officer was alerted at his nearby home, and came out to confront the criminal. Beard, who by his own account was 'full of Valium, tried to avoid arrest by attempting to headbutt Mr Banks and threatening him, saying: ‘Today is the day you die.’ Mr Banks managed to dodge the attack and received a glancing blow, sustaining minor injuries to his upper lip. The damage caused to both cars in the crash was estimated in excess of £5,000. Beard . was arrested shortly afterwards as other officers arrived at the scene and although . Beard complied with a breath test, he refused to provide a follow up . blood sample to check if he had alcohol in his system. Beard admitted aggravated vehicle taking, . assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty, theft of the . mobile phone and failing to provide a blood specimen. Of all the cars: Durham Constabulary's Deputy Chief Constable Michael Banks was alerted about the crash at his home close to the scene and went to confront Mr Beard, who attempted to headbutt him to avoid arrest . Behind bars: Beard was jailed for two years at Durham Crown Court after admitting he was 'full of Valium' at the time of the car theft . David Comb, mitigating, said Beard, originally from the Midlands, accepts he has ‘a bad record of offending’ but had settled down in recent years, moving to the North-East, working and living with his partner. Mr Comb added that following a five-year lapse in offending his recent problems arose after he became stressed with the onset of an expected child and began ordering valium from the internet. Jailing him for two years, Judge Peter Kelson told Beard he has, ‘an absolutely appalling record’, despite an improvement in his behaviour in recent years until the latest incidents. He added that given his actions on March 9, when, by his own admission, he was ‘full of valium’, a prison sentence was ‘inevitable’.","Man, 34, stole a Fiat Punto on his way home from court .

A Tory councillor was condemned as ‘egotistical’ and ‘arrogant’ yesterday for naming a park after his son without permission.

Last week council officials discovered that he did not have permission to rename  the land and had the sign taken down at  the weekend. 'Arrogant': Andre Gonzalez De Savage (left) erected a sign emblazoned 'Adam's Park' at the public space . A defiant Mr Gonzalez De Savage said . he was ‘very annoyed’, insisting that the honour was deserved as his . eight-year-old son Adam had been a member of a council ‘planning team’ working on the park in East Hunsbury, Northamptonshire. But John McGhee, Labour leader at . Northamptonshire County Council, said: ‘It just shows you the arrogance . of the Tories. I’m not surprised, but I am disappointed. It’s arrogant.’ He added: ‘I believe that for someone to have something named after them, they should have done long service. ‘If he has just named it because he . can, when there’s so many volunteers who have gone unnoticed, then it’s . absolutely egotistical. I’m surprised at Councillor Gonzalez De Savage. ‘It’s no wonder councillors get a bad name when they do things like this – we all get tarred with the same brush.’ He suggested that the park should have . been named by  the community, for example through a competition at . local schools. ‘No individual should be able to make that decision,’ said Mr McGhee. A resident who lives near the park added: ‘We were all a  bit surprised when the name went up.

"By . Ap . PUBLISHED: . 15:04 EST, 4 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:14 EST, 4 April 2013 . The Church of Scientology is asking Vietnam’s aging veterans to put their faith in the organization and pay $350 for treatment to help cure illnesses possibly caused by exposure to Agent Orange. A mushroom farm in northern Vietnam has been converted into the Scientology center – to help the veterans still suffering from the effects of war. North Vietnamese army veteran Nguyen Anh Quoc is one of its followers, and is seen grimacing as he forces down the last of the 35 vitamins he takes each morning. Scroll down for video . Sauna regime: Part of the treatment to help Vietnam war vets who suffer from exposure to Agent Orange is to take four-hour sauna sessions (patients seen in the sauna room at the Scientology Health Center in Thai Binh) After decades of suffering from illnesses he believes were caused by exposure to Agent Orange, he is putting his faith into the regime advocated by the Church of Scientology. ""I have to take them,"" the 62-year-old said at a treatment center established with the help of a Scientology-funded group. ""They will clean up my body."" The center owes as much to Scientology's desire to expand around the world, away from scandal in the United States, as it does to pressure in Vietnam to try to help aging veterans still suffering from the effects of war. Many medical experts regard the treatment — a 25-day vitamin and sauna regime — as junk medicine or even dangerous. But for now at least, it has found fertile ground here. The Vietnamese advocacy group overseeing the program in Thai Binh province wants to offer it to all 20,000 people suffering from ailments blamed on dioxins in Agent Orange. U.S. airplanes sprayed up to 12 million gallons of the defoliant over the country during the Vietnam War to strip away vegetation used as cover by Vietnamese soldiers. Going in for treatment: A patient enters a sauna room at the Scientology Health Center of the Vietnam Association of Agent Orange Victims in Thai Binh, Vietnam . The advocacy group, which has the implicit support of the government, has almost completed a two-story accommodation block for patients and is raising funds for a much larger complex, with 15 more saunas than the five it currently has. ""I have seen so many desperate families that their tears have dried up,"" said Nguyen Duc Hanh, the head of local branch of the Vietnam Association of Agent Orange Victims in Thai Binh. ""I don't know what the scientists say about its effectiveness, but the patients say it improves their health. They should be able to experience it before they die."" Scientologists believe the regime, which includes massive consumption of vitamins, four-hour sauna sessions and morning runs, can ""sweat out"" toxins stored in body fat. There are no peer-reviewed studies to back this claim. The center was established in 2010 by five foreign members of a Scientology-funded sister organization, The Association of Better Living and Education. They gave local staff two months of training. The group is devoted to spreading church founder L. Ron Hubbard's social welfare programs and health treatments around the world. Suffering: Nguyen Van Ho, 63, shows off his scar after he was wounded in a battle in 1975, during the Vietnam War . The center makes no reference to its links to the church, and the volunteers have long departed. But having its ""Purification Rundown"" treatment accepted by authorities here adds legitimacy to it, and gives the church a foothold from which to grow. The church sent volunteers to Asia to administer another of its treatments, a massage called a ""touch assist,"" in the aftermath of disasters including the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and 2008 Myanmar cyclone. Since its emergence in the 1950s, Scientology has battled accusations, legal challenges and government scrutiny around the world over accusations it is a secretive cult that preys on vulnerable people. Its leaders deny those accusations. Scientologists market the ""rundown"" treatment simultaneously as a spiritual treatment for followers and as a secular one for those needing ""detox,"" either from drug addiction or chemical exposure. Two affiliated Scientology groups use the treatment in drug rehabilitation centers that have drawn wrongful death lawsuits and investigations. In 1991, Scientology offered ""rundown"" treatments in Russia to people suffering symptoms related to radiation exposure following the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986. The church still refers to the mission in its online literature, claiming numerous successes, but Russia banned it from performing medical treatment in the country in 1996. Last year, a French court upheld fraud charges and fined the church $791,000 for its efforts to persuade people to take the ""rundown."" Daily dose: patients at the Scientology Health Center take a dose of 35 vitamins in the early morning in Thai Binh, Vietnam -The center runs a 25-day health program . Rubina Qureshi, vice president of ABLE International, said the detox has helped thousands of people exposed to chemical contamination, alleviating symptoms such as sleep difficulties, memory problems, pain and mood swings. ""Whatever the long-term health status of these individuals may be, reducing symptoms that have persisted for decades can have profoundly beneficial effects and this is a worthwhile goal in itself,"" Qureshi said via email. The Thai Binh province group said it selects patients based on the severity of their symptoms, and that about 600 people have gone through the course. Fourteen days into the program, Quoc, who suffers from diabetes, nervous system complaints and memory loss, said he was sleeping better, has a better appetite and felt better overall. A reporter questioned four other patients, all of whom made similar statements. All patients get daily care and attention from nurses, as well as pulse and blood pressure checks by doctors. Those who live outside of town also receive food and board during the course. ""It is an excellent program. I feel my health is much improved,"" said Quoc, who spent much of the war fighting along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which was heavily sprayed with Agent Orange. It is unclear if those feelings of better health endure. Hanh said it was too expensive to monitor patients once they leave the center. Many people exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam can't work, or have family members that need full-time care. Check ups: Patients at the Scientology Health Center of the Vietnam Association of Orange Victims get their pulse and blood pressure checked by doctors . The Vietnamese government provides them a stipend of between $50 and $90 a month, but there are few residential centers for people with severe disabilities. None of those taking the course when an Associated Press reporting team visited recently appeared to be suffering from life-threatening or debilitating illnesses. All were able to comfortably jog slowly for half an hour. Pham Ngoc Tan, a 29-year-old patient, said he was on the course after his father offered his place to him. He said he needed it because he and his wife had been having trouble conceiving. In the U.S., the Board on the Health of Select Populations, part of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, said in 2010 that there is an association between herbicide exposure and some forms of cancer, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It said there was more limited evidence of possible associations with several other diseases. Washington has for years questioned whether Agent Orange is responsible for sickening Americans or Vietnamese, though it has spent billions on health care and other programs for U.S. veterans who were exposed. It denies any legal liability in Vietnam. While it gives money to Vietnamese health and disability programs in general, it ignores Vietnamese requests for compensation or direct assistance to victims, saying all help is ""regardless of cause."" Vietnam attributes more illness and conditions to exposure then America does, including, for example, reproductive abnormalities and congenital deformities. Very few people in Vietnam have been tested for levels of dioxins. Hanh says the treatment costs around $350 per person, which the victims association pays for. It gets some funds from individual donors, both at home and abroad, and Vietnamese companies, often state-run ones. The center's expansion is being financed by a joint venture company owned by state-owned PetroVietnam and a Russian company. Last year, the military began a second ""rundown"" course at a military hospital in the capital, Hanoi, according to the head of the national victims support group, Nguyen Van Rinh. Worth the cost? Many medical experts regard the treatment, a 25-day vitamin and sauna regime, as junk medicine or even dangerous . Blood samples taken from patients before and after the treatment are being sent to Germany, where a lab has been contracted to check whether dioxin levels have changed, he said. The hospital declined to answer questions about the program. Many medical experts are troubled by the large amount of vitamins ""rundown"" patients are instructed to take, especially niacin, which far exceed the daily recommended doses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA warns that taking too much niacin can lead to ""liver problems, gout, ulcers of the digestive tract, loss of vision, high blood sugar, irregular heartbeat, and other serious problems."" ""It's bad enough that the treatment is ineffective ... and that people's expectations get raised. Another thing that it is a potentially dangerous undertaking,"" said Stephen Kent, a sociology professor at the University of Alberta in Canada who has studied Scientology. Still, patients including Nguyen Thi Be are hopeful. She worked along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, repairing bridges and roads damaged by U.S. bombs. Since the war ended, she has suffered two miscarriages, has a daughter diagnosed with Down syndrome and suffers from uterine fibroids, cysts and other ailments. ""The veterans here may look not very ill, but many of us are rotten from inside with illnesses,"" she said, her face red after emerging from a sauna session. ""After 13 days, I haven't seen a drastic improvement but I think I will be better with time. Other people who have finished the treatment highly recommended it. They looked very healthy when I saw them.""","Many medical experts regard the treatment as junk medicine or dangerous .

Psoriasis is an immune condition that causes patches of skin on the body to be covered with flaky scales. It affects two per cent of people in the UK and though not infectious, it can be unsightly. For some, it’s a minor irritation, for others it can seriously impact on their life. It is a chronic condition and difficult to shift. This week Jini Reddy, 47, visits a clinic for treatment. Fine floating: The salts and minerals in the Dead Sea, pictured, help with skin conditions . WHAT’S THE PROBLEM? I suffer from mild psoriasis on my elbows, ears and scalp. I’ve had it since I was a child and though I’ve tried countless ointments, the flaky patches have never gone away. Once, when travelling in India, a man came up in the street and said he was sorry for my leprosy! So it makes me feel self-conscious, especially in summer, when I’m baring my arms or when I have my hair pinned up. WHAT’S THE SOLUTION? A spell in Jordan at the Dead Sea Spa Medical Center, at the Dead Sea Spa Hotel, 1,300ft below sea level (the lowest point on earth), overlooking – you guessed it – the salts and mineral-rich Dead Sea. People visit from around the world in search of treatment for skin diseases, joint disorders and  anti-stress therapy. WHAT’S THE TREATMENT? The Dead Sea area is rich in anti-inflammatory minerals. The air also has the highest oxygen content on earth and there are extremely low levels of harmful ultra-violet radiation, creating perfect conditions for solar therapy. All of which helps to accelerate the body’s metabolic process and stimulate cell and tissue regeneration. Complete package: It's not just the water that has healing powers, the air by the Dead Sea has the highest oxygen content on earth (file photo) Clinic director, dermatologist Dr Zuhair Bisharat, says that though the causes of psoriasis are unknown, stress is thought to be a trigger. Treatment depends on long exposure to the sun as well as dips in the Dead Sea. Most patients stay for two weeks between May and November when the sun’s rays are strongest. I’m only here for three days, but hope to see some improvement. Dr Bisharat recommends I soak in the Dead Sea three times a day for 15 minutes, sit in the sun for short periods three times a day and drink three litres of water a day. He also prescribes a daily scalp massage – administered by the nurse – with a combination of salicylic acid, caster and olive oils. He prescribes salicylic acid and Vaseline for my ears and elbows, to apply every evening. I follow his advice and by the end of my stay, the psoriasis on my ears and scalp has disappeared (though it is pretty stubborn on my elbows). Dr Bisharat says 30 per cent of patients leave completely healed and the rest experience long periods of symptom-free relief. MORE INFO .

A speaker drew applause from mourners at the funeral of a district attorney and his wife who were shot dead, when he said of their killers: 'Chase 'em down. Go get 'em. Bring 'em to justice... Take them out of the hole they come from.' Chris Heisler made the remarks as he led an emotional memorial service on Thursday for Mike and Cynthia McLelland who were murdered in their Texas home near Forney last Saturday. Loved ones remembered the couple's love, warmth and public service as police continue to hunt for their killers. Dozens of law enforcement officers and . public officials, including Texas Governor Rick Perry, were among the . hundreds who attended the service. Scroll down for video . Grief: Shirley Woodward, mother of Cynthia McLelland, holds a flag after a memorial service for her daughter and son-in-law DA Mike McLelland on Thursday. The couple were shot dead on Saturday at their home in Texas . Honored: An image of Kaufman County DA Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia is unveiled beside their coffin at a memorial service in Mesquite, Texas on Thursday . According to CNN, an affidavit on Thursday revealed further details of the investigations into the couple's deaths. Friends reportedly found the bodies of the DA and his wife after going to their home on Saturday evening, having not heard from them in almost 24 hours. They were found with multiple gunshot wounds. Police have requested phone records for the McLellands for the last two months to see if more can be discovered about the days leading up to the fatal attack. At their funeral service on Thursday, Mr and Mrs McLelland shared a single, flag-draped casket inside the suburban church. McLelland had addressed many of the . same people two months earlier, after the slaying of Mark Hasse, one of . his prosecutors. Hasse was gunned down near the Kaufman County . courthouse while going to work. The deaths are feared to be planned attacks by violent white supremacist gang, the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas. McLelland was pivotal in the prosecution of a senior member of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas last year who received two life terms following a shoot out. No arrests have been made in either case. The reward for information leading to a conviction has been doubled to $200,000. Mrs McLelland's remains were cremated and placed inside the coffin with the body of her husband, the Kaufman County district attorney. Friends and colleagues at the service described the couple as the perfect mismatch: an outgoing Army veteran known for his wit and humor, and a quieter partner who loved quilting and supported her husband's work. Christina Foreman, one of the five children the couple shared, said both her mother and stepfather 'loved . every minute' of their public service. She challenged the audience to . stand up for what they believe in. Fears: District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were gunned down at their ranch-style bungalow on Saturday . Tragic day: An honor guard moves the remains of of the murdered couple. Police are still hunting for their killer . Sorrow: Texas Governor Rick Perry takes a flag to present to the family of Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia. He added $100,000 to the reward for finding the couple's killer . Ms Foreman said:' They would have done it exactly the same way, because Mike believed in making a difference.' Bruce Bryant, chief investigator for the district attorney's office, broke down in tears as he remembered his former boss. 'We will not stop pursuing justice,' Mr Bryant said. 'We will not give up the good fight. We will not stop doing God's work. We will pause only to celebrate the lives of those we have lost, but we will not stop.' Surrounding the McLellands' casket were mementos of their life together - portraits, a soldier's jacket from Mike McLelland's Army service and a quilt to commemorate one of Cynthia's favorite hobbies. Two officers stood watch as dozens more sat in the audience. Officers in the balcony behind the stage could be seen raising white-gloved hands to their eyes during the service. Governor Perry said he had spoken to McLelland weeks earlier at the state Capitol in Austin. Perry credited both McLellands for their public service - Mike as a 20-year Army veteran and district attorney and Cynthia as a nurse who worked at a state hospital. Perry said both were aware of the dangers of the district attorney's job. Final salute: A police officer salutes as mourners file one-by-one past the remains of Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia . Emotional tribute: Texas Governor Rick Perry spoke of the couple's public service as hundreds attended a memorial today . 'It's an art form. It's a calling, and one of the more difficult ones, I imagine,' Perry said in a quiet, sometimes halting voice. Perry later presented Mrs McLelland's mother Shirley Woodward with the flag which she clasped close to her. Kaufman County Judge Bruce Wood, the county's chief administrative official, said he got to know Mike McLelland while the two were campaigning for office three years ago. 'I knew immediately how intelligent he was,' Wood said. 'But he was quite a character too.' Friends remembered Mike ribbing a pastor about the length of his sermons and Cynthia repeatedly going back to one store to buy gifts for relatives and friends. They also recalled Mike running a tough campaign for district attorney - and his drive to prosecute criminals and pursue justice. 'If Cynthia was all warmth and motherhood, Mike was a warrior,' Bryant said. Distraught: Flags fly at half-staff at the Kaufman County Law Enforcement Center as the small Texas community mourned the murders of the district attorney and his wife .

Halstead recently underwent brain surgery to help him recover from being struck on the head by a branch during Hurricane Sandy . In March alone he's had four brain surgeries, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. Later in the day, the family said doctors were still running tests and they were unsure what was wrong. Tripp has been hospitalized since the October 29 incident after sustaining a brain . injury which left him in a medically induced coma. His family said finally bringing him home Friday was their greatest moment since October but some of his symptoms returned this weekend. Local businesses are trying to help . the famly with their medical bills, and three Chick-fil-A restaurants . are donating 10 per cent of sales to the family Monday afternoon.

'Tripp . has bacterial meningitis, which is very life threatening. Words can’t . describe what we are feeling except total heartbreak.' When he was rushed into Children’s .

Around 15,000 savers in the UK arm of stricken Cypriot bank Laiki will see their deposits protected under British rules and will escape the Cyprus banking levy. The Bank of England’s new City watchdog, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), said around £270 million in deposits from Laiki Bank UK had been transferred to Bank of Cyprus UK and would come under the UK compensation scheme, guaranteeing up to £85,000 per saver. Customers, including those with current accounts in credit, will not be hit by any Cypriot levy on their accounts - potentially as high as 60 per cent for large depositors - after the transfer and will be able to access their accounts as normal. Protected: Around 15,000 savers in the UK arm of stricken Cypriot bank Laiki will see their deposits protected under British rules and will escape the Cyprus banking levy . But customers with overdrafts will remain at Laiki, also known as Cyprus Popular Bank, and will see their accounts frozen. The PRA, which officially came into effect on Monday under a regulation overhaul, has been working on plans for a resolution to protect UK branch customers of Laiki after Cypriot authorities announced it would shut and merge with Bank of Cyprus. It is feared that depositors in Cyprus will be forced to accept losses of up to 60 per cent under the European rescue package to save the country from bankruptcy. The Bank of England's new City watchdog, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), said around £270 million in deposits from Laiki Bank UK had been transferred to Bank of Cyprus UK and would come under the UK compensation scheme, guaranteeing up to £85,000 per saver . Solution: Chancellor George Osborne said last week in a hearing with MPs on the Treasury Select Committee he wanted a solution for customers of the UK arm of Laiki . Deposits of more than 100,000 euro (£85,000) at the Bank of Cyprus will lose 37.5 per cent under a bank levy being imposed across the country. But a second raid on these accounts could see depositors lose up to 22.5 per cent more to prop up the bank’s reserves. Laiki runs three branches in London, including one in Mayfair, and one in Birmingham – it has been stressing to customers that it is 'business as usual.' Chancellor George Osborne said last week in a hearing with MPs on the Treasury Select Committee he wanted a solution for customers of the UK arm of Laiki. Laiki operated as a 'branch' in the UK, which meant customers would have been subject to the levy, but today’s transfer will see them become part of Bank of Cyprus UK - a UK subsidiary fully regulated under British rules. The PRA said customers in overdraft will need to contact Laiki Bank UK, while those who had an overdraft but were in credit will need to contact Bank of Cyprus to apply for a new facility. Mortgage borrowers and loan customers will instead be transferred to Bank of Cyprus in Cyprus and will be contacted in due course, but should continue making repayments as normal.","UK compensation scheme, guarantees up to £85,000 per saver .

This is the heart-stopping moment three brave lorry drivers formed a roadblock to stop a Hungarian haulier who had hurtled the wrong way down a busy motorway for ten miles after downing homemade plum brandy and beer. Pal Korbely, 50, caused chaos on the M6 after travelling south on the northbound carriageway, narrowly missing dozens of vehicles. In footage caught on CCTV,  the heroes who brought . Korbely to a halt saw his oncoming lorry and instinctively blocked him . with each one getting into a different lane. A judge has since commended the fearless hauliers - two of whom have been named as Christian Wilenski and Simon Cotton. Scroll down for the CCTV footage . Fast-thinking: Hungarian lorry driver Pal Korbely only came to a halt when three lorry drivers forced him to brake by bravely forming a roadblock . Crazy: This CCTV footage shows Korbely careering the wrong way along the M6 after drinking homemade plum brandy and beer . 'Miracle no one was killed': Korbely travelled down the opposite carriageway for ten miles after leaving Hilton Park Services near Cannock, Staffs, by the wrong slip-road at 10.30pm . Korbely set off in his lorry after . drinking 51 per cent proof homemade plum brandy which he downed while . watching the Grand Prix on TV. Dozens of terrified drivers, including one driving a petrol tanker, were forced to swerve to avoid the 60ft-long vehicle as it sped towards oncoming traffic at 10.30pm on Saturday, July 8. Terrifying video captured on motorway cameras show the moment the three lorries force the married father-of-two to brake by driving their vehicles two abreast along the carriageway in a rolling roadblock. When officers breathalysed Korbely, he had 81mcg of alcohol in 100ml of breath, almost two-and-a-half times the legal limit of 35mcg. He told officers he had downed super-strength homemade plum brandy and beer in the afternoon as he and two other drivers watched the Grand Prix qualifying races. 'Dangerous to the max': Korbely was jailed for eight months after admitting dangerous driving and driving under the influence of alcohol at Birmingham Crown Court . Terror ride: Dozens of terrified drivers, including one driving a petrol tanker, were forced to swerve to avoid the 60ft-long vehicle as it sped towards oncoming traffic . Today, he was jailed for eight months after admitting dangerous driving and driving under the influence of alcohol at Birmingham Crown Court. Sentencing him, Judge Paul Farrer QC told Korbely: 'You described your driving as being dangerous to the max. And you were right. 'This was a prolonged course of dangerous driving which presented danger to innocent motorists at the highest level. 'You spent the afternoon drinking and then for reasons that will never be clear you got into your lorry and you drove for about ten miles at night the wrong way up the M6 motorway with your headlights off. 'It’s little more than good fortune nobody was killed or seriously injured. The public have reason to be grateful for the actions of the the lorry drivers whose actions and bravery caused you to stop. 'You have reason to be grateful to them. Your position could have been much worse.' Near miss: The court heard warning signs on all of the gantries along the M6 flashed up telling drivers of the oncoming lorry and many were forced to swerve to avoid colliding with the huge juggernaut . He was also disqualified from holding . or obtaining a driving licence for three years and told he would need to . pass an extended driving test before he can apply for a new one. Korbely’s lorry left Hilton Park Services near Cannock, Staffs, by the wrong slip-road at 10.30pm. He careered between the slow and middle lane for ten miles until he reached junction 10 for Walsall, where two lorry drivers forced him to skid to a halt. The court heard warning signs on all of the gantries along the M6 flashed up telling drivers of the oncoming lorry and many were forced to swerve to avoid colliding with the huge juggernaut. Police were alerted to Korbely’s dangerous driving by panicked motorists - who took refuge on the hard shoulder and called 999. Jailed: Korbely (above) was drinking in the afternoon as he and two other drivers watched the Grand Prix qualifying races . Phillip Bradley, prosecuting, told the . court: 'Shortly before 10.30pm on July 7 members of the public . contacted the police to complain that a HGV was driving south on the . northbound carriageway of the M6. 'That . vehicle was being driven by this man who was drunk. He told police that . he parked up on Hilton Park Services earlier that afternoon where he . was to take 40 hours or more rest before resuming work. 'That . day he had come over from the continent and delivered goods to Range . Rover before collecting glass which he was to deliver to Scotland the . following week. 'He watched . the Grand Prix with two other drivers by placing a satellite dish on the . top of his cab. What this man did was to drink while they were in the . cab. 'He told police had was . drinking homemade plum brandy that was 51 per cent proof and some beers. He told police he ad no recollection of leaving the services or of . driving his vehicle at all. 'He . caused cars, lorries, a tanker and other vehicles to take evasive . action. This was being driven at excessive speed but neither was it . being driven at a crawl.' Motorist Collette Henry, 23, of Codsall, West Mids, said after the incident: 'I could not believe what I was seeing. The juggernaut was just coming towards me and did not have any lights on. 'I moved lanes and then pulled up to call the police. It is just something you do not expect to see.' Speaking after the hearing, Sergeant Robin Barker, from the Central Motorway Police Group, said it was a 'miracle' Korbely did not kill someone. He added: 'Korbely drove along one of the busiest stretches of the motorway network in Britain, into oncoming traffic, forcing dozens of innocent motorists to swerve out of the way. 'It is a miracle that his dangerous driving did not result in a serious accident, causing injury or even death. 'He knowingly got into this vehicle whilst twice the legal drink drive limit, which is dangerous in itself, before he even started driving the wrong way along the motorway. 'The co-ordinated efforts of Highways Agency staff and emergency services, and the quick-thinking of the passing motorists, means that we are not talking about a more serious incident. 'Hopefully Korbely’s sentence will serve as a warning to others to think before they act in such an irresponsible fashion.' Gary Cook, mitigating, said: 'He fully recognises the risk he placed on himself and others. 'He’s married with children and of positive good character. He’s never had so much as a speeding ticket in his life. 'A HGV driver for 30 years, his actions were wholly out of character. He would never behave like this again.' Judge Farrer also praised the actions of Mr Wilenski, Mr Cotton and the third haulier who barricaded Korbely and stopped him from carrying on down the motorway. Awarding them £250 each from public funds, he said: 'They are to be commended for their fast thinking and brave actions that may have saved lives.'

"By . Rosie Taylor . PUBLISHED: . 06:01 EST, 3 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:21 EST, 4 April 2013 . Bestselling author Iain Banks has been given only months to live, he revealed yesterday. The writer, 59, who is best known for The Wasp Factory, announced he has gallbladder cancer, is ‘unlikely’ to survive longer than a year and will bring forward publication of his latest book. He said he had asked his partner, author and horror film curator Adele Hartley, to ‘do me the honour of becoming my widow’. Iain Banks (left) announced that he was now on honeymoon with his long-term partner Adele Hartley (right) after saying he has cancer that has spread through his body and is expected to kill him by the end of the year . The couple have married in private and are now on a short honeymoon. Banks has withdrawn from all engagements and plans to spend time with friends and family. On his website, he said he was ‘officially very poorly’. He added: ‘The bottom line now, I’m afraid, is that as a late-stage gallbladder cancer patient . . . it’s extremely unlikely I’ll live beyond a year. 'So it looks like my latest novel, The Quarry, will be my last.’ Banks is an award winning writer and was named by The Times newspaper as one of the 50 greatest living authors in 2008 . Publisher Little Brown is hastening the release of The Quarry to give him ‘a better chance of being around when it hits the shelves’, he said. It was due out in October but may be ready by June. Banks, who was born in Fife and studied at Stirling University, had success with his first novel, The Wasp Factory, in 1984. He has written more than 20 books, including science fiction under the name Iain M Banks. He noticed a pain in his lower back in late January but put it down to spending hours ‘crouched over a keyboard’. ‘When it hadn’t gone away by mid-February, I went to my GP, who spotted that I had jaundice,’ he said. ‘Blood tests, an ultrasound scan and then a CT scan revealed the full extent of the grisly truth by the start of March.’ The cancer, which started in his gallbladder, has spread and is effectively inoperable, he said. He is considering whether to have chemotherapy, but cannot start treatment until his jaundice improves. A website has been set up for fans to leave messages of support and fellow authors have expressed their sadness. Scottish crime writer Ian Rankin referred on Twitter to Banks’s dark humour, saying: ‘Typical of Iain to propose marriage to his partner Adele with the words “Will you do me the honour of becoming my widow?”’ Thriller writer Mark Edwards tweeted: ‘Just saw the sad news. 'Wasp Factory, Walking On Glass, Crow Road – some of the best novels I’ve ever read.’ Banks wrote that he has withdrawn from all future public engagements and has married his partner, Adele . The gallbladder concentrates and stores bile from the liver as part of the digestive system. Gallbladder cancer is rare in the UK but is more common among women. It does not cause symptoms in the early stages, grows quickly and is often not diagnosed until the cancer has spread. Most early-stage cancers are found by chance. At more advanced stages, symptoms include jaundice, abdominal pain and nausea. If the cancer is diagnosed early enough, surgery is the most effective treatment. As it advances it can spread to lymph nodes, the liver and other organs. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used to stem its spread but only one patient in ten with advanced gallbladder cancer survives for five years. Vanda Taylor, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Gallbladder cancer is seldom diagnosed early and therefore can be very difficult to treat successfully.’","Revealed he had bladder cancer that has spread across his body .

Most couples who renew their wedding vows do so several years after they first step down the aisle. But Gemma and Luke Stewart are not a couple with time on their side. Their vow renewal on a beautiful Corfu beach last October, just a year after they first married, was a symbol of just how much time they might have left together. For Gemma, 30, has been told she may have just three months to live, after being diagnosed with terminal malignant melanoma. Gemma Stewart says being told she had terminal cancer made her realise boyfriend Luke (pictured) was the love of her life. The couple married in October 2011 . But while she is clearly devastated at her diagnosis, she also believes it has made the last few months of her life some of the best. Put simply, she says: ‘Being told I had terminal cancer made me realise Luke was the love of my life.‘Suddenly everything becomes very clear and you realise exactly what it is you want.’ Until then, the couple, who have been together for eight years, had been unsure of their future. As Gemma explains: ‘We always loved each other but it just didn’t work the first couple of times we lived together. I am quite bohemian and a hoarder of stuff and Luke is the total opposite. We also had different outlooks on life, to some degree. The couple enjoyed a 30's Hollywood glam-style themed wedding. Until her diagnosis, they had been unsure of their future . ‘I was also badly affected by the death of my father at the beginning of 2009 as he was the person who basically brought me up and we were extremely close. 'Being told I had terminal cancer made me realise Luke was the love of my life' ‘After that, I had a burning desire to have children to continue Dad’s blood line. But Luke wasn’t ready to have a family and that caused a huge rift between us. ‘In hindsight, it really wasn’t the right time to go about it, as I was incredibly raw. ‘Now we’ve made it work because we’ve realised how much we love each other.’ The couple, who live in Farnborough, Hampshire, met in April 2005 in a nightclub. ‘It was a very cheesy nightclub and we both stood out like sore thumbs,’ Gemma told MailOnline.  ‘We’d both been dragged along by the groups of friends we were with. But we got talking and just clicked. He took my number and we went on a date shortly afterwards.’ Over the next few years they had a couple of minor breakups, but always remained friends. And they were back together when in October 2010, Gemma found a lump near her groin. ‘I spoke with Luke and he encouraged me to go see a doctor,’ she recalls. ‘Neither of us dreamed it could be cancer. Shock diagnosis: Very fair skinned, Gemma has never been a tanner and was always careful in the sun . 'My doctor agreed - I was too young and had lived a healthy lifestyle, so he was sure it was nothing sinister. But as a precaution, he decided to run a few tests.' 'I just couldn't believe what I was hearing... it was like being smacked around the face' She began to feel uneasy when she was called in for a biopsy – and rightly so, for the news that followed was shattering. The biopsy had revealed malignant melanoma in her lymph nodes. ‘It was such a shock as I have never been a tanner – I just couldn’t believe what I was hearing,’ she  says ‘It was like being smacked around the face. ‘My mind was whirring with questions – when had it started, how had I got it when I’d always been so careful in the sun?’ Doctors told her the primary site of the melanoma was in the middle of the ball of her foot. ‘Looking back, I had felt very run down, but I put that down to my busy job as a special needs teacher working with autistic children, commuting and the stress of Dad dying,' she says. ‘I was warned from the start that it wasn’t good. I was pretty much slap bang in the middle of stage three, advanced cancer and was already very ill.’ The couple renewed their vows in Corfu last October, just a year after they first married. Gemma's blue wig is to symbolise the Greek theme . Gemma immediately underwent major surgery at the Royal Marsden to remove 37 lymph nodes, before undergoing chemotherapy. 'I am so grateful for every day we have together' But that failed to stop the cancer spreading and just seven months later, in May 2011, she received the devastating news that the cancer was terminal. ‘When I heard the news, all I could think about was Luke,’ she recalls. ‘We’d broken up again in the January but now everything seemed so clear, and I had to be with him. ‘He was at work and I couldn't bear to tell him over the phone. I waited for him to come around to my house and when I told him my prognosis we hugged and cried and told each other how much we loved each other. ‘It was then that I realised that the man in front of me really was the love of my life and before I knew it, I was telling him I wanted to marry him. He felt the same and proposed then and there. ‘Suddenly, everything became very clear and I no longer cared about anything in the past or the silly rows we’d had. ‘I knew regardless of what happened Luke would always be there for me. He was my rock, the one person who could cheer me up no matter what. Gemma says: 'When I do pass away I will be happy because in Luke I have found the love of my life and nothing else matters. I am so grateful for every day we have together' Precious moments: Gemma and Luke, seen on a boat trip, met in a nightclub in April 2005 . ‘I just knew that I wanted to marry him, have a fabulous day celebrating our love and enjoying the time we had left together.’ Not knowing how long she he had left, Gemma set about planning her 30’s Hollywood glam-style wedding. And in October 2011 she and Luke, 36, who works for a luxury mobile phone company, married in front of their friends and family in a Farnborough boutique hotel. ‘It was the best day of my life and I couldn't have been happier,’ says Gemma. ‘It wasn’t about getting a piece of paper, it was about celebrating our love with friends.' Brave: Gemma hopes her story will serve as a cautionary tale to those striving to get a sun tan . Since her diagnosis, Gemma has also thrown herself into travelling the world, visiting destinations such as the Mauritius, Australia and New York and the Caribbean. And in October, the couple celebrated their first anniversary by having a blessing in Corfu – the destination of their first holiday. Having lost her hair due to radiotherapy on her brain, after tumours were also discovered there, Gemma decided to embrace the Greek theme and wear a blue wig. ‘I just thought “if I’m going to wear a wig, why not wear a fabulous blue one and do the Grecian look”.' She has chosen to share her story now to try and prevent others suffering a similar fate. ‘I just want to make sure people don’t get to my stage. I have always been fair skinned and never a tanner, but I must have been burnt on my foot at some stage and that’s what triggered the cancer, although I have no recollection of it. ‘I was always very careful, wearing factor 30. So look after yourself and don’t sacrifice your life for a tan. I can’t stress enough how much it’s not worth it.’ She is now planning her 31st birthday in March as her next milestone to reach, and something to focus on. ‘But I know that if I do pass away I will be happy because in Luke I have found the love of my life and nothing else matters. I am so grateful for every day we have together.’ January 21- 27 is Macmillan Cancer Support’s Cancer Talk Week.

Benefit changes coming into force this year leave the door open for fraudsters to submit multiple claims on the same house, it as warned today. The taxpayers already loses £350million a year in housing benefit fraud and MPs today warned plans to combine a raft of handouts into a single payment will see even more public money claimed illegally. The revelation comes just weeks before ministers start rolling out their flagship Universal Credit designed to dramatically overhaul Britain’s complex welfare system. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has long argued that the single Universal Credit will save money through reduced running costs while making sure that work always pays. But concerns have been growing about its implementation, with the Communities and Local Government Committee today warning that the vast new IT system will have trouble distinguishing between genuine and fraudulent claims. Pilots of Universal Credit are due to start this month, and will be implemented nationally from October. It replaces a string of benefits such as housing benefit and child tax credits. Councils told the committee they have been raising concerns about fraud for up to three years, but the Department for Work and Pensions has still not found a way to prevent a major source of fraud. The system will not work from local authority property databases so it will not be able to detect automatically, as local systems did now, when several people made a housing benefit claim for the same property. Thanet District council warned that . fraud is a ‘major issue’ in the proposed new system. ‘With the . veriﬁcation of certain documentation no longer being required this also . leaves the proposed new system open to fraud,’ Thanet added. Blackpool council warned a loss of local knowledge will ‘probably lead to an increase in fraud’. The . committee also raised concerns that  there will be an exodus of . experienced local authority housing department staff, who will quit due . to uncertainty over their future prospects, which ‘will leave the system . more open to fraud’. Chancellor George Osborne yesterday defended the government's benefits changes, insisting they ensure work will always pay . The . committee said the Government must make sure that local authorities . have the admin funding they need to manage the transition to Universal . Credit and stop staff leaving prematurely. Universal . Credit is being introduced in gradual stages over several years, with . the national rollout following several ‘pathfinder’ pilot projects . taking place from this month. Chancellor . George Osborne yesterday defended the government's ambitious reforms, . insisting it will replace 'all those complicated benefits and tax . credits with a single, simple Universal Credit which ensures you’re . always better off working'. It will be trialled in the North West . of England later this month to 'make sure it’s ready for national roll . out later this year,' he said in a speech at a Morrisons depot in . Sittingbourne, Kent. Mr . Osborne added :'Be in no doubt: reforming the welfare system is a big . job, and it’s hard. But I’m proud of what we’re doing to restore some . common sense and control on costs. 'In . recent days we have heard a lot of, frankly, ill-informed rubbish about . these welfare reforms. Some have said it’s the end of the welfare . state. That is shrill, . headline-seeking nonsense. I will tell you what is true. Taxpayers don’t . think the welfare state works properly anymore.' However, there are increasing concerns about whether the reforms will work in practice. Labour MP Clive Betts, chairman of the . committee, said it was ‘extremely concerning’ that systems to detect . fraud were still being developed. He . said: ‘The Government must act to provide assurance that the benefit . system will not be left vulnerable to fraud either during or after the . transition. And it must do so urgently.’ The committee said the landmark changes mark the ‘most significant reforms to the welfare system for 60 years’. The . Government wants to simplify the existing benefits system, so that it . is easier for claimants to manage their own finances and make the . transition into work. Councils warn that the new computer system will not be able to automatically identify if several people are claiming housing benefit on the same house or flat . Under Universal Credit, a single unified benefit payment will take in income-based jobseeker's allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, income support, child tax credits, working tax credits and housing benefit. But the committee also highlighted concerns that the new Universal Credit scheme could result in increased rent arrears as housing support will be paid directly to tenants instead of landlords. It urged the Government to give a clear definition of the circumstances under which a tenant would be considered ‘vulnerable’, and would therefore have their rent paid directly to the landlord. The committee also said that the Government should be doing more to raise awareness about the changes and advising claimants to contact their local authority to find out more through advertising. A Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) spokesman said: ‘Universal Credit will cut benefit fraud by £200 million a year and we are confident that our IT systems will be strong enough to protect us from the threat of fraud. ‘We have been running pilot projects with local authorities to ensure that those people who can't manage with monthly or direct payments get the support they need.’","Raft of benefits to be combined into a single Universal Credit .

The father of a student killed by a single punch in a Greek nightclub came face-to-face with the man cleared of his manslaughter at his son's inquest and branded him a liar. Jonathan Hiles, of Cardiff, was dancing in a nightclub with friends on the Greek island of Zante in July 2007 when he was hit in the face. Friends say he confronted a fellow reveller who had urinated on them in the Rescue nightclub. After being struck to the face, the 18-year-old hockey player fell from a stage, hitting his head on the dance floor. He died in hospital after being airlifted to Athens. It was the day before his 19th birthday. Holidaymaker Andrew Symeou, 25, from north London, was later extradited to Greece and spent a year in custody before eventually being cleared of manslaughter. Mr Hiles’ father Denzil, 62, confronted Mr Symeou at the inquest of his late son - calling the 25-year-old university graduate a 'liar' and saying he wanted to 'string him up'. The heated exchanges between the pair prompted repeated pleas for calm from Cardiff Coroner Mary Hassell. But today, the coroner ruled that Jonathan, of Cardiff, was unlawfully killed and not by Mr Symeou. Mr Symeou said: 'I have never ever hit anyone in my life. 'And I have never ever urinated in a public place, that’s animal behaviour. 'I sympathise with Mr Hiles’ family. To lose a son is the worst thing to happen in someone’s life. But I did not kill your son. I am telling the truth.' Cardiff Coroner’s Court heard that Mr Symeou and Mr Hiles did not know each other - and had been holidaying in Zante separately. Tragic: Jonathan Hiles was killed after he fell from a stage in a nightclub on the Greek island of Zante . Mr Symeou and a group of friends had arrived on the island on July 8 - with two more friends joining them on July 12. The holiday was the first time the group had been abroad without their parents. Mr Hiles had flown to the resort of Laganas with a group of friends to celebrate his forthcoming 19th birthday. Less than 24 hours after arriving, the Welsh teenager’s party was at Rescue when they were involved in an altercation in the early hours of July 20. Mr Hiles’ friends told coroner Ms Hassell they had been dancing on a 'chest-high' stage in the club at around 1.30am when another reveller urinated on them. Jonathan Hiles had been holidaying in Zante before he died in hospital the day before his 19th birthday . Some went to the toilet to clean up but Mr Hiles and his friend Mark O’Gorman stayed put. Yesterday, Mr O’Gorman said he saw his friend hit on the left cheek after Mr Hiles had asked in a non-aggressive tone: 'What are you doing?'. He said he was certain the man he had seen hit Mr Hiles was Mr Symeou. But friends of the 25-year-old Londoner say they did not arrive at Rescue until 4am. Chris Kyriacou said he was confident the group had not split up at any point of their night out. Jonathan's friends told the coroner they had been dancing on a stage in Rescue when another reveller urinated on them . He and another friend, Charlie Klitou, later signed a police statement in a Greek police station saying Mr Symeou had 'panicked' and fled the club after a fight. But giving evidence Mr Kyriacou told the coroner that the pair had been beaten into signing the statements. He said: 'They first asked me about my heritage and where my family was from - I said my family were Greek-Cypriot. 'They said I was lucky, otherwise things were going to be a lot worse. 'First they put me in a completely dark room for around 30 minutes. Then they turned the lights on and around six other officers filed into the room. I was very scared and intimidated. 'They kept asking me ‘what happened?’ and I told them I didn’t know. 'One officer went ballistic and grabbed me by my neck. I was then hit around the face and punched to the head. 'My thinking was ‘I am just going to have to do what they want me to do’. I needed to get out of the police station for the safety of my own life. 'I did not know what was going to happen to me.' Scene: Inside Rescue nightclub in Zante where Jonathan Hiles fell . Mr Symeou wept in court as an inquest found he had nothing to do with the death of Jonathan Hiles. The coroner blamed Greek police for failing to catch the real killer. Coroner Mary Hassell said the only reason he was ever charged is because of the Greek police’s 'misguided' efforts to solve the crime. Coroner Mary Hassell said: 'I do not know who the person was who killed Jonathan but I know that person was not Andrew Symeou. 'Jonathan’s death is an absolute tragedy to his family - but they were not the only one who have been hurt here.' She recorded a verdict of unlawful killing on Jonathan who died in July 2007. Sports science student Jonathan’s travelled from his home in Llandaff, Cardiff, to the Greek party island with a group of friends. Miss Hassell said: 'Statements taken by the Greek police are not worth the paper they are written on. 'Instead they were concocted in a misguided effort to solve this crime. 'The story regarding statements given by Andrew’s friends I would not have believed unless I had heard it with my own ears. 'They were not only bullied and intimidated but they were beaten - they said what they did because they were fearful and with good reason. 'I have found Andrew and his friends to be utterly truthful, wholly accurate and entirely compelling.' Home Office pathologist Andrew Davidson said Jonathan, who was not under the influence of drink or drugs, died of a head injury following the incident in July 2007. Speaking after the case Jonathan’s dad Denzil, 62, said: 'My son’s killer is still out there - I don’t know what more I can do.'

A leading dance star who walked out of the Royal Ballet last year has vanished again just days before his new show is set for its UK premiere. Sergei Polunin, 23, was due to star in Midnight Express but failed to turn up to rehearsals on Wednesday and has not been seen since. The show, directed by Peter Schaufuss, is due to open next Tuesday at London's coliseum. Vanished: Sergei Polunin was the youngest ever male principal dancer at Britain's Royal Ballet but caused a storm when he walked out . After the Ukrainian dancer failed to show up his hotel room was searched but he had vanished. Polunin became the youngest-ever male . principal dancer at Britain's Royal Ballet when he was 19, but walked . out of the company last year, saying he was giving up dance. He later said he had quit because he could no longer handle the stress of a dance career. The star also told reporters that he found rehearsing 'very boring' and . wanted to give up ballet by the age of 26 as it was so gruelling. It is not known whether he has walked out again or if he has been involved in some kind of accident. There were claims that Polunin had chosen to quit Midnight Express because he did not like the production. Missing: Sergei Polunin, 23, has vanished after failing to turn up to rehearsals for Midnight Express which has its London premiere next week . Schaufuss told the BBC he was 'hugely disappointed' the young star had left. 'Artists have good and bad days - that goes with the territory - but rehearsals were going well,' he said. The dance company said Polunin's mentor, Igor Zelensky, had also left the production. Polunin, who moved to Britain aged 13, had spoken in a 2011 interview about the pressure he felt to succeed. 'I would have liked to behave badly, to play football. I loved sport,' he told The Guardian. 'But all my family were working for me to succeed. There was no chance of me failing.' Star: Sergei Polunin performs in Marguerite and Armand for the Royal Ballet at the Royal Opera House. He has gone missing and his current whereabouts is unknown . Polunin later returned to performing under Zelensky at Moscow's Stanislavsky Ballet and has made guest appearances with the Royal Ballet. When his role in Midnight Express was announced late last year, Polunin said it was 'exactly the kind of work I want to be making, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it.' The Peter Schaufuss ballet company said understudy Johan Christensen would take over the main role in the show. Midnight Express is based on the 1977 memoir by Billy Hayes about being jailed in Turkey for drug smuggling. The book was also made into a film which won a Best Writing Academy Award for Oliver Stone. A spokeswoman for the show was unable to give any further details about Polunin's departure.","Sergei Polunin, 23, failed to show up to rehearsals for Midnight Express .

A body believed to be that of Nevada's missing chief insurance examiner was found wrapped in a blanket and bound with duct tape Saturday in a river in Carson City, and four suspects were arrested in the case, authorities said. Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong said that while a positive identification and cause of death have not been officially established, investigators believe the body found by searchers in the Carson River is that of William McCune, who disappeared earlier this week. Authorities suspected foul play after finding evidence Thursday of a bloody, violent struggle in McCune's apartment in Carson City. Body found: A body believed to be that of Nevada's missing chief insurance examiner, William McCune, was found wrapped in a blanket and bound with duct tape Saturday in a river in Carson City, and four suspects were arrested in the case . Deputies were called to the apartment after the 62-year-old McCune failed to board a flight with a co-worker and other employees found no sign of him when they went to his residence. All four suspects are from the Carson City area, Furlong said, but detectives were unsure of their relationship to McCune or the motive for the slaying. Still, investigators continue to believe McCune's death concerned 'personal' matters and was not work-related, the sheriff said. He declined to elaborate. Michael Evans, 23, and Anthony Elliot, 20, were booked on murder charges, while Raul Garcia, 22, and Makyla Blackmore, 20, were arrested on burglary charges. Evans was taken into custody in Carson City, while the others were arrested Saturday morning on the Las Vegas Strip. Furlong believes the latter three fled Carson City on Friday after news broke of McCune's disappearance. Arrested: Twenty-three-year-old Michael Evans and 20-year-old Elliot were booked on murder charges, after the body believed to be that of McCune was found on Saturday April 6, 2013 . ‘At this point, we believe all four took part in his murder and disappearance,’ Furlong told The Associated Press. ‘We anticipate that the district attorney's office will amend the criminal complaint to also charge (Garcia and Blackmore) with murder.’ It wasn't immediately clear whether any of the four had an attorney, and the Las Vegas and Carson City jails don't make new inmates available to the media for comment. The three suspects in Las Vegas are expected to be returned to Carson City within a week, Furlong said. McCune had held his position since December 2009 and worked similar jobs for two decades before that, said Nevada Division of Insurance spokesman Jake Sunderland. As head of the division's corporate and financial affairs section, McCune worked to ensure the solvency of insurance companies in the state. He was charged with ensuring each company had sufficient money in their reserves to cover all claims and obligations. McCune was single and without any known children, Furlong said, and there was no forced entry at his home. Single man: McCune was single and without any known children and there was no forced entry at his home . The sheriff said the suspects were spotted in the area of McCune's apartment. He credited their arrests to 'relentless' detective work and 'some great tips from a lot of people and a lot of businesses.' While authorities have not found McCune's pickup truck, they located its license plates Friday night at a Carson City residence that Evans was known to have frequented, the sheriff said. ‘We're still searching for the truck, but it's unlicensed,’ Furlong said. McCune's car was found Thursday at a nearby apartment complex. Investigators continued to process evidence at McCune's home Saturday, and there was no indication yet of the weapon or weapons involved in the death. ‘We haven't finished interviews and work at the scene to substantiate theories about a motive,’ Furlong said. ‘We're still processing the house and coming up with many alternatives.’ The sheriff's search and rescue team found the body. An autopsy was performed Saturday by the Washoe County medical examiner's office, which will make a positive identification and rule on the cause of death. Carson City, Nevada's capital, is a jumping-off point 30 miles south of Reno for travelers headed to Lake Tahoe or back to California across the Sierra. It has a population of about 50,000. Further investigation: Investigators continued to process evidence at McCune's home Saturday, and there was no indication yet of the weapon or weapons involved in the death .","A body believed to be that of Nevada's missing chief insurance examiner, William McCune, was found wrapped in a blanket and bound with duct tape Saturday .

It is made from Cambodian wood, including Thnoung, Chakrom and Chek, and measures up to four metres-long and 1.73 metres-wide. Despite the popularity of the race, traditionalists fear the art of riding the ox cart among farmers will soon die out as they turn to more modern modes of transport, like tractors. Ox cart racing also takes place in Europe, including every April in Chieuti, Italy, prompting calls from animal welfare groups to have the practice banned.

Norovirus is on the rise again after Britain shivered its way through the coldest March in 50 years, according to experts. The number of cases of the winter vomiting bug had appeared to be falling after its Christmas peak. But the virus began its comeback at the start of last month and the number of people infected is expected to keep rising, according to figures released by the Health Protection Agency. The number of norovirus infections is on the rise after Britain shivered its way through March, according to new figures . Up to 1.89million people have caught norovirus since winter began, an increase of 100,000 cases compared with this time last year. HPA tests showed infections rose in the first three weeks of March, with 6,579 cases of norovirus up to March 20, compared with 6,215 at the same time in 2012. Some experts suggested that the Easter weekend could have increased the risk of the disease spreading as people travelled home to places where the number of reported cases was falling off. Professor Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Normally at this point in the year we might expect the norovirus season to be coming towards an end - especially when it started so early - but it is called the winter vomiting bug for a reason, and we haven't seen much sign of spring.' Research shows that cases of norovirus are most likely to spike in the week after a cold snap ends while the bug spreads easily with people staying indoors during the winter, when their immune systems are lowered by a lack of sunshine. People are advised to thoroughly wash their hands to avoid catching and spreading the infection . People are advised to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water to try to avoid catching the bug and to drink lots of fluids if they become ill. Government advice says norovirus sufferers should stay at home to avoid spreading the infection and remember they remain contagious for at least 48 hours after their symptoms have gone. Norovirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis in the UK and you need exposure to only a small number of virus particles - between 10 and 100 - to catch the sickness compared with 10,000 particles to catch flu.","Health Protection Agency figures show rise in first three weeks of March .

This morning his son Nitesh Bhardwaj was also called in for fresh questioning over the killing of the 62-year-old real estate developer. He has previously answered police questions in relation to the murder. Murdered: Businessman-turned-politician Deepak Bhardwaj pictured as he unsuccessfully ran for office in 2009. He was shot dead two weeks ago, on the eve of the Hindu festival Holi . Police said a dispute over property could be the motive, but rumours reported by local media suggest the politician's relationship with a younger woman could have also soured family relations. According to police sources, Mr Bhardwaj had an extra-marital affair with a 28-year-old who worked for him which had created a rift between him and his family members, reported Mail Today, MailOnline's Indian sister title. 'The idea that he was in an illicit relationship, that too with a woman 33 years younger to him, was unbearable for his family members and they started staying away from him,' said the source. Mr Bhardwaj was shot dead on March 26 - the eve of the Hindu festival Holi - at his Delhi home, in a crime which has left India horrified. The former BSP candidate for West Delhi Lok Sabha seat was shot once each in the chest and back of the head by two men deep inside his 35-acre farmhouse-resort in South Delhi's Rajokri area. Three men entered the complex at 8.55am in a dark grey Skoda, killed Mr Bhardwaj, and sped away at 9.14am. Their entry and gun-waving exit were captured on a CCTV camera. Killing: Deepak Bhardwaj was rushed to hospital after being found in a pool of blood at his farmhouse in Rajokri . So confident were the killers of making a clean getaway that they went directly through the CCTV-monitored KM 24 Toll Plaza in the direction of Jaipur minutes after their dramatic exit from the scene of the crime. The arrest of Mr Bhardwaj's son in connection with the crime, which many have speculated was a slickly planned hit, is just the latest twist in the investigation. A police source revealed last week that previous questioning of Mr Bhardwaj's sons Nitesh and Hitesh had brought to light the family dispute over the politician's alleged affair. The woman, named only as Sonia, is a . resident of Rajouri Garden, an upmarket suburb of West Delhi, but is . originally from Kanpur, Mail Today reported. She used to handle accounts in Mr Bhardwaj's Greater Kailash-based office and was reportedly very close to him. Super-rich: An earlier picture of Mr Bhardwaj inside his plush residence.

Pledge: David Cameron has previously said he would introduce a charge to halt the rise in plastic bag use but has so far failed to act . David Cameron was under mounting pressure to curb the use of plastic bags in England last night as Northern Ireland became the latest part of the UK to introduce charging. The Prime Minister pledged two years ago to take action to halt the ‘unacceptable’ rise in plastic bag use, but has so far failed to act. The pressure on Mr Cameron to meet his pledge was ramped up further last night as supermarket giant Waitrose indicated it backed charging for bags. At least one of the ‘big four’ supermarkets has also told the Daily Mail it supports the proposal and argues it is time for the Government to bring in a compulsory scheme. Leading clean-up campaigners have blasted the Prime Minister and called for the introduction of a charge that would both remove billions of bags and raise money for good causes. Some six billion bags were handed out at tills by major stores in England alone last year, a figure that has risen for two years in a row. Wales introduced a 5p charge with all-party support in October 2011, which led to a reduction of some 90 per cent in the number given out at tills. Northern Ireland introduced a 5p levy yesterday and the Scottish government is expected to follow suit next year. The ruling SNP has a manifesto commitment to ‘seek to phase out free plastic bags in supermarkets’. That leaves only England where the Westminster government has failed to act, despite repeated promises from both Mr Cameron and Nick Clegg. Julian Kirby, of Friends of the Earth, said: ‘The levy in Northern Ireland will make a huge amount of difference to the amount of harmful plastic bags in trees, eaten by animals and blown into our seas. ‘England is not only behind Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland but behind states in the US and other countries in Europe who have done this.’ Leaders from Keep Britain Tidy, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, the Marine Conservation Society and Surfers Against Sewage met Environment Minister Lord de Mauley last week. However, they were given the brush off when he promised no action beyond monitoring how schemes work in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. The coalition of green groups wants England to join the rest of the UK and introduce a 5p charge by the end of next year. Block: The move to introduce a charge is reportedly being stopped by Owen Paterson, pictured, and Chancellor George Osborne . Spokesman Dr Sue Kinsey said: ‘The Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs appears to be saying that the people couldn’t afford a charge or retailers wouldn’t cope – but we know from the Welsh experience this just isn’t true.’ Two of Britain’s cheapest and fastest growing supermarket chains are Aldi and Lidl, both of which charge customers for bags. Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrisons, Waitrose, Boots and WH Smith have coped with the 5p bag charge in Wales without any drama. Waitrose makes clear to shoppers on its website that it fully supports the 5p charge introduced in Wales, saying the legislation fits with its philosophy to cut down on waste and litter. A spokesman, however, declined to say when it would like a 5p charge to be introduced in England. Retailers are reluctant to introduce a fee on a voluntary basis, fearing it will give rivals a commercial edge. Consequently, they want a national scheme. Many Conservative MPs and councillors support charging as do the Lib Dems and Labour. However the measure is apparently being blocked by Chancellor George Osborne and Environment Secretary Owen Paterson because of fears about the impact on the cost of living. Marks & Spencer has led the way on bag charging. It introduced a 5p fee in 2008 at the same time as the Daily Mail launched its Banish the Bags campaign. Since then, it has cut the number of bags issued by 78 per cent and raised more than £4million for charity. A Defra spokesperson said: 'We want to work with retailers to help them lift their game to cut the number of bags they hand out. 'We are monitoring the results of the charging scheme in Wales and the outcome of the Scottish consultation on a charge so that we can make a fully informed decision.'","Pressure mounts as Waitrose indicates it backs charging for bags .

"By . Charles Walford . UPDATED: . 08:24 EST, 8 February 2012 . A paediatrician has been suspended and a hospital matron 'removed' from a Cumbrian hospital where police are investigating the deaths of six patients within eight months, it has emerged. Police began their investigation after a coroner raised concerns following the deaths of at least four babies and two mothers at Furness General Hospital, in Barrow-in-Furness, in 2008. The revelation comes as it emerged that mothers and babies are still being put at risk by the hospital. Final warning: The maternity unit at Furness General Hospital was put on red alert by Monitor yesterday, which oversees standards, and warned it must improve or face closure . On Monday, Monitor, the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts, announced that it has used its formal powers of intervention for a second time at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust. It said the trust, which runs hospitals in Barrow, Lancaster and Kendal, 'continues to be in significant breach' of measures put in place in October. The issues relate to maternity services, as well as overall governance at the hospital. The watchdog's board 'has therefore decided to intervene to strengthen the leadership of the Trust so that it can quickly fix the problems identified', it said. It has appointed Sir David Henshaw, from Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool, as interim chair to ‘drive the recovery of the trust’. Monitor said the trust would continue to be 'red rated' until further notice. Last September the Care Quality Commission gave the hospital two months to improve or face closure, and in October Monitor implemented an expert review of maternity services. The trust was also given a red-flag warning by Monitor, which oversees standards at foundation trusts. And last September members of the trust’s . board were ordered to attend a high-level meeting in London. Sir David Henshaw has been brought in from from Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool to ¿drive the recovery of the trust¿ . 'We intervened at that stage to appoint clinical experts to review underlying problems in maternity services and to require the trust to commission an independent review into overall governance,' said Monitor. A letter from Monitor obtained by the Guardian states: 'In its meeting with Monitor on 3 November 2011, the trust stated that changes in staff had been made in the maternity unit at Furness general hospital, including the removal of a matron.' It went on: 'In its meeting with Monitor on 9 December 2011, the trust stated that staffing issues in paediatricians were known matters and that a paediatrician has been suspended.' But Monitor's board said it has found the Morecambe Bay Trust in significant breach of the terms of its Authorisation in October 2011. Original concerns about governance and leadership at the trust have been reinforced by the findings of reviews into maternity services and overall governance, it said. The report found maternity services suffered from a lack of equipment, such as electronic devices used to monitor a baby's heart rate. There was also a shortage of training or induction in maternity, which meant some junior and middle grade medical staff did not even know where the adult resuscitation equipment was kept. It found medical and midwifery teams were not working together and staffing issues meant some people were working more than 12 hours without a break. A third key point related to the appointment system, with thousands more follow-up appointments missed because of computer problems than previously acknowledged. The problems stemmed from the introduction of a new computer system called Lorenzo and while the report said the changes were made for good reason, they were made without understanding the risk and the impact to patients. Monitor said in recent weeks the director of operations, chairman and one of the trust's non-executive directors had resigned. It deemed the trust's governance processes and systems to be inadequate. Executive directors spent too much time on operational issues and operated 'in a largely reactive manner'. 'They should focus on making key decisions more quickly and in setting a clear direction for continuous improvement of quality,' the regulator said. Clinical leadership roles were poorly defined and clinical leadership was weak, according to Monitor. Policies that do exist were not consistently applied or evenunderstood by staff, it said. Monitor's report said: 'Many of the non-executive directors we spoke to were surprised and concerned with the letter that a group of six [later seven] senior clinicians wrote to the previous chairman, in which they raised their concerns about patient safety at the trust and their view that management were not acknowledging their concerns despite 'repeated representations over several years'.' Tony Halsall, the trust's chief executive, who has resisted calls to resign, said the trust had been working hard to address the issues and 'considerable progress' had been made. He apologised 'once again' to anyone who had suffered as a result of the trust's failings, and thanked staff for their hard work and commitment.He described Monitor's report as disappointing and 'less than complimentary'. 'The additional resources and expertise at the top of the organisation will help us resolve the shortcomings and weaknesses as quickly and effectively as possible, whilst also making longer term improvements to our services,' he said. In a statement released through the trust's website, Mr Halsall said: 'The three key reports undoubtedly make uncomfortable reading for the Trust but we accept their findings. 'Everyone has been working hard to make the changes that are needed to resolve the current issues at the Trust and considerable progress has already made.' Monitor's report said there was 'an ongoing significant risk for mothers and babies', and it was seeking a shake-up of the trust's board. Stephen Hay, Monitor's chief operating officer, said: 'The action we are taking now is designed to strengthen the trust's board so that it can move quickly and effectively to deal with the concerns identified. 'Sir David Henshaw is an experienced chair and it will be his job to take whatever action is necessary to fix the problems so that patient care is delivered to the standards they should be able to expect – now and in the future.'","Mothers are children are still being put at risk by failures at Furness hospital .

Popular: Rosie Whitaker, who once performed at London's Royal Opera House, was a 'popular, beautiful girl who brought joy to everyone through her various talents' A girl of 15 killed herself by lying in front of a train after visiting websites which promote self-harm and suicide, an inquest heard yesterday. Rosie Whitaker, a talented ballet dancer who had performed at the Royal Opera House, suffered from bulimia. The inquest was told she had been a happy girl leading a full and normal life until the beginning of the year. She had become stressed by the ten GCSEs she was taking which exacerbated her eating disorder. She had admitted to her mother that she had self-harmed and had visited self-harming websites before her death in June close to her home in Beckenham, south-east London. Campaigners are calling for the Government to act to prevent the vulnerable being influenced by such websites after a second 15-year-old girl died in similar circumstances last month. Tallulah Wilson, who had said she was a friend of Rosie’s, was hit by a train at St Pancras station in London after visiting a website about self-harm and anorexia. Rosie’s mother, Vanja Whitaker, said in a statement read to her inquest in Croydon: ‘She was a perfectionist, very particular about her school work. Rosie made those around her laugh. She didn’t judge anybody. ‘She cared for people, and was leaning towards a career as a social worker or in psychology.’ She said her daughter had been referred to the adolescent specialist anorexia unit at King’s College Hospital in south London. Tributes: Friends of Rosie left flowers and notes at Beckenham Station in tribute to the schoolgirl . You'll never be forgotten: One of Rosie's friends left a note expressing her sadness at the schoolgirl's death . She said: ‘She was treated for her eating disorder, but I thought that rather missed the point. She was still self-harming. Train driver Andrew Pagram said he saw . a shadow drop on to the tracks but thought it was a plastic bag or a . piece of discarded advertising, so did not immediately brake. 'She was two to three seconds away. I broke as soon as I realised what had happened'. Rosie's dancing achievements had included performing at London's prestigious Royal Opera House . After her death, Rosie’s family . said in a statement in June: It appears she was, unfortunately, heavily . influenced by websites and online communities promoting self-harm and . suicide. ‘We hope her tragic death serves as a . warning to other impressionable youngsters and their parents that such . sites pose grave risks.’ Coroner Dr Roy Palmer recorded a verdict of suicide.

"By . Becky Evans . PUBLISHED: . 15:08 EST, 3 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:08 EST, 3 April 2013 . PC Eileen Arthurs, 52, has been jailed for two and a half years for misconduct in a public office . A police officer has been jailed today after she accessed the police national computer database to help a friend who was once suspected of involvement in Britain's biggest ever cash robbery. PC Eileen Arthurs, 52, lied to police about her friendship with Lee May, who was described as 'a man of interest' by detectives investigating the £52million robbery of a . Securitas warehouse in Tonbridge, Kent, in 2006. Arthurs . denied five charges of misconduct in a public office between 2004 and . 2012 but was convicted today by a jury at Maidstone . Crown Court and jailed for two and a half years. Divorcee Arthurs met Mr May when she sold her £760,000 house to him and the two became ‘at least’ friends. The court heard at one stage she was even asked by senior police officers if she knew 'trustworthy' neighbours in the street who could help them with surveillance on Mr May’s house. Lee May was never arrested or charged in connection with the robbery, and is not a police suspect in the case. Arthurs was working in the community safety unit at North Kent police station in Northfleet. Last year Mr May attended the police station to report someone was trying to kill him, giving a description of the car, an Audi, and its registration number. The following day Arthurs told a colleague she had seen a black Audi and its occupants 'behaving suspiciously' on her way to work that morning. She said she had kept a note of the car’s registration number which matched the one given by Mr May the previous day. Arthurs obtained a print-out of the Audi’s details on the PNC (police national computer), including its history and registered owner. She reported to her acting sergeant that the car’s registered owner was from Yorkshire and that the vehicle was 'probably dodgy'. Senior officers had already been suspicious of her conduct and on her way home from work she was stopped by police and arrested. Arthurs, from Bexley, Kent, was found to wrongly have the PNC print-out in her possession, and she had handwritten the same details on another piece of paper. She admitted knowing Mr May and said her account of the Audi that morning was a 'complete fabrication'. Arthurs worked in the community safety unit at North Kent police station in Northfleet . Judge Martin Joy told Arthurs, pictured arriving at court, that offences by officers 'seriously undermine the trust in the police service' Investigating officers looking into . the PC’s association with Mr May found this was not the first time she . had been spoken to about using the PNC for non-policing purposes. Between 2004 and 2005 Arthurs had used the Genesis police system to check the profile of Mr May. In June 2005 she accessed information on a Michelle Stevenson listed on the database, a former partner of Mr May. And in 2006 Arthurs checked the profile of Ian Tucker. He too was 'associated' with Mr May. Arthurs was given a formal warning by the Professional Standards Department of Kent Police in 2008 to 'show a higher degree of honesty and integrity' when using the police system. But she still failed to disclose her association with Mr May when submitting a vetting form to fellow officers in November 2011. Prosecutor Matthew Jewell told the court: 'We know that PC Arthurs was aware of May’s status as a man of interest to police. 'She knew he had been linked to one of the biggest robberies, not just in Kent but in the UK. 'Investigating officers working on the Securitas robbery considered Lee May a person of interest, so much so that they wanted to set up an observation operation on his home. 'Officers discovered that PC Arthurs had connections to this address, namely she used to live in the house before May. 'An officer leading the Securitas case emailed Arthurs asking if she knew any trustworthy people in the street who they could contact in a bid to set up their surveillance operation. 'Arthurs replied saying that she did not, however she did assist in compiling a full layout of the house.' Jailing her for two and a half years, Judge Martin Joy told Arthurs: 'You told lies to other officers, including superiors, perhaps to cover your tracks for your dishonest and criminal behaviour. 'This was an extended course of misconduct carried out over many years. The misuse of the computer relates to major criminals and not mundane matters. 'It is clear that misconduct by police officers such as committed by you seriously undermine the trust in the polices service which the public are entitled to.' Arthurs joined Kent Police in June 2002 about a year after separating from her husband. The court heard she was 'at least' friends with May - having regular and general contact, although she referred to him as a 'neighbour'. Kent Assistant Chief Constable Gary Beautridge said: 'The vast majority of officers serve with the utmost integrity, honour and pride. 'It is important that those rare few who cross the line are dealt with appropriately and charged if an offence has been committed.'","PC Eileen Arthurs, 52, accessed the police national database to help friend Lee May - once suspected of involvement in the £52million Securitas robbery .

Shamed drugs cheat Lance Armstrong has pulled out of a swim meet because doing so may have violated his worldwide ban from competition. Swimming's international federation body raised objections to Armstrong's participation in the Masters South Central Zone Swimming Championships at the University of Texas this weekend, U.S. Masters Swimming Executive Director Rob Butcher said today. Armstrong was to swim three distance events. Out of the pool: Lance Armstrong pulled out of a swim meet this weekend over concerns that doing may have violated his worldwide ban from competition . Butcher told The Associated Press. 'He doesn't want to cause any more harm to any more organizations. His interest was around fitness and training. 'In light of FINA [swimming's international governing body] and the other political stuff, he will not be swimming.' Although Butcher said Armstrong withdrew from the event, he likely didn't have a choice after FINA raised objections to his participation. Competitor: Armstrong was to swim three distance events in the event this weekend in Austin, Texas . An Armstrong spokesman did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. The U.S Anti-Doping Agency banned Armstrong from sanctioned competition for life for his use of performance-enhancing drugs during a cycling career that included seven Tour de France titles. Butcher had said Wednesday that Armstrong, who is a U.S. Masters Swimming member, would be allowed to compete in his 40-44 age group because the master's event did not fall under USADA drug testing rules. But FINA sent a letter to U.S. Masters Swimming officials, saying that because U.S. Masters Swimming is under its umbrella as a sanctioning body, it must recognize the World Anti-Doping Code and bar Armstrong from competition. 'We're expecting them to apply the rules,' FINA executive director Cornel Marculescu told the AP. Armstrong had to register for the Austin event by March 31. According to the meet event sheets, Armstrong had the second-best qualifying time in the 1,000 freestyle and No. 3 in the 1,650- and 500 freestyle events. U.S. Master's Swimming does not drug test. Butcher said earlier that U.S. Masters Swimming has debated in the past whether to start testing and . whether Armstrong or other athletes who have been caught doping should . be allowed to compete. 'We just stick to the fact that our purpose is encouraging adults to swim,' Butcher said. Armstrong . had been pursuing a post-cycling career in triathlons before he was . banned by USADA for performance-enhancing drug use. A message was left . seeking comment from USADA. Armstrong had to register for the Austin event by March 31. Drugs: The swimming competition was originally not believed to be covered under the same anti-doping rules as the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which banned Armstrong for life from its sanctioned events . According to the meet event sheets, Armstrong has the second-best qualifying time in the 1,000 and No. 3 in the 1,650 and 500. He denied doping for years until USADA issued a massive report in 2012 detailing drug use by Armstrong and his teams. In January, Armstrong admitted during an interview with Oprah Winfrey that he used steroids, blood boosters and other banned performance-enhancing drugs and methods during his career. Armstrong also was removed from the board of the Livestrong cancer foundation he formed in 1997 after being diagnosed with testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain.

An aristocrat was shocked to find an unusual obstacle while digging up the grounds of his estate to clear a blocked drain - the remains of a soldier from the English Civil War. Sir Benjamin Slade made the grisly discovery under the driveway of his family pile, the 13th century Maunsel House near Bridgwater, Somerset. He believes the human bones, found encrusted with clay along with tattered clothes and a rusted helmet, belong to a murdered Roundhead. Sir Benjamin Slade with the English Civil War helmet he dug up in the grounds of his 13th century estate near Bridgwater, Somerset. He had been digging under his driveway to clear a blocked drain . One theory is that after fleeing a battle during the war, waged from 1642 to 1651, the soldier was caught trespassing by Sir Benjamin's ancestors, ardent Royalists, and executed . And despite unearthing the lobster tailed helmet, worth around £5,000, the man's skull was nowhere to be seen. The baronet, who hires out his estate . in the village of North Newton for weddings, reckoned the unfortunate . soldier's head may also be buried somewhere on his property. One theory is that after fleeing a battle during the war, waged from 1642 to 1651, he was caught trespassing by Sir Benjamin's ancestors, ardent Royalists, and executed. Speaking to the Sunday Express, Sir Benjamin - whose ancestor Richard Maunsel was killed by Roundhead troops under the command of Oliver Cromwell - said: 'Nobody knows what happened to him because he died . nearly 400 years ago. 'There are some records but they are slim and . obviously my ancestors were not going to advertise what happened to this . poor chap. Roundheads march victorious past fallen Royalists after the English Civil War's final Battle of Worcester in a modern-day re-enactment . 'Maybe he had a heart attack and fell down a hole but I . very much doubt it. I'm not aware of this land ever being a battleground . so perhaps he came here and wasn't welcomed by my Royalist ancestors . and killed.' When he first made the find, Sir Benjamin - whose ancestors also fought in the Crimean War and had links to Horatio Nelson - had hoped there would be some form of gold or other treasure. But after giving the remains a thorough cleaning with WD40 spray, none was found. Keith Hartwell, a military consultant with Mullocks . Auctioneers in Shropshire, believed the discovery was genuine. He said: 'It was found near some of the Civil War battle areas. I'd say . it was an escaping Cromwellian but it seems he may have been unlucky to . bump into Royalists.' When King Charles I took the throne in 1625, his reign was met with almost immediate murmurs of discontent . When King Charles I took the throne in 1625, his reign was met with almost immediate murmurs of discontent. His was a style of governance defined by religious dogma and a stubborn opposition to parliamentary rule. This bred feelings of alienation and deep mistrust in pockets of England, while in Scotland tensions with the English boiled over into bloody conflict. The embattled king was forced to form a parliament in 1640, and within this a vocal and highly critical Puritan faction began to grow. When a violent Catholic rebellion broke out in Ireland, disagreements over how to respond split England in two, and in 1642 the English Civil War broke out. The Royalists, based largely in the north and west, fought for the king, while the Roundheads, also known as Parliamentarians, came mainly from the south and east. They took their nickname from their preference for closely cropped hair, which set them apart from the ringlets of courtly Royalists. The battles that followed saw Charles's forces, bolstered by the Welsh and Cornish, clash with a Roundhead army swollen with Londoners. The Royalists looked to be on the brink of victory in 1643, until their enemies joined forces with the Scots. In 1644, the king's men suffered a crushing defeat at Marston Moor, North Yorkshire, effectively conceding the north. A further loss at Naseby, Northamptonshire, was the final nail in the coffin. The king gave himself up to the Scots and they promptly passed him on to their Roundhead allies, who were in the early stages of establishing a republican regime. He was executed in 1649, but not before inciting further clashes known as the Second Civil War.","Sir Benjamin Slade found bones while digging driveway to clear drain .

Asked if he is still a fascist he said: 'I don't have to answer that question any more.' But Di Canio issued a statement today, stating: 'I am not political, I do not affiliate myself to any organisation, I am not a racist and I do not support the ideology of fascism.

The pictures emerged today after the political storm over the Italian's appointment intensified when a miners' group asked the club to return an iconic banner which hangs in its . stadium in protest. Signorelli, who died aged 76 in December 2010, had been a senior member of the Italian Socialist movement which grew out of the collapse of Benito Mussolini's Fascist party after World War II.

Ex-miners will next week mark the 20 years since their pit closed, with a party - on the day of Baroness Thatcher's funeral. Alan Cummings, chairman of the Durham Miners' Association, said the timing of the events was 'remarkable' and 'one of those quirks', though he added: 'She couldn't be cremated on a better day.' The party will be held on Wednesday at the Easington Colliery Club, in the former pit village, subject to the committee's approval, he said. On Tuesday evening there will be another party for the women's groups who supported the striking miners, he said. The pit in Easington Colliery, which was the setting for the film Billy Elliott, closed in 1993, with the loss of 1,400 jobs and it is one of the most deprived parts of the country. Of Wednesday's event, Mr Cummings said: 'We are planning to have a colliery band and we are inviting ex-miners and their families to go back over their memories of the strike and what has happened since the closure of the pit.' Mr Cummings, an ex-NUM Lodge secretary, said the event was not in poor taste and he had only received positive feedback. 'I couldn't stand her,' he said of Baroness Thatcher. 'She had a very patronising manner and I could have put my foot through the television whenever I saw her on there. 'We opposed and hated everything she did. She has wrecked thousands and thousands of lives so, no, it's not in poor taste. 'We can understand why people are happy and rejoicing that she has gone because they remember these communities have never recovered.' Anne Scargill, the former wife of Arthur Scargill who led the miners during strike action in the 1980s, told Daybreak she was 'happy' to hear about Margaret Thatcher's death, calling her an 'evil' woman.

And as many found some admirable qualities in her years of political life, Morrissey found no positive achievements in her premiership.

"PUBLISHED: . 19:44 EST, 8 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:48 EST, 9 April 2013 . Criticised: John Griffith-Jones has been attacked for giving HBOS a clean bill of health in the run-up to its collapse . The chairman of the new City regulator is facing calls to step down for failing to sound the alarm about reckless lending at HBOS. Financial Conduct Authority boss John Griffith-Jones previously chaired the accountancy firm KPMG, which has been  criticised for giving HBOS a clean bill of health in the run-up to  its collapse. The calls came as David Cameron refused to push for former HBOS chief executive Sir James Crosby to be stripped of his knighthood or demand that his pension be slashed for his disastrous stewardship of the bank. Between 2008 and 2011 Lloyds, which took over HBOS under a  government-backed rescue deal, racked up £46billion of losses from bad loans made by its former rival. Paul Moore, the former head of risk at HBOS who was sacked in 2004 shortly after he raised concerns about the bank’s reckless lending, said: ‘The position of John Griffith-Jones as head of the regulator is clearly untenable. ‘This is the man who chaired a company which failed to check HBOS’s accounts properly.’ Last night the FCA hit back at accusations of a conflict of interest and insisted that Mr Griffith-Jones will not be involved in the regulator’s report into the demise of HBOS, due to be published later this year. The authority said: ‘John Griffith-Jones was subject to a rigorous appointment process by HM Treasury, and had an appointment hearing with the Treasury Select Committee, to assess his suitability for the role.’ KPMG said the firm ‘stands by the quality of its audit’. Downing Street yesterday signalled that the Prime Minister will not intervene over Sir James’s knighthood as he did last year when he called for Fred Goodwin to lose his over the collapse of RBS. Officials said the Government would investigate ways of holding HBOS executives to account, but not until the FCA review and a report by the Insolvency Service are completed in the coming months. Refused: David Cameron has ignored calls for former HBOS chief Sir James Crosby, right, to be stripped of his knighthood after his disastrous stewardship of the bank . Last year Mr Cameron said the Cabinet Office’s Forfeiture Committee, which decides on honours, should look at Sir Fred. But yesterday No 10 said the Prime Minister would not be referring the case of Sir James to the committee. The row will add to a growing fury over his gold-plated pension worth around £700,000 a year. If HBOS had been allowed to go bust, rather than being rescued by Lloyds, he would have received a fraction of this. The Pension Protection Fund, which rescues the pensions of failed firms, sets a cap on how much it will pay workers who have retired early, like Sir James. In 2008 – when HBOS would have gone under – it set a cap of just £24,788 a year for people of his age, then 52, who had taken early retirement.",Call comes as Cameron refused to strip bank's former chief of his knighthood .

A ticket given to a man who was caught driving his car while trying to find his way using the GPS map on his mobile phone has been upheld on appeal. Steven Spriggs was pulled over by California's Highway Patrol and given a ticket for driving with one hand while holding the phone in the other to peer at directions on its map software. He appealed against the ticket, but the punishment was upheld by judges at a California appellate court. Distraction: A man given a ticket for holding . his mobile phone in one hand to use its map function while driving in . California has had his punishment upheld on appeal. (Stock image) Judges ruled that using the GPS or map function on a mobile phone while driving is a moving violation on the same level as sending a text message while driving. Spriggs was cited for 'moving violation section 23123, subdivision (a), driving a motor vehicle while using a wireless phone', on January 5 by California Highway Patrol Officer Jack Graham, according to court documents. At his appeal, heard on April 26, both Spriggs and Officer Graham testified that he was indeed looking at a map on a phone held in his hand while driving. The underlying facts of the case were undisputed, but Spriggs argued that the wording of the statute was not intended to cover using a wireless phone to look at a map. He maintained lawmakers had intended to limit the application to 'conversing' or 'listening and talking' on a mobile. Judges disagreed. The California v. Spriggs ruling reads: 'This case requires us to determine whether using a wireless phone solely for its map application function while driving violates Vehicle Code section 23123. 'We hold that it does.' 'The judgment of conviction is affirmed': The text of the ruling handed down by the Appelate Division of Fresno Superior Court which upheld the punishment of Spriggs . Applying the test of plain language to the letter of the law, the court concluded that 'the primary evil sought to be avoided is the distraction the driver faces when using his or her hands to operate the phone. 'That distraction would be present whether the wireless telephone was being used as a telephone, a GPS navigator, a clock or a device for sending and receiving text messages and emails.' The ruling added: 'This statute ... is specifically designed to prevent a driver from using a wireless telephone while driving unless the device is being used in a hands free manner.

A driver who mowed down two policemen trying to arrest him has been jailed for ten years. Wayne Crompton, 36, was on a six-month driving ban when he knocked over two officers who had stopped him for driving on the wrong side of the road. The officers suffered fractures and are still recovering from the incident which took place in Harpurhey, Manchester, in February this year. PC John McGreggor, 27, sustained three fractures to his skull as Crompton suddenly reversed, knocking him unconscious with the driver’s door. Crompton then shot forward at PC Richard Hayes, 34, who was standing in front of the car, attempting to stop him by using his Taser gun. PC Hayes flew onto the vehicle’s bonnet and was carried for 30 feet before he was thrown off, suffering a broken wrist. Crompton sped from the scene, leaving the two men sprawled on the ground outside a convenience store. Despite his injury, PC Hayes managed to take down the full registration plate of Crompton’s borrowed Hyundai, and was able to call for back-up. The car, belonging to a friend of Crompton’s, could be traced and he was arrested at a house 16 miles away where the car was seized. A warrant had already been issued for Crompton’s arrest in the weeks before the incident after he failed to attend court following a string of other motoring offences. At the time of the incident, Crompton, of Whitefield, Manchester, was serving a six month driving ban which had been imposed in November 2012. Unemployed Crompton, who claims sickness benefits, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent, dangerous driving, aggravated vehicle taking, driving while disqualified and driving with no insurance at a previous hearing at Manchester Crown Court. Sentencing him to ten years in prison today, Judge Andrew Gilbart QC, told him: ‘Two police officers doing their job stopped you. You resented that. ‘You reversed suddenly, knocking Mr McGreggor over. Mr Hayes tried to stop you with a Taser. You drove at him. I have no doubt you used the car as a weapon.’ Dangerous driving: Crompton was stopped outside this shop and as one got out, he reversed, knocking the PC unconscious, before speeding forwards forcing the other officer onto his car bonnet . Crompton, who must serve a minimum of six and a half years, has a lengthy criminal record, including many offences of taking vehicles without consent. He also injured himself in a crash in 2006 when he ploughed into an HGV at high speed, which led to the removal of his spleen. He was jailed in 2007 for assaulting his ex-partner and threatening to set her alight after pouring petrol over her body, the court was told. Judge Gilbart said he was satisfied the defendant was a dangerous offender and imposed an extended licence period of three years on top of his ten-year term. Judge Gilbart also banned Crompton from driving for seven years and ordered him to take an extended test before he could get behind the wheel again. Police plea: A note asking for witnesses to the assault can be seen near the scene in Harpurhey, Manchester . PCs McGreggor and Hayes remain off work, but are said to be recovering. PC McGreggor still has short-term memory loss and faces a long recovery. Manchester Crown Court heard the consequences for both could have been far worse. Detective Inspector Mark Tootill from Greater Manchester Police said after the case: ‘Only Crompton knows what possessed him to react in such a dangerous way. ‘He may well have panicked knowing that he was already banned from driving and was wanted by the police, and in a moment of stupidity deliberately drove at these two officers to flee the scene. ‘As a result, the two officers sustained injuries and needed hospital treatment. This clearly caused their families a great deal of anxiety and distress but thankfully they are both now recovering well at home.","Wayne Crompton was stopped for driving on the wrong side of the road .

Tony Blair yesterday reignited his bitter rivalry with Gordon Brown, boasting he would have done a better job at stopping the Tories from returning to power in 2010. Mr Blair reckoned that had he not been forced to quit as Prime Minister by his then-Chancellor, he would have given David Cameron a ‘run for his money’. Under Mr Brown’s leadership, Labour lost 91 seats at the 2010 general election, clearing the way for Mr Cameron to take the keys to Number 10 as the head of the Tory-Lib Dem coalition. In an interview with Bloomberg Markets, Tony Blair argues that even in 2010 he was more of an electoral asset than Gordon Brown . Tony Blair used an interview to claim the result of the 2010 election would have been 'tighter' if he had not been forced out as Labour leader by Gordon Brown . Mr Blair claims that had he been given the chance to fight a fourth election as Labour leader he could have secured a better result than with Mr Brown at the helm. The remarks, in an interview with Bloomberg Markets magazine, lay bare the tensions which still exist between the two former friends almost five years after Mr Blair quit Number 10. Despite leading Labour to an unprecedented three election victories, his reputation was tarnished by the Iraq War and his leadership was troubled by in-fighting between factions loyal to him or Mr Brown. Mr Blair said: ‘Frankly, if I'd had a fourth election, I would have given Cameron a run for his money. I'm not saying I would have won, but it would have been tighter than it was.’ Friends of Mr Blair argue he would have performed more strongly in the TV leaders’ debates which saw Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg’s popularity soar in the weeks before polling day. Triple whammy: Mr Blair suggested he could have given the Tory leader 'a run for his money' in 2010, which for the first time saw TV debates between the three main party leaders . In the wide-ranging interview Mr Blair also reveals his regret at not being offered the job as president of the European Council, eventually filled by Belgium's Herman Van Rompuy. ‘If the European job had been offered to me, I would have taken it,’ Mr Blair said. ‘But it wasn't.’ He also defended making millions since leaving Downing Street – and quitting the Commons on the same day in June 2007. Mr Blair said: ‘The motivation is not the accumulation of personal wealth. If I'd wanted to do that, I could do it a lot simpler with a lot less time.’ He added: ‘There’s a myth that just because you used to be British prime minister, people give you lots of money to play with. No, they don’t.’ Heir to Blair: David Cameron used to position himself as a natural successor to the Blairite style of politics . Mr Blair, who is thought to have made at least £60million since 2010, went on to defend his decision to work for notorious dictators such as Kazakhstan dictator Nursultan Nazarbayev, whose regime stands accused of human rights abuses. ‘I don’t dismiss the human rights stuff at all,’ Mr Blair said. ‘These are points we make. There’s a whole new generation of administrators there who are reformers, and we’re working with them.’ The former Labour Premier also denied using a complex web of companies to avoid paying tax. Adrian Huston, a former UK tax inspector and director of Belfast, Northern Ireland-based accounting firm, told Bloomberg: ‘There’s no reason to make your life that complicated unless it’s to reduce tax or hide something. The only reason you do all these intervening transactions is to create a smoke screen.’ But Mr Blair insisted he pays ‘full 50 per cent tax’ on all his earnings and has set up interlocking businesses to stop the spotlight falling on his finances. He said: ‘We wanted confidentiality. There’s a section of the media that will go after anyone connected with me, and I can’t operate like that.'","Former Labour Prime Minister claims he could have given David Cameron a 'run for his money'

An 85-year-old shopper repeatedly hugged and groped the breasts of two female Tesco workers while asking where he could find groceries. John Moffatt, who was found guilty of sexual assault, claimed although he 'caressed' his victims' breasts his behaviour was not sexual. But a judge told the former sheet metal worker: 'Touching a breast is not something you do to strangers.' Moffatt had targeted two teenage employees, one who he sexually assaulted three times and her colleague, who he sexually assaulted once at the Tesco in Rossendale, Lancashire. Burnley Magistrates Court heard Moffatt had asked the first worker for a hug and had then groped her, before following her around the store. He then waited at the door when she went into the office to try and get away from him. He persisted, returning to the shop the next day and touching another woman on her waist, after putting his hand inside her unzipped jacket. He had asked her: 'Was it you I was talking to yesterday?' Moffatt, who had been filmed in the store on its CCTV, was caught just over a week later, when he went back into the shop. The hearing was told Moffatt, who is now suffering from prostate cancer, accepted he had touched the victims, but insisted it was not sexual. He claimed he was 'more or less being friendly'. The defendant, of Newchurch, Rossendale, denied four counts of sexual assault on a female on November 21 and 22, but was found guilty by District Judge David Scanlon, who adjourned the case for pre- sentence reports. The judge, who said Moffatt would not face a prison term, said: 'I don't want this to be the start of something.' Moffatt had no previous convictions. Giving evidence, the first victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she was filling shelves when Moffatt asked where the long-life milk was. She said she took him to another aisle and as they crossed the bakery section, he asked for a hug and touched her left breast. The teenager said: 'I was quite scared and shocked. I didn't know what had happened really. I was just panicked by it. I just carried on walking him to where the milk was, because I was in shock. 'I said I was going back to my department and he said: ""Wait, I will walk back with you."" I just waited for him because I didn't know what to do.' Tesco in Rossendale, Lancashire, where the assaults took place . She said Moffatt then started to put his arm around her waist and moved her arm to put it around him. When the defendant said he needed another product, the victim said she couldn't help him and went into the office. Moffatt waited at the door for her. When she returned to the shop floor, Moffatt appeared again, went to hug her and stroked her breast again. She said: 'Obviously, I was more scared then.' The court heard the store's duty manager reported the incident to the police. The victim said: 'I had no physical injuries, but it's made me extremely wary around people. It affected my work at first and I'm just a quite paranoid person now.' John Moffatt pictured on his way to Burnley Magistrates Court, where he was convicted of sexual assault . The court heard that the fourth sexual assault happened the following day. Kristian Cavanagh, for Moffatt, said the defendant accepted he hugged the first woman, was embarrassed about it and accepted he should not have done so. Moffatt told the court he accepted touching her breast, but said it was 'more of a caress'. He said: 'There was no intention of any sex whatsoever. It never crept into my mind at all. I was more or less being friendly.' District Judge Scanlon said of the victims: 'I believe them both implicitly, both in terms of what they say you did and the way it made them feel.' He said he had been struck by the defendant's use of the word caress. He said: 'Caress, to me, is a word that automatically has a sexual connotation. 'Touching a breast is something that people do who have an intimate relationship with each other, or potentially would like an intimate relationship with each other, not to strangers. 'I don't want there to be a repetition of this.'","John Moffatt found guilty of sexual assault while shopping at supermarket .

But with grim wintry weather still blighting much of the country, the duo will have their work cut out to persuade people to abandon plans to go abroad in search of sun. Aardman animators are working on a new TV advert featuring Wallace and Gromit which will form part of a £4million campaign to persuade Brits to holiday at home . Animators at the Oscar-winning studios Aardman are working on a TV advert which will air from next month encouraging people in the UK to consider booking their holidays closer to home. Tourism chiefs at VisitEngland hope Wallace and Gromit will follow in the footsteps of actors Rupert Grint, Stephen Fry and Julia Walters who last year fronted a star-studded drive to persuade more people to not travel abroad. The latest push is part of the cross-government GREAT campaign to promote the UK at home and abroad . The new £4million campaign will see the animated duo take to the road to explore the country and discover the best of the UK.

A senior midwife in an Irish hospital told an Indian woman her dying baby could not be terminated because 'it's a Catholic thing', an inquest heard today. Mrudula Vasealli described the agony of her friend Savita Halappanavar's drawn-out miscarriage after doctors at Galway University Hospital said the foetus could not be saved. She was at the hospital a week later when Mrs Halappanavar died of septicaemia, and told the hearing that the woman's husband Praveen collapsed and vomited in the lobby after he heard the news. Agony: Savita Halappanavar, left, was denied a termination while having a miscarriage because 'it's a Christian thing', according to her friend Mrudula Vasealli, right . Ms Vasealli told Galway Coroner's Court that her friend pleaded for the baby's heartbeat to be stopped when it became clear the child could not survive. 'She said, the midwife, ""We do not do that here dear. It's a Catholic thing,""' she said. 'The nurses were lovely, they took good care of her. It's the system that was wrong.' Mrs Halappanavar died on October 28 last year at the age of 31, sparking international outcry against Ireland's strict abortion laws which some say contributed to her death. 'Somebody said Praveen collapsed,' Ms Vasealli said. 'He was brought to the lobby. He was vomiting there. He couldn't walk.' Devastated: Mrs Halappanavar's husband Praveen, pictured, collapsed and vomited after her death . Mr Halappanavar previously told an inquest that his Hindu wife asked for a termination three times before she finally delivered her dead baby daughter. Consultant obstetrician Katherine Astbury has denied his claims that she refused a termination on the grounds that Ireland is 'a Catholic country'. Ms Vasealli spent the day with Mrs Halappanavar five days before her death as Praveen drove his parents-in-law to Dublin Airport. She said in her statement: 'Savita was very upset again because the foetal heartbeat was still there. 'She cried, saying: ""What kind of mother am I waiting for my own baby to stop its heartbeat? I'm losing it, I'm losing it terribly.""' Couple: Mr and Mrs Halappanavar at an event for the Indian community in the Irish town of Galway . She told coroner Ciaran MacLoughlin that her friend wept continuously as a midwife checked again for a heartbeat. 'We both, Savita and I, asked if there was a possibility of saving the baby because there was still a heartbeat after three days,' she said. 'Savita said, ""Can you please save it. If you can't do something to stop the foetal heartbeat, I can't take this waiting for the baby to die.""' It is unclear who the midwife on duty at the time was, but hospital officials said their 'best guess' was that it was clinical midwife manager Ann Maria Burke, who will now be called to testify at the inquest. Hospital: Doctors at Galway University Hospital are accused of negligence after the patient's death . Mrs Halappanavar carried the baby until October 24, but by that night she was in critical condition in intensive care, where she died four days later from septicaemia. Earlier family friend Dr Rupanjali Kundu, a senior house officer in obstetrics at the hospital, said she visited Mrs Halappanavar on the Monday and Wednesday when she noticed a significant change in her health. 'She was lying on the bed and she was unable to speak that much,' she said. 'She looked really ill. It was a significant change.'

President Obama today spoke out strongly for gun control legislation, saying that the heated debate ‘shouldn’t be about politics.’ Speaking from the University of Hartford Monday evening, the president pointed out the alarming frequency of mass shootings, not only in nearby Newtown, but across the country – in Aurora, Colorado, Tucson, Arizona, and Virginia Tech, adding that the December 14 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School was the ‘toughest day of my presidency.’ ‘Now’s the time to push back on fear and frustration and misinformation,’ he said. ‘I’m asking everyone listening today to find where your member of Congress stands on this,’ asking what is more important than keeping children safe. ‘Shouldn’t we be taking that step?’ Scroll down for video . Remember the victims: Obama delivers remarks on measures to reduce gun violence at the University of Hartford in Connecticut today, saying people must hold their congressmen accountable . Never forget: Mr Obama was introduced by Nicole Hockley and her husband Ian, right; the Hockleys lost their son Dylan in the school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown . Pause: The president said again in Monday's speech that December 14, the day of the Sandy Hook shooting, was the most difficult day in his presidency . The president, who is in Connecticut as part of an initiative to urge Congress to act on gun control legislation and mandatory background checks that he says 90 percent of Americans support. He met privately with some of the Sandy Hook victims’ families ahead of his speech, and plans to bring 11 family members back with him to Washington on Air Force One later tonight, allowing them to meet with senators in Washington about the legislation. Twenty first graders and six educators were killed on the December 14 shooting at the elementary school, where the entire massacre took less than five minutes. In his speech, the president singled out GOP lawmakers who want to use procedural maneuvers to block legislation, something that the president said was akin to saying the voice of the public doesn’t matter. In his 20 minute address, Mr Obama proclaimed his support for the stricken Connecticut town. ‘Newtown, we want you to know that we’re here with you,’ he said. ‘We will not walk away from the promises we’ve made. We are as determined as ever to do what must be done. In fact, I’m here to ask you to help me show that we can get it done. We’re not forgetting.’ Comforter in chief: Left, Obama hugs a woman at the gymnasium at the University of Hartford; right, he hugs Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy upon his arrival at Bradley Air National Guard Base ahead of the speech . Grief: Families of Newtown children listen as President Barack Obama speaks, all wearing green ribbons in remembrance . The people united: At one point during the president's address, members of the audience chanted, 'We want a vote, we want a vote!' A group of Sandy Hook families originally planned to travel to Washington earlier on Monday, but the White House offered to give the families a ride so they could also attend Obama's speech before their lobbying push. The families' trip was organized by Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit started by community members in the wake of the shooting. 'The group is encouraging senators to come together around legislative proposals that will both save lives and respect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans,' the group said in a statement. Mr Obama teared up when speaking of six-year-old Dylan Hockley, one of the 20 students slaughtered on December 14 when describing how his mother, Nicole Hockley, said that she asks her dead son every night to visit her in her dreams every night so she can see him. 'If there’s even one thing we can do to prevent a father from having to bury his child, isn’t that worth fighting for?’ he asked. In his emotionally-charged speech, the president specified that he doesn’t want to ban guns, only make sure that background checks are mandatory so that the weapons don’t get into the wrong hands. A sister's sadness: Karlee Soto, center, whose sister Victoria Soto was killed in the school shooting, cries during Mr Obama's speech . Sombre: People listen during the president's speech wearing green to show their support . ‘Shouldn’t we make it harder, not easier, for someone who’s been convicted of domestic abuse, to get his hands on a gun? Turns out 90 percent of Americans support universal background check,’ he said. At one point in the president’s speech, audience members in the packed university gymnasium began chanting, ‘We want a vote, we want a vote.’ 'This is not about politics. This is about the families who are here who were torn apart by gun violence. That's what it's about.' Amid the chanting, Mr Obama said: ‘This is not about politics. This is about the families who are here who were torn apart by gun violence. That’s what it’s about.’ The president further argued that lawmakers in Washington owe it to the victims of gun violence, including those killed at Sandy Hook, to pass the legislation, which would ban magazines containing over 10 rounds and put a ban on assault weapons. Mr Obama said that while nearly everyone present for this year’s State of the Union Address stood to applause his stance on gun control, some members of Congress were singing a different tune once the cameras had turned off and the news trucks had left. On a wing and a prayer: Mr Obama, left, follows family members of children killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, into Air Force One following his speech . All you need is love: Nelba Marquez-Greene, mother of 6-year-old Ana, holds sign as she walks up the steps of Air Force One . ‘If our history teaches us anything, then it’s up to us, the people, to stand up to those who say we can’t or we won’t. Stand up to the change we need,’ he said. The president rode to the University of Hartford with Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who signed sweeping gun control legislation into law last Thursday, again with Sandy Hook families in attendance. A successful vote passing the legislation would require 60 votes to pass, which is a difficult maneuver in an 100-member Senate. The legislation’s opposition, which includes some Republican members of Congress, claims that the bill would impose on Second Amendment rights.

More than 100 Coldstream Guardsmen protecting the Queen at Windsor Castle have contracted scabies – a disease that has not affected the British Army on such a scale since the Korean War. The outbreak of the highly contagious condition, in which tiny mites lay eggs under the skin causing severe itching, was reported after the guardsmen returned from a military exercise in Germany. Last night Royal sources insisted that none of the infected troops had come into direct contact with the Royal Family or the public. Under attack! The Coldstream Guards marching at Windsor Castle. The scabies outbreak happened after they returned from Germany . The Queen is the regiment’s Colonel-in-Chief and the guardsmen live a few hundred yards from Windsor Castle. Every day, immaculately dressed in red tunics and bearskins, they march to the castle from Victoria Barracks to perform the Changing of the Guard – a spectacle watched by crowds of tourists. A Ministry of Defence investigation is focusing on the guardsmen’s movements in the weeks leading up to the outbreak. Meanwhile, their bedding and clothing have been removed and they have been issued with special ‘anti-scabicide’ cream. Scabies is an irritable skin infection caused by tiny parasitic mites that burrow into the skin and lay eggs. Easily passed from one person to another through close body contact, the mites – known as sarciotes scabiei – normally affect the hands, genitals, abdomen, feet and ankles. They can also be passed on through clothing, bedding and towels. The mites are too small to be seen with the naked eye and signs of infection include intense itching and a red rash. Treatment is simple and essential. Permethrin cream or malathion lotion must be applied to the affected areas. Everyone in a household – as well as any sexual partners – must also be treated. Scabies is usually contracted in highly unhygienic environments. Once the minuscule mites have laid their dozens of eggs, there is a two- to six-week incubation period, after which lesions appear on the victim’s arms, hands, torso and genitalia. A guardsman said: ‘The Coldstreamers were on an exercise in Germany and must have been lying in a polluted ditch or something. Now the boys are rubbing in scabicide cream like there’s no tomorrow. Everyone is using it – not just the 120 confirmed cases. More than 500 guardsmen are affected. ‘All this is pretty embarrassing for us, and the other Guards regiments are having a great laugh. Beds have been stripped, clothes lockers emptied and offices fumigated. In all my years in the Guards Division I haven’t heard of anything like this.’ Precautions are also being taken in London, where the regiment’s junior soldiers, belonging to Number 7 Company, are based at Wellington Barracks. Scabies was rife during the First World War but has been less common since then because of improved personal hygiene and healthcare. Though the disease has affected prisons in Afghanistan, there have been no major outbreaks involving British soldiers there. Army: The Coldstream Guardsmen are based a few hundred yards from Windsor Castle and perform the Changing of the Guard outside each day . The last time the disease affected a large number of British troops is believed to have been during the conflict in Korea from 1950 to 1953. Coldstream sources told The Mail on Sunday that when the outbreak was identified, the regiment’s medical staff advised that all military training involving bodily contact should cease until the scabies was eradicated. Despite that, many guardsmen then took part in exercises at a training centre at Lydd in Kent, after which the outbreak continued. Last night, the Ministry of Defence said that accommodation used by the guardsmen at Lydd was now being deep-cleaned. A spokesman insisted, however, that the regiment’s Commanding Officer had followed medical advice. The soldiers who caught scabies later had received written advice based on national guidance and practices suggested by the Thames Valley Health Protection Agency. Culprit: A scabies mite which irritates the skin. They can be passed on through clothing, bedding and towels . A week ago the MoD confirmed that 120 guardsmen had contracted scabies. Yesterday 65 were still affected. The Coldstream Guards is the British Army’s oldest regiment in continuous service, having been raised by General George Monck in 1650. The regiment’s motto is ‘nulli secundus’, meaning ‘second to none’, and the guardsmen have seen service in all major conflicts, most recently in Iraq and Afghanistan. The regiment’s most famous former officers include ex-SAS commander General Sir Michael Rose. Its current crop includes Captain John Scarlett – son of former MI6 chief Sir John Scarlett – who was recently awarded a Military Cross for outstanding gallantry in Helmand, Afghanistan. Last night, Buckingham Palace declined to comment but an MoD spokesman said: ‘A small number of cases of scabies have been identified at Victoria Barracks. ‘The unit has arranged for specialist cleaning of bedding and clothing, and a deep-clean of living and work areas. Personnel will be fit to return to duties 24 hours after their first treatment. There is an ongoing investigation. However, it may not be possible to find out how or where the initial cases were infected.’","Coldstream Guardsmen live a few hundred yards from the Queen at Windsor .

Six insurgents, including two senior Taliban leaders, were killed in the attack, the Interior Ministry said. Scroll down for video . The woman and children died in the Nato air strike in Afghanistan's Kunar province (file picture) The Interior Ministry did not mention any civilian casualties but Wasefullah Wasefi, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said civilian homes had been hit during an air attack. 'Eleven children and a woman were killed when an air strike hit their houses,' Wasefi said. Mohammad Zahir Safai, the Shigal district chief, said the woman and the children were killed when the houses collapsed on them. A spokesman for the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) said they were aware of reports of civilian casualties and were assessing the incident. He said: 'No Isaf personnel were involved on the ground, but Isaf provided fire support from the air, killing several insurgents. 'We are also aware of reports of several civilians injured from the engagement, but no reports of civilian deaths. Isaf takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously, and we are currently assessing the incident. 'The air support was called in by coalition forces - not Afghans - and was used to engage insurgent forces in areas away from structures, according to our reporting.' Tribal elder Haji Malika Jan told the BBC that fighting began early on Saturday and lasted for at least seven hours. Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, pictured with David Cameron, banned Afghan troops from calling for air strikes after anger about the number of civilian casualties from such operations . A Reuters journalist said they saw the bodies of 11 children when they were taken to Safai's office in protest by their families and other villagers on Sunday. The journalist did not see the body of a women and Safai said residents told him of the death. Women's bodies are not displayed, according to custom. Wasefi also said an American civilian adviser to the Afghan intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security, had also been killed in the operation. He said it had lasted several hours. The Ministry of Interior said the two dead Taliban commanders, Ali Khan and Gul Raouf, planned and organised attacks in Kunar. Civilian deaths have been a long-running source of friction between Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who banned Afghan troops from calling for air strikes. About ten women and children were killed in February last year in a Nato air strike in the same area of Afghanistan.

Network Rail, who run the railway tracks, receive £4billion in public funding each year. The news will infuriate commuters and train travellers facing huge hikes in rail fares for an 'inadequate service', in which trains are often overcrowded and more than 40 per cent do not arrive on time. Bonus: Four top Network Rail bosses have been awarded bonuses totalling more than £600,000 . The long-term incentive plan payments, including £168,000 to finance director Patrick Butcher, come at a time when rail regulators have been critical of Network Rail's performance on the railways. Under the plan, network operations managing director Robin Gisby and infrastructure projects managing director Simon Kirby both get £158,400, while group strategy director Paul Plummer picks up £148,400. The payments, reflecting the company's . performance in the period 2009-12, could have been higher but National Rail said 20 . per cent had been cut 'to take account of specific safety and train . performance issues.' David Sidebottom, passenger director at Passenger Focus, said: . 'Passengers are not interested in salaries and bonuses given to industry figures. What is important to them is that they can rely on their service to get them in on time, and that their ticket is good value for money. It's up to Network Rail to justify performance-related bonuses by working with operators to deliver an on-time railway and to continue to drive down the costs of this.' Top bosses: The long-term incentive plan payments, including £168,000 to finance director Patrick Butcher. right, and £158,400 to network operations managing director Robin Gisby . Network Rail executives are some of the highest paid in the public sector, as the head of its remuneration committee admitted at a meeting in December. But non-executive director Graham Eccles stressed that they remain in the 'lower quartile' of private sector organisations, and the company needs to be able to attract and retain top employees. The news comes after Network Rail bosses gave up their bonuses last year, amid pressure to reduce high payouts at a time of public sector austerity. Punctuality: The blue line shows what proportion of trains arrive on time month-by-month; the red line shows a moving annual average; and the green line shows the trains arriving within one minute of schedule (i.e. not precisely on time) Network Rail also said that the payments would be phased, with 60 per cent paid now and the balance to be reviewed at the end of the 2013/14 financial year. The company added that the award had been delayed by a year. Claims: Network Rail chairman Richard Parry-Jones said: 'The railway today is considerably more efficient than in 2009' The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) has repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with Network Rail's performance, particularly on long-distance routes. Of late there have been a series of overhead line problems that have caused serious delays on some busy routes, including the East Coast main line where trains-on-time figures have fallen. Network Rail said today that under the terms of the 2009 long-term incentive plan (LTIP), the four directors had qualified for a 100 per cent payout. However, the company’s remuneration committee had decided to reduce the award by 20 per cent. Of this figure, 10 per cent reflected 'workforce safety, level crossing safety and enforcement notices over the period' while the other 10 per cent took into account the fact that train performance targets were not met. Network Rail pointed out that during the period 2009-12 it had the cut the cost of running the railway by £1.6 billion and achieved £526 million in incremental savings above the ORR’s original target. The number of passengers arriving on time had risen 13 per cent and projects worth £12 billion had been completed. Network Rail chairman Richard Parry-Jones said: 'The railway today is considerably more efficient, carries more passengers and freight, and is in a much better state than it was in 2009. 'Taxpayers have benefited from very significant savings, with a further £526 million saved over and above our tough targets. Passengers have benefited not just from more trains, but also more of those trains arriving on time. And we have made real progress in renewing our Victorian legacy. ' He went on: 'Not everything has been perfect - and the 20 per cent reduction we have made reflects that. But it would be flying in the face of reality not to acknowledge the real progress NR has made in this period, and these payments reflect and recognise that success.' Network Rail's chief executive Sir David Higgins was not eligible for any LTIP bonus as he was not with the company in 2009. Network Rail which is responsible for track, signalling and some stations, is a not-for-dividend company. Last year transport secretary Justine Greening ratcheted up the pressure saying she would attend the rail giants annual members' meeting in an attempt to shame directors into abandoning plans for hefty payouts . It is effectively a public company in that it has no shareholders and its debt is guaranteed by the Government. As of March 31 2012 Sir David was on an annual basic salary of £560,000 while Mr Butcher was on £382,000. Mr Gisby and Mr Kirby were both on £360,000. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: 'This is rewarding failure on a grand scale. For the second year running, NR have missed their punctuality targets and still awarded themselves massive long-term bonuses. 'The timing looks like Tom Kelly (former Number 10 press secretary and now NR head of PR) has lost little of his ability to try to bury bad news. He has used the arrangements for Mrs Thatcher's funeral as a cover to try to avoid passenger outrage. 'As passengers faced a 4.2% fare increase in January, they will be puzzled why the people who cannot make their trains on time are rewarding themselves with taxpayers' money. This is yet another Great Train Robbery.' In February 2012 the Network Rail directors rejected bonus payments worth up to £20million and instead offered the money to be spent on safety improvements. The decision was taken after they faced growing pressure to turn down the payouts in the wake of the row over bonuses for banking staff. Each of the six board members was entitled to receive up to 60 per cent of their annual salary as a bonus - which could have amounted to £1.39million. Over the next three years the total bonus package they could have received would have been £20million. Last year transport secretary Justine Greening ratcheted up the pressure by saying she would take the unprecedented step of attending the rail giant’s annual ‘members’ meeting’ in an attempt to shame directors into abandoning plans for hefty payouts.","Network Rail receive £4billion in public funding each year .

He's fallen out with several family members, been forced to move out of the ancestral home set on a 4,500 acre estate, and has been claiming £71-a-week Jobseeker's Allowance. But now the Earl of Cardigan is embroiled in a fresh drama - he is in a row with his uncle and a gamekeeper who he claims set up illegal snares on the family's land. The Earl has made a criminal complaint and said his dog Lucy 'suffered an appalling injury' when her leg became trapped in one of the devices. Family estate: Lord Cardigan, pictured outside Tottenham House on the Savernake Forest estate, has accused his uncle and a gamekeeper of setting illegal snares . His uncle Lord Charles Brudenell-Bruce and gamekeeper Peter Tilley strongly deny the allegations. Lord Cardigan has put up warnings to dog walkers about the snares across Savernake Forest, in Wiltshire, which has been owned by the family for the last 1,000 years. It is the latest drama in the life of the 60-year-old Old Etonian who has fallen out with his father, his son and has barely spoken to his daughter Bo Bruce, who starred on The Voice, since 2005. He has been forced to move out of Tottenham House - the Grade  I-listed, 19th-century Palladian mansion with even older gardens laid out by the famed landscaper Capability Brown - on the Savernake Estate. Snare: Lord Cardigan claims that his dog Lucy was injured by a snare (file photo) The Earl has most recently been working on and off as a delivery driver for a company that provides items to private jets at Heathrow Airport, using his family name David Brudenell-Bruce. On a typical day, he’ll be sent to a store such as Harrods to pick up caviar and other select goods, then drive to the tarmac at Heathrow. In recent years he has been prosecuted for assault and criminal damage and has gone through a messy divorce with his first wife. The fresh snare drama was sparked when his dog injured herself in the forest and the Earl spotted several more traps. He has asked Wiltshire Police to charge Lord Brudenell-Bruce and Mr Tilley under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1982. A spokesman for the force confirmed that the incident was under investigation. 'Wiltshire Police have received a complaint regarding the use of snares on the Savernake Estate,' he said. 'Our rural crime officers attended the area and now investigating this matter to ascertain the legality of the traps and where they were positioned.' The Earl said that his dog had been very badly injured by a snare. 'My dog Lucy suffered an appalling injury to her leg in a snare. I found them close to my house,' he told the Daily Express.'They were near to a pheasant rearing pen. My uncle is responsible for the good conduct of the shoot in the forest.' Family feud: The Voice star Bo Bruce has barely spoken to her father, the Earl of Cardigan, since 2005 when her parents divorced . Gamekeeper Peter Tilley said that all the snares were legal. Old Etonian David Brudenell-Bruce is descendant of the 7th Earl who famously led the disastrous British cavalry charge of the 600 in 1854 against the Russians in the Crimean War. Their title goes back to 1611 when James I created the Baronetage of England and offered titles to 200 men to help with the settlement of Ireland. They have lived on the same estate in Wiltshire for 1,000 years. They rode 'into the jaws of Death, into the mouth of Hell', wrote Tennyson in his poem commemorating the suicidal attack. An appalling series of misunderstandings led to the Brigade advancing down a different valley from the one commander-in-chief, Lord Raglan, had intended when he dictated ambiguous orders for Lord Lucan, the cavalry commander. Despite the fact that the order seemed to demand the cavalry to attack the Russian artillery without infantry support - in contravention of all accepted laws of military practice - an incredulous Lucan passed the instructions on to the Earl of Cardigan, who commanded the Light Brigade, and the troops advanced. 664 men took part and 110 were left dead. 'I have been a keeper in the forest for 44 years and I have an unblemished record. These allegations are rubbish but I find them quite upsetting considering the efforts I have put in over those years,' he told The Times. 'All my snares are legal and I left them closed when that pen went out of use. I first heard about these leaflets three of four weeks ago and they had my telephone number on them.' Lord Charles has not commented. The Earl has been involved in a court dispute with the two trustees of Savernake who control his family's estate by managing its assets and finances. He has a 49 per cent share in it, while his son Thomas, Viscount Savernake, owns 51 per cent. The Earl appointed the trustees — one of whom was a trusted friend of more than 30 years — several years ago to help him manage the estate’s complex affairs. But now the he says the trustees are refusing to give him access to his own money. His dispute with the trustees goes . back to April 2011, when he returned from a self-imposed exile in . America with his new bride to discover that the trustees had removed . around 25 valuable paintings from Savernake Lodge, against his wishes. They . intended to sell them, they said, to fund his divorce settlement from . his first wife Rosamond, Countess of Cardigan. A desperate legal battle . by the Earl to have the  portraits returned was unsuccessful, and most . have now been sold. Since . his return, he says the trustees have refused to give him a penny from . the estate. Last October, he launched a fresh claim at the High Court to . seek the removal and replacement of the trustees. Family home: Lord Cardigan pictured with his second wife Joanne, Lady Cardigan, has been forced to move out of Tottenham House and has been claiming Jobseeker's Allowance . The case has yet to be heard but the trustees deny any wrongdoing and are defending the Earl’s claim. Understandably, . given the background, relations between the Earl and trustees are . extremely tense. One of them, John Moore, has made a number of . complaints to the police against the Earl, which has resulted in Lord . Cardigan making several appearances at court. The most recent was in January at . Swindon Crown Court, on a charge of criminal damage and theft at . Savernake. The Earl denied damaging six pheasant feeders, worth £66, and . the theft of a battery and electrical power unit, worth £80. No . prosecution evidence was offered and the Earl agreed to be bound over to . keep the peace for 12 months. A . few days beforehand the Earl was acquitted of assaulting Mr Moore, who . had accused him of spitting at him and waving a stick in his face.

The name says it all: For more than 70 years the soldiers of Britain’s Parachute Regiment have been prepared to risk their all by dropping into the toughest of war zones. But now cost cutting means the Paras will no longer be trained to use their chutes, the Mail on Sunday can reveal. The regiment, whose most famous sortie during the Second World War was immortalised in the film A Bridge Too Far, has been targeted by Ministry of Defence accountants keen to reduce budgets. Skyfall: Paratroopers shown here dropping from a Hercules will no longer be trained to use their chutes due to MOD cost cutting measures . Until now, all recruits joining the 1,500-strong regiment have undergone intensive parachute training, including a requirement to complete eight jumps before being considered ready for battle. Soldiers have had to do at least two refresher jumps each year of their service to ensure that they remain fully trained for drops behind enemy lines. Now, just a handful of recruits will receive parachute training and hundreds of more experienced Paratroopers will not do the annual jumps required to keep them battle-ready. Revealed: Former Parachute Regiment officer Dan Jarvis, now a Labour MP, said that parachuting is being phased out . Former Parachute Regiment officer Dan Jarvis, now a Labour MP, revealed that parachuting is being phased out and in future most recruits will not see a chute or receive specialist airborne training. Jarvis, who led paratroops in battles against the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2007 to 2008, said: ‘Our paratroopers in the second and third battalions, 2 Para and 3 Para, cannot jump any more because they are being denied training and resources. 'Every year there used to be huge parachuting exercises with around 800 paratroopers jumping together. 'Now only 80 troops are jumping in these exercises. Parachute training is being phased out to nothing.’ Senior military figures condemned the reduction in parachute training, arguing that recent operations by French and US forces have proved the value of paratroops. On January 29 this year, 200 French . paratroopers were dropped over the war-torn African state of Mali. They . landed at night, forcing Islamist rebels to relinquish control of . Timbuktu airport. And last . year US troops launched several missions into isolated areas of . Afghanistan by parachute to avoid Taliban forces who were ready to . ambush any soldiers travelling by road. Former . Chief of the General Staff General Sir Mike Jackson said: ‘Parachuting . should remain an essential capability in Britain’s defence because . dropping troops from fixed wing aircraft gives you strategic options . beyond that which can be achieved by helicopter. Paratroopers can operate effectively at night and can surprise enemy on the ground.’ Lieutenant . General Sir Hew Pike, who commanded 3 Para in the Falklands War added: . ‘For as long as the government states that it wishes to retain a . parachute capability they should bloody well pay for it. Celebrated: The Parachute Regiment's most famous sortie during the Second World War was immortalised in the film 'A Bridge Too Far' starring Sean Connery . 'Stopping recruits from completing their parachute training is completely unacceptable.’ MoD strategists point to the fact that the Parachute Regiment has not mounted a large-scale parachute drop for more than half a century. The last such mission was during the Suez Crisis of 1956. Last night an MoD spokesman admitted that the Army has reduced the size of the parachute force on short notice to 80 men. He added that parachute training had never formed part of basic training for Parachute Regiment recruits. The move coincides with the phased withdrawal of the RAF’s main transport aircraft, the Hercules – used by Paras for their jumps.","Parachute Regiment recruits will not undergo intensive training .

The film shows the spooked horse turning and kicking out in fright, catching his owner above her left eye with a sickening thud. She was left with blood pouring from a gash above her eye, and the muscles needed to be stitched back together. Scroll down for video .

Yesterday she said the incident at . her home in Brecon, Mid Wales, had not put her off riding, although she . will have to wait another week before she returns to the saddle because . of a risk of infection to her wound. She said: 'I didn't really know what had happened at first, I just saw . blood trickling down my face and my head was really, really sore,' she said, adding that a family friend who came to her aid thought she had 'walked into a horror film'. 'There was blood everywhere,' said Rosie. 'If I hadn't been wearing my riding hat, I would have been a lot more seriously injured, if not dead. 'I didn't always used to wear it when I was riding Luke, but I will from now on. 'Amazing bond': The student, from South Wales, said she would 'never' let getting injured put her off riding .

And the student is already keen to get back in the saddle after her accident last Monday. 'I'm most upset that I can't see my horses for a week, because of the risk of infection,' she said. 'I love my horses and getting injured is a risk I have to take. I'd never let it put me off.

"By . Mike Jaccarino . PUBLISHED: . 15:57 EST, 7 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:15 EST, 8 January 2013 . A hardworking immigrant who won $1 million on the Illinois Lottery last summer died of a lethal dose of cyanide poisoning the day after receiving the check for his winnings. Urooj Khan, 46, paid $60 for two lottery scratch-off tickets at Goreel's, a 7-11 convenience store in Chicago in June, and, upon scratching the second one, reportedly leaped in the air and shouted, 'I hit a million!' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The American dream: Khan emigrated to the U.S. from India during the 1980s and had opened a string of dry cleaning shops in his Chicago neighborhood. He bought this $1million scratch-off winner just before his death . Fateful purchase: Khan spent $60 in June on two Illinois state lottery tickets. The second one of which proved to be a winning ticket . Khan had apparently forsworn lotto after a trip to the Middle East in 2010, but broke down to buy the tickets at this Chicago 7-11 last June . Days later, with his wife and daughter at his side at the same convenience store, Khan gleefully - and fatefully - accepted an oversized, mock check from lottery officials. At the time, he said he was going to utilize the money to pay bills, donate to St. Jude's Children's Hospital and grow his dry-cleaning business. After taxes, the prize money amounted to $425,000 and Khan received his check a month after his win on July 19. Khan went to work as normal the next day, but that night he woke up screaming in excruciating pain. His frantic widow, Shabana Ansari, and daughter rushed to his side. The stricken Khan was taken to St. Francis Hospital in Evanston, where doctors pronounced him dead. Khan's death was initially attributed to natural causes and his body was laid to rest at Rosehill Cemetery. Entrepreneur: Khan emigrated to the U.S. during the 1980s, and had saved enough to open three dry cleaning shops (pictured) on Chicago's Far North side . But within a week of Khan's death an unidentified relative phoned the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office and asked investigators to take another look. ‘They had concerns that it was deemed a natural cause of death and . wanted us to look harder,’ Medical Examiner Dr. Stephen Cina told NBC Chicago. When his investigators conducted comprehensive toxicology tests, they found lethal levels of cyanide. 'It is a very lethal drug,' Cina said. 'It’s a chemical poison. It . basically asphyxiates you at the biochemical level, so a little goes a . long way.' The Chicago Police Department is now treating Khan's death as a homicide and is considering exhuming his body. Khan emigrated to the U.S. during the 1980s, and through hard work and discipline, saved sufficiently to open first one and eventually three dry cleaning shops in Chicago. The day after receiving a check for his winnings, Khan awoke screaming in pain in his bed at his Chicago home (pictured) No signs of foul play: An initial autopsy on Khan performed by the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office found nothing awry . He opened the first of his stores in 2004 on a stretch of roadway known for its Indian and Pakistani restaurants, bakeries and bazaars. The hardworking Khan personally oversaw the day-to-day operations at all three shops, which counted 10 employees. If a worker called in sick, Khan reportedly often handled cleaning and delivery duties in the employee's stead. 'By God's grace, he was a workaholic,' his widow Shabana Ansari told The Chicago Tribune. 'Day or night ... he picks up the phone 24/7. 'He made the clients happy by doing his job. He could not be everywhere, but he had to be everywhere.' The very fact that he bought the winning lottery ticket represents an ironic - and fateful - misfortune. The Tribune reports that after a 2010 Islamic pilgrimage to the Middle East, Khan forswore his foible for playing the lotto. But he apparently momentarily lost his will when he purchased the two scratch tickets during the summer. A good man: The cashier at the 7-11 where Khan bought his fateful lotto tickets said Khan was a 'gentle' man and a 'nice person' who cared for his family . 'It's sad. It's very sad. But I guess it's true when they say that money is the root of all evil,' a cashier at the 7-11 told WGNtv.com. 'He was very nice. I would never think that anybody, especially around him and in the family, would hurt him,' the cashier added. 'He was a nice person, very helpful, very gentle, a hardworking person. I mean, in a short time, he came and managed to have three businesses. That tells you what kind of person he was for his family.' Khan's widow, for her part, refused to be interviewed by The Tribune about her husband's homicide, other than to say she had cooperated with authorities. Shabana Ansari, 32, to whom Khan was married for 12 years, told the paper, though that he was, 'extraordinary, nice, kind and lovable.' He was, she said, 'the best husband on the entire planet.'","Urooj Khan of Chicago's Far North Side won the prize in June and received his winnings a month later .

The Real Housewives of Orange County's Vicki Gunvalson and Teen Mom Farrah Abraham are among the celebrities who have been showing off noticeably more defined jawlines. Last year, the American Society of Plastic Surgery reported that the 'chinplant' was the fastest-growing cosmetic surgery procedure. Gunvalson reportedly got her chin tweaked as part of an $8,000 'breakover' surgical overhaul following her divorce from ex-husband Donn. Chin up: Real Housewife Vicki Gunvalson pictured in 2010 (left), and with her new look post-surgery in March (right), which included a chin implant as well as fillers around her nose and eyes. Countless other stars are rumored to have been nipped and tucked below the nose. Sarah Palin's daughter Bristol emerged . with a much more prominent chin after jaw surgery. She never confirmed . an implant, but experts say that procedures to correct bite problems, . rhinoplasty and/or facial liposuction can be performed at the same . time. So why is the surgery becoming so popular? A strong chin is traditionally a sign of strength and success. Many people want to balance their face to look better onscreen, whether that involves reality TV or video conferencing at work. Cautionary . tale: Heidi Montag, pictured here in late 2012, had 10 surgeries in 2009 that included chin augmentation . and a brow lift. She has since expressed regret about the multiple operations .

'A weak chin makes an aging face look older, and we most commonly see . this in women,' explains New York plastic surgeon Dr David Rapaport. 'We get jowls.' So which celebrity has the most-wanted chin? Browsing through plastic . surgery blogs, Angelina Jolie's angular profile is a favorite - there . are dozens of online debates devoted to whether or not she has had work . done below the nose. When Pacific Plastic Surgery Group compiled a list of their five . most requested celebrity body parts, Jennifer Lopez, Keira . Knightly and Halle Berry's chins were at the top. But for potential . patients, it's not as simple as walking in with a Mr Potato Head . profile and asking for the Christina Hendricks cleft. 'Each patient is . completely unique. It's about blending the lower face with the rest of . the face. It's like art,' Dr Rapaport explains. Implants can either be temporary - where . surgeons inject fillers such as Radiesse or the patent's own fat - or . permanent with silicone. Coveted chins: Plastic surgery blogs rave about Angelina Jolie's bone structure (left), while others want Christina Hendrick's cleft and definition (right) Most-wanted: Halle Berry, Keira Knightly and Jennifer Lopez's chins were all at the top of Pacific Plastic Surgery Group's most-requested body parts . The injectables can last up to a year - longer than, for example, a shot of Botox - but patients will have to come back for top-ups. Surgeons can also saw down the bone to make a chin smaller.The important thing, doctors stress, is that the face stays in balance. Shortly after her full-body makeover that involved ten surgeries, Heidi Montag said that her chin was her 'favorite'. She later said that she regretted having so much work done.

And ever since 20-year-old Cara caught the world's attention walking in forty shows over London Fashion Week, there has been a boom in semi-permanent cosmetic eyebrow-thickening treatments. One such clinic that offers the service to emulate Cara's big-brows look has been fully-booked for the past two months, with orders for the treatment up 200 per cent on the previous year.

And with Season 5 of Made In Chelsea . hitting our screens next Monday, central character Binky Felstead has jumped on the power brow bandwagon in order to look her best for the show's big comeback. The 22-year-old star has recently had the Power Brow treatment at Debra Robson LDN clinic in Harley Street  in order to get more definition and depth after seeing Cara at London Fashion Week. Binky said: 'I love the look that Cara Delevingne has got and I’m really pleased that strong brows are back in again. I’m thrilled with the results of my Power Brow treatment.' An over-arched, over plucked eyebrow not only dates your look - it ages you too. That . is why, reports the clinic, the number of women . seeking to enhance their brows has surged in recent months. Before and after: Binky is thrilled with her new eyebrows and is sure to turn some heads in the new episodes . Binky added: 'The great strength of the Power Brow is that it looks totally natural even close up because the brows are built up using hundreds of individual hair strokes. 'In the past I have beefed up my eyebrows with an eye-pencil but this can be very time consuming on a daily basis and even then doesn’t always have the intensity or the staying power that I’m looking for. 'So I’ve enlisted the help of semi-permanent make-up artist Debra Robson.' The procedure itself takes about 30 minutes, and Debra talked it through with Binky and precisely measured the shape and angle of her brows so that the finished result would be symmetrical and the perfect proportions for her face. An anaesthetic cream had been applied to her brows before they started deciding the shape of them. It took 15 minutes for the cream to take effect, and during that time Debra created a custom-blended pigment for the hair strokes which is a perfect match for your hair, eye and skin colour. Speaking after the treatment, Binky said: 'I could barely feel a thing. 'It was amazing and I was really overjoyed with the results. You can see the improvement in the before and after pictures. 'In the 'before' the start of the brow near my nose is thin and it gets very messy and sparse at the peak and there are wispy bits at the tail of the brow, whereas my new Power Brow is stronger and frames the eye beautifully.'

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 17:12 EST, 2 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:14 EST, 2 April 2013 . 'People used to ask, when are you getting married?' Shelly Crocker says, leaning across the table at a north Seattle donut shop next to her wife, Sandy Kibort, and their daughter, Emma Kibort-Crocker. 'I always told them, ""Well, the entire state of Washington has to vote on it first.""' Ms Crocker and Ms Kibort got that nod in November. Two months after Washington voters approved Referendum 74, the couple were legally wed in their synagogue. Same-sex wedding: Shelly Crocker (second left) and Sandy Kibort (second right) had a Jewish ceremony in Seattle, Washington, on January 13, accompanied by their daughters, Emma (left) and Hannah (right) High school sweethearts originally from . Minneapolis, Ms Kibort and Ms Crocker had first been joined in a commitment . ceremony in 1984, but waited to legally marry until they could do so in . their own state. That's a trend among same-sex couples, . says Kirsten Ott Palladino, the Atlanta-based co-founder and editor in . chief of EquallyWed.com, an online magazine devoted to same-sex . weddings. 'As more states are legally recognizing same-sex marriage, couples are choosing to wait to marry in their home states,' says Ms Palladino. 'We're not seeing as many people flying to Massachusetts or New York for their big weddings.' Ms Palladino also cites a growing interest in incorporating religion into same-sex ceremonies, as Ms Crocker and Ms Kibort did. 'For a time, there was a backlash against including religion in same-sex weddings. Now couples seem proud to put religion and cultural traditions back into their ceremonies,' says Ms Palladino. There's more freedom these days to choose a wedding that reflects a couple's relationship and budget, according to Steven Petrow, author of Steven Petrow's Complete Gay & Lesbian Manners. This generation of gays and lesbians is creating a new set of rites and rituals incorporating both old and new traditions, says Mr Petrow, who lives in Hillsborough, North Carolina, a state that doesn't allow same-sex marriage. 'The maid of honor might be a man or the . best man may be a woman. And honored attendants are . often a mix of close friends and family' He cites one new tradition of sending the rings around to be blessed by all those in attendance. 'It's like a metaphor for a group hug,' says Mr Petrow. 'It's incredibly moving.' Today's same-sex couples often go with non-traditional wedding party configurations. 'The maid of honor might be a man or the best man may be a woman,' Mr Petrow says. 'And honored attendants are often a mix of close friends and family.' Often the couple walk down the aisle together, 'or if they have kids, the whole family may process,' he says. Ms Crocker and Ms Kibort sent their two adult daughters, Emma and Hannah Kibort-Crocker, down the aisle before them. Bringing back traditions: Now that gay marriage is becoming more mainstream, there is a growing interest in incorporating religion into same-sex ceremonies, as Ms Crocker and Ms Kibort did . 'It was a very family wedding,' says Ms . Kibort. 'My kids pulled a prank on me in the middle of the ceremony and . it was a crackup. Everyone was laughing.' Like these two women, many same-sex couples tying the knot are in mid-life, and have well-established relationships and children. While their parents may be given honored roles in the ceremony or reception, such as the first dance, many couples are planning and paying their own way. It remains to be seen how younger . same-sex couples will structure their weddings as they marry earlier in . life. 'My kids pulled a prank on me in the middle of the ceremony and . it was a crackup. Everyone was laughing' Mr Petrow notes that while his generation of gays and lesbians had . no expectation of getting married, today's kids are growing up . expecting to have the choice. And . just because they have the right to marry doesn't mean a couple will . choose to do so. 'It's impolite to hassle people - gay or straight - . about getting married,' he says.

'Same-sex weddings, like straight weddings, are at their heart about love and commitment. If you can't honor the couple, please stay home.' Ms Crocker and Ms Kibort even bristle at the term 'gay marriage.' 'I don't gay park. I don't have gay lunch,' says Ms Kibort. 'You don't say you're going to an interracial marriage.

When pregnant Laura Horne’s bump suddenly started growing much faster than expected, worried doctors carried out a scan to find the cause. What they discovered was a huge ovarian cyst – growing on the ovary not of the mother-to-be, but of her unborn daughter. And as well as putting increasing pressure on the baby’s vital organs, if it burst the little girl could suffer serious complications. Mrs Horne had to have an emergency Caesarean to deliver her daughter, so she could then undergo a life-saving operation. Laura Horne had a scan when her baby bump started to grow much more quickly than expected. She is pictured with baby Ruby and husband, Michael . The scan showed that Ruby had an ovarian cyst which was two inches in diameter. The cyst is the round black area in the centre of the image . Ruby, now 23-months-old, has made a complete recovery and is at home with her parents in Stirling, Scotland. Mrs Horne, 26, a pharmacist, said: ‘The scan saved Ruby’s life. If the doctors hadn’t carried out the scan to see why my stomach was so huge, then they might not have spotted the growth in time. ‘It was in the top of her stomach and growing upwards so that it was squashing her major organs. ‘It could have ruptured any minute whilst she was in the womb – which would have killed her. She is the luckiest baby in the world.’ The growth of Mrs Horne’s bump started accelerating after she went past the 30-week mark in her pregnancy in April 2011. She said: ‘When I got to 36 weeks my bump was so enormous that I looked as though I was having triplets. I couldn’t fasten my seatbelt in the car. ‘My pregnancy had gone smoothly at first. I’d had a bit of bleeding initially, which was a worry, but that soon stopped. And my scans had shown nothing was wrong. ‘But then after I reached 30 weeks pregnant, my bump really started to grow over the next few weeks. Even the midwives were shocked at the size of it – they thought it was absolutely huge.’ Ruby had to be delivered by emergency Caesarean because the cyst was putting pressure on her vital organs and was in danger of rupturing and killing her . Doctors at Glasgow’s Southern General Hospital thought Mrs Horne might have had excess fluid in her womb so carried out a scan. It was then they discovered that the baby had a mass growing in the top of her stomach. Ovarian cysts in newborn baby girls are quite common and usually clear up on their own but Ruby's was unusual as it was putting pressure on her organs and was in danger of rupturing. Mrs Horne, who lives with husband Michael, 25, an engineer, said: ‘It was terrifying. The sonographer ran the scanner over my stomach and then said they could see a mass growing in the baby’s stomach. ‘I had another scan to check, and at that point the doctors weren’t sure whether the mass was a tumour, a cyst or a bowel blockage.’ Mrs Horne underwent an emergency caesarean to deliver Ruby, who weighed 7lb 6oz. After she was born Ruby had to have an operation to remove the cyst which turned out to be benign. She has now made a full recovery . Ruby had to have one of her ovaries removed but her parents have been told that it should not affect her ability to have children in the future . Ruby was immediately transferred to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow, where she had an operation. Doctors discovered she had an ovarian cyst measuring nearly two inches in diameter. The surgeons managed to remove all of it, and Ruby immediately lost half a pound. Mrs Horne said: ‘We were so worried about Ruby having the operation as she was so young, only a few days old. ‘But we knew that the cyst could have ruptured at any moment, so we didn’t have a choice. When surgeons removed Ruby's cyst she immediately lost half a pound in weight . ‘When they told us afterwards that it had been a success it was such a relief.’ The couple have been told that although one ovary had to be removed, it should not affect Ruby’s chance of having children in the future as she still has one ovary remaining. Mrs Horne added: ‘We were so amazed that a baby could even have an ovarian cyst like this. ‘The doctors told us it was incredibly rare but it had probably developed as she had absorbed excess hormones through me.’ Tests showed the cyst was benign, not cancerous.","Laura Horne, 26, had a scan when her baby bump grew faster than expected .

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . UPDATED: . 06:48 EST, 5 October 2011 . When a heavy gambler decided to lose weight, he knew he would need an extra incentive to stick to a diet. Peter Heeks used his love of gambling to cash in on his own weight loss - by placing a bet on how many pounds he could lose in a year. Now the 26-year-old has collected a win of £10,000 after shedding more than seven stone in a year. Gambling man: Peter Heeks after his £10,000 win (left) and before his dramatic weight loss (right) Peter staked £100 at 100-1 that he could lose 100lbs in a year and, followed it up with 12 months of healthy eating and exercise. Strapping 6ft 2ins tall Peter weighed 21 stone when he placed the bet and now tips the scales at 14 stone. He said: 'I had tried diets and exercise in the past to lose weight, but it had never worked. 'Then I heard a story on the radio about a man who won a bet with William Hill after losing three stone. 'I . thought that would be the incentive to help me lose weight and my . target weight was 14 stone, so I contacted the bookmaker and they took on . the bet. 'It's put years on my life along with money in the bank' 'They hadn't had anyone wanting a bet on themselves to lose so much, so they gave me a big price. 'If . they kept the 100-1 out there - they'd be doing the nation a favour as . it would be a great incentive to beat the obesity time bomb. 'I . was clearly very overweight when I placed the bet. Every other time I . tried I failed to get the results as I gave up with the diets and . exercise. 'But I was never . really sporty and when I placed the bet I started going to the gym and . exercising and also counting my calories. 'The bet made me focus on losing the weight as soon as I placed it. I started changing my diet and going to the gym. My biggest bet before this was about a fiver on their casino games.' Cash incentive: Peter believes the bet would help tackle the obesity crisis if bookies allowed others to follow suit . CALORIES: 4,000 a day . Breakfast: Never really bothered . would instead get to work and snack on a can of Coke at about 130 . calories with a 200-calorie bag of Kettlechips. Lunch: A 500ml Dr Pepper at . 210 calories, a 500-calorie sandwich from Sainsbury's and another 200 . calorie bag of crisps. Mid-afternoon snack: Crisps 200 calories and another coke 130 calories. Evening . meal: More soft drinks with a large pizza and chips or . other takeaway with an average intake of 2,500. Alcohol would boost his intake to four or five . thousand calories. CALORIES: 1,500 a day . Breakfast: Three bananas - 100 calories each - glass of water. Lunch: A salad from Subway at 350 calories with water - cutting out the soft drinks saved him thousands of calories each week. Evening . meal: Healthy piece of chicken or fish with vegetables and perhaps a . piece of fruit for dessert. Cooking the food himself ensured Peter . knew exactly what went into it and his evening meal was rarely more than . 750 calories - less than a third of his previous intake after work. He . also virtually cut out alcohol for the year to lose more calories. Call centre worker Peter, from Darwen, Lancashire, even inspired friends and family to lose weight as the stones slipped away. He said: 'I started enjoying the gym and was going up to five times a week. 'And my calorific intake went from a daily average of more than 4,000 to less than half that. 'It's . had a great knock on effect on my health with my weight dropping to 85 . kg from 134kg at the start, my waist shrinking from 129cm to 91.5cms and . my BMI dropping from a morbidly obese 37-1 to a much healthier 23-5. 'Even . my blood pressure has changed from 156 over 104 to a much more normal . 110 over 70 - it's probably put years on my life along with the money in . my bank. 'When William Hill accepted my bet they changed my life.' William Hill's spokesman Rupert Adams said: 'Peter is our biggest ever winner at £10,000 after betting £100 at 100/1. 'When he called to say he had succeeded we were flabbergasted, this is an amazing achievement and he deserves his winnings.'","Peter Heeks dropped from 21 stone to 14 stone .

Feminist group FORCE takes issue with messages such as 'Sure thing' emblazoned across Victoria's Secret underwear . Underwear emblazoned with anti-rape phrases have been planted in over a dozen Victoria's Secrets' stores across by North America and Europe by a US feminist group. The U.S feminist group FORCE: Upsetting Rape Culture, continued its crusade against Victoria's Secrets by carrying out its 'operation panty drop' The activists are fighting what they . call a 'culture of rape' and take issue with the messages such as 'Sure . thing' emblazoned across the front of Victoria's Secret underwear. Over the weekend Rebecca Nagle, 26, and Hannah Brancato, 27, along with a number of 'consent enthusiasts' launched co-ordinated strikes against the lingerie store, sneaking in thongs emblazoned with 'No means no' and placing them alongside the official lingerie line. 'What we’re doing is one tactic within a bunch of necessary tactics to change our culture,' Nagle told the Daily News. Earlier this month the group tried to . convince American fashion media that Victoria's Secret's PINK line was . launching a special collection of sexual consent-themed underwear, . sending out a fake press release and launching a fake website under the . Victoria's Secret name. In its original press release, PINK . Loves Consent claimed to be a new Victoria's Secret line that 'promotes . consent to fight rape in new panties.' The PINK Loves Consent website, with a Victoria's Secret copyright notice on the bottom and the brand's logo at the top, features a model wearing  underwear with the phrase 'No Means No'. The line has its own Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest, and the website claims to have more than five milliion members who have joined the 'consent revolution'. The website also shows how the Victoria's Secret PINK . line has evolved with 'Then and Now' sections that read: 'Then we loved . styles that were all about rape culture. Now we love styles that are all . about consent! Catch the changes hitting stores this holiday season.' Sexual consent campaign: Feminist group FORCE has launched 'operation panty drop', putting fake PINK thongs with the words 'No Means No' next to real Victoria's Secret underwear that say 'Unwrap Me' The website also has a Facts box which reads: 'By the time women in the United . States graduate from college, one in four will have been raped. 'Every . 21 hours someone is raped on a college campus. Women are twice as . likely to be raped in their lifetime than to develop breast cancer.' When Jezebel's . Katie Baker spoke to Molly Reagan, who says she is the 'Media Relations . with Victoria's Secret's new PINK loves CONSENT line,' she said she was . working for Victoria's Secret. However . a Limited Brands spokesperson (which owns Victoria's Secret), rebuffed . these claims, saying: 'This is not an official PINK campaign. We are . looking into it.' The website is still active, and now . that FORCE has admitted it is behind the PINK Loves Consent campaign, . it is taking to brick-and-mortar Victoria's Secret stores to spread . their message, putting its PINK Loves Consent underwear next to real Victoria's Secret lingerie. According . to the FORCE website, it wants 'customers who hadn’t heard about PINK . Loves Consent on the internet to stumble upon it in stores.' Despite the unwanted attention from Force, Victoria's Secret continued with its swim line shoot in St Barts over the weekend. Models Doutzen Kroes and Alessandra Ambrosio sizzled on . set during a steamy bikini photo shoot in the Caribbean.

The mother-of-two of two's physique was impossibly fit as she sauntered around in the surf in a variety of skimpy bikinis. According . to the FORCE website, it wants 'customers who hadn’t heard about PINK Loves Consent on the internet to stumble upon it in stores.' Covetable products: People that have come across the PINK Loves Consent website actually want to purchase the goods, however FORCE are unable to sell them for obvious copyright reasons . Consent revolution: FORCE hopes to draw attention to its cause through the hoax, pointing out that 'By the time women in the United . States graduate from college, one in four will have been raped' It continues: 'Last . week, Victoria’s Secret shut down pinklovesconsent.com and . @loveconsent [both the website and twitter handle are back up after the . group fought the take down] and we realized we need another method to . spread the good news of consent.' Apparently many people have stumbled . upon them in stores actually want to buy them, including Jezebel's Miss . Baker, who praised FORCE's efforts, wrote: ' My only complaint is that . you can't actually buy anything off the site, because now I kind of want . some underwear that says 'respect' on the crotch.' FORCE's website explains: 'When one . shopper found them in the store in Miami, FL, she said, ""When I picked . up this pair of underwear, it was fun because I knew that they had been . planted in the store, because I knew about pinklovesconsent.com.' Although FORCE can't sell its prank underwear line because they would probably be sued (Victoria's Secret has already taken legal action to try and block the website, according to FORCE), the group says: 'There never was a plan to sell consent-themed panties, [it is] just to create a consent revolution!'

Released: The couple were identified as Andy Wells, the 51-year-old head of the local subsidiary of Exxon Mobil and his wife Caroline . A British oil executive and his wife were kidnapped as they drove through a remote area of Egypt. Andy Wells, chairman of ExxonMobil for the country, was driving with his wife Caroline, 48, from their Cairo home towards Sharm el Sheikh, through the increasingly lawless Sinai region. As they stopped at a bureau de change in the town of Ras Sidr, the couple were held by two masked gunmen. The kidnappers drove them to a remote mountainous area in southern Sinai and held them for a number of hours. The couple were finally freed after police promised Bedouin tribesmen they would release a relative who had been detained and accused of smuggling weapons from Libya to Egypt. It is the latest in a number of kidnappings by Bedouin in Sinai wanting to pressure police into freeing detained relatives. Mr and Mrs Wells, who married in 1987, have a home in West Byfleet, Surrey and two daughters – 25-year-old Hannah and Emily, 22. Mr Wells, 51, has been working in Egypt for almost two years. Following the uprising against President Hosni Mubarak in 2011 the Foreign Office has advised against all travel to northern Sinai and all but essential travel in southern Sinai except for the tourist areas around Sharm el Sheikh. A spokesman for travel organisation Abta said: ‘The incident highlights the importance for British people to follow the FO’s advice.’ Security . in the isolated desert region has deteriorated since the overthrow of . President Hosni Mubarak in a popular uprising two years ago. Tourists kidnapped in similar circumstances last year were released unharmed. South Sinai's Red Sea coast is a major tourism area for Egypt. Missing: The Britons were heading in a private car from Cairo to Sharm El Sheikh, pictured, and had stopped to change money in Ras es-Sidr when they were kidnapped by the tribesmen . Several other tourists have been held briefly by tribesmen in recent months and released unharmed, often after less than a few hours of negotiations with authorities. Bedouin have attacked police stations, blocked access to towns and taken hostages to show their discontent with what they see as their poor treatment by Cairo and to press for the release of jailed kinsmen. Two American women were kidnapped in Sinai in February last year but Egyptian authorities negotiated their release a few hours later. Two other U.S. tourists were kidnapped in late May that year, and then two more U.S. tourists in July. The captives were released within days in both incidents. Although many UK tour operators have Egypt programmes, trips including Cairo are rare. Most UK tourists take Nile trips which do not include Cairo or visit the seaside resorts.","Andy Wells, 51, and wife Caroline, 48, abducted at bureau de change .

'But I have also included a couple of humorous images such as the 'sketch and fight' picture which shows the battle of two artists - myself and my friend Cal Redback' - each with our own technique.' Sebastien created the pictures in his apartment, using a Canon 7D, a 50mm and simple lighting. The drawing is done by hand on a sheet of paper, scanned and cleaned, before being added to the photo using Photoshop. From the shooting to the final image, it can take Sebastien a few hours to several days to complete. 'I find it's good to take a break when I'm creating these images,' he said.

The RSPCA has voiced fears that swans are being killed to be eaten after a pair were found shot with a high-powered crossbow. The male and female swans, who have mated for life, were discovered in a river with the one foot long wooden bolts speared into their bodies. The male survived the attack but the body of the female swan was found on the River Stour at Throop, near Bournemouth, Dorset. A male swan was found on the River Stour at Throop in Dorset having been hit with a crossbow arrow which an RSPCA officer said may have been fired by a non-British person . An RSPCA officer and four firemen managed to rescue the male mute swan but were unable to catch his terrified partner . The male swan is released today at Throop, near Bournemouth, Dorset, but its mate died of her injuries . An RSPCA officer and four firemen managed to rescue the male mute swan but were unable to catch his terrified partner, which later died. An X-ray later showed the bolt and metal arrow-head had lodged five inches into the male bird's body, missing his heart by a fraction of an inch. He underwent surgery to remove the missile and is now recovering. RSPCA inspector Graham . Hammond said: ‘It is educated guesswork but I don't believe this is the . work of thugs looking for their kicks because they would normally use . stones or catapults. ‘It is possible that someone who is non-British may have considered these swans to be food. ‘In . Britain swans are revered and are heavily protected. I suspect that . this has been carried out by someone who is not aware of their status. ‘This was a sophisticated, high-powered crossbow that would have had to have been concealed so not to arouse suspicion. ‘Swans aren't far removed from a goose or turkey, a big bird with a lot of meat on them. I suspect the intention of the . offenders was to remove them. An X-ray showed a four-inch bolt near heart of the unfortunate swan which was fired at with a crossbow . A vet removed part of the missile from the swan, which survived the attack but became separated from its mate . The male swan was found with the bolt embedded in its back while the female had the arrow in her side, close to the waterline. He . said: ‘I saw bolts in both of them. Myself and four firemen in dry . suits waded into the river and we managed to catch the male, although . the bolt snapped in two. ‘We spent about three hours trying to catch the female but she was terrified and wouldn't let us near her. ‘The male was X-rayed and he was hit in the back and it came within a few milimetres of his heart. ‘He underwent surgery under general anesthetic to remove the 10cm long broken section of the bolt. ‘It is particularly sad because the swans have been on this territory for a number of years.' The male swan has now recovered well enough to be released back into the wild again. Mr Hammond added: 'The male will be pining for the female. The male swan was released today at Throop, near Bournemouth, Dorset, after being treated for his injuries by RSPCA officer Graham Hammond . 'It sounds a bit extreme, but we may have to show the male the female's body so that he knows what has happened. Hopefully he will find another mate.' Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 it is an offence to kill, injure or harm a wild bird and the penalty for killing or injuring a swan carries a fine of up to £5,000 . and six months in prison. In Britain all swans are a protected species owned by the Queen and until 1998 it was considered treason to kill a swan. But . in parts of Eastern Europe they are considered a delicacy. Mr . Hammond said the RSPCA will examine the broken arrow for DNA and . cross-reference any sample with the police database in a bid to catch . the offender. It is not the first time a swan has been targetted to be killed for the table. Last . year there was a spate of swan attacks in Lincoln and one involved a . swan being bludgeoned to death with nail-embedded sticks by a group of . five men.

Paolo Di Canio stepped up his row with David Miliband yesterday by calling his accusers ‘stupid and ridiculous’. The new Sunderland manager spoke out after the former foreign secretary quit his role at the football club because of the Italian’s ‘past political statements’. Di Canio has been accused of fascist sympathies and of giving an open-handed salute to crowds during a match. New manager: Paolo Di Canio pictured outside the Sunderland stadium in a brief appearance this morning . David Miliband, right, seen in the stands at the Stadium of Light for Saturday's game against Manchester United, resigned his Sunderland directorship yesterday after the appointment of Paolo Di Canio . Last night he apologised for any offence, saying his comments were made many years ago and taken out of context. In a statement issued jointly with his new club, he denied he was racist or extremist and said he didn’t want to talk politics. ‘I don’t have a problem with anyone. I haven’t had a problem in the past and I don’t know why I have to keep repeating my story, to be defending myself on something that doesn’t belong to me every time I change clubs,’ he said. ‘Talk about racism? That is absolutely stupid, stupid and ridiculous.’ He added: 'What I can say is that if someone is hurt, I am sorry. But this didn't come from me - it came from a big story that people put out in a different way to what it was. 'The people who know me can change that idea quickly. When I was in England my best friends were Trevor Sinclair and Chris Powell, the Charlton manager - they can tell you everything about my character. 'I don't want to talk about politics because it's not my area. We are not in the Houses of Parliament, we are in a football club. I want to talk about sport. 'I want to talk about football, my players, the board and the fans. I don't want to talk any more about politics - I am not a politics person.' Mr Miliband quit as vice-chairman and non-executive director on Sunday night. In a statement on his website, Mr Miliband said: 'I wish Sunderland AFC all the success in the future. It is a great institution that does a huge amount for the North East and I wish the team very well over the next vital seven games. 'However, in the light of the new manager’s past political statements, I think it right to step down.' There is anger among fans too, with many calling for the 44-year-old to renounce his ‘extremist views’ or resign. On Facebook, a petition against Di Canio’s appointment had 10,000 members yesterday. Unite Against Fascism's joint . national secretary, Weyman Bennett, said Di Canio's political views were . 'an insult' to the people of Sunderland who died fighting fascism. Mr Bennett said: 'If he wants to be a . manager and wants to be a public figure, he needs to make it clear he . accepts these views are completely inappropriate. Paolo Di Canio was fined by Fifa for making a fascist salute to fans while playing for Italian club Lazio . 'Football has made great strides in . opposing fascism. It's simply not true that you can say you agree with . fascism and that's okay. It's something that isn't acceptable.' And war veteran John Hall, 92, said: ‘I do not believe in fascism. ‘If there was another man of the same calibre who was not a fascist then they should have employed him as manager.’ Di Canio was made manager following . Saturday’s sacking of Martin O’Neill. When he was made Swindon Town’s . boss in 2011, the GMB union withdrew its sponsorship. Last week Mr Miliband, Labour MP for . South Shields, said he was leaving the country and British politics to . head an international charity in New York. However, he did not say that . he was quitting his part-time role at Sunderland. He joined the Wearside club in February 2011. Since then he has earned £125,000 for just 15 days of work. As . a boy, Di Canio was a junior member of the 'ultras', or extreme . supporters, of Lazio, which was founded by Italian army officers in 1900 . and reportedly has a tattoo of Mussolini, who supported the club. He praised Italy’s former fascist dictator in his autobiography as 'basically a very principled, ethical individual'. His appointment has also upset some fans of Sunderland who are . proud of the club’s working class and socialist . background. The Stadium of Light was built on the last Wearside pit and . has close associations with the remaining miners’ lodges in the region. When . Di Canio made the fascist salute in 1995, Mussolini’s granddaughter . Alessandra said: 'What a delightful Roman salute! I was deeply moved.' Di . Canio, a former striker for West Ham said after the incident to Italian . news agency ANSA in 2005: 'I am a fascist, not a racist.' Done deal: Di Canio leaves the Stadium of Light after talks yesterday . Fans said they respected Mr Miliband's decision to step down but said the club's success should take priority over politics. However, they warned that Di Canio must keep any political views out of football or face being kicked out of the club. Supporter Stan Simpson, a season ticket holder for 40 years and a Sunderland AFC Supporters' Club member, said some fans would be 'wary' about the Italian's appointment. 'David Miliband has got principles to stick by, and it's a principle. You've got to admire the guy for that,' he said. 'I understand Mr Miliband's decision but there is no way we, as fans, would entertain any fascism in our club. 'As long as he doesn't express any political opinions I can cope with it. I've got no problem with him being there. But if he expresses those sort of opinions while he's there, he should be sacked, it doesn't matter how or where. It's not acceptable in this country.' Fan Janet Rowan, a long-time supporter and secretary of the Chester-le-Street supporters' group, said she thought Di Canio was 'very passionate' about his involvement in the game but said extremist politics 'isn't something we want in football'. She added: 'I respect David Miliband's views but as fans we have got to support Di Canio. 'I think with some people, his appointment probably will leave a bad taste but I hope that the majority of fans are going to put Sunderland football club ahead of everything.'","Di Canio was once fined by Fifa for making fascist salute to Lazio fans .

The leader of a body-snatching ring responsible for stealing the bones of veteran broadcaster Alistair Cooke is dying of bone cancer, his lawyer has been revealed. Michael Mastromarino, who made millions . of dollars by illicitly harvesting skin and bones from corpses, was . given his last rites two weeks ago in a New York state prison. Bone cancer has spread through the 49-year-old former dentist's entire body. Dying: Michael Mastromarino in 2008 after pleading guilty for looting hundreds of corpses and selling the parts for millions of dollars . 'I thought it was ironic, and I told him that,' said lawyer Mario Gallucci, adding that the twist of fate was not lost on the man who cheated the dead, but ultimately could not cheat death. He is being held in Alden at the state's Wende Correctional Facility, a prison for infirm inmates, a state Correction Department spokeswoman said. Mastromarino's ring dismembered more than 1,000 cadavers in unsanitary conditions in New York state, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and sold parts to doctors who transplanted them into patients. Mastromarino had pleaded guilty to body stealing, reckless endangerment and enterprise corruption. As part of the scheme, a team of so-called cutters removed bones, skin and tendons in an unsanitary embalming room, prosecutors said. Cooke, the former newspaper foreign correspondent and the BBC's Letter from America, died in 2004 at the age of 95 in New York. Harvested: American radio commentator Alistair Cooke during his brief visit to London in 1946. He died in 2004 at the age of 95 in New York . Vito Bruno, whose father, Michael, died of kidney cancer in 2003 and after which his organs were sold by Mastromarino told the New York Daily News of the irony. The record producer from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, who is suing Mastromarino said: 'You don't want to wish anything bad on anyone, but karma's a son of a b***h. 'He committed a horrendous crime against a lot of people. There are tens of thousands of people affected.' Mastromarino, who was sentenced to 18 to 54 years in prison, is suffering from bone cancer, his lawyer says . The bodies were looted and the parts sold to medical companies to be used in dental implants, knee replacements and other procedures. 'Irony has its way,' Susan Cooke Kittridge, Cooke's daughter, told the New York Daily News. 'My father had lung cancer that metastasized to his bones. 'Of course you wonder about cosmic irony. But at this time, I feel so deeply for his family and his children. What a complicated time for them.' Cooke Kittridge said that when she told her family Mastromarino was on his deathbed - and what he was dying of - 'everyone is kind of speechless'. 'What he did was horrible, but it's not for me to pass judgment on this man,' she said. 'Yes, he hurt me. He hurt thousands of people, but I don't feel any satisfaction that he is suffering, or that he is dying. 'It does make you wonder though.' A relative told the New York Daily News that Mastromarino's ex-wife, Barbara, and their two children visited him last week. Mastromarino is down to 125 pounds and can't hold a cup. Mastromarino has been serving an 18 to 54-year sentence for body stealing, forgery, grand larceny and enterprise corruption. Lawyer Sanford Rubenstein, who represents more than 20 of Mastromarino's victims, has little sympathy for the dying man. 'It doesn't change the fact that what he did when he was alive horribly affected the lives of many families, victims and individuals who now fear illness for the rest of their lives,' said Rubenstein.","Michael Mastromarino was .

Vinogradov, 59, who had been in space in 1997 and 2006, was heard saying on . NASA TV: 'It's . such a beautiful sight, hard to believe my eyes.' The incoming crew will spend five months in space before returning to Earth. The trio who arrived at the space station this morning includes former navy seal Lieutenant . Commander Chris Cassidy  - on his second mission into space. The 43-year-old served four six-month deployments to . Afghanistan and two to the Mediterranean as a Navy SEAL. His dedicated . service earned him two Bronze Stars for leading a nine-day operation at . the Zharwar Kili cave complex in Afghanistan. Once the capsule reached the station, the trio had to wait two hours for the pressure to equalize before they were allowed to enter. Action man: Cassidy waves as he walks to the Soyuz spacecraft and, right, as a Navy SEAL who served with distinction in Afghanistan . 'Hey, is anyone home?' joked Vinogradov as he floated into the station. Cassidy, . Vinogradov and Misurkin were greeted with cheers and hugs by American . Tom Mashburn, Russian Roman Romanenko and Canadian Chris Hadfield, who . have been at the station since December. The astronauts then had a brief session with Mission Control outside Moscow, talking with friends and relatives. 'You're . such a star! I'm really proud of you!' Misurkin's tearful mother said. The 35-year-old Russian is on his first flight into space. Their mission began with a late-night launch from the Russian-leased Baikonur launch pad in Kazakhstan. It . was the first time a space crew has taken such a direct route to the . orbiting lab. Cassidy, Vinogradov and Misurkin are the first crew to . reach the station after only four orbits instead of the standard 50-hour . flight to reach the station. The Soyuz-FG rocket booster with Soyuz TMA-08M space ship takes off carrying Cassidy and his crew mates to the International Space Station . The . new maneuver was tested successfully by three Russian Progress cargo . ships, unmanned versions of the Soyuz used to ferry supplies to the . space station. Russian cosmonauts have described the two-day approach . maneuver in the cramped Soyuz as one of the most grueling parts of . missions. Vinogradov . said at a pre-launch news conference that the shorter flight path would . reduce the crew's fatigue and allow the astronauts to be in top shape . for the docking. Cassidy, who lives in . York, Maine with his wife and their three children, was selected for the . space program by NASA in 2004. Astronaut training is among the toughest in the world, but Cassidy was more than prepared for it, having already gone through Navy SEAL training. As a seal he underwent the infamous 'hell week,' in which candidates only sleep four hours over 5 1/2 days while running up to 200 miles and physically training for 20 hours per day. Cassidy told Universe Today that all training that astronauts - and Navy SEALs - go through is for a very good reason. 'I think just the training that I got in the field, training in the early part of my Navy career, and during my time being an astronaut will all combine together. 'What I know from combat in the Navy, there’s a sort of calmness that comes over people who are well-trained and know what to do. Muscle memory kicks in, and it’s not until after the thing is over that you realize what you went through,' he said. The U.S. Navy has shown its support for Cassidy on social media platforms by posting this meme . On the International Space Station, Cassidy will be doing experiments measuring bone mass, which will have applications for people facing osteoporosis. This is his second mission. In 2009 he was part of a mission to help install and complete components of the Japanese Experiment Module and got to perform three spacewalks. He follows on the heels of other former SEALs to make it to space, including International Space Station Expedition 1 commander William Shepherd. The U.S. Navy has shown its support for Cassidy on social media platforms by posting a meme of an astronaut with the wording: ‘Nothing beats an astronaut… except a Navy Seal astronaut.’ The wording is a play on the popular T.V. commercial that Unilever is currently running featuring astronauts, a lifeguard and a fireman, to promote the Axe Apollo body spray for men by Lynx. Cassidy with his fellow crew - Russian Cosmonauts Alexander Misurkin, right, and Pavel Vinogradov, center . The Soyuz TMA-08M lifted off from the Russian-leased Baikonur cosmodrome at 2:43 a.m. Friday local time. The . new maneuver has been tested successfully by three Russian Progress . cargo ships, an unmanned version of the Soyuz used to ferry supplies to . the space station. Vinogradov joked at a pre-launch news conference at Baikonur that the journey to the station would be so quick that it could allow the crew to even carry ice cream as a present to the three men currently manning the orbiting outpost. ‘It wouldn't melt in such a short time,’ he said. The shorter flight path also reduces the crew's fatigue and allow astronauts to be in top shape for the docking. Vinogradov said that it takes about five hours for the human body to start feeling the impact of zero gravity, so the quicker flight would allow the crew to more easily adapt to weightlessness in much roomier space station interiors. The downside of the accelerated rendezvous is that the crew will have to stay in their spacesuits, which they don hours before the launch, through the entire approach maneuver. Once on-board the International Space Station Cassidy will be doing experiments measuring bone mass . Other Russian cosmonauts in the past have described the two-day approach maneuver in the cramped Soyuz as one of the most grueling parts of missions to the orbiting station. The spheroid orbiting capsule allows the crew to take off their bulky spacesuits, change into more comfortable clothes and use a toilet, but its interior is extremely confined. The ship's spartan layout lacks adequate heating and fails to provide an opportunity for the crew to get hot food. It contrasts sharply with the spacious U.S. space shuttle, whose retirement has left Soyuz as the only means to deliver crews to the space outpost. Russian space officials said the longer approach was necessary at a time when the station was in a lower orbit required for the shuttle flights. After they ended, it was raised from 350 kilometers to 400 kilometers, making a quicker rendezvous possible. NASA is working on the development of its new generation Orion spacecraft. Orion's first trip is an unmanned mission in 2017, and the first manned mission is set for 2021.","The Soyuz capsule linked up with the space station at 2.28am .

The family of a four-month-old boy who tested positive for HIV after he was born are battling county officials in a bid to keep him off the medications treating his condition. John Martinez and Lindsey Nagel, as well as Nagel's parents Cheryl and Steve Nagel, believe that the drugs could actually stop their baby, Rico Nagel Martinez, from living a healthy life. Lindsey, from Brownsdale, Minnesota, had HIV when she was adopted by the Nagels from Romania as a child, and the couple believes that taking her off the medication saved her life. Following a hearing this week, a judge will decide whether the . county should get custody of Rico and supervise his medical treatments, . or whether they will trust the parents to administer them correctly. Battle: John Martinez and Lindsey Nagel are fighting the courts to oversee HIV treatment for their son . Adored: Martinez and Nagel greet their four-month-old son after being in court all day on Monday . The family said that they will continue to administer the drugs because they do not want to harm Rico and want to keep custody of him, but that they are searching for second opinions. 'Right now, we're following the plan,' Rico's grandmother Cheryl Nagel told the Minnesota Star-Tribune after the hearing. 'But we're legally going to try to . get him off the medications if we can. Because we know they'll kill him . eventually.' Rico's father John added to KTSP: 'We know we're not . doctors. We wouldn't just stop giving him the drugs, we're not willing . to risk that. But we were in search of someone who would say okay Rico . doesn't need to be on these drugs.' Cheryl Nagel said that if she allows Mower County officials to win custody of Rico, she worries he might suffer as her daughter did as a girl. History: Lindsey also has HIV; she had the illness when she was adopted from Romania as a child, right . Determined: But Lindsey was taken off medication when she became sick and wants the same for her son . 'My goal is to have a healthy, thriving grandson,' she testified, reported. 'We're complying now because I’d like to keep my grandson here. It . makes [my daughter] very happy to have him home, and she wants to raise . him herself.' Lindsey, who is now 22, underwent two years of . treatments when she was young but her parents decided to stop them . because she became so ill and weak that they worried she might die. Her parents added that she has been . healthy since stopping the medications. KTSP reported that, despite this, . her condition has transitioned from HIV to AIDS. Rico tested positive for HIV after he . was born on December 19; his parents said they knew this would be the . case but maintained Lindsey has lived a healthy life despite her . condition. Support: Lindsey's parents, Steve and Cheryl, also want Rico to stop receiving the treatment . Deja vu: The couple was also in the news in 1994 when they wanted to stop Lindsey's treatment . The baby was put on medication two . weeks after he was born, even though his parents had initially refused . the treatment, the Minnesota Star-Tribune reported. Loved: The parents have agreed to administer the drugs until the court's decision . But in mid-January, his parents missed a doctor's appointment about his care. They say they were driving towards Seattle to get a second opinion, but later learned that doctor was not a pediatrician. Child protection officials claimed Rico was being 'medically neglected' by his family and removed him. He was kept at hospital under county supervision for seven weeks, where he was given the drugs. But on March 8 he was returned to his parents until the outcome of the hearing. At the hearing, a social worker . testified at the hearing that the couple has not missed a single . treatment, and that she even suggested reducing the number of visits by . the county. But the couple . declined as they did not want to take the chance that officials thought . they had missed an appointment, the social worker testified. Lindsay Brekke, a Mower County Health . and Human Services supervisor, said she had concerns about the treatment . due to the Nagels' statements about how Lindsey's health had . deteriorated. But Aaron Jones, an assistant county . attorney, argued at the hearing on Monday that the county should retain . custody of the boy to ensure he receives the treatments. Fears: Doctors worry that Rico will develop AIDS, as Lindsey has, if he does not continue the treatment . He argued that Lindsey had initially failed to divulge her HIV status and had refused to take treatments that could have reduced the likelihood of Rico becoming infected. Dr. W. Charles Huskins, a Mayo Clinic expert in pediatric infectious disease, added that if Rico needs to continue the medication, so 'he will grow and thrive and develop.' If he does not continue the medication, doctors say he could develop AIDS. The hearing continues on Tuesday.","Lindsey Nagel, 22, does not want her son Rico to receive the drugs as she became sickly when she took similar treatments as a child .

"By . Dai Davies . PUBLISHED: . 18:33 EST, 1 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:29 EST, 2 April 2013 . The night shift was under way at our police station in South-West London when a 999 call came through. I was an inspector in those days, and felt a frisson of excitement as I received the report of a burglary at a nearby detached home. This was what I really loved about my job: chasing and nicking criminals. It was why I’d joined the police. 'Proper copper': Dai Davies says punches and kicks were all part of the job . Immediately, I left the station with  several officers and we raced to the house whose owner had reported the break-in. The burglar was said to be lurking somewhere in the garden. Without hesitation and despite my short stature, I decided to climb over a high wall to catch the thief. As I leapt up and put my hands on top of the wall  to pull myself over it, I felt a sharp, stabbing pain. The surface had been covered in broken glass, precisely to deter any attempted intrusion. I could feel the thick, warm blood streaming down my outstretched arms. But there was no turning back. Even with these serious cuts, I hauled myself over the wall and into the garden. Sadly, my efforts were in vain, for under the cover of darkness the burglar had managed to escape. I had no alternative but to give up the chase and make my way to hospital, where my bleeding wounds were sewn up and bandaged. Throughout this experience and its aftermath, never once did I dream of suing the owner of the house over the injuries I received from his strategically placed broken glass. I, and all my colleagues, knew that physical damage was an inevitable part of our job in the frontline of the war against crime. I . was reminded of that incident this week when I read about the . outrageous decision by PC Kelly Jones, a constable from Norfolk, to take . legal action against the owner of a petrol station in Thetford after . she tripped up over a kerb while investigating a break-in there. Unlike . me, the litigious PC Jones does not appear to have suffered any serious . injury at all, yet she is pursuing the garage owner for £50,000. Shamefully, . she is supported in this frivolous claim not only by a firm of . self-seeking lawyers but also by the Police Federation, the . representative body of the force’s personnel. What is so disturbing is that this action, despite its absurdity, is hardly an isolated case. WPC Kelly Jones, left, is suing burglary victim Steve Jones, right, after she tripped on a 6in kerb at his garage, pictured, while investigating a break-in . As this paper revealed yesterday, the insidious spread of the compensation culture means police officers are grabbing more than £20 million a year in the settlement of personal-injury claims. Slips, grazes, falls, and animal attacks are all fodder for this growing barrage of self-serving litigation. A bruise is no longer just an occupational hazard for a copper, but rather a cue for financial reparation. All this is a world away from the culture of policing when I was rising through the ranks. During my career I sustained my fair share of knocks, yet, like all my colleagues, I would have regarded the idea of compensation as laughable, even offensive. Punches in the face, kicks on the head, pokes in the eye and even a bayonet into my flesh were all part of the job. ‘Back again, Dai?’ the nurses used to say at my local accident-and-emergency department when I turned up with another injury. On . one occasion, I fell off high school-gates while chasing a burglar, . landing heavily on my back, but it never occurred to me to sue the . school or local education authority. Even more serious was an incident in 1981, when I was driving a Black Maria through Hammersmith in West London. As I went through the streets, I caught sight of a notorious local . criminal, wanted for grievous bodily harm, drinking outside a pub. I . stopped the vehicle, leapt out and walked over to him with the immortal . words: ‘You’re nicked.’ Unfortunately, several of this thug’s family . were in the pub. At once, a fracas started, during which I was kicked so forcefully under the chin that my spine was fractured. WPC Jones tripped while investigating the break in at the Nunns Bridges Service Station in Thetford, Norfolk. Owner Steve Jones said it is example of the 'fallacy that someone is to blame for every accident' Luckily, I recovered after a spell in hospital. But again, I would never have considered any demand for compensation. All that has changed — and there are several reasons. I think it partly reflects a dramatic shift in the nature of modern policing. When I was in the force, police officers were expected to be tough, both physically and mentally resilient. Standards . of fitness had to be kept high, something that obviously does not apply . in the case of PC Kelly Jones, who looks like she regards the gym as an . entirely alien environment. Moreover, . in a predominantly masculine culture, courage was an absolutely core . quality. We were duty-bound to advance towards danger, rather than hide . behind risk assessments and safety guidelines. Because . our task was to protect the public, risk was just part of the job. Nowadays, police officers and fire-fighters won’t even go into a 3ft . pond to rescue someone. And . when that kind of risk-averse culture is all you know — and is drummed . into you by your bosses — then you will probably think it’s perfectly . acceptable to sue someone if you trip over a kerb. Despite the dangers, we were nothing like as well-equipped as officers today. Going . into basements, lofts, factories and alleys, we carried little more . than a truncheon and a torch, in contrast to the vast array of . protective gear today’s police wear, which makes them look more like . American battlefield troops than constables. But . again it is telling that, despite all the technical advances in . equipment, PC Jones appears to have overlooked something as basic as . using her torch. In addition, the police over recent decades have increasingly retreated from the streets. When . I was a serving officer, going out on the beat was regarded as the most . essential element of policing, to deter crime, provide a reassuring . presence to the public and build a knowledge of a neighbourhood. The insidious spread of the compensation culture means police officers are grabbing more than £20¿million a year in the settlement of personal-injury claims . Tragically, beat policing is now treated as an irrelevance and given a far lower priority than other tasks such as holding meetings, monitoring the internet, attending training courses or dealing with paperwork. So officers have far less hard experience of life on the streets. And when they do venture out, they tend to go in pairs, something that would have been unthinkable in my time because it is such a colossal waste of manpower. The justification for this rigid  policy of pairing is that it supposedly helps in the corroboration of evidence at any crime scene, but in reality it shows a crippling lack of self-confidence and authority. But perhaps the most important reason for the shift in policing culture is the fact that, like all major institutions, the police mirror the worst changes in our society. The forces of safety bureaucracy and the compensation culture have been spreading their malign influence across the whole of Britain in recent years, fuelled by measures such as the introduction of ‘no-win, no-fee’ law-suits in 1998, and the notorious Human Rights Act, which has overthrown basic common sense in so many public services. Only last week, it emerged that teachers are now annually awarded £25 million for injuries and discrimination in the classroom — another indicator of how rife cash-grabbing has become. But the police should know better. Officers are employed to protect the public, not exploit them for financial gain. In particular, the Police Federation and senior officers should not be colluding with this destructive trend. The Federation should be battling to uphold the true principles of policing that used to serve this country so well, ensuring the spirit of public service remains at the heart of all operations. Turning itself into a shabby arm of the litigation industry, complete with endless adverts for law firms, is an utter betrayal of those basic values. Similarly, the top ranks of the force should stop being so supine, obsessed with every nuance of political correctness and desperate to show how progressive they are. They are not directors of social services or health-and-safety bureaucrats. They are crime-fighting chiefs, and if they want to do their jobs properly, they need to concentrate on raising standards of fitness, improving recruitment, and putting officers back on the beat. And with regard to PC Kelly Jones, the worst of it is, she’s far from being the only one milking the taxpayer for injuries that my generation would simply have shrugged off.","Former Metropolitan Police Chief Superintendent Dai Davies had his fare share of knocks when he was an officer .

Grandfather-of-two Brock Fettes was held captive on the HKN Energy platform in Iraq for three days and used Skype to keep in touch with his family . Three Scots oil workers held hostage on a platform in Iraq have been released today. The men were among 140 staff held captive after the HKN Energy rig was stormed by an armed group on Friday. The rig was shut down and the group demanded a $1million in return for the release of the oil workers. Father-of-four Brock Fettes, from Insch, Aberdeenshire, was one of three Scottish workers who were held captive on the onshore platform. The 65-year-old Schlumberger engineer kept his family up-to-date through emails and Skype over the weekend. His 54-year-old wife, Rosie Wilson-Leagas, anxiously waited at home for news of her husband as the situation unfolded. Today she spoke of her relief after finding out her husband had been released from captivity. She said: ‘It's good news. I am happy that he is safe. He was concerned. 'It's stressful when you want to leave somewhere and you can't. ‘He was not due to come home for another 10 days. He was worried that this would escalate and he would be stuck there. ‘I spoke to him yesterday evening and he was doing fine. They've managed to keep everything as normal as they can.’ Mr Fettes informed his family two graduates from Aberdeen University, who are working as consultants for the HKN oil firm, were also taken captive. One of them is thought to be from Orkney. The directional engineer told his family before he was released that staff had about four days supply left of food, water and diesel. Rosie Wilson-Leagas was kept informed by email from her husband Brock Fettes while he was kept hostage . He said: ‘The local villagers came to the rig heavily armed and made us shut the rig down. ‘They have taken over the checkpoint leading to the rig, which is about 1,500ft away, and are not allowing any workers in or out. ‘They are demanding money from the oil company, and the company, I think, are going to pay them. ‘The situation will obviously be resolved if they pay them but, until then, we are being held hostage. ‘My concern is this happening again. If they get paid off this time, it will become the national sport for villagers to target oil rigs. They will all be doing it.’ Ms Wilson-Leagas said her husband had been travelling to Kurdistan for the last four years and his latest trip was only meant to last four weeks. The grandfather-of-two has worked in troubled countries for many years but had never been faced with danger before. Ms Wilson-Leagas said one of his four children, Brock Junior, is following his dad into the industry and spent three months gaining work experience on the same rig in October last year. She said she was now planning to cook a family dinner to welcome her husband home and to celebrate his birthday next week. Yesterday the Foreign Office confirmed that the Kurdistan incident had now come to an end.

Accusations: Intimate details of the early life of Spain's Princess Letizia are set to be revealed in a new book . Spain's royal family faces fresh embarrassment as a new book accuses the wife of the heir to the throne of covering up an abortion. The book about Princess Letizia was written by her cousin David . Rocasolano, and includes intimate information about her life before she married Crown Prince Felipe in 2004. It claims Princess Letizia allegedly had an abortion in 2002 - before she met the Crown Prince - and that she tried to cover this up before her engagement was announced, the Telegraph reports. Princess Letizia, a former newsreader and divorcee, allegedly asked for paperwork detailing the abortion to be destroyed, according to the book. Mr . Rocasolano said he was asked by the Princess and Prince Felipe to carry out the task. The abortion is alleged to have taken place at a time when terminations were still illegal in Spain - unless . there was abnormality or the mother's life or mental well being were significantly threatened. It comes at a difficult time for the . royal family after Princess Cristina - Crown Prince Felipe's sister - . was made a suspect in a fraud case. The book, called 'Adios Princesa,’ is believed to portray the Princess as an 'obsessive' person who is suspicious of her relatives. It claims the Princess, 40, thought one of her family had been leaking stories about her to the press and that she told some of them she was pregnant with a boy in 2005 - when she was actually pregnant with a girl - to test this out, according to the Telegraph. Princess Letizia was criticized by some in Spain when she married Crown Prince Felipe as she was a divorcee and a commoner. Accusations: The princess (left) is accused of having an abortion before she met Crown Prince Felipe (far right, pictured here with UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon and his wife at Pardo Palace in Madrid) Greeting: Prince Charles kisses Princess Letizia's hand during a visit to Madrid (Prince Felipe is to her right). The book - written by her cousin - also alleges she tried to cover up the termination .

The staff association representing a police officer who is suing a suspected burglary victim has defended her and said it had 'failed to prepare her'. PC Kelly Jones, 33, is taking legal action against garage owner Steve Jones, 50 after she fell on a kerb while attending a suspected break-in. Lawyers claim Mr Jones was at fault for failing to ensure the officer was 'reasonably safe', making no attempt to light the area or warn her about the step when she went to the incident in Thetford, Norfolk, in August last year. The case has caused controversy and strong reactions. WPC Kelly Jones, left, is suing burglary victim Steve Jones, right, . after she tripped on a 6in kerb at his garage, pictured, while . investigating a break-in . Steve Williams, chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales came to the constable’s aid. He said: 'It is important that the public understand that police officers are not financially compensated by their own force for injuries received on duty and in fact can lose money through half pay and reduction in allowances. 'It may also affect their future prospects concerning promotion, specialisation and in some cases their continuation in their job. 'There is no distinction between on and off duty injury or illness and whilst the Government may wish to reduce litigation culture, there must be some alternative put in place. 'Let me be clear - to vilify this female officer is wrong. WPC Jones tripped while investigating the break in at the Nunns Bridges Service Station in Thetford, Norfolk. Owner Steve Jones said it is example of the 'fallacy that someone is to blame for every accident' 'She took legal advice as to how she could claim back some of her lost earnings as a result of the injury, and at this stage no formal proceedings have taken place. 'She has been supported by my own organisation, the Police Federation, who have agreed to fund her on a conditional fee basis should the matter progress. 'In my view it is actually we that . should be looking at our processes and structures in terms of how we . provide advice - she is our member and I feel that our organisation has . failed to prepare her for the wider personal impact that might arise . from such a claim. 'This is regardless of her right to take this action in law, and the merits of the case which I am not able to discuss.' Mr Williams said the Police Federation’s structure was being independently reviewed. Chief Constable Phil Gormley (left) has spoken of his 'disappointment' but Steve Williams (right), chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales has come to the constable's aid . He added: 'While PC Jones may be an easy . target as she is one individual within a media storm, for me it is the . Police Federation that needs to be mindful of the widespread public and . member perception that has arisen out of this claim, and address that . where relevant in our advice going forward.' The officer’s father, Danny Harle, . earlier said his daughter would drop the lawsuit after being upset at . the strong reaction it prompted. Mr Harle, 58, told the Daily Mirror she felt she had been 'persecuted'. He added: 'All she did was follow standard police procedure. 'There was never any mention of figures. 'She was expecting a couple of grand, not £50,000. 'Kelly wants to drop the claim to prove she’s not a money-grabber, not because she feels she’s done anything wrong.' Yesterday PC Jones’s boss, Chief Constable Phil Gormley spoke of his 'disappointment' over the matter. Mr Gormley said: 'This type of claim does not represent the approach and attitude of the overwhelming majority of our staff who understand and accept the risks inherent in policing and which they willingly confront to keep the public they serve safe. 'It is a disappointment that this is potentially undermined by a private compensation claim.' A Norfolk Constabulary spokesman said yesterday: 'This legal action is not supported by the Constabulary, our understanding being that the action is funded and supported by the Police Federation, a position over which the Constabulary has no control.' PC Jones and Mr Jones were checking the outside of the building after an alarm had gone off, when she is alleged to have fallen and injured herself. A letter from her law firm Pattinson Brewer, seven months after the incident, claims she injured her left leg and right wrist and went to the West Suffolk Hospital. Further questions also remain over the role of the Police Federation in brokering the civil legal action by one of its members. The Daily Mail revealed . frontline officers are receiving millions of pounds every year from . personal injury claims from a Police Federation-backed service. Lawyers behind the free claimline boast they have recovered £42million . in the last two years alone after suing over slips and trips, workplace . accidents and negligence. Stephen Bett, Norfolk’s police and crime commissioner, said WPC Jones’s behaviour was ‘appalling’ and ‘leaves me cold’. He said: ‘Of course, there are officers who deserve to receive help when . they are injured in the course of duty and the public would readily . support this. WPC Jones, I suspect, is not one of them.’ Henry Bellingham, Tory MP for North West Norfolk, called on the Home Secretary to ‘get a grip’ of the situation immediately. He said: ‘Will a firefighter sue because they don’t like flames or a . paramedic because they can’t stand blood? This threatens the fabric of . our emergency services. ‘The public need to know they can have confidence that the police will investigate a crime without trying to sue them.’","PC Kelly Jones, 33, is taking legal action against garage owner Steve Jones .

Dutch police have had to issue an apology after a 'single colleague' posted an April Fool's message online saying that a major section of the country's motorway would be closed today. The message - posted on the national police website -  claimed that 20 miles of the A2 motorway between the Dutch capital Amsterdam and Utrecht would be closed for filming of BBC's Top Gear's attempt to set a new world speed record on a public road. A police spokesman told the Telegraph: 'This is obviously not the intention. It was an action of a single colleague who did not think about the possible consequences.' Dutch police have issued an apology after an April Fool's message appeared on its website saying that a major section of the country's motorway would be closed while BBC's Top Gear filmed an attempt to set a new world speed record . The mock 'warning' was posted on the national police website on Easter Monday morning. It remained stayed online but was removed after an hour after the public began to inquire about the road closure. The fake message said that Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May,  would use the motorway on 1 April to try and break a world record speed record of 268 miles per hour on a public highway. It claimed that 20 miles of the 10 lane A2 motorway between the Dutch capital Amsterdam and Utrecht would be closed for filming . The Dutch justice ministry said 'police organisation quickly moved to avoid confusion after a thoughtless action.' The Dutch are known for their fondness of April Fool jokes, and their love of pranks goes back 440 years with roots in the Dutch war against Spain for the country's independence. On 1 April 1572, Dutch rebels conquered the town of Den Briel, marking a major victory in the struggle against the rule of Spain and a garrison commanded by Lord Alva. To commemorate the victory, and a successful April Fool trick, the Dutch say, 'Op 1 april, Verloor Alva zijn Bril' or 'On April first, Lord Alva lost his glasses', a pun on the word 'Bril', meaning spectacles and Briel, the name of the town.","Dutch police issued an apology after a 'single colleague' posted message .

A motorist caught running red lights and swerving between lanes claimed he was 'under the influence' of drum and bass music. Delivery driver Aaron Cogley, 25, said he was 'high' on the 'intoxicating effects' of his favourite music, which he said made him drive erratically. Police spotted him running two sets of red lights in Bristol and then 'cut up' another driver. Aaron Cogley was banned from driving for 12 months at Bristol Crown Court, pictured, after he admitted dangerous driving but said it was because of the 'intoxicating' effects of drum and base . Bristol Crown Court was told Cogley then rounded a corner so sharply his van rocked on its chassis. Officers pulled him over but he passed a drink and drugs test. When asked why he was driving erratically he blamed his drum and bass. Cogley, of Portishead, Bristol, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and his defence team argued he had been 'intoxicated' by the music. David Miller, defending, said: 'It was stupid. He was carried away because of the intoxicating effects of drum and bass music.' Passing sentence, Recorder Mr Kevin De Haan QC described drum and bass as 'Intoxicating for some. Very irritating for others.' Cogley was ordered to do 80 hours unpaid work, was banned from driving for 12 months and ordered to pass an extended driving test and pay a £60 victim surcharge. Mark Hollier, prosecuting, said police in an unmarked car spotted Cogley driving his Ford van in the streets near Bristol Royal Infirmary. Cogley was seen swerving between lanes and driving erratically in the roads surrounding Bristol Royal Infirmary, pictured . He 'cut up' a motorist, drove slowly through two sets of red lights before swerving from lane to lane as he headed towards a train station. Police rushed the vehicle and Cogley was arrested and breathalysed, but blew a zero reading. Mr Hollier said: 'When asked about it he said he was listening to drum and bass and was in a hurry.' Recorder Haan QC told Cogley: 'It's always serious, dangerous driving. 'Even if you only went up to 40mph you were lucky that night. 'You could have had an accident and been hurt, or worse you could have hurt someone else. Police thought you had taken something.' The court heard that Cogley would now lose his job as a delivery driver.","Aaron Cogley, from Portishead, Bristol, was stopped after running red lights and swerving between lanes .

From cleaning up banana smeared floors to non-stop running around, bringing up a young family can feel like an endurance test at times. And although this musical offering from Australian father of three Matthew Hodge won't make chores and stress go away, it might just put a smile on your face. Set to Carl Orff's famous Carmina Burana, the Ode to Sleep Deprived Parents and Terrorising Toddlers, includes such lyrics as: 'Put my phone down/Where are your pants?', 'Why won't you sleep?/Is it your teeth?' - all of which will be instantly recognisable to the harassed parents of those entering the terrible twos. Harmonious: Sydney's Philarmonic Choir sings Hogde's revamped version of the Carmina Burana . Familiar? Hodge's lyrics will strike a chord with anyone who has or has had a toddler in their life . O' you terror!Get down from there!Mummy's getting cranky... Put my phone down.Where are your pants?What have you done with my purse?Don't throw those blocks.What is that smell?Why do you look so happy?What's in your mouth?Who ripped that book?Why won't you just stop moving? He's on the chair!Just standing there!Wobbling like a drunk man.Where is my mug?What was that crash?Who let you in the kitchen?You've got a knife!Put it down now!Don't wave it near your sister! Put my phone down.Where are my apps?Who dialled triple zero? Why won't you sleep?Is it your teeth?I need another coffee!My head's so sore!Look at the floor!Cleaning will take forever. What's wrong with you?What did I do?Why do you do this to me?I hope when you... Have some kids too...They drive you crazy! The new version of Carmina Burana, which has been used on scores of film soundtracks including Lord of the Rings, is the result of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra's 'Say it with Carmina' contest, which invited members of the Australian public to come up with new lyrics. Despite competition that included odes to the Pope and one entrant's new pet cat, Hodge’s libretto received the most votes. According to Hodge, who lives in Sydney, the ditty was inspired by his youngest son, who at just a year old, has started walking, climbing and generally causing mayhem in the Hodge household. When he penned the winning lyrics, Hodge’s wife Rachel had just endured a 'night of limited sleep and a day of rampant destruction' with the toddler. '(She) recognised many of the phrases instantly and given that our son threw her phone into the toilet two days later, they seemed very appropriate,' Hodge told TODAY Moms - a parenting blog linked to NBC's Today show. 'I put the lyrics together one lunchtime when I heard about the contest. The original lyrics refer to a relentless wheel of fate crushing the poet, and Carl Orff's music reflects that, with its short, sharp phrases and its repeating melodies. 'Somehow, the idea popped into my head that we speak to our children in ‘short, sharp phrases’ as well when we're telling them off.' The winning entry was sung by the 200 members of the Sydney Philharmonia Choir and the resulting video posted on YouTube, where since last month, it has received more than 150,000 views. 'Parenting, while it's highly rewarding, is also a job that involves many frustrations and we constantly find ourselves barking orders to these little people that just won't listen,' added Hodge, who also revealed that he hopes to show the video to his son when he's older - ideally on his 21st birthday. 'So I think many parents have found themselves saying very similar things to their children.'","The Ode to Sleep Deprived Parents was written by Matthew Hodge .

The housing market may have taken some knocks over the past few years, but this terraced house is a particularly extreme victim of the crash. The two-bed home in Burnley, Lancashire is the cheapest house in Britain, on sale with a starting price of just £1,000. But while that may seem like an unbeatable bargain, buyer beware - the property is so delapidated that it will take thousands of pounds to make it liveable. Bargain? This run-down house in Burnley is on sale with a starting price of just £1,000 . Needs work: The house is described as 'in need of complete refurbishment' by its estate agent . Estate agents marketing the house have done their best to lower expectations, admitting the home is 'in need of complete refurbishment'. The stone house in Dall Street, Burnley Wood, has been unoccupied for four years and its interior has been almost completely stripped out. The windows are boarded up with metal sheets to keep out intruders. It is being auctioned off in Preston on Wednesday, but has already attracted online bids pushing up its price to £5,000 - which still makes it Britain's cheapest home. Renovation: It will cost thousands of pounds to restore the gutted house to a liveable state . Damage: The house's windows are all either broken or boarded up to keep out intruders . Back entrance: The other side of the house is equally rundown and in need of work . In addition, the successful bidder will . have to pay a buyer's premium of £5,000, significantly pushing up the . price of the property. In July 2011, a similar house just a mile away in Burnley was sold to builder Darren McGaughey for £10,000, who estimated that it would cost around twice that much to renovate. Five years ago, two-bedroom terraced houses in the area were hard to find for less than around £35,000. Former councillor Karen Heseltine, from the Dall Street residents' association, welcomed the sale of the house on her street, saying: 'I am pleased that the building will hopefully be brought back into use. Listing: The estate agents apparently do not have high hopes for the sale of the property . Neighbourhood: The Burnley Wood area has 'improved a lot' over recent years, according to a resident . Damage: The new owner will have to contend with water damage as well as the house's other problems . 'It has been derelict for so long that it has caused lots of problems for the community. It has been plagued by fly-tipping and pigeons in the loft. It has been a real pain. 'For years residents have had to put up with it being an eyesore and with anti-social behaviour, so we are pleased to hear that somebody is hopefully going to take it on.' She added: 'We want somebody who has got the time and money to turn it into a complete house again. 'We have had enough people in the area buy a cheap house and then either run out of money or run out of interest, and we are back to square one again. 'Burnley Wood is like a different place over the last five years. It has improved a lot and the community is really coming together now.' Burnley was traditionally a mill town which thrived during the Industrial Revolution but has suffered since the decline of manufacturing. It was first recorded in the 12th century, during the Norman period, when it was a farming centre, but its economy and population began to boom with the arrival of cotton mills and the canal. At its peak, the town's population was more than 100,000, but it has now fallen to around 70,000 after the end of industrial activity in the area. Well-known people from Burnley include actor Ian McKellen, Shameless creator Paul Abbott and England cricketer James Anderson. The town is perhaps most famous for Burnley Football Club, which has twice been the national champion and counts Prince Charles among its supporters.","Two-bedroom house in Burnley going under the hammer for bargain price .

An MSNBC host has apologised for describing Mitt Romney 's campaign tactics as the 'n***erisation' of Barack Obama. Toure, a critic on The Cycle, used the term last night when accusing the Republican presidential candidate of racially-charged rhetoric against the President. He had been discussing aggressive comments made by Mr Romney against Mr Obama during a campaign speech in Ohio on Tuesday, in which the Republican said the President should take his 'politics of division and anger back to Chicago'. The former Massachusetts governor also said the President was 'angry and desperate'. Romney himself was responding to Vice President Joe Biden's race blunder when he told an audience of black students that the Republican party would 'put y'all back in chains'. The MSNBC host claimed Romney was engaging in 'racial coding' by portraying Obama as an angry black man. He said on the show: 'You notice he says 'anger' twice. He's really trying to use racial coding and access some really deep stereotypes about the angry black man. 'This is part of the playbook against Obama. The otherization, he's not like us. I know it's a heavy thing to say. I don't say it lightly. But this is ni--erization. You are not one of us, and that you are like the scary black man who we've been trained to fear.' But he today apologised, saying: 'On yesterday's show in discussion about the presidential race, I used a word to make a point. In retrospect, I muddied the discussion by using the ""N-word,""' 'I could've made my point without that word. I shouldn't have used it, and for that I'm sorry.' The Romney campaign is said to have contacted MSNBC executives about the remarks, which were met with anger by the conservative members of The Cycle's panel. Critics had been quick to condemn Toure for the remarks. Ben Shapiro, of Breibart, wrote: 'This is disgusting. It’s a lie, and what’s more, it waters down racism to the point where anything qualifies — and to the point that real racism isn’t taken seriously anymore,' On the show, S.E. Cupp accused Toure of being 'so irresponsible' as she pointed out the liberal commentator only saw Romney's remarks as racial coding - and not Biden's initial comments that sparked the furore. Scroll down for video . Controversy: President Barack Obama inspects drought damaged corn on the McIntosh farm on the campaign trail in Iowa this week . 'Joe Biden made the overtly racial comment and has a history of making bigoted remarks, Mitt Romney was responding to that remark and yet he is the one responsible for the whole Republcian history of racism in politics?' Toure justified his remarks saying that the Republicans were 'a constituency all-white party that rejects the black vote.' The issue was sparked by Vice President's Joe Biden's remarks to an audience at the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research in Danville, Virginia. He told an audience of several hundred black supporters: 'Romney wants to, he said in the first 100 days, he’s gonna let the big banks again write their own rules, unchain Wall Street.' Fightback: Mitt Romney fired back atthe remarks by Joe Biden during a speech in Ohio . Then lowered his voice and added: 'They are going to put y'all back in chains.'

All ablaze: A fire burns at Park Medical Centers building in Detroit on Tuesday as two people remain unaccounted for in the gutted medical office . Crews dug through the gutted Detroit medical building, searching for two people unaccounted for,  Dwane Blackmon, a Detroit police homicide inspector said. 'Initially, what we know is that it . was an arson fire,' Blackmon said. 'It was started by an individual who . we believe fired shots prior to the fire being started.' Investigators were unable to go deep . into the one-story building, described by tenants as having also have a . basement, due to fears of the structure's safety. Heavy construction equipment tore off sections of the building's scorched roof which had not caved in from the blaze. Blackmon was not able to confirm if there were any victims inside the building. Names have not been released but Antha . Williams-Hill said police told her the woman who has yet to be accounted . for is her 30-year-old daughter, Sharita Williams. She said: 'I've been trying to get in . touch with her since this morning. I turned on the news and saw the . building and said, ''Oh Lord!''' The owners of two businesses inside .

Superstorm Sandy displaced hundreds of thousands, caused $50 billion worth of destruction and left over 100 people dead - but MSNBC host Chris Matthews thinks it was all worthwhile. The outspoken anchor ended his overnight election coverage by ignoring the desperate human cost of last weeks storm and insensitively hail it as a game changer that allowed President Obama to secure his second term. Using his final thoughts of the election evening to declare that he was 'so glad' the fatal storm storm smashed into the East Coast of the United States, Matthews' comments were greeted with outrage by Republicans and independents on Twitter. Scroll Down for Video . Chris Matthews the outspoken and forthright host of MSNBC 'Hardball' caused outrage during Election Night coverage by saying he was 'so glad' superstorm Sandy aided President Obama's re-election . 'What kind of sicko says they're so happy we had that hurricane last week? Seriously Chris Matthews is beyond revolting,' tweeted 'Christine915'. Others were more level headed in their criticism, with Justin Hill taking to the social networking site to say that, 'No amount of political points are worth even one life lost.' Another Twitter user called 'Stephanie Scanlon' called Matthews 'a disgusting excuse for a person', while 'Marcia Chimie' said that he was 'a disgrace to humanity.' Even last night in the MSNBC studio, where he was on a panel including Rachel Maddow, Matthews' comments caused an audible 'oooo', leading him to raise his hand to explain. Twitter was awash with outrage from members of the public upset with Chris Matthews comments regarding superstorm Sandy . The MSNBC host claimed that he was happy that Sandy had occurred because it gave President Obama a much needed boost in the polls . The 66-year-old news anchor clarified his comments on air as politically speaking - but the damage was already done . 'No, politically I should say - not in terms of hurting people,' explained a backtracking Matthews. 'The storm brought in possibilities for good politics.' Despite hailing the storm-of-a-lifetime for aiding the re-election of President Obama at the expense of Mitt Romney, the at times controversial MSNBC host took to Twitter where he clarified his statement. 'To clarify -- I was thrilled at the cooperation between the President and state officials that made the country proud. Great bipartisanship,' he tweeted. 'Obviously I wasn't talking about the horror of the storm. I grew up on the Jersey shore,' Matthews wrote on his Twitter feed.

Devastation: Waves break in front of a destroyed amusement park wrecked by Superstorm Sandyin Seaside Heights, New Jersey . Aerial view: Seaside Heights, New Jersey, was surrounded by water after Superstorm Sandy lashed the Atlantic Coast . The death toll from Sandy has already exceeded 100 and many who were in the path of the storm in New Jersey and New York lost their property and were forced into emergency shelter - which some are still relying on. The massive weather system also caused mayhem on Election Day, with many voting districts and precincts facing power outages, fuel shortages and some had to light up their polling places with flares in the dark. Indeed, findings from the Pew Research Center's election weekend survey in the aftermath of the storm said that President Obama held a 48-percent to 45-percent lead over Romney among those likely to vote. This was compared to a week before the storm which had each candidate level on 47 percent of the likely vote. The respected center polled 2,709 likely voters from October 31st to November 3rd in their final pre-election survey while the previous survey dated from October 24th to 28th. Non-partisan pals: Christie, known to be a . longtime critic of Obama, put those differences aside on when . he guided the president on a tour of damaged areas of New Jersey . Up in the air: The Marine One helicopter, carrying President Obama and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, took an aerial tour of the Atlantic Coast in New Jersey . Destroyed: Homes were wrecked by flooding from Superstorm Sandy, pictured on in Mantoloking, New Jersey . In fact according to Pew, 69-percent of all likely voters approved of the way President Obama handled the storm's impact and 46 percent of Romney's supporters did too. More importantly for President Obama, 63 percent of swing voters looked favourably on his handling of the storm and its effects. Analysts said that the storm boosted Obama's image among voters by visibly allowing him to show a bipartisan side. His rapprochement with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and the manner in which he was publicly thanked by one of his fiercest critics was seen as damaging to Mitt Romney. This was especially the case as Chris Christie had been the keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention and had been one of Romney's most vocal supporters. Praise from Matthews: Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney gives his concession speech in Boston last night . But, even before his massively controversial comments last night, Matthews had been ruffling feathers with his forthright political opinions during early Election Day coverage. One of his first targets were Americans who do not vote - describing them as idiots, before attacking those who vote for third party candidates. 'If you haven't voted, I don't want to talk to you,' said Matthews earlier in his broadcast. 'And if you vote for one of these numbskull third or fourth party candidates like Gary Johnson or Joe Steele and then you go 'Oh, I was surprised by what happened,' well, you shouldn't be. 'Because idiots like you voted for a third or fourth party candidate and they don't know how how the system works: two choices.' President Barack Obama speaks at his election night party last night in Chicago . Indeed, Matthews capped off a memorable evening for himself by praising Mitt Romney's concession speech instead of attacking President Obama's victory one. 'I mean, I thought Romney’s speech last night was a piece of wonder,' said Matthews. 'I thought the way he came out alone and stood in one, as they say on Broadway, right out there by himself — not with the wife, with the shoulder to cry on or any of that — stood out there with manliness and grace, and did absolutely everything right. ‘ . 'I called the President. I wish him well.’ This is out of the book. This is how you do it; it’s Biblical. And every single thing was classic, perfect.'","'I'm so glad we had that storm last week,' said MSNBC's Chris Matthews last night - claiming the storm helped President Obama gain re-election ."

An angler hooked two fish for the price of one when he caught a monster pike that had a 4ft long eel in its mouth. The greedy pike was in the middle of devouring the long slippery eel when he went for Mick Brown's plastic 'lure' fish he was using as bait. The veteran angler realised something felt very odd about the catch but was shocked when the two fish emerged from the water. This big: Angler Mick Brown was left stunned when he hooked two fish for the price of one when he caught a monster pike that had a large eel in its mouth . The pike spat out the perfectly intact, but dead eel on the bank and Mr Brown, 66, weighed it at 4lb 8ozs - 1lb heavier than his own personal best for an eel. He weighed and photographed the 17lb pike before returning it to the water safe and well. Mr Brown, a professional angler, had been filming a new type of bait when the extraordinary catch occurred at Langtoft Lakes in Cambridgeshire. Mr Brown, from Market Deeping, Lincolnshire, said: 'I have been fishing for as long as I can remember and this is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen. 'I had just started when I hooked this pike. 'It didn't feel quite right from the start, sort of like I had hooked a plastic bag under the water. I don't think the pike put up much of a fight because it was concentrating on the eel. 'I couldn't believe it when the pike broke the surface and had this eel in its throat. The lure was lodged down inside the pike's jaw and one of the hooks had latched onto the eel. 'Pike eating eels is not unusual but it is very rare indeed to catch one hanging out of its mouth. 'They normally quietly digest them over a number of days so it is very unusual for a pike to take a bait while eating something else. 'It would have been just sitting at the bottom of the lake quietly enjoying its meal when it saw the bait and decided to go for that as well. It must have just been greedy. 'When the temperatures are low like they are at the moment the eels get quite lethargic, so this one wouldn't have put up much of a fight.' Despite fishing in the same lake for the last 25 years, it is the largest eel Mr Brown has ever caught there by a pound. Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the Angling Trust, said pikes have massive appetites.and one of the joys of angling is when unexpected things like this happen. 'Pike are known for their appetite and will try and eat all sorts of other fish. I've never seen one eat an eel before but it doesn't surprise me,' he said. 'They'll eat small ducks, mice that fall into the water and frogs as well. 'They are savage predators and it is one of the great attractions of fishing for pike. A small pike eats three times its body weight in two days and they go after anything that moves.'","Pike was devouring long slippery eel when he went for plastic 'lure' fish .

Writ: Physiotherapist Paul Edwards, pictured, is suing the firm behind Willows Farm Village and Park after breaking his back on a trampoline in May last year . The Bank of England's in-house physiotherapist has launched a £300,000 compensation claim against a children's theme park after breaking his back in a trampolining accident. Paul Edwards, who provides physio for Sir Mervyn King and some of the nation's other top bankers, fractured his spine on a visit to Willows Farm Village and Park near St Albans, Hertfordshire. The incident happened in May last year. Mr Edwards, 40, from Chesham in Buckinghamshire, claims that he struck his back while bouncing because the trampoline was 'positioned too close to the ground below it'. He is suing park owners Bowmans Farms Ltd - who advertise that visitors to Willows Park will experience 'acres of fun' - for a minimum of £300,000 in damages. In a High Court writ, Mr Edwards says he was 'using a trampoline which he was permitted to use and was using it in a normal manner' when he injured his back. Mr Edwards, who runs his own physiotherapy clinic . in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, with his wife Nicky, as well as working . for the Bank of England since 2008,  had an annual membership to Willows Farm Village and the accident happened during a family visit to the park on a Sunday. The writ says: 'Mr Edwards was using a trampoline...when, after jumping upwards and then landing on the stretched fabric of the trampoline, he struck the ground beneath the fabric and suffered a serious injury to his back. 'His injuries were caused by negligence or breach of an implied term of the contract that the trampolining facilities would be safe for him to use,' it is alleged. Businessman: Mr Edwards, pictured with his wife Nicky, runs his own physiotherapist in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, as well as working for the Bank of England . Popular attraction: The Willows Farm Village website describes the park as 'acres of fun' Mr Edwards also claims that staff at the theme park had 'positioned the trampoline on a slope...so that it was too close to the ground below it, failed to place the trampoline on level ground (and) failed to ensure that there was sufficient distance between the stretched fabric component of the trampoline and the ground below it.' According to the writ, Mr Edwards suffered 'a serious injury to his back including a wedge compression fracture of the 12th thoratic vertebra.' In their defence to the action, Tanja Neuhof, for Bowmans Farms Ltd, said the company 'admits primary liability' for Mr Edwards' accident, but 'reserve the right to allege contributory negligence against him.'

The British presenter and YouTube comic - whose tongue-in-cheek 10 Reasons Why... series has had 4.6m hits, gained 30,000 subscribers, and prompted belly-laughs all over the world - has come up with a new list of theories pointing out the real reasons why you're still unattached.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Are you a single woman? Emily Hartridge is here to explain why . Are your cuddly toys turning men off you? Hartridge acknowledges that as a single woman herself she is essentially taking the mickey out of her own situation in the new video blog. Then again, she does seem to have found a handsome chap to assist her with her latest entry: adorable baby nephew Arlo. Sidekick Arlo ('I'm not sure how much help he's going to be since he can't stand up by himself') watches as his auntie rattles through the reasons why women are single, and they include drinking too much, smelling bad, looking a bit of a mess, being too fussy, and simply going after the wrong type of man. This week baby nephew Arlo helps Emily explain why single women stay... single . Filming in high definition camera for the first time, the popular (and often controversial) chatterbox explains that there is 'a certain stigma' attached to being single. She goes on to demonstrate why being too needy is 'apparently not an attractive quality in a woman'; how owning too many cuddly toys and 'treating them like people' can be quite frightening to a man; that 'getting smashed' alcohol is for some reason not pretty; that men can be scared of a woman's success; that men can be scared of a woman's face; and that bad smell can put off a man. Drinking too much is apparently not an attractive quality in a woman . Emily Hartridge says perhaps you smell, are too needy and need to many compliments... Maybe 'you slept with them too quickly and didn't make them earn it', or perhaps you're too fussy and pick holes in every man you see... or could it be that you simply pick the wrong guys?

The best-selling horror author James Herbert, described as ‘one of the giants of popular fiction’, died yesterday aged 69. Mr Herbert, who wrote horror classic The Rats, died only a week after his 23rd novel, Ash, was published. He was prolific, releasing a new novel almost every year between 1974 and 1988, but said he remained ‘very insecure’ about his skills as a writer. His fans disagreed and he sold more than 54million books and was translated into 34 languages. Acclaimed: Best selling author James Herbert has died at his Sussex home aged 69, his publisher announced today . A spokesman for his publisher Pan Macmillan said Mr Herbert died peacefully in bed at his home in Sussex yesterday morning. No cause of death was given but the spokesman said he had not been ill. He is survived by Eileen, his wife of 46 years, and their three daughters Kerry, Emma and Casey. Jeremy Trevathan, his publisher of ten years, paid tribute to him as an author with a ‘rare distinction’. ‘Jim Herbert was one of the keystone authors in a genre that had its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s,’ he said. Popular: Several of Mr Herbert's books including classic The Rats, were made into films . ‘It’s a true testament to his . writing and his enduring creativity that his books continued to be huge . bestsellers right up until his death. ‘He has the rare distinction that his . novels were considered classics of the genre within his lifetime. His . death marks the passing of one of the giants of popular fiction in the . 20th century.’ The youngest of three brothers, Mr . Herbert was born and raised in the East End of London. His childhood was . what he later described as a ‘hand to mouth’ existence. As a boy he often told dark stories . to entertain his friends, inspired by watching the rats running in the . bomb sites around them. After school and art college Mr Herbert worked for an advertising agency. Booker Prize winning author Salman Rushdie worked at the same agency at the same time. He wrote his first novel, The Rats, . aged 28. The book, which depicted a London overrun by mutant, . flesh-eating rodents, was rejected by the first five publishers he sent . it to. When it was published in 1974 it was an immediate hit - the first printing of 100,000 copies sold out in three weeks. The book is said to have been based on a . line in Dracula in which a lunatic says that he has seen 1,000 rats with . red eyes staring up from the lawn. Among his other novels were The Magic Cottage and The Secret of Crickley Hall. Four of his books were made into films. The Magic Cottage was dramatised for Radio 4. His 23rd novel, Ash, the tale of a paranormal detective who is sent to investigate the crucifixion of a man in a locked room at a remote Scottish castle, was published last week.

Another, Peter James, wrote: 'Deeply saddened to hear today that my dear friend, writer James Herbert, died last night. Will miss you lots, Jim, you were a diamond.' Almost 3,000 fans have left messages in tribute to Mr Herbert on his official Facebook page since the news of his death was announced. One, Gary Alcock, wrote: 'I've been reading his books since I was 13 years old. 'I remember picking up a copy of The Rats in a second hand book shop back in 1985 and was hooked for life. Gutted.' The critically acclaimed author has been the UK's bestselling horror writer since his first novel The Rats in 1974.

A daring photographer managed to hold his ground to take these spectacular pictures of an elephant - despite it charging straight towards him. Incredibly, Ben Cranke sat unfazed in his camp chair as the five-tonne male dashed out of the savannah and stampeded into the water. The pair came within just 30 feet of each other during a tense stand-off at the Savuti Game Reserve, Chobe National Park, Botswana. Stand back! Photographer Ben Cranke incurred the displeasure of this elephant at Savuti Game Reserve in Botswana which decided to charge at the 48-year-old to show him who's boss . Too close for comfort: The five-tonne fully-grown male raises its ears into a V position to show it threatening the photographer while splashing water at him . But the 48-year-old from Chingford, Essex, held his nerve as the elephant rushed at him, knowing from experience that the first is usually a mock attack. The fully-grown animal - which towered . 12 ft high - charged at Mr Cranke three times before concluding he posed . no threat and calmly walked away. He said: 'It was a blistering hot day and I was sheltering from the heat in the deep shade of a Camelthorn tree, right next to the Savuti channel. 'This elephant walked out of surrounding savannah, down to water's edge on the opposite bank to drink. 'I sat quietly in my camp chair, not moving a muscle, enjoying the experience of being 20 or so metres (65ft) from such a majestic animal. Making a splash: The elephants marks its territory and gives photographer Ben Cranke a hosing down in a tense stand-off at the reserve in the Chobe National Park . 'I had been upwind from him, so remained undetected - but as the breeze shifted, he caught my scent. 'He immediately turned to face me and seeing I was close, he charged without warning straight into the channel in an attempt to scare me off. 'I had suspected he may do this so had quietly adjusted my camera settings to freeze the action of his charge. 'Having spent a lot of time around elephants on foot before, I also thought his charge would be a mock charge, so when he did charge I did not move apart from raising my camera to shoot a burst of frames. 'I must admit to having a few moments of thinking ""Have I got it right?"", ""Is this going to be a mockie?"" If I had this wrong I had no chance of escape.' But after a few tense moments as the fully-grown male elephant charged towards him, it slowed down - eventually stopping just a few metres from where Mr Cranke was sat. Lucky escape: Fortunately for Mr Cranke, the charge was just a 'mock attack' and the elephant left him alone when it realised he wasn't a threat . He added: 'Fortunately, he proved me right by stopping short after a few metres of charging into the water. 'He backed off a short distance for a half a minute or so before he charged again, thrashing the water with his trunk and spraying water in my direction. 'I changed my camera from landscape to portrait framing and shot another series of frames, still remaining seating in my camp chair. 'He backed off again, watched for a short while and then charged for the third time - again splashing and spraying water at me. 'This time, he came within 10 metres (30ft) of where I sat quietly, apart from raising my camera. 'After this third charge I suspect the bull realised I was not a threat because he backed off to the opposite edge of the channel. 'He watched me curiously from the bank and splashed himself with some water to cool off. 'He also had a long drink before moving off and disappearing back into the bush from where he had come. 'It was only at this point that I returned to my camp site - in search of a cold beer and with a big smile on my face. What a privileged experience that had been.' Quite an ordeal: The pair got within 30ft of each other during the confrontation.

More young black men die as a result of murder than those killed as a result of suicide, accidents and disease put together, a shocking new article has claimed. The report, by a professor at Florida Atlantic University, showed that murder was 'by far and away' the leading cause of death among young black men. By contrast, the article, published in the April issue of the American Journal of Medicine, revealed, young, non-black men of all ethnicities were also 'by far and away' most likely to die in accidents. A shocking article by Florida Atlantic University physician Charles H Hennekens says the vast majority of young black American men who die do so because of murder . Charles H Hennekens, the report's author, called the findings - and his article - 'the new American tragedy', and described the death of so many young black men by murder as 'a devastating epidemic'. He said black men were six times more like to die as a result of murder and seven times more likely to commit murder than their white counterparts. Dr Hennekens also provided the shocking statistic that while only one-eighth of the American population was black, half of the country's homicide victims are black, giving them a reduced life expectancy of more than six years. Citing figures covering the deaths of young men aged 15-34 between 1999 and 2009, the physician said there were 106,271 homicides, 85% (89,887) of them among men and 49% (52,265) of them among black men. Even in states with relatively low levels of young black men being murdered, the figure still soared above that of those killed in accidents. Dr Hennekens, of FAU's school of medicine, compiled statistics from several sources to write his article. Dr Hennekens says the issue of murders due to gun crime must be addressed by policy-makers (file photos) Dr Hennekens says firearms are a major factor in the murders of young black men - 91 per cent of such murders involve guns . Addressing the issue of firearms, he said 91% of murders among black men were as a result of guns, and said it was the duty of doctors to identify risks to public health and bring their findings to the attention of policy-makers, 'even if the threats are lawful'. He added: 'For example, cigarettes are both lawful and popular, but public health support of laws controlling their exposure to the general population has contributed to the reduction of the premature mortality they cause.' Dr Hennekens said: 'Death is inevitable, but premature death is not, including among young black men.'","Article entitled A New American Tragedy says most non-black men die in accidents .

KFC is taking the hassle out of eating chicken on the bone, by stripping the organ out of the meat completely. In case eating the fast food wasn’t easy enough, the chain is introducing deep-fried boneless chicken pieces on April 14. The calorie-laden snack will become an alternative to its traditional breast, thigh and drumstick pieces, which can contain up to 490 calories for the extra crispy version. Making fast food faster: KFC reveals its new boneless chicken options, as an alternative to breasts, thighs and drumsticks . The new offering reflects the growing popularity of nuggets and strips that are easier to eat on the go, as well as its consumers' seemingly endless desire for more convenient foods. KFC says nearly four out of five servings of chicken sold in the U.S. are now boneless.Based on customer trends, the chain says bones could eventually disappear from its menu. ""Younger people don't tend to be fans of bones — they've grown up with nuggets,"" said KFC spokesman Rick Maynard, referring to people in their 20s and 30s. Although KFC has more than 18,000 locations worldwide, the boneless chicken will only be offered in its 4,500 U.S. locations. The new chicken, which is skinless and comes in white or dark meat, are whole muscle pieces fileted off the bone and are about twice the size of KFC's crispy strips. Consumer demand: KFC's spokesman said that young people don't like bones (boneless chicken pictured) Customers will be able to order them for the chain's meal deals, which include two pieces of chicken, a side, a biscuit and a drink for $4.99. They also come in buckets, which include four pieces of boneless chicken and six pieces of breasts, thighs and drumsticks for $14.99. The boneless chicken option costs the same as the regular fried chicken. A piece of the boneless white meat has 200 calories and 8 grams of fat. A dark meat piece has 250 calories. Even before the latest launch, KFC had already been shifting its menu to more boneless offerings. It rolled out smaller chicken ""Bites"" last year, as well as ""Dip'ems,"" which are strips of chicken with a variety of sauces. The chain had also been offering the chicken filets used in its sandwiches as a stand-alone, handheld option. The chain says those will be phased out and that the new boneless pieces will be used in sandwiches. KFC says it took two to three years to develop its version of boneless chicken, which performed strongly in test markets including Oklahoma City and Omaha last year. Like McDonald's and Burger King, chicken chain Chick-Fil-A offers nuggets, strips and sandwiches but doesn't list any chicken pieces with bones on its menu. Although McDonald's recently tested chicken wings at select locations, the world's biggest hamburger chain has also focused on convenient options such as its new chicken McWraps and chicken McBites that come in portable cartons. Howard Penney, a food industry analyst for Hedgeye Risk Management, noted that KFC has been struggling in the U.S. and that it has nothing to lose with the latest move. Struggling fast food chain: KFC is owned by Yum Brands Inc, which saw its share price fall 3.2 per cent in morning trading . Even in the wings category, Penney noted that boneless varieties have been growing in popularity.""People don't want to have to deal with the bones,"" Penney said. KFC is owned by Yum Brands Inc., which also operates Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. Despite its choppy performance in the U.S., Yum has enjoyed a streak of growth for the past several years as a result of its growing presence in China. Yum is the largest Western fast-food operator in the country with about 5,300 locations, most of them KFC restaurants. But since late last year, Yum has been working to overcome a scare over its chicken supply that has hammered sales in China. Yum, based in Louisville, Ky., has warned that it expects its profit in 2013 to decline, snapping an 11-year streak of double-digit growth. Shares of Yum Brands fell $2.17, or 3.2 percent, to $65.58 in morning trading as broad market indicators sagged on weaker than expected U.S. job growth in March.","'Young people don't tend to be fans of bones', KFC spokesman said .

Her appearance comes just days before a book with details about her alleged secret abortion is published . The author of a book that will damage the Spanish royal family with allegations Princess Letizia had a secret abortion has defended writing it. David Rocasolano accuses the wife of the heir to the throne of having an abortion and then covering it up in Goodbye, Princess, which is out on Monday. In an interview with Spanish website Vanitati, Mr Rocasolano says he is just outlining 'the facts I lived' and claims it is not a personal attack on the princess. He said: 'Perhaps this book will only bring me problems. 'I do not know why I wrote ... Every day I think of a different reason. 'Think what you want. What I think is clear is that Goodbye, Princess is not a book written against a person. 'It is not a book against Letizia nor do I hold any grudge. 'It is a book against an institution, if you want. Or maybe against the institutions of this country.' The book includes intimate information about Princess Letizia life before she married Crown Prince Felipe in 2004. It . claims she had an abortion in 2002 - before she . met the Crown Prince - and that she tried to cover this up before her . engagement was announced. Princess . Letizia, a former newsreader and divorcee, allegedly asked for . paperwork detailing the abortion to be destroyed, according to the book. Mr . Rocasolano said he was asked by the Princess and Prince Felipe to carry out the task. The abortion is alleged to have taken place at a time when terminations were still illegal in Spain - unless . there was abnormality or the mother's life or mental well being were significantly threatened. The book, Goodbye Princess, was written by her cousin, David Rocasolano . He is also candid about his desire to make money from the book. When asked if he wrote it for money, he asked his interviewer: 'Do you love doing this interview for art's sake?' Despite the book's publication in a few days Spain's Princess Letizia appeared calm and relaxed when she appeared at a literary awards ceremony in Madrid yesterday. Dressed in a chic black pantsuit and a scoop-neck embellished camisole and heels, the Princess greeted attendees and spoke to the audience at the El Barco de Vapor' Children and Youth Literary Awards in the Spanish capital. The publication comes at a difficult time for the . royal family after Princess Cristina - Crown Prince Felipe's sister - . was implicated in a fraud case. The Princess's cousin is unrepentant about the book and the allegations it contains . The book is believed to portray the Princess as an 'obsessive' person who is suspicious of her relatives. It . claims the Princess, 40, thought one of her family had been leaking . stories about her to the press and that she told some of them she was . pregnant with a boy in 2005 - when she was actually pregnant with a girl . - to test this out, according to the Telegraph. Princess Letizia was criticized by some in Spain when she married Crown Prince Felipe as she was a divorcee and a commoner. Demands have been made for an investigation into the allegations - which could further damage the royal family's public image. A spokesman for the family said it had no comment to make on the book. The potential embarrassment Princess Cristina, 47 - one of King Juan Carlos's three children - will be called in for questioning later this month, a court in Palma de Mallorca has announced. She . will be quizzed over claims her husband Inaki Urdangarin, 45, and his . former business partner Diego Torres, 47, embezzled cash from public . funds.

Christopher Murray, 25, was known as the 'green skull man' after he sported a luminous Halloween mask to terrify his victims. But when police found the mask dumped at the roadside following a knifepoint raid, they carried out DNA tests and trawled the social networking site for Murray's profile. Christopher Murray was caught when officers found a picture he had posted on Facebook wearing his glow-in-the-dark disguise . Officers eventually found a picture of him posing on his profile page wearing the same mask and flicking V signs at the camera. Today Lancashire Police released the photo of Murray as he began a five year jail term. One officer said: 'The DNA evidence was clear cut but this man will feel a prize chump for posting a picture of himself posing with his own disguise for all the world to see. 'It's an extremely distinctive mask and you would have thought he would be keen to keep it to himself - not splash it over the internet. It just goes to show the idiotic lengths some criminal will go to to brag about their crimes.' The raid occurred on January 7 at 8pm when a 51-year old woman was returning to her £20,000 Mini Cooper after a shopping trip at Sainsbury's in Darwen, Lancashire. Bolton Crown Court heard that Murray put on his mask and high visibility jacket then ambushed the woman as she put her shopping in her car. He threatened her with a kitchen knife before demanding her keys but ran off when he couldn't start the car. He ditched the jacket and mask but was linked to the crime when his DNA was found in saliva inside the mask. It emerged he had targeted a couple on New Year's Day, who had parked their Peugeot 307 outside a Spar store in Bolton. Murray, who has 32 convictions for 70 offences, was jailed for five years at Bolton Crown Court . The driver was inside the shop when Murray leapt into the vehicle and threatened the driver's wife, who was sat in the passenger seat, with a knife. She fled and ran to her husband virtually 'unable to breathe' while Murray sped off in their car. The vehicle was found in Darwen later with false registration plates. Murray, who has 32 convictions for 70 offences, had only been out of jail for a few months when he was arrested. In April 2012 he was jailed for 16 months after he knocked down and injured a firefighter while stealing a Saab from outside Darwen Fire Station.

MPs have been told they can claim up to £3,750 if they want to take part in today’s Commons tributes to Baroness Thatcher. Expenses chiefs emailed all 650 MPs to tell them they can receive the sum to cover the cost of returning from their Easter holidays. Critics say the debate could have been held next week when Parliament  returns from its recess. There is nothing to stop MPs covering the cost of attending today’s session themselves. The Union Flag was lowered to half mast over Portcullis House on Monday to mark the death of the former Conservative Prime Minister, which will be debated in the Commons today . Commons Speaker John Bercow announced Parliament would be recalled to allow MPs to pay tribute to Baroness Thatcher, who died on Monday aged 87. Under rules covering emergency recalls, MPs can claim travel expenses to return from anywhere in the world. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) said that, in line with normal rules, MPs were entitled to claim up to £3,750 for their journeys back to Westminster. The money can be used by an MP to bring back their whole family early from a holiday overseas. Or they can claim to return to . Westminster and then jet back to their holiday resort. Peers are able to . claim their £300 daily attendance allowance. An Ipsa spokesman said that some MPs . could well have been out of the country when the recall was announced . and that it was ‘reasonable’ that they should be reimbursed for the cost . of returning. ‘If Parliament is recalled, MPs can claim the cost of getting to Parliament,’ the spokesman said. Former Labour minister John Healey (left) accused Mr Cameron of hijacking Parliament's recall for political gain . while Labour MP Ronnie Campbell said he would rather be in a 'torture . chamber' than join the debate . When Parliament was recalled after the summer riots in August 2011, extra costs also included £32,228.56 for extra Hansard staff to record the debates, £5,000 in overtime for Met Police and £6,039 for tour guides. Ronnie . Campbell, MP for Blyth Valley in Northumberland, told BBC Radio 4 he . would 'rather be put in the torture chamber' than attend today's debate. 'Why . we’re being recalled at all this expense beggars belief. We could have . done it next week. All this this afternoon is to heap praise on Margaret . Thatcher. We could have done that next week.' Former Labour minister John Healey said he would boycott the tribute session, and accused David Cameron of hijacking Baroness Thatcher's death for political gain. Writing for PoliticsHome, he . said: ‘Her death could and should have been marked when the Commons . returns next week… Parliament is being used today for narrow political . gain by the Prime Minister, as a platform for his Party’s ideology not . just eulogy.’ Foreign Secretary William Hague defended the cost of the debate, and next Wednesday's funeral. 'It's . right Parliament meets and commemorates such a leader of historic . proportions in our country's history,' he told BBC Breakfast. 'She . changed the course of our history and there have been many comments . over the last few days from all corners of the political spectrum. 'When . it comes to money, the rebate she negotiated for this country from the . EU has brought us so far £75 billion - which is twice the size of our . annual defence budget. 'I think that puts money in perspective... so I think we can afford to contribute to a funeral.' Tory MP Penny Mourdant also defended the cost of recalling Parliament. She told Sky News: 'The cost stuff that's been running is not really fair. If people are the other side of the world and Parliament has to be recalled, IPSA pay money to get those people back if they need to be there. If people are on a select committee visit or whatever, I don't think they'll be coming back to speak in the debate this afternoon. 'I'm speaking in the debate. I'm not claiming any expenses for turning up and speaking and I really think it gives us the option.'","All 650 MPs told they can receive up to £3,750 after Parliament was recalled .

A pregnant mother was held captive for three days by men she paid to smuggle her across the U.S. border so she could be reunited with her family. Zoila Figueroa, 28, from El Salvador, was blindfolded, bound and gagged by smugglers known as 'coyotes' who she had paid $1,500 to guide her across the Rio Grande and into Texas. Her husband Jorge, who lives in Long Island with her American-born son, was made to pay a ransom on $3,990 for her safe return, after the men threatened to kill her. Zoila Figueroa was trying to cross the Mexico-U.S. border when she was kidnapped by the men she had paid to help her . Mrs Figueroa, who was expecting her third child at the time, told the New York Daily News: ‘They were threatening me with a gun, pointed right to my stomach. ‘They threatened me. They said if my husband didn’t pay ransom they were going to take out my baby. They were going to take out the baby alive and then they were going to kill me.’ Mrs Figueroa had paid the smugglers in March 2012 in an attempt to return to the U.S. to be reunited with her husband and her autistic son in Roosevelt, Long Island. The men, who called each other El Jefe and Juan, drove her part of the way across a bridge linking Reynosa, Mexico and Hidalgo, Texas before stopping at the bridge and making her climb down a rope into a sugar cane field. Captors held a gun to the stomach of pregnant Zoila Figueroa and threatened to kill her unless a ransom was paid . Pregnant Mrs Figueroa lost her grip and fell, injuring her back.

Trapped in a sinking car, your commanding officer, Dunn - whose leg is uncompromisingly wedged in the wreckage - passes you his gun and orders you to shoot out the window. The windscreen starts to crack as the pressure increases. Your other two comrades are screaming at you to ignore his pleas but you know what must be done. Raising the weapon, you fire before the screen goes black. Life-like: DICE says that the Frostbite 3 engine allows for more realistic animations and the level of detail is some of the best we've seen. This is to complement a much more emotional story . Welcome to Battlefield 4. Or, as the gameplay demonstration would have us believe, Medal of Duty: Warfighter Ops III. Indeed, although absolutely stunning to look at, it was impossible to ignore both Call of Duty's and the (late) Medal of Honor series' influence on Battlefield 4's level structure and gameplay. Namely, the frequent set-pieces (which sees helicopters explode in slow-motion, car chases, more helicopters exploding), the soundtrack, the Hollywood talent (none other than The Wire's Michael K. Williams) and an overarching emphasis on developing bonds with your team-mates. No matter, as COD is a proven winning formula. In Battlefield 4, based in the same universe as its predecessor, you play Recker - part of the Tombstone squad. The demo, which showed off the game's prologue, sees the team in Azerbaijan, trying to escape while under fire from Russian soldiers. Immediately evident are the environments, which art director Gustav Tilleby calls an 'agresssive world'. Interestingly, the overall look has been inspired by car adverts - creating bright, dynamic worlds that contrast with the dark subject matter. Everything in the environment reacts to each other, too. The Frostbite 3 engine allows particles, foliage and cloth to be affected by explosions as well as standard-fare destructive environments. Aggressive world: Interestingly, the art director has said that car adverts inspired the overall look of the game. The entire demo had a Hollywood sheen which made the battlegrounds look more inviting . Thankfully, unlike in Battlefield 3, the single-player makes the most out of these. You can use explosions to create new paths, then use the new 'designate target' function and get your team to cover your flanking maneuver. DICE have made it clear that multiplayer has had a huge impact on the single-player campaign - offering the freedom of movement and choice many thought was missing from the previous game. Also improved are the vehicle sections. The demo saw the player driving two cars - a 4x4 and armed buggy (although the lack of animation when both entering the car and using the on-board turret was less than impressive), while the teaser trailer clearly showed you in control of a dinghy alongside a large aircraft carrier. Unfortunately, the 17-minute demo footage was most likely using a high-powered PC so if the game was to arrive on current gen, visuals will look noticeably worse. There is no date penned for release although it is expected to arrive at the end of the year. SEE THE BATTLEFIELD 4 GAMEPLAY FOR YOURSELF: .

A SINGLE mother caught with £2million worth of  cannabis in her home has been spared jail. When detectives raided Lisa Dolan’s home and found 450lb of cannabis resin hidden in bags, she told them: ‘It’s not mine – I’m minding it for a couple days for £500.’ The 39-year-old added that she had hidden the vast haul – which made her home in Liverpool ‘positively hum’ with the odour – because it would be ‘easy money’. But in an extraordinary decision, a judge allowed her to walk free from court with a suspended prison sentence. After hearing her 13-year-old son would be taken into care if Dolan went to prison – the boy’s father is already behind bars – Judge Stephen Clark took pity on her. ‘We know compassion is a dirty word, but there is still room for it,’ he said. The case comes after police chiefs were criticised for quietly introducing a softer policy on illegal drug taking. Yesterday anti-drugs campaigners criticised the sentence. They said it sent out the wrong message at a time of mounting fears about the health effects of super-strong ‘skunk’ cannabis. Dolan’s terraced house in a run-down estate in Netherton, Merseyside, was raided in November and 2,000 blocks of cannabis were found in packages and bags. The total weight was 204kg (450lb) with a potential street value of £2million, Liverpool Crown Court was told. Ben Jones, prosecuting, said the house ‘positively hummed’ with the odour of the cannabis. ‘She must have been aware of the quantity,’ he added. Dolan, who is believed to be unemployed, initially told police she was ‘minding’ the drugs for a man she barely knew called ‘Jim’ and for only a couple of days. The court heard that Dolan was the sole carer for her 13-year-old son, who faced being taken into care if she went to prison . However the court was told that she . had since admitted she was aware of the identity of the person who asked . her to hide them, and a separate prosecution is understood to be in . progress. Mr Jones said she blamed being behind on loan  repayments and . financial difficulties from her son’s father being in prison. ‘She said . she fell to the temptation of easy money,’ he added. Charlotte Kenny, defending, said Dolan was worried about both her son and her father, who requires kidney dialysis. ‘She did not appreciate the scale of . the offence,’ she added. ‘Her main concern was to provide for her son . and she is greatly concerned about him having to go into care.’ Dolan's suspended sentence comes after Judge Peter Bowers let a convicted paedophile and a burglar walk free from court with suspended jail terms . Dolan, who sobbed in the dock, pleaded . guilty to possessing cannabis with intent to supply. Judge Clark told . her: ‘I don’t know what you were thinking to get yourself involved. I . presume you were under pressure and felt some loyalty.’ But he said he wasn’t going to send . her to prison, describing her as a hard-working woman who played a big . part in helping her family and pointing out she had no previous . convictions. ‘Your concerns throughout have been . for your son,’ he said. ‘You realise now how appallingly you let him . down. I don’t think you will be back before the courts again.’ He imposed a 20-month suspended sentence along with 120 hours’ unpaid work. Yesterday anti-drug campaigner Mary . Brett, of Cannabis Skunk Sense, said: ‘This sentence sends out . completely the wrong message – dealers will feel nothing’s going to . happen to them. ‘Today’s strong varieties of cannabis . lead to psychosis and violence, and I would have thought that at the . very least a short, sharp shock of a jail sentence would be appropriate . for possessing such a shocking amount.’ New drugs sentencing guidelines . published last year were branded ‘soft justice’ after it emerged that . dealers could be spared jail even if they are arrested with as much as . 6kg (13lb) of cannabis.","Lisa Dolan, 39, was a first-time offender who was in financial trouble .

Only 6 per cent of those questioned would trust the Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove . Parents are concerned about the effect the Government is having on their child's education, a poll suggests. Around one in 12 (8 per cent) parents think that the coalition has had a positive impact on the education system since it took power, while almost half (44 per cent) said the impact has been negative. The survey of around 2,000 adults, commissioned by the National Union of Teachers (NUT), indicates that the majority would entrust their child's education to school leaders. Asked who, other than themselves, they trust the most to educate their son or daughter, more than half (59 per cent) of those questioned said head teachers, followed by the local authority (16 per cent) and school governors (13 per cent). Around 6 per cent said they would trust the Secretary of State for Education, a post currently held by Michael Gove, and the same proportion said they would trust an academy chain. The poll also reveals that just 2 per cent believe politicians should be able to prescribe what teachers teach, while a third (35 per cent) said teachers should be able to exercise their professional judgment to meet the needs of their pupils. The survey comes as the NUT meets for its annual conference in Liverpool. NUT general secretary Christine Blower said: 'The fact that only 8 per cent of parents think that the Government has had a positive impact on the education system is very significant.' She added: 'It appears that it is now only the Secretary of State who believes that his policies are taking education in the right direction. Michael Gove's proposals for examination reform, the national curriculum and academies and free schools are all being questioned.' The poll shows that Mr Gove 'does not have the confidence of the profession or parents', Ms Blower said. Nearly half of parents don't trust the coalition with their child's education (stock image) Parents were also asked if they were in favour of the Government's plans to allow schools to decide on teachers' pay - a key issue in the NUT's current dispute with the Government. One in four (25 per cent) said that every school should have to set its own pay system, while 60% were in favour of a national pay system for all teachers. Ms Blower acknowledged that the survey had not asked parents if they would back teachers if they proceeded with strike action over pay. The NUT and NASUWT teaching unions are proposing to stage a series of regional walkouts, followed by a national stoppage before Christmas in a continuing row over pay, pensions and workload. She said that if they were to ask 'do you want your child's teacher to go on strike?'the 'greatest likelihood' is that they would say no. General Secretary of the NUT Christine Blower said that strike action disrupts a child's education and should be avoided when possible . 'Strike action inconveniences people,' Ms Blower said. But she added that the action was not just about pay and pensions, but also workload and ""the umbrella question underlying it, which is, 'is what's being done to your children's education the right thing?'."" Ms Blower said the NUT is planning a series of rallies to meet parents, governors and young people to ask, ""do you think what's going on in education is right?"". A Department for Education spokesman said: 'This survey in fact demonstrates the high level of parental support for our reforms. 'Almost two-thirds of parents want heads and teachers running their schools, rather than councils - that is why we have given schools more freedom than ever before to do just that through our academies programme. 'Our new national curriculum will be significantly slimmer than the current one, and does not tell teachers how to teach its content - this poll finds that 98 per cent of parents support us in that. 'Additionally, the vast majority of our new free schools are so popular with parents that they are over-subscribed. 'There is much to do but our package of reforms will again give all parents the confidence that their child is receiving the first-class education they deserve.' The YouGov poll questioned 2,008 adults between March 12 and 18.","Only 8% of parents think that the coalition has had a positive impact .

North American monarch butterflies migrate across the continent without an internal map, according to new research. The butterflies travel from Canada and the United States to Mexico using basic orientation techniques and landmarks to find their way - as opposed to the internal maps they were previously though to use. Researchers from the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, believe that the insects also use an ‘internal compass’ which enables them to navigate to their wintering sites using the position of the sun and the Earth’s magnetic field. North American monarch butterflies migrate across the continent without the internal map they were previously though to have . The butterflies are found in North America, New Zealand, Australia and parts of Western Europe. They have a wingspan of 8.9 to 10.2cm and are famous for their migration from Canada and the U.S. to Mexico and then back. They start their southward migration with the first frost and then return in spring. The length of the journey exceeds the lifespan of most butterflies - which is less than two months - so a full migration cycle involves a number of generations. They migrate south because they cannot withstand freezing temperatures and they return north because the larval food plants they need do not grow in their overwintering sites. The team analysed more than 50 years' worth of migration data in an attempt to learn how monarchs find their . way to their wintering habitat in Mexico – a journey they make just part of during their lifetime. They discovered that when the butterflies are blown off course, they most likely use major geographic landmarks to help them get back on track. The researchers believe that this is necessary as the butterflies cannot detect longitudinal displacements so would otherwise get lost on the journey. To test whether monarchs could detect longitude displacements, the team, led by undergraduate student Rachael Derbyshire, examined the butterflies' flight patterns in a funnel on the University of Guelph campus. They then tested the same monarchs in Calgary. ‘The monarchs we tested in Guelph flew southwest, in the general direction of Mexico,’ said Ms Derbyshire. ‘When we tested them in Calgary, they flew in the same general direction as if they were in Ontario, suggesting that they did not know they had been displaced 2,500 kilometres.’ The team also studied data from monarchs tagged and recaptured throughout North America from 1952 to 2004, and found that migrating monarchs do not use an internal map to reach Mexico. The butterflies travel from Canada and the United States to Mexico using basic orientation techniques and landmarks to find their way . To discovered whether monarchs can detect longitude displacements the team examined their flight patterns in a funnel (pictured) Instead, they use landmarks, such as coastlines and the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains.‘Given the challenge of this migratory journey and the fact that these insects are less than a gram, it is a remarkably simple system they used to travel thousands of kilometres to a site they have never seen,’ said Professor Ryan Norris. Despite the new findings, one question remains unanswered – monarch butterflies use the same sites in the highlands of central Mexico each year but no one knows exactly how they pinpoint these exact locations. Ms Derbyshire said: ‘One possibility we think is likely, and would need to be tested, is that they - like some other migratory animals - use smell to guide them to their final destination.’","The butterflies migrate without the internal map people thought they had .

Ancient warriors were far more adept at making bronze weapons that previously thought, a new analysis of a huge battering ram on a 2,000 year-old warship has found. Known as the Belgammel Ram, the 20kg artefact was discovered by a group of British divers off the coast of Libya near Tobruk in 1964. A British team has now completed the first analysis and 3D scan of the ram - and say it was cast in a single piece using advanced techniques for the time. Known as the Belgammel Ram, the 20kg artefact was discovered by a group of British divers off the coast of Libya near Tobruk in 1964 . An artist's impression of the Belgammel bow on the from of a ship . The Belgammel Ram was found by a group . of three British service sports divers off the coast of Libya at the . mouth of a valley called Waddi Belgammel, near Tobruk. Using a rubber . dinghy and rope they dragged it 25 metres to the surface. It was brought . home to the UK as a souvenir but when the divers discovered that it was . a rare antiquity, the ram was loaned to the Fitzwilliam Museum, . Cambridge. Ken Oliver is the only surviving member . of that group of three and the effective owner. He decided in 2007 that . is should be returned to a museum in Libya. With the help of the British . Society for Libyan Studies this was arranged in 2010. The Libyan uprising of 2011 resulted in . many battles in the area around the museum, but fortunately the museum . suffered no damage. The ram is from a small Greek or Roman warship – a 'tesseraria'. These ships were equipped with massive bronze rams on the bow at the waterline and were used for ramming the side timbers of enemy ships. At 65cm long, the Belgammel Ram is smaller in size and would have been sited on the upper level on the bow. This second ram is known as a proembolion, which strengthened the bow and also served to break the oars of an enemy ship. Dr Nic Flemming a visiting fellow of the National Oceanography Centre, co-ordinated a team of specialists from five institutes to analyse the artefact before it was returned to the National Museum in Tripoli in May 2010. Experts were stunned to find it was made in one piece. 'Casting a large alloy object weighing . more than 20kg is not easy. 'To find out how it was done we needed . specialists who could analyse the mix of metals in the alloys; experts . who could study the internal crystal structure and the distribution of . gas bubbles; and scholars who could examine the classical literature and . other known examples of bronze castings. A series of experts analysed the ram. Dr Chris Hunt and Annita Antoniadou of Queen's University Belfast used radiocarbon dating of burnt wood found inside the ram to date it to between 100 BC to 100 AD. This date is consistent with the decorative style of the tridents and bird motive on the top of the ram, which were revealed in detail by laser-scanned images taken by archaeologist Dr Jon Adams of the University of Southampton. The X-ray team produced a 3-D image of the ram's internal structure using a machine capable of generating X-rays of 10 mevs to shine through 15cm of solid bronze. By rotating the ram on a turntable and making 360 images they created a complete 3-D replica of the ram similar to a medical CT scan. The revealed it it is possible that during its early . history the bronze would have been remelted and mixed with other bronze . on one or more occasions, perhaps when a warship was repaired or maybe . captured. Further analysis was carried out by . geochemists Professor Ian Croudace, Dr Rex Taylor and Dr Richard Pearce . at the University of Southampton Ocean and Earth Science (based at the . National Oceanography Centre). An X-ray image of the ram revealed the 3 fins porosity, allowing researchers to work out how it was made . Micro-drilled samples show that the . composition of the bronze was 87 per cent copper, 6 per cent tin and 7 . per cent lead. The concentrations of the different metals vary . throughout the casting. Scanning Electron. These results indicate the likelihood . that the Belgammel Ram was cast in one piece and cooled as a single . object, the team say. The thicker parts cooled more slowly than the thin parts so that . the crystal structure and number of bubbles trapped in the metal varies . from place to place. However, the researchers admit thy still do now know how the ram ended up on the seabed. 'We will never know why the Belgammel . Ram was on the seabed near Tobruk. 'There may have been a battle in the . area, a skirmish with pirates. It could be that it was cargo from an . ancient commercial vessel, about to be sold as salvage. 'The fragments of . wood inside the ram show signs of fire, and we now know that parts of . the bronze had been heated to a high temperature since it was cast which . caused the crystal structure to change.

Five-year-old Dauz disappeared from the Dausman family's fenced Collinsville yard in July last year. To the surprise of his heartbroken owners David, Alicia, and their two children David Jr., 3, and the dog's 'best friend' six-year-old Lilian, the pet traveled more than 900 miles to end up last month at an animal shelter in Fairfax. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Found: Five-year-old Dauz, pictured center with Lilian, 6, left, and David Jr., right, has been found months after he disappeared from the Dausman family's fenced Collinsville yard in July last year . 'He's the same dog, but he won't let us out of his sight. As we will not, either,' said Alicia Dausman, 35. The mother suspects Dauz, a purebred, was stolen by a friend's family member who was temporarily living with them, and that person took him to Virginia, according to Suburban Journals of Greater St. Louis. He was given to a man, who gifted the dog to his wife on her birthday. The couple, who called him 'Bruno,' took care of the pet but after a time he managed to escape and found his way to the shelter. Ms Dausman said she tried everything she could think of to locate the dog, posting his picture on her Facebook page, submitting weekly Craigslist ads, and contacting shelters and Italian greyhound rescue groups.

Ms Dausman said she couldn't believe her ears when the shelter called her, then the disbelief was replaced by elation that they would soon have their beloved pet back. 'I was so excited I had to pull over,' she told the news outlet. 'I got (Lilian) from school and she was walking down the hallway towards me. When I told her we found Dauz, she just stopped dead in her tracks.' She said the animal shelter insisted the dog was in good shape suggesting someone had been taking care of him.

Victim: Alice Hicks, 27, died from her injuries after her partner Daniel Day crashed her car while 'racing' on a country road . A motorist killed his girlfriend when he crashed her car while driving at 'vastly excessive speeds' on a country road, a court heard. Daniel Day, 34, was racing a Mini Cooper belonging to his partner Alice Hicks, 27, at up to 80mph when he lost control on a blind bend. The car swerved and skidded out of control before smashing into a Mazda driving in the opposite direction leaving trainee accountant Alice with fatal injuries. Day is facing jail after being . convicted of causing his girlfriend's death by dangerous driving. She . died a day after the collision. He . denied the offence but was convicted following a week-long trial at . Taunton Crown Court, with the jury reaching their guilty verdict in just . 40 minutes. Today Alice's devastated family welcomed the decision but said it would not bring their 'beautiful daughter' back. Proud mother Yvonne Hicks, 59, a receptionist from Bleadon Hill, Somerset, described her daughter as 'the centre of the family'. She said: 'I am just pleased with the outcome but nothing will ever bring her back. 'We . all miss her terribly, she was the centre of our lives, she did so much . for us all. We now need to think of all the happy times that we all had . together.' Taunton Crown . Court was told how Day 'revved' Alice's blue Mini Cooper as he drove . down the country road near Rooksbridge on September 24, 2011. Day . ignored 'ample warning signs', including four which said 'slow' and . another on a lamppost instructing him to 'reduce speed now' before . taking a blind bend. He approached the corner at speeds of up to 80mph according to witnesses, who described seeing him 'whizzing' past. Moments before the crash, driver Kevin Buck had stopped his Mercedes van around the bend as he waited to turn right into Biddisham, Somerset. Day, from Lower Weare, Somerset, swerved around the van, as well as a Ford Focus behind it before colliding with a Mazda driving in the opposite direction. Anguish: Alice's father Raymond Hicks had given his trainee accountant daughter his cap and gown from university to wear at her graduation . The jury was told Alice's convertible Mini was still travelling at speed on impact and had little or no chance of stopping when the driver saw stationary traffic. They also heard evidence that neither Day or Alice had been wearing their seat belt. Alice, who was sat in the front passenger seat, died from serious head injuries sustained when she was flung from the from the car. The driver of the Mazda survived. Witness Lucy Fulford, who was a passenger in a Honda Civic travelling in the opposite direction to the Mini prior to the smash. She told the jury: 'The speed shocked me. I saw the driver, he looked panicked. His arms were rigid and his eyes were wide. 'I smelt rubber.' Other witnesses estimated that the car had been travelling at between 70 and 90 mph before it went round the blind bend. Tests showed Day had not taken drugs or consumed alcohol before the smash and there were no faults with the Mini. Her brother Andrew Hicks said the jury's verdict proved Alice played no part in the accident. He added: 'We can never be happy because nothing will change the result. But this verdict shows Alice wasn't to blame. She was the centre of our lives.' Her father Raymond, 79, added that Alice was months away from graduating from an accountancy course at Weston College in Weston-super-Mare. The retired BT national sales training manager added: 'She died in the September but was due to graduate the following June.

An Irish midwife has apologised today for telling a woman who was suffering a miscarriage that she could not have a termination in Ireland because it was a 'Catholic thing'. Ann Maria Burke admitted she made the remark to Savita Halappanavar, originally from Belgaum in Karnataka, in University Hospital Galway but insisted she meant it in kindness. The patient later died of septicemia. The senior midwife said she used the reference to Catholic teaching after the 31-year-old dentist said she was Hindu and she would have ended her pregnancy in her home country. Midwife Ann Maria Burke, pictured outside Galway Coroners court, apologised for telling Savita Halappanavar she could not have a termination because it was a 'Catholic thing' Savita Halappanavar died of a heart attack caused by septicaemia after being refused an abortion and delivering a dead baby . 'I did mention it’s a Catholic country,' Ms Burke told Galway coroner Dr Ciaran MacLoughlin. 'I didn’t mention it in a hurtful context. It was in a conversation we had.' Ms Burke said she regrets making the statement, which the coroner said 'went around the world'. 'I’m sorry that I said it,' she added. Mrs Halappanavar, 31, was admitted to hospital on Sunday, October 21 and delivered a dead baby daughter three days later. She died the following Sunday of a heart attack caused by septicaemia due to E.coli. The inquest, in its third day at Galway courthouse, has heard claims that a consultant obstetrician, Dr Katherine Astbury, made the remark to Mrs Halappanavar and her husband Praveen, and also that the midwife said it. Dr Astbury, who was cross-examined over her treatment of Mrs Halappanavar for several hours today, denies using the phrase. But the consultant has admitted there were system failures in her care and she also warned of a lack of legal clarity for doctors treating pregnant women who suffer health risks. Mrs Halappanavar was 17 weeks pregnant when she was admitted to the hospital in pain. Asked by Mr Gleeson if it would have been . insensitive, uncivilised and wrong to use the word Catholic to the . patient, Dr Astbury said: 'It’s certainly not something I would say.' Dr Astbury revealed there is confusion over how her patient was cared for, including that she had been unaware of blood test abnormalities and that the patient’s vitals should have been checked more regularly after her foetal membrane ruptured. The senior medic was asked by coroner Dr Ciaran MacLoughlin if the two aspects of Mrs Halappanavar’s care could be seen as system failures and she replied 'yes'. Dr Astbury revealed that she initially refused a request from the Halappanavars to terminate the pregnancy two days after her admission to hospital as at that time there was no risk to her life. Praveen Halappanavar, pictured arriving at the inquest, collapsed and vomited after his wife's death . 'She was well,' said Dr Astbury under cross-examination. 'There was no risk to her life. If you need to give somebody medication to deliver and there’s a foetal heartbeat, my understanding is that legally you are considered to be terminating.' Dr Astbury spoke in a loud, clear voice as widower Praveen Halappanavar, who claims she made the Catholic remark, sat with his friend, a Galway-based consultant Dr CVR Prasad. She addressed the Irish Medical Council guidelines on abortion which refer to terminating a pregnancy if there is a risk to the mother’s life. She said her understanding was that they relate to conditions such as cancer, such as women getting radiotherapy, cervical care or a hysterectomy. 'My understanding is that this is a case where a woman is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, usually unrelated to the pregnancy,' she said. Dr MacLoughlin asked if there was confusion over the interpretation of the guidelines. 'There’s no law to tell you what you what is permitted or not permitted,' she replied. Dr Astbury admitted there were system failures in her care at Galway University Hospital (pictured) Savita Halappanavar and Praveen Halappanavar at an event for the Indian community in Galway . Dr Astbury insisted that when she told . Mrs Halappanavar she could not abort the baby on the Tuesday, she used . the words: 'In this country it is not legal to terminate a pregnancy on . grounds of poor prognosis of the foetus.' The . doctor agreed that in other jurisdictions Mrs Halappanavar would have . been offered the option of a termination if the prognosis of her foetus . was poor. 'The law in Ireland does not permit termination even if there’s no prospect of viability,' she said. Dr Astbury saw Mrs Halappanavar at . 8.30am on the Wednesday during her morning round, about two hours after a . junior colleague raised concerns over her vitals and condition and . suspected sepsis chorioamnionitis, an infection of the foetal membrane. She . said the patient’s temperature and pulse rate had fallen in that time . and that she had not been told of an earlier entry on the medical notes . highlighting a sign of chorioamnionitis. Dr . Astbury said that had she known this she would then have started the . steps for a termination, instead of ordering tests to check for a urine . infection. 'A medical termination usually takes several hours, but I would have started it,' she said.","Ann Maria Burke admitted using the words to Savita Halappanavar .

Police say that Staff Sgt Adam Arndt, . 31, shot himself at his Germantown, Maryland, home on Monday morning, . but not before he gunned high school student Michelle Miller, 17. Miller's father, Kevin Miller, told . The Associated Press that he had never met Arndt, but that . his daughter had seemed 'a little smitten with this guy.' Tragedy: Michelle Miller was shot dead by her recruiter, Staff Sgt Adam Arndt, after she rushed to be with him because he had threatened to kill himself . He said that his daughter left their home on Sunday night, telling her parents that she had to help 'a friend' in her platoon who was suicidal. Mr Miller exchanged several texts with his daughter after she left, but she wouldn't say where she was. He said she later stopped responding to his calls and text messages. But she did send texts to her friends - messages like 'I love you' and 'goodbye.' Fighting tears, Mr Miller told ABCNews.com: 'He shot her. She went to help him and he shot her for it.' Miss Miller was a senior at Rockville . High School, where she took advanced classes and played soccer and . lacrosse. She was heading to Arizona State University in the fall. Her father told ABC: 'She had a lot of . things going on. She was all set to go to boot camp in June, go to . initial training and then in January go to Arizona, but it's all over.' Watch video here . Scene of the crime: The bodies of Miller and Ardnt were found inside his Germantown, Maryland, home on Monday morning . Arndt was a nine-year veteran who had served overseas, the Army said on Tuesday. Miss Miller met him about four or five months ago as he signed her up to enter the Army Reserves, which she had joined to earn money for college. Kevin Miller said his daughter left their Rockville home on Sunday night, saying somebody in her platoon was suicidal. He said she stopped responding to his calls and text messages. Army recruiters are barred from . fraternizing with recruits, a restriction that includes dating, inviting . recruits to their homes or having any kind of personal relationship . that would place undue influence on a recruit, said Kathleen Welker, a . spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Recruiting Command. Gone too soon: Miller met Ardnt about four or five months ago as he signed her up to enter the Army Reserves, which she had joined to earn money for college . Arndt, a native of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, joined the Army in October 2003. He was deployed to Turkey from September 2009 to September 2010, and his decorations include a medal for service in the global war on terrorism. He has also served in Korea and Germany, according to personnel records released by the Army. He was working as a human resources specialist before he was detailed in January 2011 to the recruiting office in Columbia, Maryland, Welker said. Such assignments typically last three years, after which soldiers can decide whether to become permanent recruiters or return to their previous occupations. His duties would have included visiting schools, Welker said, although it was not clear on Tuesday whether he had visited Miss Miller's school prior to recruiting her. The investigation remains active and is focused on 'determining how these two people died,' said Capt. Paul Starks, a Montgomery County police spokesman. Dana Tofig, a county schools spokesman, said military recruiters routinely visit the county's schools. The school system's focus, he said, was helping those who knew Miller. Grief counselors were visiting her classmates on Tuesday. Kevin Miller said his daughter was excited to join the military. He said: 'She had her life taken away from her on one fell swoop.'

Respect: The Falkland Islands flag flies at half mast in front of the Visitor Centre after the death of Baroness Thatcher, in Port Stanley on Monday . David Cameron is open to the idea of renaming the capital of the Falklands in honour of Margaret Thatcher, as long as the idea is backed by islanders, Downing Street said yesterday. The Mail revealed yesterday that senior MPs are suggesting that Port Stanley, also known simply as Stanley, should be renamed Port Margaret in honour of the woman who liberated it in 1982. They include ministerial aides in the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence, and Cabinet ministers are understood to be sympathetic to the idea, if it wins the support of the Falklands government. Bridgwater MP Ian Liddell-Grainger and former education minister Tim Loughton were among those backing the campaign yesterday, with the latter saying: ‘Count me in.’ There were initial discussions in Number Ten yesterday on ways to commemorate Baroness Thatcher, including renaming the Falklands capital. ‘The Prime Minister thinks it’s a good idea to think of how in due course Lady Thatcher could be commemorated,’ a spokesman said. ‘With regard to Port Stanley, it would be a matter for the Falkand Islands.’ Another Downing Street source said the Prime Minister was open to the proposal but stressed that he believed the views of the islanders had to be ‘paramount’. Stanley is currently named after Edward Smith-Stanley, who was the British prime minister three times in the mid-19th century, but never actually set foot in the Falklands. Appreciation: A group of former British paratroopers who fought in the Falklands War salute as they leave a wreath for Lady Thatcher by a street sign in Port Stanley in her name after hearing of her death on Monday . Renaming it after Lady Thatcher would . infuriate Argentina’s erratic president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, . who has been upping her rhetoric over sovereignty of the islands around . the 30th anniversary of the conflict. But bookmakers offered odds of 5/1 that islanders would agree to bestowing the honour on the woman who many still hero-worship. Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, said he would also like a statue of Lady Thatcher erected in the capital - though some MPs fear it could become the target for Left-wing protests. Mr Johnson insisted that the former prime minister deserved a ‘prominent’ central London memorial, and refused to rule out using an empty plinth in Trafalgar Square to honour Britain’s only female Prime Minister. Guided tour: Former prime minister Lady Thatcher (centre) looks around the Falkland Islands in January 1983 . The fourth plinth has never been permanently filled, but since 1998 it has been used to show a series of artworks. 'The Prime Minister thinks it’s a good idea to think of how in due course Lady Thatcher could be commemorated' Downing Street spokesman . Defence . Secretary Philip Hammond said: ‘I think it would be very appropriate to . have a memorial to Margaret Thatcher somewhere in London. 'I . haven’t personally given any thought yet to where that should be, but . certainly the fourth plinth could be one of the options. ‘Let’s look at that in slower time, I think these things are better thought about in slightly slower time after the event.’ Support: Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured on Monday) is open to the idea of renaming the capital of the Falklands in honour of Margaret Thatcher, as long as the idea is backed by islanders, Downing Street said . Commander John Muxworthy, a Lt Commander . on the SS Canberra during the Falklands conflict, said: ‘Let’s have a . full scale statue next to Nelson to recognise that she was at the heart . of the nation. 'I think it would be very appropriate to have a memorial to Margaret Thatcher somewhere in London' Defence Secretary Philip Hammond . 'It wasn’t just the navy that she was a champion of; she was there for all the services. She was a great Briton, let’s put her at the centre.’ Falklands veteran Simon Weston agreed: ‘I think we should celebrate all that she brought back to this country. I think it would be terribly fitting if we could remember her in a similar way to Winston Churchill.’ But he warned a statue could become the focus of protest: ‘I think that you have to be careful of the reaction of the foolhardy, the misled and the misguided who have been popping champagne corks and dancing on her photo.'","Senior MPs are suggesting Port Stanley should be renamed Port Margaret .

Lloyds shareholders called for former HBOS chief executive Andy Hornby to give up his £240,000 pension . Furious Lloyds shareholders last night led calls for disgraced former HBOS chief executive Andy Hornby to give up his gold-plated pension worth more than £240,000 a year. Campaigners said the pension should be paid to ordinary investors who have seen their nest eggs devastated after Lloyds’ disastrous takeover rescue of HBOS in 2008. The spotlight has switched to Mr Hornby and former chairman Lord Stevenson, after Sir James Crosby asked on Tuesday to be stripped of his knighthood and issued a public apology for the debacle. Sir James, who was chief executive of HBOS before Mr Hornby, was accused of being the ‘architect’ of the lender’s implosion in a devastating report published by the banking commission last week. The 57-year-old also offered to give up 30 per cent of his £580,000 a year final salary pension, or around £175,000, which he hopes to give to charity or to Lloyds shareholders. Last night pressure was mounting on Mr Hornby to give up some of the huge pension he amassed in less than eight years at Halifax and HBOS, formed when Halifax and Bank of Scotland merged in 2001. Sir James, Mr Hornby and former chairman Lord Stevenson were all accused of ‘catastrophic failures of management’ which led to the collapse of HBOS. Lloyds had to be bailed out with £20.5billion of taxpayers’ money in October 2008, weeks after its disastrous rescue. Adrian Lithgow, from Lloyds Action Now – a campaign group battling to secure compensation for 7,500 Lloyds shareholders – said: ‘Crosby clearly feels the shame of destroying one of Britain’s finest institutions. It is up to others, like Hornby, to now follow his example. He should give up his pension and divert this money to shareholders who have suffered hugely as a result of his actions.’ While Sir James has been forced to quit lucrative board positions since last week’s report, Mr Hornby is clinging on to his role as chief executive of bookmaker Coral, where is thought to receive more than £500,000 a year. He also has a huge retirement nest egg, courtesy of HBOS, where directors enjoyed a final salary pension more generous than that given to MPs, and similar to that of the governor of the Bank of England. The spotlight has switched to Mr Hornby . and former chairman Lord Stevenson (left), after Sir James Crosby (right) asked on .

One of the longest serving inmates on death row, who snatched a ten-year-old girl as she rode her bike to school and then took her to an orange grove to beat her and cut her throat, was executed last night by lethal injection. Larry Eugene Mann, 59, was pronounced dead at 7:19 pm on Wednesday night at Florida State Prison in Starke, outside of Tampa, after a judge overturned a last-minute, final appeal. A group of Elisa's relatives sat in the front row wearing buttons with her photo on them. The oil well driller was 27 when he abducted little Elisa Vera Nelson, who had been carrying a note in her pocket saying she would be late to school because of a dentist appointment. The blood-covered note was later found by Mann's wife days after the murder. Scroll down for video . Larry Eugene Mann, who killed 10-year-old Elisa Nelson in 1980 by slitting her throat, was executed Wednesday night at the Florida State Prison in Starke. He did not issue a final statement . Elisa Nelson, 10, had been riding her bicycle to school when she was abducted by Mann, taken to an orange grove, and killed . The convicted killer, when asked if he had any last words, told a prison officer: ‘Uh, no sir,’ according to the Tampa Bay Times. Mann had his final meal at 10am, which included fried shrimp, fish and scallops, stuffed crabs, ice cream and a soda. Elisa had been carrying a note with her from her mother saying she would be late to school because of a dentist appointment . On November 4, 1980, Mann, a resident of Dunedin, kidnapped her and took her to an orange grove, where he then slit her throat. Days later, the body of Elisa was found lying under an avocado tree. After slitting the girl's throat, Mann bashed her head in with a pole before going home and trying to commit suicide by slitting his wrists, telling the responding police officers he had 'done something stupid'. An autopsy later showed that Elisa died from the blunt force trauma from the pole, which had a concrete block at one end. Days later, Mann's wife found the bloodied note that Elisa's mother had written to explain why she was late for school. Elisa’s cousin, Katy DeCarolis, who . was at the execution, told the Tampa Bay Tribune: ‘Thank God it’s over,’ after Mann was declared dead tonight. Mann had been appealing his death sentence since former Florida Gov Bob Graham signed it in 1986. According . to the Tribune, Mann had several other instances of violent and sexual . assault against girls. Court documents show that he raped a . girl in Mississippi in 1973, and told that victim that if he didn’t ‘get . what he wanted’ from the girl, he would rape a toddler in the next . room.

The 2013 hurricane season is expected to be 'above average' featuring 18 tropical storms, nine of which will intensify into hurricanes, forecasters at Colorado State University report. Four of the hurricanes will be major with sustained winds reaching at least 111 miles per hour, the leading U.S. storm research team said of their prediction on Wednesday. An average season from June 1 to November 30th brings about 12 tropical storms, six hurricanes and two major hurricanes in the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, according to CSU. Above average: Hurricane Charley is seen in a satellite image over Cuba in 2004 which was an above average year opposed to the typical six hurricanes seen and which is expected for 2013 . The prediction for a busier 2013 season was based on two factors, the researchers said. Hurricanes thrive on warm water and the Atlantic Ocean has warmed in recent months. There is also little expectation of an El Nino effect this summer and fall. El Nino is a warming of surface waters in the tropical Pacific that occurs every four to 12 years and has far-ranging effects around the globe. The weather phenomenon creates wind shear that makes it harder for storms to develop into hurricanes in the Atlantic-Caribbean basin. The researchers said there was a 72 percent chance that a major hurricane will hit the U.S. coast this year, compared with a historical average of 52 percent. Strengthening: A New Orleans Police car drives down Canal Street during Hurricane Katrina, a Category 4 storm in 2005 that was one of the strongest storms to impact the U.S. coast during the last 100 years . There is a 48 percent chance a major hurricane will hit the U.S. East Coast, compared with a historical average of 31 percent, and a 47 percent chance one would hit the Gulf of Mexico coast, compared with an average of 30 percent. The 2012 hurricane season spawned 19 tropical storms and 10 hurricanes, including Hurricane Sandy, which hit the northeastern United States in October after rampaging through the Caribbean. Sandy killed more than 200 people and caused more than $71 billion of damage in New York and New Jersey.

Some of us have nice neighbours, some of us have noisy neighbours, but few of us have neighbours who will cover our gardens with foam while we're at the shops. For mother-of-three Maggie McElroy, however, it was absolutely par for the course when she came back from the supermarket to discover Barry Brennand's latest prank. Because the two friends - who live next door to each other in a village in north Wales - have been playing tricks on each other for years . In the most recent incident Mr Brennand, 65, hired a foam cannon and covered Mrs McElroy's garden (which he knew to be her pride and joy) with a carpet of white bubbles six feet deep. Mrs McElroy, 50, was so stunned to come home and see her bungalow looking more like an Alpine chalet, she didn't immediately work out who the culprit was. She said: 'For a moment, I thought I'd left my washing machine on and that it had gone crazy. 'I jsut couldn't work it out until I heard my neighbours giggling from behind a hedge.' Thankfully, she saw the funny side and joined her neighbours, who'd been hiding to watch her reaction, as they all waded into the suds and enjoyed a giant foam party.

A policeman has been shot dead while protecting a team of female polio workers in Pakistan, in the latest in a series of attacks on people connected to a UN-backed vaccination programme. Recent months have seen a spate of deadly attacks on aid workers linked to the scheme - which has been condemned by some Islamic groups who claim it is intended to sterilise Muslim children - in Pakistan and in northern Nigeria. No group has claimed responsibility for the latest attack in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province today, but suspicion has fallen on Islamic militants. Polio: The UN-backed vaccination programme has been condemned by some Islamic militants who claim it is intended to make Muslim children sterile (file photo) In January seven female . aid workers and a male doctor were shot dead while working for an agency vaccinating children against polio in Pakistan. The Taliban - whose leaders had repeatedly denounced the vaccination programme - denied involvement in the attacks. The next month nine female health workers were shot in northern Nigeria in two attacks around 30 minutes apart. The shootings in Nigeria were blamed on Islamist militant group Boko Haram. Pakistan . is one of only three countries in the world where polio is still . endemic. Health workers have made progress in combatting the disease in . recent years, but the attacks threaten to reverse that progress. Some opponents to the vaccination campaign have accused health workers of acting as spies for the U.S. and claimed the vaccine is intended to make Muslim children sterile. Today's attack occurred in the district of Mardan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, said police officer Mohammed Nabi Khan. One policeman was killed and another wounded. No polio workers were harmed since they were inside a home giving polio drops to children at the time of the attack, said Khan. Endemic: A polio vaccination programme is also underway in Nigeria, where nine female health workers were shot in February in an attack blamed on Islamist group Boko Haram (file photo) In December, gunmen killed nine polio workers in different parts of Pakistan. Several more workers have been killed since then, as well as policemen who were protecting them. The U.N. said last month that some 240,000 children missed vaccinations since July in parts of Pakistan's tribal region, the main sanctuary for Islamic militants, because of security concerns.","Policeman was protecting team of female polio workers in Pakistan .

The Sri Lankan government has launched an investigation into a recently uncovered mass grave containing more than 150 skeletons. President Mahinda Rajapaksa announced a presidential commission will be appointed to investigate the chilling find, likely to be the bodies of Marxist rebels killed decades ago, said Lakshman Hulugalle, head of the government's Media Centre for National Security. It was found late last year at a state-run hospital in the central region of the country.

Macabre: There are 150 skulls in the grave, most likely of Marxist rebels . Mr Hulugalle told reporters the commission's probe will be in addition to an ongoing police investigation, adding names of the members of the commission will be announced soon. Workers found the remains while doing construction work in December at the hospital in Matale, about 65 miles northeast of the capital, Colombo. The 154 skeletons were found buried in neat rows, five or six stacked on top of one another. Last month, a judge declared the mass grave a crime scene, and said the skulls and bones recovered date back 25 years, strengthening suspicions that they belonged to suspected Marxist rebels killed at the time. Judicial medical officer Asoka Jayasena carries a skull of an unearthed skeleton. The country has seen two major uprisings from Marxist guerrillas . Unearthed: The mass grave was found in December by workers on a hospital construction site . Magistrate Chathurika de Silva told a court in Matale that tests carried out by archeological and judicial medical officials showed the remains dated to between 1987 and 1990. During that period, thousands of men and women suspected of having ties to the rebels disappeared after being arrested by security forces. When the bodies were found, there were initial claims that they belonged to those killed in an epidemic in the 1940s or in a mudslide. Light onto darkness: The presidential commission will run alongside the ongoing police investigation into the deaths . The Marxists were mostly rural Sinhalese, the country's majority ethnic community. They complained of economic hardship . However, hospital authorities did not have any records of bodies buried on the premises. A Marxist group, the People's Liberation Front, which led two uprisings first in 1971 and again in 1987 to 1989 against the government, said the bodies may belong to its members killed by security forces and demanded that the government conduct a full investigation.

But in the days leading up to Easter, another vision of the Son of God has emerged - this time in condensation on the windscreen of a car parked in Gateshead. David Alexander, 39, of Seaton Delaval, Northumberland, was shocked when he looked over and saw the image of Christ appear above the dashboard of his friend's car. Holy water: David Alexander was transfixed on the face revealed on the windscreen of a car which he says resembled Jesus Christ . Mr Alexander, who works as a support manager for a data marketing analysis firm, said: 'I was sitting in a friend's car on Sunday night. 'We were about to set off when an image manifested itself on the driver's side of the windscreen. 'I could see a face staring back at me - it looked just like the Turin Shroud - except it looked like Jesus was smiling back at me. 'I pointed it out to my friend and we couldn't believe it.' Sighting: In the days leading up to Easter another vision of the Son of God emerged. This time in the condensation on a windscreen of a car parked in Gateshead . The image of 'Jesus' was around three inches high and remained on the windscreen for around an hour. 'Maybe there was some holy water in the car', said Mr Alexander. 'It was very strange. It was a very still night and there was an orange light from the streetlamp shining through the image, making it glow and really stand out. Holy brew: When Trucluck flipped over the piece of carton, he discovered a white marking which he said looked like the profile picture of Christ . 'It was very surreal so I had to take some photographs to prove it. I immediately thought it looked like Jesus. 'Seeing the image hasn't changed my life so far, it hasn't led to a conversion experience, but who knows, maybe it has something to do with Easter approaching.'

Mystery: Russell Matthews reappeared in January after vanishing and being declared a missing person more than three months before . A veteran rescue swimmer has been charged with desertion after he went missing for three months and triggered a massive search, the Coast Guard said Wednesday. Petty Officer 1st Class Russell Matthews faces three other charges including being absent without leave, wrongful use and possession of a controlled substance, and causing the Coast Guard to conduct a search when there was no need, said Chief Warrant Officer Gene Maestas, a Coast Guard spokesman. An Article 32 hearing - the military equivalent of a grand jury hearing - will be held to determine if there's enough evidence for Matthews to be tried in a court-martial. Matthews was in the process of being discharged from the Coast Guard for illegal use of marijuana when he disappeared in October. The 36-year-old showed up at his home in mid-January. Police said Matthews was incoherent when he was found, and he taken to a hospital for observation. The Coast Guard later took him into custody and had him confined at a Navy brig while they investigated why he left without authorization. Police had found Matthews' car abandoned at Kaena Point, a remote area of Oahu next to the ocean, after his wife reported him missing. Police at the time described him as emotionally distraught, and said his friends and family were concerned for his welfare.

Tragedy: Clara and her children were involved in a head-on bicycling accident in 2009 and the mother suffered a traumatic brain injury; two years later, she committed suicide . Hawaii News Now reported that Matthews lost four colleagues in a 2008 helicopter crash. The following year, his first wife was critically hurt when she was hit head-on by a car while riding her bike. She killed herself about two years later. Matthews vanished near the anniversary of her suicide. Under investigation: Matthews, pictured before his disappearance, was under investigation for alleged marijuana use . 'In Petty Officer Matthews' case, we certainly empathize with his situation, but we certainly do not condone his actions,' Maestas said. Search and rescue crews scoured more than 10,000 square miles looking for Matthews. Honolulu firefighters sent a helicopter and rescue teams to searches the rugged coastline and sand dunes near Kaena Point. Maestas couldn't discuss what Matthews was doing while he was missing, saying that's part of the investigation. Maestas said he didn't know if . Matthews has an attorney. He is entitled to representation by a lawyer . from the Navy's judge advocate general corps if he wishes. Matthews joined the Coast Guard in 1997. He's been stationed at Air Station Barbers Point on Oahu for five years. The decision to charge Matthews was made by Capt Timothy Gilbride, the station's commanding officer. Loss: Clara Matthews suffered a traumatic brain injury following the accident and took her life two years later . Treatment: The petty officer is now being evaluated at Tripler Army Medical Center .
