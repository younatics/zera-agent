"Real Madrid are close to agreeing terms on a new contract with Karim Benzema but have not given up on the pursuit of Radamel Falcao from Monaco. Benzema is poised to agree an extension until 2017 on £5.5million a year. Falcao has been the subject of a loan offer from Madrid who are concerned about proof of his recovery from cruciate surgery. The deal would be around £10m for the year with a view to a permanent deal next summer. Wanted: Real Madrid are still interested in fit again Monaco striker Radamel Falcao (left) Deal me in: Madrid are close to agreeing a new contract with France striker Karim Benzema . Former Monaco star James Rodriguez has told Spanish paper AS that he would like to see Falcao follow him to Spain. He said: 'I am sure he could play here. But it is not up to me to decide if he will come. It is the decision of the President. He can come because he has the quality and the mentality of a winner. 'I’ve known him for four years and have played by his side. We were only separated when he left for Atletico. He has a winning mentality and that’s something you want at Madrid. I hope he can come.' TEENAGE TALENT AT OLD TRAFFORD . Some of the world's best teenage talent will descend on Carrington next week as Manchester United play host to the Premier Cup World Finals also known as the Nike Cup. The tournament kicks off on August 6 with the final being held at Old Trafford three days later. Twenty Under 15 sides will take part from around the world including United and Chelsea. Hidden gems: Lionel Messi and Fernando Torres are among those who have graced the Nike Cup . However, it won't be overflowing with scouts. Owing to accusations of poaching in recent years, access is strictly guarded through the clubs and only affiliated staff are allowed in. Carlos Tevez, Theo Walcott, Fernando Torres and Lionel Messi are just some of the names to have graced the competition in the past. PALACE TO COMPLETE HANGELAND DEAL . Crystal Palace will win the battle to sign Brede Hangeland on Thursday. The towering 33-year-old was released by Fulham via email at the end of the season and has held talks with Hull City with Steve Bruce keen to add experience alongside Curtis Davies and new signing Harry Maguire. However, Tony Pulis has managed to convince the experienced Norwegian to stay in London and form a partnership with Scott Dann for next season. London calling: Brede Hangeland is set to join Crystal Palace after he was released by Fulham . Hangeland left Craven Cottage under a cloud after six-and-a-half years in west London. He said he would have been willing to stay with Fulham in the Championship had he received assurances about the future direction of the club. He said: 'With the right signs and the right players coming in I would have been prepared to stay. 'There was a release clause in my contract which they decided to take. I would have hoped for at least (to have been told) face-to-face or a pat on the back after six-and-a-half years.' Fulham have since insisted that 'all personal protocol was followed' when Hangeland was informed of his release. Hangeland is likely to have the last laugh though as he agrees a two-year deal. BORO CLOSE IN ON NSUE . Middlesbrough are poised to sign Real Mallorca captain Emilio Nsue. Spanish sources say the club are closing on the former Spain Under 21 international after he held talks to cancel his contract. Boro boss Aitor Karanka coached Nsue while in charge of Spain's Under 20 side and has decided to bring him to England because of his versatility. The 24-year-old was due to sign for Arsenal in 2010 but a family bereavement forced him to abandon the transfer and return to Mallorca. Nsue who can play right wing, forward and right-back and was also part of the successful Spain Under 21 side that boasted the likes of Juan Mata, Thiago Alcantara and David de Gea. CLAYTON IN DEMAND . In demand: Adam Clayton has several suitors . Huddersfield midfielder Adam Clayton is a man in demand. The 25-year-old, who sported a spectacular blue and white beard for part of last season, is being pursued by four Championship clubs and is considering his options. Clayton was voted as Huddersfield fans' player of the year last season and Brighton had a £1million bid rejected in January. They have returned as have Middlesbrough but the presence of Cardiff and Reading could prove more revealing. Cardiff are in the throes of selling Gary Medel to either Inter Milan or Galatasaray and want to strengthen their midfield while Reading want a proven Championship player who can make the step up to Premier League should they gain promotion. Clayton, a former Manchester City graduate, is ready to leave once the clubs agree a price with Huddersfield. TOTTENHAM IN THE MARKET . Tottenham are showing an interest in Mateo Musacchio of Villarreal. The tough Argentine defender has impressed a lot of scouts in recent years. He is not the tallest but reads the game well and has all the hallmarks of former Argentina captain Daniel Passarella. He is well known to Maurico Pochettino who is looking to toughen up his defence and has already shown he is willing to listen to offers for Michael Dawson while doubts remain over Younes Kaboul. Tottenham are hopeful of concluding a deal with Sporting Lisbon for Eric Dier but 23-year-old Tottenham are showing an interest in Mateo Musacchio of Villarrealwould be ready-made for the first team if they step up interest. He won't come cheap though - his buy-out clause is £39million. Tottenham midfielder Iago Falque, meanwhile, is undergoing a medical at Genoa. COSTA RICA INTERNATIONAL OFF TO THE SEASIDER . Jose Riga looks like getting one of the players he has been wishing for with the arrival of Costa Rica international midfielder Jose Miguel Cubero at Blackpool . The 27-year-old, who came off the bench to appear in four World Cup games this summer, posted a series of pictures of himself with Blackpool boss Riga at Bloomfield Road saying 'My new home'. He is having his medical on Thursday ahead of signing. Moving on: Jose Miguel Cubero posted this picture of himself with Blackpool boss Jose Riga . DATE SET FOR SUAREZ HEARING . Luis Suarez has been told August 8 is the confirmed date when he will learn his fate over the four month ban imposed by FIFA. The Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) has called to hear out the appeal regarding Suarez’s suspension, where the player is looking to reduce the entire ban or at least several of the conditions in order to join and train with his new club, Barcelona. Suarez and his lawyers will be in Lausanne, Switzerland, to testify and hear the verdict on their appeal. He is unlikely to have the entire ban lifted, but is hopeful that the ban will be reduced enough to allow him to be formally presented and train with Barcelona. IRVINE TO RAID CONTINENT . West Bromwich Albion manager Alan Irvine is weighing up bids for Switzerland striker Haris Seferovic and French winger Jonathan Biabiany. Wanted man: West Brom boss Alan Irvine is keen on Switzerland striker Haris Sefrovic (left) Seferovic, 22, plays for Real Sociedad but struggled to score regular goals for the La Liga outfit last season. Biabiany, who joined Parma two years ago from Sampdoria for about £2m and has since extended his contract until 2018, is also on Southampton's list of potential targets. LAZIO JOIN RACE FOR VLAAR . Lazio, meanwhile, have expressed an interest in rivalling Southampton for Aston Villa defender Ron Vlaar. Lazio want to team him with new signing Stefan de Vrij. Aston Villa will offer the Dutchman a new contract in the coming days.

"England’s decision to change their team on the eve of the World Cup showed to me where we still are with one-day cricket. Would they have done the same to their Test side the day before the Ashes? No, they would have been ready to go. Maybe those switches will work as the World Cup goes on. Gary Ballance might go on to be the answer for England at No3 in 50-over cricket and James Taylor, as he showed in Melbourne, could thrive at six. It’s just the timing of those changes that was odd and we still seemingly have a less settled approach to the one-day game, which reminds me of the bad old days when people were worried about being dropped every couple of matches. Gary Ballance hits a shot during England training, and he must be given a long-term chance at number three . The timing of Ballance's move into the pivotal three role shows how England have failed to prepare . You could pretty much have named the New Zealand side for this World Cup a year ago but could you have said that England’s top three at the tournament would be Moeen Ali, Ian Bell and Ballance even a couple of months ago? Now that England have made those changes they had to stick with them for Friday's game in Wellington and you have to say that, even though the timing was strange, Ravi Bopara cannot really feel hard done by. I felt Bopara was unlucky to have been dropped when England played India last summer but maybe he came back with a little bit missing and was wondering when he would be left out again. He hasn’t been scoring enough runs and his bowling is just not used often enough any more. Ravi Bopara was unlucky to be dropped last summer, but he hasn't done enough since then to earn his place . Bopara (left) practices a shot as Jos Buttler takes part in some training ahead of England's second game . Against Australia, England were too worried about strategy. There is a lot of time between games at World Cups which means a lot of meetings and a lot of thinking and that can lead to over-thinking. Clearly, with the long square boundaries at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, England’s plan was to bowl short but when it was not working they had to think on their feet. England players should have the ability to be instinctive. Have plans, of course, but be prepared to change them. England’s bowling is far too one-dimensional. If the ball is moving around they have a chance against any team in the world but if it’s a flat, drop-in pitch they haven’t got a Plan B. Steven Finn bowls during training, but England need to become less reliant on plans during their matches . With plenty of time to think before games England can become too rigid when things are not going right . No-one needs to be instinctive more so than Eoin Morgan. The captain is at his best when he just does what comes naturally but again there is evidence that he is thinking too much. For instance, Morgan said the other day that he had to ‘re-engage with the belief’ he needs to have in his batting. That sounds like management-speak to me. Can you imagine Brendon McCullum saying that? There is no question that Morgan is pivotal to England doing well in Australia and New Zealand. He hasn’t just been out of form in his five innings before facing New Zealand. The century in Sydney was the exception to the rule of his largely poor form going back a year. Eoin Morgan needs to get away from the 'management-speak' and go back to his instinctive play . The England captain has been out of form for the best part of a year, but is still crucial to the team's success . We have all been through it. We have all had a scrambled brain over where the next big innings is going to come from. You feel the pressure, particularly as captain, but Morgan needs to deliver if England are going to prosper. The World Cup so far has been pretty much what I was expecting. Teams, on the whole, are batting first and racking up 300 plus. Australia are clearly the stand out side, they tick every box, so England will not be the only side thumped by them in this tournament. The associate countries are stronger than they used to be too. Ireland beating West Indies just wasn’t a surprise. It did not constitute an upset. Australia are the best side in the World Cup, and it won't only be England who suffer a heavy defeat to them . Ireland celebrate as the beaten West Indies side trudge off the field in Nelson after their defeat . Scotland, despite their defeat to New Zealand, showed plenty of steel, and are a well-prepared side . The Irish team was full of established players whereas West Indies were captained by a young lad in Jason Holder with very little experience of the big stage. Scotland, too, with Paul Collingwood on the coaching staff, will be a well-prepared, committed outfit which is why England cannot just expect to beat the associate teams in their group and progress that way. England have to get as far up their group as they can otherwise they will have a tough quarter-final back in Melbourne on a flat pitch and that means winning against the ‘big’ teams too. For them, the World Cup starts now.","Ian Bell, Moeen Ali and Gary Ballance unthinkable as a top three a year ago .

"House after house, block after block it is a scene of the most appalling devastation. Not one building has escaped the onslaught of countless mortars, bombs and bullets in Syria’s savage civil war. The only signs of life in Homs are out-of-control weeds. Syria’s third largest city – and the home of 650,000 people before tens of thousands fled or were killed – now looks as if it has been blasted back to the Stone Age. The picture shows the city’s strategic Khalidiya district which troops loyal to president Bashar al-Assad have just retaken after weeks of fierce fighting with rebels. The counter-offensive, which also saw the government make gains around the capital Damascus, was supported by Lebanese  Hezbollah guerrillas. At least 100,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict, which started with peaceful protests against Assad’s rule in March 2011. Nearly two million refugees have fled. Scroll down for video . Destruction: This aerial view shows the destruction in the al-Khalidiyah neighbourhood of Homs, which has seen some of the heaviest fighting as government forces bid to flush rebels into the open . Destroyed: The sounds of busy traffic, bustling . markets and children playing in the streets have been replaced by the . roar of fighter jets, exploding bombs and gunfire . The Britain-based Syrian Observatory . for Human Rights activist group, however, denied that regime forces had . seized all of the district of Khaldiyeh, saying there was still . scattered fighting in southern areas of the neighborhood. Syrian . TV aired footage from the neighborhood, showing troops roaming deserted . streets and waving flags in front of shell-scarred buildings. Two . opposition activists in the area who could normally be contacted via . Skype were offline Monday. Government troops launched a sweeping offensive to retake rebel-held areas of Homs, Syria's third-largest city, a month ago. Even if small pockets of resistance remain, the fall of Khaldiyeh to regime troops appeared to be a foregone conclusion, and its capture would be the second major setback to rebels in central Syria in as many months. Shells of houses: The Khaled bin Walid Mosque is scarred and pockmarked from shrapnel spat into the city by the daily explosions that hit the city. Beyond the mosque, the shells of buildings and homes give the city the look of a post-apocalyptic wasteland . Tragic: The once glorious Khalid Ibn al-Walid Mosque in the heavily disputed northern neighborhood of Khaldiyeh, Homs, lies in ruins after being hit by shells during the long bombardment of the city . Bruised and battered: From the outside, the Khalid Ibn al-Walid Mosque looks little better . In early June, regime forces captured the strategic town of Qusair in Homs province near the border with Lebanon. Troops have also captured the town of Talkalakh, another border town in the province. The province of Homs is Syria's largest, and runs from the Lebanese frontier in the west all the way to the border with Iraq and Jordan in the east. The city of Homs holds strategic value because it serves as a crossroads: the main highway from Damascus to the north as well as the coastal region, which is a stronghold of President Bashar Assad's Alawite sect, runs through Homs. Khaldiyeh had a population of about 80,000 but only some 2,000 remain there today as residents fled the violence, activists say. The heavy fighting over the past two years has caused extensive damage, with some buildings reduced to rubble. Ghost town: Many of the roads in Homs are completely empty giving this once great city the look and feel of a ghost town, populated only by the thousands of souls who died here . Poignant: An empty chair sits among the shells of buildings is a haunting reminder of the life that used to fill the streets of Homs. They are now empty and desolate . In a report on Monday, Syrian state TV said 'the Syrian army has restored security and stability in the whole neighborhood of Khaldiyeh in Homs.' A Syrian TV reporter embedded with troops in the area gave a live report standing in front of damaged buildings. He interviewed an army officer who said the troops fought a tough battle against rebels who mined buildings and fought from underground tunnels. 'As of this morning, our armed forces in cooperation with the (pro-government paramilitary) National Defense Forces have taken control of Khaldiyeh and are now cleansing the neighborhood,' said the officer, surrounded by about a dozen soldiers and plainclothes security agents. No respite: Syrian youths inspect the site of a car bomb explosion at a roundabout on the outskirts of Homs . 'The fate of terrorists will be under our feet,' he said, claiming that all Homs will be soon 'cleansed' of rebels. The Observatory has said that troops are backed by members of Lebanon's Hezbollah group. Hezbollah, which did not acknowledge whether its members are fighting in Khaldiyeh, played a major role in a battle last month in Qusair, outside Homs, and lost scores of men there. Observatory director Rami Abdul-Rahman said government troops have captured most of the neighborhood apart from some fighting on its southern areas. Another opposition activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the battle in Khaldiyeh 'is almost over.' He acknowledged that troops are almost in full control of the area. Fire and smoke: Smoke and flames rise in the Khalidiyah neighbourhood of Homs after an attack by Syrian forces . Patrol: Syrian government forces patrol in the Khalidiyah neighbourhood of Homs. They claim to have broken the rebel resistance in the area . Still fighting: Syrian soldiers fire their weapons as fighting continued to rage in pockets of the city . Trundling on: A government tank patrols the neighbourhood under a shroud of smoke . Victory? Syrian soldiers pose for a photo while holding the Syrian flag in al-Khalidyya neighborhood which they claim to have secured . In the northern city of Aleppo, several rebel factions including the al-Qaida-linked Jabhat al-Nusra, or Nusra Front, attacked army posts in two neighborhoods in a an offensive titled 'amputating infidels' the Observatory said. It said rebels captured several buildings in the neighborhoods of Dahret Abed Rabbo and Lairamoun, and that eight government soldiers were killed. Rebels have been on the offensive in Aleppo province and captured last week the strategic town of Khan el-Assal. Activists and state media said score of troops were killed there after their capture. The Western-backed Syrian National Council condemned the killings. In the southern region of Quneitra, on the edge of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, government troops captured the town of Mashara on Sunday night after intense fighting, the Observatory said.","Syrian forces say they have captured the Khaldiyeh district of Homs, a rebel stronghold since the war began .

"Calum Chambers' £12million transfer to Arsenal suggests all is not lost when it comes to the production line of young English talent. The 19-year-old is already being tipped for a full call-up when international football resumes later this summer. Chambers' former Southampton team-mate Luke Shaw won his first England caps towards the end of last season and a £30m move to Manchester United duly followed. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Baker and James Wilson in action . Young guns: The team (left), including Calum Chambers (right), boarding the plane ahead of Arsenal's tour . Gunner be a star: Arsenal unveiled new signing Chambers after a £12m move from Southampton . But what about the next generation of English players set for stardom? Here, Sportsmail devises an XI of youngsters – headed by Chambers – who we believe could make a mark on the Premier League and international scene in the coming years... Goalkeeper: Daniel Bentley (Southend) Just turned 21, Bentley is yet to be recognised with any sort of international honour despite making more than 60 league appearances for Southend. Big things to come: Southend keeper Daniel Bentley has experience beyond his years . Perhaps his residence in the lower . leagues is the reason for that, but this agile yet imposing goalkeeper – . he's 6ft 4in – is set for bigger things and has more senior experience . than any young English stopper of his age. Right back: Calum Chambers (Arsenal) His £12million move to Arsenal this week has already triggered talk of him maturing into a future England captain, especially with Arsene Wenger keen to convert him into a centre back. Top young Gun: Chambers is hugely regarded by Arsene Wenger and could be a future England captain . Still only 19 and with just 23 . first-team appearances for Southampton, the Gunners are nonetheless . convinced he is a star of the future and their judgement on former . Saints graduates Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has proved . sound in the past. VIDEO Chambers aims to emulate ex-Saints stars . Centre back: Jamaal Lascelles (Nottingham Forest) The 20-year-old has shot to prominence this summer - £5m bids from Premier League clubs have a tendency to generate such fuss – but it is not without good reason. Without weakness: For a 20-year-old, Forest's Jamaal Lascelles has a remarkably well-rounded game . Lascelles is a class act; watch him play and you cannot identify a weakness. Forest . are determined to keep him at the City Ground and that could well prove . the best setting for his development under former England Under 21 boss . Stuart Pearce. Centre back: Brendan Galloway (MK Dons) When a player makes their senior debut at 15 years old then he must have a bit about him. Classy and versatile: Defender-midfielder Brendon Galloway made his senior debut at just 15 years old . And in the case of Galloway – a classy defender-cum-midfielder in the mould of Rio Ferdinand – that is certainly true. Premier League clubs – Everton chief among them – are circling and a £4million price tag has been slapped on the 18-year-old. Left back: Matt Targett (Southampton) It's perhaps folly to assume that Targett will follow in the stud marks on Gareth Bale and Luke Shaw, but Southampton's production line is showing no signs of winding up just yet. And, in the form of 18-year-old left-back Targett, they have another talented teen ready to grace the senior stage this season. The new Saint: Matt Targett is another huge talent off the Southamption production line . Centre midfield: Lewis Baker (Chelsea) Chelsea's young player of the year was prolific from midfield last season, scoring 17 times for the Under 21s. Jose Mourinho says he will take the blame should Baker not go on to earn full international honours, and that suggests elevation to the first-team could well be on the agenda. The England Under 19 schemer is a deadball specialist and is comfortable on either foot. Blue streak: Lewis Baker (right) was Chelsea's young player of the year with 17 goals for the Under 21s . Centre midfield: Will Hughes (Derby) Having only turned 19 in April, Hughes's experience for a player of such tender years is remarkable and he is now just 11 outings shy of his 100th at club level. He has seemingly decided the best place to add to that experience is at Derby, as he signed a new four-year deal this summer. He can pass, dribble, score, create and gets about the park; he may be in the Championship this season but the Premier League surely awaits. Hard to keep: Will Hughes signed a four-year deal with Derby but a Premier League move is likely . Right wing: Patrick Roberts (Fulham) Fulham's relegation could well prove a blessing for the diminutive forward who, at 5ft 5in and with a liking for a mesmerising dribble, has been likened to Lionel Messi. He scored twice during England Under 17s' European Championship success this summer and has seven from 14 international appearances. Fulham . boss Felix Magath has described the 17-year-old as 'an extraordinary . talent' and the club are said to have put a £15m price tag on his . head to ward off interest from Manchester United among others. Fulham's Messi: Patrick Roberts has been likened to the Argentinian master for his mesmerising dribbling . Left wing: Jordon Ibe (Liverpool) The secret was out when the explosive winger debuted for Wycombe at 15 and Liverpool made certain they were the club to secure the teen talent. He has progressed to the fringe of the senior side at Anfield and assisted in both goals during their 2-1 win at Preston earlier this month. Obvious comparison with Raheem Sterling has been drawn, but you wouldn't bet against the 18-year-old enjoying a breakthrough campaign in much the same fashion as his team-mate did last time around. Liverpool lad: Jordon Ibe impressed for Wycombe at just 15 and the Reds made sure they snapped him up . Striker: James Wilson (Manchester United) 'James Wilson scores goals,' his former schoolteacher told Sportsmail last year. The 18-year-old duly debuted for United against Hull City and bagged a brace in a 3-1 win. Then caretaker boss Ryan Giggs had charted his progress through the academy and wasted no time in handing him a senior start. He may have to be a little more patient under Louis van Gaal, but goals are his game and, to that end, age is an irrelevance. Boy wonder: James Wilson scored a double on his Manchester United debut last season . Striker: Adam Armstrong (Newcastle) Devastatingly quick, the Geordie frontman was part of the England Under 17 squad which triumphed at the Euros in Malta this summer. Alan Pardew has already given him a taste of senior action and the Toon Army like what they see, quickly conducting a terrace chant for one of their own. More first-team exposure beckons and, with United short on out-and-out attacking options, a couple of early-season strikes could well see him win an extended stay in the side.

"Click here for updates on Phil Hughes' condition after his injury . I never once worried about being hit by a cricket ball. It’s just something that did not cross my mind. I even fielded at silly point without a helmet because I felt I could get out of the way should the need arise. But the shocking incident involving Phil Hughes makes me wonder whether I was too gung-ho and blase. I had plenty of broken bones, of course, and was once struck a glancing blow on the helmet by Brett Lee at Perth but you always just thought that you would be out for a few weeks and would then get on with it. It was part and parcel of the game and will always be so with such a hard cricket ball. WARNING Some pictures and video in this story may be distressing . Nasser Hussain sways away from a bouncer during a Test against South Africa at Headingley in 2003 . South Africa's lightning quick bowler Allan Donald has Hussain in all sorts of trouble with a short ball . Hussain falls to the ground after trying to get out of the way of a Brett Lee bouncer . The then-England captain ends up sprawled on his back during the Test at Perth in 2002 . Hussain ducks out of the way to avoid a short ball . You never think about serious injury to yourself even when you see it happen to someone else, like when I was playing for Essex at Chelmsford against Leicestershire and two of Phil Whitticase’s teeth came flying past me at second slip after he was hit in the face by the dear, late Neil Williams. Whitticase was in a dreadful state, there was blood everywhere, and he needed dental reconstruction work but you think of it as an occupational hazard and thankfully injuries as experienced by Hughes are extremely unusual. This, of course, is a huge shock and everyone’s thoughts go out to Hughes, a real fighter who has overcome adversity to be on the brink of a return to the Australian Test team. Those fighting qualities have never been needed more. Spare a thought too for the bowler whose bouncer struck Hughes, Sean Abbott. He will be feeling absolutely terrible but no blame will be attached to him and it was good to see the cricket community rallying round him. Every cricketer will be checking his safety equipment now and every helmet manufacturer will be looking to see if they can make even more improvements to their product, as they did when Stuart Broad was hit in the face at Old Trafford last summer. But the fact is, this is incredibly rare. I would say to every young cricketer out there that it is 99.9 per cent certain that something like this will never happen to you. There are inherent risks involved in cricket, of course, but they are part of the game. Phil Hughes is hit on the head by Sean Abbott's delivery at the SCG on Tuesday . The ball goes through Stuart Broad's grille and injures the England star during a Test against India last year . Hussain fielding at short leg for England - with a helmet on - in 2003 . Every precaution is taken now at youth level to ensure that cricketers have as much protection as they possibly can. Helmets are compulsory for any hard ball match at schools level and that includes wicketkeepers too, because we saw with Mark Boucher two years ago that they are not exempt from the risks. I do a bit of coaching and one thing I will say is that I will be reminding my players of the need to stay alert in the nets when you are watching or waiting for your turn to bowl. Being hit at the back of the nets, obviously without any protective equipment, is almost a bigger danger than when you’re batting. It was different when I was a kid. I didn’t wear a helmet until I was on the brink of becoming a professional and I was initially uncomfortable with a grille because I was concerned that I couldn’t see the ball properly. I had a massive gap between my grille and the peak of my helmet and I was so superstitious that I kept the same old lid that would probably have shattered into a million pieces had it truly been struck. But I never thought about that. Go back further and people like David Lloyd used to face the likes of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson without a helmet and he would even field at short leg without one. Can you imagine doing that? That was one area where I did draw the line. If someone like Matt Hayden, in my day, aimed a slog sweep you wanted to have as much protection on as possible and I always wore a helmet there. Hussain in 1990, near the start of his professional career, wearing his helmet with peak and grille miles apart . Nasser gets a tennis ball stuck between his peak and his grille during a demonstration on Sky . Mike Atherton will tell you that helmets have been the biggest game changer of the last 40 years because there’s no doubt they have switched the game more heavily in the batsmen’s favour and changed techniques. Even tail-enders stay very much in the line of the ball now. But that doesn’t mean that truly horrible accidents cannot happen and that’s what we saw at the SCG. At times like this all you can do is hope and pray that Phil Hughes will pull through. The cricket world is thinking of him.

"The most exciting thing about Jos Buttler is that he can hit 360 degrees — he can play almost any shot, anywhere. That’s not to say we should be expecting him to open his box of tricks in a Test match. It would be completely unfair to burden him with that. But from what we’ve seen of him so far in limited-overs cricket for England, the boy has got some serious talent. Nice move: Jos Buttler and England warm up with a game of touch rugby at Ageas Bowl on Thursday . His hand-eye coordination and bat speed are exceptional — a bit like Eoin Morgan’s. He has strong wrists, which may help explain his prowess at squash, and obviously a good deal of self-confidence. It’s a combination that can make him very hard to bowl to. We saw during his fantastic 121 off 74 balls in that one-dayer against Sri Lanka at Lord’s in May that, by the end, they didn’t know where to bowl. He was just smashing them over extra cover for six. Of course, Test cricket is a different beast. There are slips and a gully in pretty well all the time, and the edges that might fly to third man in a one-day game can end up in a fielder’s hands in a Test match. There are times when I’ve watched him play red-ball cricket that he has gone hard at the ball early on and that can lead to nicks. So he’ll need time to adjust — just as he will behind the stumps. You still need a technique to survive in Test cricket. Players such as Alec Stewart and Matt Prior  had exactly that and we saw at Lord’s with MS Dhoni that a keeper-batsman can struggle with lateral movement if his technique isn’t quite up to scratch. But the natural talent is clearly there. He plays the ramp shot differently from Tillekeratne Dilshan with his Dilscoop. Dilshan goes down early and hits the ball back over his head, with the blade of the bat facing him. Buttler stands up, shimmies across his stumps — but not so far that he’s exposing them too much — and watches the ball. He doesn’t try to overhit and keeps his head in line with the ball. He has a strong bottom hand and almost rubbery wrists, and has the confidence to go through with the stroke. The result can be that bowlers then go wide outside off to stop him playing the ramp, but then he responds with a kind of reverse-scoop or swat over backward point. If the bowlers go full, he sets himself early and gets his front leg out of the way. Because his hands are so quick, he can latch on to anything that isn’t quite yorker length and has the leverage to hit it over the top. There was a one-dayer against South Africa at Edgbaston in 2012 when they had set the field to stop him playing the ramp so instead he just stood up and hit everything in the V. He absolutely destroyed them. The question is whether he can transfer this mindset into Test cricket, though of course all these exciting shots are mainly for the one-day game. People have to realise he could take a while to adapt to the longer form, just as it took a while  for Buttler to convince everyone he could do a job for England in  limited-overs cricket. But, with the English game at such a low ebb right now, he is definitely worth getting excited about.","Buttler called up for Third Test against India .

"Double Grand National-winning jockey Carl Llewellyn has somehow been invited back on to the same Cheltenham preview panel on which he made a vile racist comment. Llewellyn was fined £1,500 by the British Horseracing Authority, axed as a Jockey Club racecourse host and interviewed under caution by Gloucester Police after inexcusably telling an audience of 140 punters at famous racing pub, the Hollow Bottom that ‘There are no n*****s in here because Hugh (the owner) doesn’t allow them in.’ Minister of Sport Helen Grant called his remark ‘horrific’. Jockey Carl Llewellyn has been invited on to the Cheltenham preview panel despite his racist comment . Llewellyn, assistant trainer for Nigel Twiston-Davies, apologised and after his BHA disciplinary he said: ‘I’m very aware that any success I’ve had in racing brings with it responsibility. On that evening I failed to live up to that responsibility.’ Yet despite the huge sensitivity around racism in sport, the Hollow Bottom is staging its pre-Cheltenham Festival event with exactly the same cast list as last year — including Llewellyn. The decision will exasperate those trying to change racing’s often insular attitude but pub owner Hugh Kelly said: ‘It’s entirely appropriate Carl is on the panel. He has paid his dues so why shouldn’t I employ him.’ A BHA spokesman said: ‘This issue was dealt with at the time. We cannot tell the Hollow Bottom how to conduct their business.’ Rory McLeod, the only British Muslim on the snooker circuit, was wearing a waistcoat logo badge bearing the initials ISIS in his match against Ronnie O’Sullivan in the Welsh Open, causing a furore on social media. McLeod explained that accountants ISIS Business Solutions - rather than an Islamic terror organisation - had been his personal sponsors for 14 years.

David Beckham’s relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson has thawed somewhat since the infamous boot-in-the-face incident was followed by his transfer to Real Madrid. Still, it was a surprise to see the pair separated only by Beckham’s spokesman Simon Oliveira at the Parc des Princes as they watched Chelsea draw with Paris Saint-Germain. The seating plan was said to be concidence. Ferguson was in Paris on holiday with his wife, while Beckham  played briefly for PSG before his retirement. David Beckham (left) and Sir Alex Ferguson (right) watched PSG'S 1-1 draw against Chelsea on Tuesday night . Aston Villa have not only gone for a new manager in Tim Sherwood, who was sacked by Spurs but also appointed a chief commercial officer Charlie Wijeratna, who was axed by Spurs chairman Daniel Levy for failing to find new sponsors. Wijeratna has had a more successful time as commercial director for the inauguaral European Games in Baku 2015, but is leaving before a UK broadcasting deal is signed and what will be a difficult ticket sale process. Meanwhile well-travelled former ECB and ICC communications chief Colin Gibson is expected to take up the same role in Baku. Charlie Wijeratna has been appointed a chief commericial officer at Aston Villa . Figo swerves race row . Luis Figo’s advisers have switched Thursday’s launch of his FIFA presidential campaign manifesto from Stamford Bridge to Wembley to avoid the furore over Chelsea fans’ racist behaviour overshadowing the event. Figo has been vocal about racism issues in the past, calling it ‘not a football problem, but a wider social ill’. Going to the national stadium could be awkward as the FA are supporting Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan. But the prince has no problem over the change of venue, with Sepp Blatter’s three challengers effectively acting in concert to maximise opposition to a fifth term.

Surrey chairman Richard Thompson outlined his serious concerns about the future of Test cricket to an MCC audience who took on board the message. Thompson fears agreeing a future tours programme of Test cricket after 2019 will be hugely difficult such is the dominance of white-ball cricket. West Indies are one of those countries in which Test cricket is in steep decline and a seriously sub-standard Test series in the Caribbean against England in April could mark the beginning of the end for the five-day game.

"A Nigerian ‘witch-hunter’ who claims any child who cries is a ‘servant of Satan’ could be banned from the UK following calls to Home Secretary Theresa May that she is a risk to youngsters. Campaigners are urging for Helen Ukpabio, known as ‘Lady Apostle’, to be deported and banned from returning to the UK on the grounds her preaches are harmful to the public. The born-again Christian Pentecostal preacher, who founded the controversial African Evangelical franchise Liberty Foundation Gospel Ministries in Nigeria, is thought to currently be in the UK. Campaigners are urging for Helen Ukpabio, known as 'Lady Apostle', to be deported and banned from returning to the UK on the grounds her preaches are harmful to the public . It understood she flew into London where she has been holding a number of church services to promote her belief in witchcraft and offer help to those ‘under threat’ from the wizardry. A poster advertising one of Ms Ukpabio’s most recent talks – which was cancelled after the venue was leaked online – claims to offer help to people who are under ‘witchcraft attack, ancestral spirit attack or mermaid spirit attack’ and claims to help ‘disconnect' them. However, campaigners have warned her controversial views are dangerous to children – including the belief that ‘if a child under the age of two screams in the night, cries and is always feverish with deteriorating health, he or she is a servant of Satan’. The Witchcraft and Human Rights Information Network (WHRIN), the Bar Human Rights Committee of England and Wales and the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) have now written to the Home Secretary in an attempt to get Ms Ukpabio deported under the Immigration Act 1971 - on the grounds her presence here is not conducive to the public good. In a letter to Ms May, the campaigners warn: ‘Whilst the Government has moved swiftly to block entry to the UK for Islamic preachers whose presence is considered as harmful to the public good, there have been no cases of Christian pastors facing such measures.’ Campaigners have written to Home Secretary Theresa May in an attempt to get the preacher deported under the Immigration Act 1971 - on the grounds her presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good . The groups are hoping the pastor will be banned from returning to the UK once she has completed her final tour. Gary Foxcroft, of the WHRIN said Ms Ukpabio was one of a number of preachers who regularly travelled to the UK. He told the Independent: ‘The fundamental problem is that churches need to be regulated. Anyone can set up a church tomorrow in their own garden shed with no commitment to child protection or making their accounts transparent or any theological training.’ Bob Churchill, of the IHEU, also told the newspaper: ‘It is important that the UK authorities send a message to the world that branding children, or anyone, as a witch is beyond the pale.’ ‘Lady Apostle’ Helen Ukpabio is the founder of the controversial African Evangelical franchise Liberty Foundation Gospel Ministries in Cross River State, Nigeria. The Christian fundamentalist and a Biblical literalist founded the church in 1992 and now claims to have 150 branches worldwide. With its headquarters in Calabar in Southern Nigeria, the Liberty Gospel Church has grown to be a witch hunting church with branches in Nigeria and overseas. Ms Ukpabio founded the church to fulfil her ‘mission’ of delivering people from witchcraft attack and organises deliverance sessions where she identifies and exorcises people, mainly children, of witchcraft. The born-again Christian Pentecostal preacher claims to have the power to identify and exorcise ‘witch children’ who are possessed by the devil. She uses her sermons to incite hatred, intolerance and persecution of alleged witches and wizards. Her supporters, of which there are many in West Africa, believe she is a servant of God who has helped eradicate spiritual ailments from humankind. Her beliefs – promoted through her publications (Unveiling the Mysteries of Witchcraft), films (End of the Wicked) and sermons - fuel witchcraft accusations against children in the region. In some of the poorest parts of Nigeria, thousands of children are being blamed for catastrophes, death, famine and branded witches.","Helen Ukpabio founded controversial Liberty Foundation Gospel Ministries .

Chelsea’s new commercial chief Christian Purslow hired outside agency HTH, run by two former Manchester United executives, to help with his sponsorship hunt.

FIFA president Sepp Blatter says it is business as usual for his Zurich staff, who have been told not to get involved in any electioneering that would be in breach of regulations that were not in place last time Blatter faced competition for his crown. However, FIFA and Blatter — bidding for a fifth term — are so intertwined it is impossible for the communications team not to effectively support Blatter in their day-to-day work. So, unless the president forms a stand-alone campaign team, he is making a mockery of the election process. But FIFA have insisted that Blatter was not intending to set up a separate election operation as he was not campaigning. FIFA President Sepp Blatter arrives for the International Football Association Board AGM in Northern Ireland . The most awkward moment at the IFAB summit in Belfast so far was FA chairman Greg Dyke’s quick welcome handshake with Sepp Blatter.

The FA of Wales president Trefor Lloyd Hughes and vice president David Griffiths are still insisting that the gentlemen’s agreement between the Home Nations chiefs from the 2011 IFAB meeting at Celtic Manor is relevant today. That would mean it is Wales’s turn to provide the British vice-president on the FIFA ExCo. But the three other countries regard the changes in statutes that see the whole of UEFA voting for the British place voiding that pact.

"Front gunner Leslie Davenport, from Birmingham, was on the way back from a raid with Bomber Command over Berlin on September 7, 1941 when he was shot down and captured by the Nazis . A man who was fascinated with his grandfather's plane crash behind enemy lines during the Second World War has tracked down the wreckage in a forest in Germany after years of research. Front gunner Leslie Davenport, from Birmingham, was on a raid over Berlin on September 7, 1941 - one of the most dangerous missions for Bomber Command. Returning from the German capital, the Short Stirling plane he was flying in was badly damaged by flak and then attacked by a night fighter. With the starboard outer engine in flames and the wing badly damaged, pilot Alick Yardley gave the order to bail out of the stricken plane. Leslie, who was 20 at the time but had already flown in 13 missions in RAF bombers, and the rest of the crew made a lucky escape, but were soon captured and put in prison camps. Leslie's grandson, Ian Davenport, has been fascinated with the story since childhood. In 2008, 20 years after his grandfather's death, he decided to track down the crash site. The 32-year-old said: 'I had been lucky enough to make contact with Alick Yardley's daughter Elizabeth on the internet. 'Sadly, both of our relations had passed away, so I felt it my duty to locate the spot in Germany where the Stirling bomber crashed that fateful night. 'That night Alick gave the order to bail out into the unknown, and the story goes that my grandfather helped him put on his parachute. 'The crew survived the jump and landed in a forest but local security captured them and they were marched into prison camps for the rest of the war.' Mr Davenport's research suggested Recklinghausen, a city in western Germany, could be the location of the doomed Stirling's final resting place. He wrote to the local newspaper and contacted the town archive to see if anyone had any information. 'I had numerous replies from eyewitnesses from 1941,' he said. 'Some of them gave me an exact road name where the bomber came down. This made me delve deeper into the web of information I had unearthed.' Scroll down for video . The front gunner and his four other crew members bailed out of the Short Stirling bomber behind enemy lines and were captured by the Nazis . Leslie Davenport survived the war and died in 1988. In 2008, his grandson Ian Davenport decided to track down the wreckage of where the plane crashed, finding large chunks of the bomber . Leslie Davenport and his five crew members bailed out of the Short Stirling bomber (file picture) after it suffered damage from flak and a night fighter . After help from town archivist Matthias Kordes, Mr Davenport contacted Uwe Benkel, the head of a search group for missing Second World War airmen, which scours Germany and recovers remains for a proper funeral. In the end, the precise location of the crash site was only pinpointed by chance when Rene Karassek, a member of the search group, spoke to a young boy passing on his bicycle, who just happened to know where the wreckage was. Mr Davenport said: 'A whole host of wreck parts, from bullet cases, aluminium parts, flexi glass and cockpit fragments, were lying on the floor. 'One of the most notable finds was a pressure gauge from the pilot dash board. All had the RAF markings and maker's stamps on.' Mr Davenport flew out to Germany this summer with his father, Anthony, and Elizabeth Yardley. After working out where the plane had come to rest, Ian Davenport (left) travelled to Germany with (from l-r) Elizabeth Yardley, pilot Alick Yardley's daughter, crash site locator Rene Karrasek and his father Anthony Davenport . A plaque stands at the crash site in a forest outside the city of Recklinghaus, western Germany . He said: 'It was an awe-inspiring visit. It signified the start of a journey that would change my grandfather for the rest of his life. 'He would suffer harsh winters, lack of food as a prisoner of war and never quite know if he would ever make it home. 'I later sent a plaque to Germany and it was recently erected at the crash site by Uwe and Rene at their own cost. I can't thank them enough.' He added: 'On that visit to Germany I felt I was the closest I had ever been to him since he passed.' Leslie was eventually repatriated and married Eileen, Mr Davenport's grandmother, in 1946. They went on to have three sons, Anthony, Richard and Michael. Mr Davenport added: 'He never spoke about the war nor did he go to the reunions. 'I think the things he witnessed he wanted to forget and move on with his life. 'My grandfather was one of the lucky ones in certain respects, but had to endure the harshness of being a prisoner at such a young age and live with this for the rest of his life.' Mr Davenport is now trying to track down the family of crew members Flight Officer Clive Mayor Hall, Sgt Jack H Boulton, and Sgt Johnny M Sutton. He has already contacted the family of fellow crew member Sgt Don Owens, and Sgt Arthur Speakman, who is still alive and living in Preston. Anyone with information can email Mr Davenport at ian-davenport@hotmail.com . RAF Bomber Command's role during the Second World War was to bomb the enemy's airbases, shipping, troops, communications and other industries connected to the German war effort. Britain had to use long-range bombing after Dunkirk in 1940 until D-day in 1944 as it had no other way of attacking the Germans. The job fell to RAF air crews - some of who were just 18 - who flew increasingly heavier types of long-range bombers. It was so successful that Hitler was forced to divert nearly a million men, 55,000 artillery guns and a large part of the German air force on to defending the nation instead of fighting offensively. Bomber Command flew almost every day and mostly at night during the war to avoid being shot down - but this meant it was difficult to locate small targets. In 1941 it was decided whole industrial cities should be priority targets. Larger four-engine bombers and improved navigation equipment then followed to create a formidable fighting force. The repeated and persistent attacks on German cities which followed became a critical factor in the liberation of Europe and the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. Bomber Command's targeting of large industrial areas was considered controversial by many, with firebombing killed tens of thousands of civilians in Dresden in just two days. Working class housing areas were targeted because they had a higher density and firestorms were more likely. This disrupted the German workforce and the Germans capability of producing more weapons. The plan was highly controversial even before it started, but the Cabinet thought bombing was the only option available to attack Germany directly as a major invasion of the continent was years away. The tactic has been strongly criticised leading to accusations of war crimes.","Leslie Davenport was a front gunner for Bomber Command during WW2 .

"The old wives’ tale that cows lie down when it is about to rain may not be so far fetched after all, according to a new study by scientists. For researchers have discovered that cows stand up for longer periods when it is hot, proving there is a definite link between their behaviour and the weather. They also suggest that cows lie down when it is colder, which is often what happens to the weather just before it rains. Weather gauge: Cows are more likely to lie down when it is cold, the study shows . The study unwittingly lends credibility to British farming folklore which has long suggested that the sight of a herd of the beasts lying down in a field is a good sign that rain is on the way. University animal scientists specifically researched the body temperature of cattle across the great American west because when cows are too hot, their milk production suffers. And the study, by the universities of Arizona and Northwest Missouri, found that cows stand up for longer when it is hotter because it helps lower their core body temperature. By exposing more of their surface area, it allows their body heat to disperse in the air. When cows get too hot they pant more, eat less and so produce less milk. Cows lie down when they want to conserve heat, and energy, and farmers in particularly hot climates should try and get their herds to lie down more. Research: The study was conducted by the University of Arizona (pictured) and the University of Northern Missouri . But this may also unwittingly explain why it may be true that cows lie down when rain is on the way in more temperate climates. As any weather enthusiast knows, rain is usually preceded by a bout of low pressure which is easy to detect and is also a sign that it is about to get colder. If cows lose heat by standing up, as the US study now suggests, then detecting the arrival of colder weather will make them lie down. Lead researcher Dr Jamison Allen of the University of Arizona presented his findings to a US conference on animal science. He said: 'Predicting heat stress is vital for keeping cows healthy and productive. 'Cows prefer standing to lying on hot days. Cows stand to allow more of their surface area to disperse heat into the air. 'We can predict the animal’s behaviour to stand according to their core temperature. 'But by encouraging cows to lie down, producers will also help their cows conserve energy.'

"'Psychology in the Bathroom' lifts the lid on loo behaviour . A new psychology book lifts the lid on the most natural of human behaviours, yet one of the the least explored – excretion. Yes, you read that right. The act of going to the loo may well often be the butt of a joke (sorry!) but there's a much more serious side, linked to our psychology, don't you know? Citing studies, facts, figures and theories, 'Psychology in the Bathroom' enlightens readers on all areas of toilet-related behavior, including flatulence, incontinence and constipation. Despite its humorous tone, the book tackles this most taboo of topics from a serious scientific standpoint. Is constipation associated with particular kinds of personality? Why do we feel shame and disgust about our toilet habits? These are just a few of life’s dirtiest questions the book attempts to answer. Written by Professor Nick Haslam, the head of the school of psychology at the University of Melbourne, 'Psychology in the Bathroom (£19.99 Palgrave Macmillan) also investigates cubicle graffiti, toilet-related swearing and erotic urination. In the chapter dedicated to breaking wind, the author writes, 'Psychologists have paid little attention to the ludic aspects of flatulence.' The study into the breaking of wind presented college students with a description of hypothetical wind situations and asked the students to judge them on how polite, malicious and humorous they were. The study found that wind was deemed most polite when accidental, silent, odourless and among acquaintances, and most malicious and obnoxious when deliberate, loud rank and in the presence of strangers. No surprises there then. The book tackles a taboo in today's society: flatulence . 'Interestingly, the farts are most humorous when they are halfway between politeness and obnoxiousness - odourless and in the presence of acquaintance but also loud and deliberate. They are potentially embarrassing but not outright shameful,' Haslam writes. Did the college students really need a team of psychologists to come to that conclusion? Possibly not. In another chapter called 'The Anal Character' the author investigates the famous Freudian theory that typical 'anal' characteristics (orderliness, obstinacy and prudence) really are linked to 'concern with defecation'. In other words, do people with uptight personalities also have an aversion to poo? The book describes several studies that have explored whether this link really exists. In one such experiment by Roswenwald in 1966, participants had to try to identify metal objects at the bottom of a tank using just their sense of touch. In order to feel the objects, the participants had to plunge their arms elbow-deep into the tank, which was filled either with water or a 'faecal-like stimulus'. (The scientists created a thick smelly mixture using crankcase oil and flour.) Psychology in the Bathroom: It's a smelly topic but someone has to deal with it . Sure enough, on the task that involved the poo-like mixture, people who had anal characteristics performed worse than other participants. On the task that only involved water there was no difference in performance. This led the study's authors to conclude that Freud was right - people with an 'anally retentive' personality really do have an aversion to poo. Another poo conundrum solved. Hmm, we're not so sure. Haslam also explores the human swearing habit. Did you know that has links to toilet habits too? According to one study of swearing in 25 languages, faeces is by far the most common theme, with 'arseh*#e', 'fa*t', 'pr*t', 'sh*t' and 'turd' the most commonly used expletives. Sodomy-themed words came a close second, with 'bugg*r' and 's*d' at the top of the list. The study also found that excrement and flatulence related swear words were used more frequently than urinary ones and that urinary words were also deemed less offensive. Who knew scientists had dedicated so many grey cells to exploring such enlightening matters?","'Pyschology in the Bathroom' is written by Professor Nick Haslam .

"Rutgers University Athletic Director Tim Pernetti was pushed out today as he handed in a letter of resignation arguing that he initially wanted to fire the school's basketball coach last year after a video revealed that he was hitting and screaming at his players, but Pernetti claims that university officials convinced him not to oust the coach. The school's interim vice president was also fired on Friday as the two men were involved in a decision to 'rehabilitate' rather than fire coach Mike Rice whose abusive behavior was captured on a video. University president Robert Barchi's job appeared to be safe after getting a public nod of support from the school's board of governors. Scroll down for videos . Fired: The dismissal of Rutgers Athletic Director Tim Pernetti is coming at 1pm on Friday following his decision not to immediately dismiss the basketball coach when he saw the tape . First time out: Basketball coach Mike Rice, seen here on Thursday in the driveway of his home, was fired on Wednesday just days after an old video of him screaming at players was released . Under a microscope: Many have called for University president Robert Barchi, seen here Thursday night, to be fired as well due to his involvement but no announcement has been made regarding his professional future . The day began with a letter of . resignation sent to Barchi by AD Tim Pernetti, who said he hoped his . tenure at Rutgers 'will not be judged by this one incident.' When he first saw the video of coach . Mike Rice pushing, shoving and throwing balls at players in November, . Pernetti said he wanted to fire him on the spot. However, he said the consensus among school officials at the time was that it didn't warrant dismissal. The video, shown Tuesday on ESPN, prompted outrage not only on the Rutgers campus but nationwide. It also includes obscenities and . slurs, which the campus is especially sensitive because of the suicide . by student Tyler Clementi, who jumped off a bridge days after his . roommate used a webcam to see him kissing another man. Admission: Tim Pernetti, pictured right with Rice, has admitted that his decision to suspend Rice in December - and not fire him - was the wrong move . Anger: In this clip, Mr Rice, in white, is seen gesturing aggressively towards one of the Rutgers players . At a news conference Friday, Barchi . said he first saw the video this week, but was aware it existed in late . November. He said Pernetti gave him a summary of what was on it at the . time. Pernetti's finest hour may have been when he helped in the school's move to the Big Ten Conference, which means millions in additional revenue by way of television contracts and more national exposure, especially in football. The move, which becomes official in 2014, should provide a big boost to the program in recruiting and season ticket sales. The Scarlet Knights will continue to play next season in the Big East. Pernetti's first major move as athletic director came in May 2010, when he hired the volatile Rice away from Robert Morris, which he took to two NCAA tournament appearances. ‘He convinced me he understood his reputation, but he also understood where the line was,’ Pernetti said, referring to Rice. ‘I made clear to him if he crossed the line he would be held accountable.’ Pernetti viewed Rice as the man who could turn the perennially underachieving program around. It didn't happen. Rice went 44-51 in three years and posted a 16-38 mark in the Big East after going 73-31 in three seasons at Robert Morris. The Scarlet Knights went 15-16 this season, including 5-13 in the league. 'This was a failure of process. I . regret that I did not ask to see this video when Tim first told me of . its existence,' Barchi said. 'I want to apologize to the entire Rutgers community for the negative impact that this situation has had on Rutgers. 'I also apologize to the LGBT . community and all of us who share their values for the homophobic slurs . shown on that video. I personally know how hurtful that language can . be.' Based on the information he received . from Pernetti, Barchi said he 'agreed with and supported his . recommendation to suspend, rather than fire, coach Rice at that time. It . was not until Tuesday evening of this week, when I watched the video, . that I had the opportunity to witness personally for the first time what . Tim had seen last fall. 'I was deeply disturbed by the . behavior that the video revealed, which was much more abusive and . pervasive than I had understood it to be. As Tim acknowledged on . Wednesday, his decision to rehabilitate, rather than fire, coach Rice . was wrong.' Pernetti was given the video by a . former employee, Eric Murdock, and the decision was made in December to . suspend Rice for three games, fine and dock him pay totaling $75,000 and . order him to attend anger management classes. The 42-year-old Pernetti is a Rutgers graduate who played tight end for the Scarlet Knights from 1989-93. Also resigning Friday was John B. Wolf, Rutgers' interim senior vice president and general counsel, who is . believed to have recommended against firing Rice in December. On Thursday, assistant coach Jimmy Martelli resigned. What did they know and when did they know it? Teachers, alumni, politicians and gay rights activists demand that . Rutgers president Robert Barchi, left, and athletic director Tim . Pernetti join Rice on the unemployment line . Outrage: Garden State Equality organized a demonstration near the school on Wednesday, questioning why Rice wasn't fired sooner . Speaking out: New Jersey Gov Chris Christie said in a series of Twitter posts that he supported Rutgers' decision to remove Rice . Barchi's position appears to be safe. 'At the end of the day, he has to run . this place, day in and day out,' Ralph Izzo, chairman of the school's . board of governors, said. 'And I think he is the right person to run this place for many years to come. 'Dr. Barchi was brought on here eight . months ago with two primary objectives: No. 1 was to build a strategic . plan for this university for 10 years, going forward, to lead us to . academic success and academic greatness; and No. 2, an enormous . challenge of integrating a medical school with this university. 'Being on the job two months, hearing . from a general counsel and the athletic director that there was a . serious problem, I think he did the right thing by acquiescing to that . advice at the time.' Governor Chris Christie issued a . statement Friday calling Pernetti's resignation 'appropriate and . necessary given the events of the past six months. Axed: Former Rutgers coach Mike Rice was fired on April 3 after a video emerged of him shoving players and berating them with insults and gay slurs . Slurs: In one portion of the video, Rice unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players, saying: 'You f***ing fairy! You're a f***ing f****t!' 'I commend President Barchi for his . decisive leadership in coming to an agreement with Mr. Pernetti to have . the Athletic Department of Rutgers University come under new . leadership,' he said. 'This entire incident was regrettable . and while it has damaged the reputation of our state University, we need . to move forward now on a number of fronts which provide great . opportunities for Rutgers' future.' Pernetti said in his resignation . letter to Barchi that he has 'spent a great deal of time reflecting on . the events which led to today. As you know, my first instincts when I . saw the videotape of Coach Rice's behavior was to fire him immediately.' 'However, Rutgers decided to follow a process involving university lawyers, human resources professionals, and outside counsel. 'Following review of the independent . investigative report, the consensus was that university policy would not . justify dismissal. I have admitted my role in, and regret for, that . decision, and wish that I had the opportunity to go back and override it . for the sake of everyone involved.'","Athletic Director Tim Pernetti to be fired after scandal over video of basketball coach Mike Rice .

"The website of Olympic bobsledder Justin Kripps has been censored by Russia's strict Internet laws while the Canadian is in Sochi for the Winter Games. The heavy-handed censorship has led to speculation as to whether a recent picture of Kripps and his teammates posing bare-chested may have fallen foul of President Putin's anti-gay laws. Kripps had been using the website to keep fans updated on the team's preparations for the Olympics, but when he arrived in Sochi he found access to it had been barred. Scroll down for video . Fans: Justin Kripps, left, and his teammates were voted 'Beards of the Week' by a gay blogger when the Olympic hopeful posted this picture online . When the 27-year-old pilot of Canada's three-man bobsled team tried to log into his website from his cellphone an error message, written in Russian, appeared. Kripps used an online translator to decipher the message and discovered his website had been 'restricted' because it contained information prohibited by Russian law. It is believed the ban could be related to a tweet that Kripps sent on February 6, that linked to a video mocking Russia's homophobic laws. He tweeted: 'This is pretty funny' and linked to a short film made by the Canadian Institute of Diversity as part of its Keep The Games Gay campaign. Kripps had also tweeted a team picture in January, which showed him and his bearded teammates wearing only their underpants. Error: This Russian message, blocking Kripps' website says access has been restricted because it is either breaking a law or spreading information prohibited in Russia . Going for gold: Kripps with the four-man Canadian team . The bobsledder's tweets automatically link to the news feed on his website. According to the Wire, the team picture quickly went viral on social media networks last month, and led the team to be declared 'beards of the week' by gay blogger Andrew Sullivan. It is not known if Russian censors cut access to the website because of its popularity within the gay community, but the country has strict laws governing material it deems to be 'homosexual propaganda'. Kripps told CBC the ban was 'pretty crazy'. An online translation that he did of the error message showed three possible reasons for the ban. Denied: Kripps joked on Twitter about his website being censored . The message said it could be restricted because of a court decision; a source which spreads information prohibited in the Russian federation and law; or that the website uses information from right holders that it shouldn't. Kripps took the censorship in good spirits, tweeting: 'Looks like my website is censored in Russia, haha classic #SochiProblems I wonder if there's a camera in my room.' Canadian reporters in Sochi for the Games also reported that they were unable to access the site, and a clear reason for it being blocked has not yet been given.","Justin Kripps has been barred from his own site while in Sochi .

"The body of a man who was 'fueled by obsession' to find a legendary gold mine has reportedly been found in the remote Superstition Mountains of Arizona. Jesse Capen, a 35-year-old bellhop from Denver, disappeared three years ago after heading off to find the 'Lost Dutchman's' gold mine - which has evaded adventurers for centuries. For the intrepid explorer his quest to find the mine, on which he had read more than 100 books and spent all his free time, appears to have ended in tragedy. Scroll down for video . Quest: Jesse Capen, 35, went missing three years ago in the Superstition Mountains while hunting for the 'Lost Dutchman's' gold mine . Peak of adventure: The 'Lost Dutchman's Mine' is believed to be buried deep in Arizona's Superstition Mountains . Hikers found remains last Saturday in a crevice around 35 feet up a cliff face, deep in the Superstition Mountains. The discovery was made in a spot about 60 miles east of Phoenix, according to Maricopa County sheriff's spokesman Brandon Jones. Rescuers had spotted a boot sticking out from the ledge, that was almost impossible to notice. The remains have been sent to the coroner's office for identification but are believed to belong to Mr Capen. An autopsy took place on Tuesday but results are not expected to be conclusive for several weeks. Left behind: Around a month after Mr Capen went missing, hikers found his tent and backpack in the mountains . Desperate search: Rescuers carried out extensive searches every weekend for three years before finding Mr Capen's body balancing on a crevice . The area where the body was found is half a mile from where the man's Jeep and belongings were found in December 2009. The legend of the 'Lost Dutchman's' Gold Mine has been peddled for centuries. Although it is believed to exist by many, no one knows exactly where because the 'Dutchman' Jacob Waltz (who was actually German) took the secret to his grave. He reportedly shot people who tried to follow him into the mountains looking for riches. There are several routes that have been mapped out to find the mine - but no one has ever succeeded and several have died trying. In the 19th century, around 8,000 people would try to reach the mine every year - but the number has dropped down to the hardy few. The former Arizona Attorney-General Bob Corbin is among those who have looked for the mine's existence. As with all legends, stories have grown up around the mine - either that it is cursed or has guardian angels concealing the entrance. Mr Capen's mother said he was obsessed . with finding the Lost Dutchman gold mine and made dozens of detailed . drawings and scoured maps trying to work out its location. The Lost Dutchman’s Mine has been folklore since the 19th century - but many believe in its existence deep in the Superstition Mountain range. Search and Rescue Director Robert Cooper told Fox: 'We call ‘em Dutch hunters out here. 'They’re infatuated with all the lore and the history of the lost Dutchman mine and he was part of that.' Mr Capen's parents refused to comment. A month after Mr Capen disappeared in November 2009, his campsite was found in the mountains, littered with books about his passion. According to rescuers, he had booked into a nearby hotel for a month, then made three or four day trips into the mountains at a time. Mr Capen, had been an employee of the Sheraton Hotel in Denver for ten years, and had made several previous trips in search of his fortune at the mine. His colleagues said he would work almost constant night shifts and rarely socialized with anyone. His sole purpose seemed to be his search for the gold mine.

"Parents who took their kids to see the new SpongeBob movie at a drive-in movie theater in California were horrified to find steamy bondage romp Fifty Shades Of Grey being shown on the adjacent screen. Deborah Powell  brought a group of 12 children to see The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out Of Water on Sunday evening at West Wind Solano Drive-In in Concord, but was shocked when she was parking up and found it unavoidable for herself and her young passengers to see the screen showing Fifty Shades. '[On the screen] at the time there was a woman being slapped, naked, bound up… so, we had to have our children close their eyes,' she told KTVU. Parents who took their kids to see the SpongeBob movie at the West Wind Solano Drive-In movie theater in Concord, California, were horrified to find steamy Fifty Shades Of Grey being shown on the adjacent screen . Deborah Powell took a party of 12 people to the drive-in on Sunday evening to enjoy SpongeBob, but arrived to find scene of a woman being slapped unavoidable . 'I could see another car behind us that had children in there with their eyes closed.' The drive-In has two screens, one pointing north and one west, but both face the same general area making it unavoidable to see what is happening on both screens. Powell said she complained to a theater worker, who told her that other parents had also expressed concerns about the bondage movie being played so close to a children's movie. After trying and failing to shield her kids from the R-rated movie, Powell decided it was best to cancel the planned cinema trip and head home. 'There is no way to avoid looking at that screen. It's too tempting. So, we couldn't stay. So, we had to turn around. My children were devastated.' Syufy Enterprises who run the theater have yet to comment on their decision to show the two movies at the same time. The R-rated movie, which cost only $40 million to produce, took in $93 million from 3,646 locations across the long President's Day holiday .

"The elaborate tattoo emblazoned across Tom 'Billy' O' Connor's muscular shoulder bears the legend: 'Hung Like A Stallion'. But while O'Connor, a 34-year-old former porn star from Colchester, might have a manhood worth bragging about now, that wasn't always the case. Instead he is one of an increasing number of British men opting to go under the knife to enhance their manhood - an operation now so popular, demand has jumped 40 per cent in just one year, according to a leading surgeon. Satisfied customer: 'Gypsy porn' pioneer Tom 'Billy' O'Connell has spoken out about going under the knife . Demand: Leading plastic surgeon, Dr Roberto Viel, has seen demand leap by 40 per cent . 'I know some men – and women – will be amused at what they perceive as self-indulgence,' says  Dr Roberto Viel, who operates on more than 300 men a year in his Harley Street clinic. 'But believe me, large numbers of men reading this will not be laughing – even visiting the gym can cause heartache [for them].' Dr Viel, who says demand for the procedure has shot up by more than 40 per cent in the last year, isn't the only surgeon to find himself bombarded with applications from men desperate to give their manhood a boost. Dr Alessandro Littara, a Milan-based surgeon, claimed last year that demand for penis extension surgery among Italian men was shooting up by a record 25 per cent annually, and pinned the blame on the flood of sexualised images that crop up on everything from TV to billboards. 'With everyone seeing images of the body the whole time these days, men are more aware and worried about their bodies,' he told MailOnline. 'All the parts are important and the genitals are no exception. We're living in the age of images, with sexual ones very often on the front page. Sex gets more attention and people feel the need to be more competitive.' Dr Viel, whose clinic, the London Centre For Aesthetic Surgery, is based on Harley Street, agrees. 'Male models, . notably David Gandy in the D&G adverts, David Beckham for H&M . and model Jamie Dornan for Calvin Klein, posing on buses and billboards in tight . pants that leave little to the imagination drive the trend,' he explains. 'The demand for these . operations is growing constantly.' But it isn't all David Beckham's fault. Indeed, as Dr Viel is keen to point out, porn is also behind the increase - not just in penoplasties, but in breast enhancement and labiaplasty surgery as well. Insecure: Large lunchboxes, such those belonging to Davids Beckham and Gandy, make men less confident . 'It is also the same for girls with smaller breasts,' he explains. 'It’s a similar problem. More and more young people are coming here asking for this operation. 'I am here to help the people. I’m here to listen. I’m not here to judge. But the demand is at an all time high.' For those already in the porn industry such as O' Connell, the pressure to have a large penis is extreme, and as a result, there's little that adult actors won't do to enhance their assets. 'I always had a big one but I wanted a monster,' says O' Connell who had the girth of his penis increased using fat injections. 'Having a big penis is the ultimate - there's no way you could make it in this [porn] industry without it and having surgery helped me get roles every time.' O'Connor, who pioneered a sub-genre called Gypsy porn before retiring after meeting the woman he describes as 'the love of my life', describes the sum he paid for the procedure as 'the best money I ever spent'. But while O'Connor is thrilled, not every penoplasty works out as imagined, with just 35 per cent of men happy with the results, according to the NHS. 50 Shades of Hunk: Well-endowed celebrities such as actor Jamie Dornan are fuelling the trend . That, however, hasn't put men off in the slightest, with many of those who do go under the knife boasting average or large sized penises. The issue, says Dr Viel, is a lack of self-esteem. 'I always ask why the patient wants the treatment at the beginning . of the consultation,' he explains. 'Most tell me it's because they lack confidence, have low self-esteem and don’t feel confident enough to show their penis in front of their partner when it's flaccid. 'It’s a lot to do with the way they . see their own body. If you go to the gym, you don’t need to be an expert . to see that it's always the man with a big penis who is the one parading around the changing . rooms with no towel. 'It makes other men, especially those who think they are smaller, feel intimidated and so they cover up. This is every day life. If you go to the gym and pay attention to that, you will see it.' So can plastic surgery really be the answer to this most intimate of dilemmas? The penis extension market is a large and growing one, with hundreds of gizmos marketed to men desperate to give their manhood a boost. Chop chop: Penis extensions involve cutting the suspensory ligament for an extra one to four inches of length . Prices for penis extending devices can . be as low as £10 - a far more affordable option than a £6,000 . penoplasty - but Dr Viel says men who try to give their bits a boost . using a contraption bought online risk wasting their money. 'Unfortunately . there is no miracle cream to enlarge your penis,' he says. Instead, . surgery is the only option for those who think themselves small - or . simply want a boost. 'The majority of clients are average-sized but you get the odd one who is already very well endowed and doesn’t need . anything but thinks that he wants more,' explains Dr Viel. 'Then there are also men who . have a real small penis and they need help, yes. Having said that, there's not much difference, mentally, between a man with a real small penis and a man . with a normal penis who feels small. 'It's clear this . problem has been neglected by the medical profession for a long time.' The number of patients asking Dr Viel for a penis extension has increased by 40 per cent in the last 12 months. But what does having a penoplasty really involve? The surgeon talks FEMAIL through the operation. 'There are two ways to enlarge your penis,' explains Dr Viel. 'To lengthen a penis, I look for a ligament that runs from the base of the penis to the pubic bone, which is called the suspensory ligament. 'I cut the ligament where it is attached to the pubic bone and in doing that the penis is released and drops out more – and that is the increase in length.' For most men, cutting the ligament results in an increase in length of between one and four inches, while Dr Viel's fat injections can increase girth by the same amount. The extra length, however, only applies to flaccid penises - erect ones remain the same length and tilt upwards at a 90 degree angle. 'I have performed this operation for over 20 years,' adds Dr Viel, 'and I can guarantee that there is no increase in length when erect. If someone claims this is possible, they are wrong.'","Dr Roberto Viel has seen a 40% increase in demand for penis surgery .

"With its beautiful parks, enviable healthcare and location next to one of the world's best coastal drives, it's little wonder people want to live in Melbourne. While it may not necessarily have the glamorous appeal of Sydney, Australia's second city has been ranked the world's most liveable city for the third year running. Home to almost 4.25million people, it beat Austrian capital Vienna into second place, with Vancouver in Canada ranking third. Top spot: Melbourne was lauded in every category from healthcare to education in the rankings which saw it crowned number one place to live in the world for the third year running . Australia dominates the ranking with four cities - Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney and Perth - in the top ten, with Canadian cities accounting for three of the others. Despite its popularity with tourists however, London is nowhere to be seen. The rankings were compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit which explains that the destinations that score highest are 'mid-sized cities in wealthier countries with a relatively low population density.' The ratings take into account: stability, worked out by looking at crime rates and civil unrest; quality of healthcare; culture and environment; education and infrastructure. Each city was given an overall score out of 100 based on its ranking in each catergory. As well as the best places to live, the EIU also ranked the worst - with 28 cities seeing their score drop because of civil unrest from the Arab Spring. Unsurprisingly, war-town Syrian capital Damascus finished bottom of the list. Tripoli in Libya and Tehran in Iran also ranked close to the bottom. Winner: Australia's second city was lauded in all categories, scoring the maximum 100 out of 100 for its healthcare, education and infrastructure and being awarded 95 and 95.1 in the stability and culture and environment categories respectively. The city, home to 4.2million, has topped the rankings for the past three years, scoring 97.5 overall. Melbourne is famed for its vibrant multi-culturalism, burgeoning arts scene, excellent food and wine and is the sporting capital of Australia. Runner up: Vienna was one of only two European cities to make the top ten. Like Melbourne, it scored maximum marks in terms of healthcare, education and infrastructure, and matched the city in terms of stability. But surprisingly, given that the Austrian capital is steeped in history, it fell short in the culture and environment category with a score of 94.4. As well as its history Vienna has a colourful contemporary arts and culture scene, a bustling nightlife, picturesque vineyards on the outskirts and an innovative performing arts scene. Third place: Vancouver in Canada Scored top marks for health, education, and culture and environment. It gained third spot thanks to its 95 out of 100 ranking in terms of stability and a 92.9 mark for infrastructure. The city is known for its majestic natural beauty located between the Coast Mountains and the Pacific ocean. The city is relatively small compared to some of the other top ten destinations with a little over 600,000 living there. Fourth: Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populated city in Canada. It scored top marks in terms of stability, healthcare and education, but fell short of the winners as it scored 97.2 in terms of culture and environment and a relatively low 89.3 in terms of infrastructure. The city's most famous landmark is the CN Tower, which at 1,815 ft tall is one of the world's tallest buildings. The city's surrounds are home to some stunning wineries. Fifth: Calgary is the largest city in Alberta, with a population of almost 1.1million. It scored 100 out of 100 in the stability. healthcare and education categories as well as an impressive 96.4 in terms of infrastructure. But it didn't hit top spot because of its 89.1 rating for culture. It was once ranked the world's cleanest place to live by Forbes magazine. It's a relatively young city but still claims to have a rich history and was the first ever venue for the Winter Olympics. Sixth: Known as Australia's wine capital, Adelaide scored top marks for healthcare and education. But it could only muster 95 in terms of stability, 94.2 in terms of culture and environment and 96.4 in terms of infrastructure. The city's tourism website describes it as the '20 minute city' with all amenities including the airport and beauty spots such as Adelaide Hills within a short distance of the city centre. Adelaide has a diverse cultural mix. Seventh heaven: Sydney is the third of Australia's four cities in the top ten. It scored top marks for healthcare, education and infrastructure, but 90 for stability and 94.4 for culture. Famed for its outdoor lifestyle, the city's iconic landmarks include the Harbour Bridge, the Opera house and some of the world's most beautiful beaches. Sydney is a great place to live if you like watersports, surfing, seafood and wine. Eighth: The Finnish capital scored top marks for stability and healthcare and impressive scores of 96.4 for infrastructure, 91.7 for education and 90 for culture and environment. It is the most populous city in Finland and located on a picturesque arm of the Baltic Sea coastline. It is famed for its art nouveau architecture and maintains its small-town feel despite being an international municipality and a hub for Finnish commerce. Nine: The final Australian entry in the top ten. Perth hit top marks in healthcare, education, and infrastructure and scored 95 in the stability category. But its overall marked was dragged down by an 88.7 score for culture and environment. It is the largest city in Western Australia and home to almost 1.9million people. Australia's 'sunniest capital city', Perth mixes vibrant city culture with stunning nature and is home to some gorgeous beaches. Top ten: Auckland in New Zealand scored top marks for its education. It scored 95 and above in all other categories bar infrastructure, which saw it score 92.9. Like many others in the top ten, Auckland, known as Tamaki Makaurau to the indigenous Maori people, combines nature and a vibrant city life. The city claims that everyone lives within half hour of a beautiful beach, a hiking trail and 'a dozen enchanted holiday islands'.","Melbourne was lauded for its healthcare, education and infrastructure .

"Defense attorneys for the Arizona woman accused of stabbing her ex-boyfriend to death 27 times presented emails in court Thursday in which the victim, a devout Mormon, called his former paramour a 's***' and a 'w****.' Jodi Arias, 32, is on trial for allegedly murdering 30-year-old Travis Alexander by stabbing him in the shower, slitting his throat and then shooting him in the face in June 2008, months after the two had broken up. Arias, a photographer who had dated . Alexander for nearly five months in 2007, has been in jail since her . arrest. She has pleaded not-guilty to first degree murder. If convicted, Arias could become the fourth woman on Arizona's death row. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . On trial: Defendant Jodi Arias, right, talks with her defense team during the prosecution's opening statements in the trial of Arias in Maricopa County court in Phoenix . On Thursday, jurors heard testimony from lead detective Esteban Flores and a recording of a conversation he had with Arias in June 2008. On the call, Arias denied being involved in the death and calmly told the detective that she had not seen Alexander in two months. Visualization: Prosecutor Juan Martinez  points to his neck showing the jury where Travis Alexander had his neck slit by a knife . According to Flores, the defendant told him during questioning that she and Alexander were so distrustful of each other that they shared their Facebook, MySpace and Gmail passwords in a failed bid to patch up their unraveling relationship, ABC News reported. During the first full day of testimony, the prosecution introduced emails between the couple. On cross examination, defense attorney Kirk Nurmi asked Flores whether Alexander referred to his ex-girlfriend in those missives as a s*** and a w****, to which he detective answered in the affirmative. Flores testified that the communique included the 30-year-old Mormon writing to Arias: 'I think I was little more than a dildo with a heartbeat to you.' Attorneys in the trial painted opposing pictures of Alexander, with prosecutors describing him as a person of faith and a 'good man,' and the defense saying he was violent and abusive. Prosecutors argue Arias was a jealous woman who brutally attacked Alexander after he tried to end their relationship. 'This is not a case of whodunit,' Deputy Maricopa County Attorney Juan Martinez said in his opening statement. 'The person who committed this killing sits in court today - Jodi Ann Arias.' Jennifer Willmott, an attorney for Arias, told jurors her client acted in self-defense after Alexander 'lunged at Jodi in anger' in his suburban Mesa home after she dropped his new camera. 'Jodi's life was in danger. He knocked her to the ground in the bathroom where there was a struggle,' Willmott said. 'If she did not have to defend herself, she would not be here.' Troubled couple: A Mesa police detective said Arias told him that she and Alexander were so distressful of one another that they had exchanged online passwords . Motive: The prosecution claimed that Arias flew into a jealous rage after learning that Alexander wanted to date another woman . Possessive: The defense described Alexander as abusive and controlling . Since the murder, investigators said Arias has changed her story three times. Initially, the woman denied being at the scene of the crime until officials found her bloody hand-print on the floor of Alexander's bathroom. Arias later told police that two masked intruders attacked her and killed Alexander, and she didn't call police because she was scared. She then offered an alternative version of events, claiming that she killed Alexander in self-defense because he got violent. Alexander had told friends Arias had become too possessive and was acting like a stalker, so he ended their relationship to see other women. But phone and email records indicate the pair continued to carry on a sexual relationship, The Arizona Republic reported. Story: Arias offered investigators three different versions of events ranging from her denial of being at the scene of the crime to claims of self-defense . Flores downplayed the stalker description, saying Alexander was inviting Arias to his home and the phone calls between them 'were back and forth.' Arias' attorneys have said she was not the sexual instigator in the relationship and pointed to provocative photos Alexander had sent her in an attempt to paint him as a sexual deviant who sought to control his on-again, off-again lover. Willmott showed the jury a T-shirt she says he made Arias wear emblazoned with the phrase 'Travis Alexander's' across the front. 'That t-shirt is the perfect example of how Travis treated her,' she said. According to court records filed by Arias' attorneys, Alexander persuaded her to come to his home on June 4, 2008. They claim the couple had sex, then took provocative photographs of each other, one even showing Alexander posing naked in the shower. Authorities said a camera found in the washing machine at Alexander's home contained a memory card with the photos, including one taken minutes after Alexander posed naked showing his bloody body in the shower. Another photo allegedly showed Arias dragging Alexander across the floor. Offensive terms: Prosecutors presented emails in court in which Travis Alexander called Arias a 'slut' and a 'whore' Accused: Jodi Arias, 32, faces the death penalty after allegedly murdering her ex-boyfriend, right . Travis Alexander and Jodi Arias were involved in a rough sexual relationship before the death of Alexander in June 2008 . Happier times: She met Travis Alexander, a Mormon and motivational speaker, at a Las Vegas conference . The couple had met at a work . conference in Las Vegas in September 2006 and began speaking on the . phone every day. Court records show they exchanged as many as 82,000 . emails. They started dating . in . February 2007 and, because Alexander was a Mormon, Arias chose to be baptized into the church. But they broke up in June 2007, with Arias . telling police jealousy on both sides was to blame. In jail: Arias claimed she had nothing to do with the murder but later said it was out of self defense . In December 2007, Alexander . began dating another girl and allegedly told friends that Arias became so jealous that she . slashed the tyres on his car twice. In June 2008, Alexander told friends he thought Arias might have hacked . into his Facebook account and told her to stay away. Yet on June 4, she visited his home and they had sex before he was murdered. She later told police that they had maintained a secret sexual relationship despite breaking up, ABC reported. 'There's nothing about her that I see in . marriage material - or wife material,' Alexander had said, according to . his friend, Dave Hall. 'But it's hard to say no to a woman that sneaks . into your house, crawls in your bed and tries to, you know, seduce you.' At first she denied being at his . house the day he was killed, yet police found a camera in . Alexander's washing machine containing graphic pictures of the pair having sex. The water-logged camera, which belonged to . Alexander, had been damaged in the washing machine, but the Mesa police crime lab was able to recover images, some of which had been deleted. Among those deleted were pictures showing Alexander posing naked in the shower at 5.22pm, with the last picture . showing him alive at 5.30pm. Later photos showed him bleeding . while on the floor. The camera also contained pictures of Arias posing naked on . Alexander's bed at 1.40pm. On June 9, his friends went to his upscale home after he had failed to return their calls. They found him dead in his shower and his body was 'well into the decomposition process'. Troubled: Alexander's friends said she stalked him in the months before his death and slashed his tires . Missed: Alexander, a motivational speaker from Arizona, was found several days after the killing . Wounds show that Alexander attempted . to fight back, court records show. An autopsy found he sustained 27 puncture . wounds and one gunshot wound, with the bullet found in his left cheek. Investigators also found a bloody left palm print with Arias' DNA on the bathroom wall. Her DNA was also found . in hair recovered from a bloody wall, according to the Arizona Republic. After initially claiming that she had not been at his home that day, Arias changed her story to admit she had been there - but had not killed her ex-boyfriend. 'I witnessed Travis being attacked by . two other individuals,' she told Inside Edition. 'Who were they? I . don't know. I couldn't pick them up in a police lineup.' Scene: A grab shows Alexander's home in Mesa surrounded by police tape after his body was found . Deceit: Police found a camera in Alexander's washing machine, pictured, that contained pictures of him having sex with Arias on the day of the killing. There were also pictures of his dead body . She later changed her story once . again, telling the court that she killed Alexander in self defense after . he became angry when she dropped his camera. She claims he had been sexually and physically abusive throughout their relationship. 'It makes me sick because I know her . true side,' Steven Alexander, Travis Alexander's brother, told ABC. 'And I ask people to please not buy into . this sweet innocent personality that she puts on.' As well as the inconsistencies in her story, Arias' case has been plagued with difficulties with her legal representation. She asked to represent herself but . when she submitted letters to the court that she claimed Alexander had . written - saying he was a pedophile - they were found to be forgeries, and she told a judge she was in 'over her head'. In court: Arias has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder but prosecutors want the death penalty . Her defense team was reinstated but in December 2011, her attorney, Victoria Washington, was granted a motion to withdraw from the case. Jennifer Willmott, a death penalty-qualified defense attorney, had now been assigned to represent Arias. In January 2012, a judge denied a motion asking for the death penalty to be rejected.

"Survivor: Mohammed, whose name has been changed out of fears for his safety, was forced to attend an Islamic State children's camp . A survivor of an Islamic State children's camp today revealed how young boys are being lashed with whips and forced to watch the executions of men and women. Mohammed, whose name has been changed out of fears for his safety, was just 13 when he was made to attend one of the terror group's camps in northern Syria. Under supervision by militants, he was taught the Quran, trained in the use of weapons and forced to watch men being crucified and women stoned to death. He was also made to take oaths of allegiance to ISIS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and witness boys younger than himself being 'brought to the camp and lashed'. Today, Mohammed, who was eventually pulled out of the camp after 30 days by his father and later fled to Turkey with his family, described some of his horrific experiences there. 'When we go to the mosque, they order us to come the next day at a . specific time and place to [watch] heads cut off, lashings or stonings,' he told CNN. 'We . saw a young man who did not fast for Ramadan, so they crucified him for . three days, and we saw a woman being stoned [to death] because she . committed adultery.' Donning a brown t-shirt and fidgeting with his hands, Mohammed said he had not understood some of the words the militants had used, such as 'infidels', nor why he should fight them. Shockingly, he added that one of his friends at the camp had been killed on the front line while trying to help ISIS defeat the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 'He was martyred in Deir Ezzor when he fought . the Free Syrian Army with ISIS. He was my age, 13 or 14 . years old,' he said. Shocking: Mohammed said young boys are being lashed with whips and forced to watch the executions of men and women. Above, a Syrian youngster, donning a balaclava, is trained how to use a rifle at an ISIS camp . Terror group: A rising number of young Syrians are being recruited by the militant group for roles ranging from soldiers and snipers to stretcher bearers and suicide bombers. Above, ISIS militants march in Syria . Mohammed's father, who did not wish to be named, said ISIS had told him that if he prevented his son from attending the camp, they would 'cut off' his head. He added that he had tried to visit his son several times a day out of fears for his well-being, but had been turned away by militants. It comes as a rising number of young Syrians are being recruited by the militant group for roles ranging from soldiers and snipers to stretcher bearers and suicide bombers. Earlier . this year, Human Rights Watch said the extremist Nusra Front and the . Islamic State have both targeted children as young as 15 through . education programs, which include military training. Boy jihadis: Amn Al Qaeda fighter stands with two children while watching ISIS parade in Mosul, Iraq . The . group, which said the number of children fighting in the conflict is . unknown, based its report on interviews with 25 children and former . child soldiers in Syria. ISIS continues to terrorise rivals and civilians alike with widely publicized brutality in Syria and Iraq as it seeks to expand a proto-state it has carved out on both sides of the border. It frequently publishes graphic photos and videos of everything from bombings and beheadings to mass killings and images of jihadis taunting and humiliating terrified troops or other opponents. This afternoon, sickening footage emerged appearing to show ISIS militants parading around 250 captured soldiers through the desert in their underwear before killing them. A militant fighter claimed the men were from the Syrian government's Tabqa air base which extremists seized on Sunday, potentially handing them warplanes, tanks, artillery and ammunition. The video, which has not been . independently verified, shows dozens of men being marched through the . desert wearing only their underwear.

It then fades to black, resuming with a pile of bloodied bodies stacked on top of one another. The precise death toll is uncertain and other sources put it at lower than 250, but at least 150 bodies are visible in the shaky. An Islamic State fighter in Raqqa told Reuters: 'Yes we have executed them all'.","Mohammed, whose name has been changed, was brought to camp at 13 .

"A marketing manager who was too heartbroken to leave her dog at home every day has quit her high flying career of 20 years to open up a café for dogs. Lisa Owen-Jones, 44, from Stoke Newington, north London, was so distraught at leaving her Wire Fox Terrier, Florence, at home that she decided to do something about it. Earlier this year she realised her dream and opened a coffee shop catering exclusively to four-legged-friends and their owners. A marketing manager who was too heartbroken to leave her dog at home every day has quit her high-flying job to open up a café for dogs . Lisa Owen-Jones, 44, from north London, was so distraught at leaving her terrier Florence at home when she went to work that she quit her job - and opened Scooby's Boutique Coffee Bar, based in Muswell Hill . Scooby's Boutique Coffee Bar is based in Muswell Hill and has proved immensely popular with local dog owners. The menu includes doggy lollypups, cheese bone biscuits, flap Jack Russels, dog-gestives and puppaccinos as well as extra special weekend treats for hounds - and Lisa's tried them all. All dogs and humans are welcome and Lisa's over the moon that her beloved Florence can now go to work with her every day. The former marketing manager at BBC Concert Orchestra, said: 'I love my job, I can't think of a better way to spend my time than with man's best friend. 'When I got Florence in 2012 it really was love at first sight, I even carried her round in a puppy rucksack before she could even walk. 'Florence came everywhere with me, on the tube, to the pub, I'd have a beer and Florence would have an ice cube. Lisa Owen-Jones, 44, from Stoke Newington, was distraught at leaving her terrier, Florence . Some dogs 'refuse to walk past unless they can come in for their cheese bone or dog-gestive biscuit' 'But over time I found it harder and harder leaving her to go to my day job. Florence would sit next to the door with sad eyes, I felt so guilty. 'I started thinking about ways I could spend more time with her and Scooby's was born. 'Now some of my most loyal doggy customers refuse to walk past unless they can come in for their cheese bone or dog-gestive biscuit. 'I wouldn't have my life any other way now. 'We have both a human and hounds menu and we also host birthday parties and afternoon tea, we have so much fun. 'But you don't need to have a dog to come to Scooby's, everyone's welcome. It's a place to relax, meet friends and have a nice time.' Lisa's over the moon that her beloved Florence can now go to work with her every day . Both humans and hounds can enjoy a nice drink and treat inside come rain or shine . Lisa has wanted a dog for more than a decade. And after being dragged to countless dog shows, her mother decided to give her the best Christmas present she could ever wish for - a wire fox terrier puppy. The idea of Scooby's came to Lisa after she was left angered by other coffee shops turning her and her pooch away. Lisa said: 'I was tired of waving outside coffee shops trying to get the attendant to notice us. 'I got tired of standing in the rain drinking my coffee, there was no reason why we couldn't go in we just weren't allowed. 'Now both humans and hounds can enjoy a nice drink and treat inside come rain or shine.' Lisa had worked in classical music for over twenty years and had no experience of running a café or coffee bar before. Lisa said: 'It's been a sharp learning curve from writing business plans, learning about coffee machines to sourcing beans. 'In the beginning I signed me and Florence up for dog training classes, I really wanted to be able to feel in control of dogs in all situations. 'We've now passed our puppy foundation, bronze and silver Kennel Club Good Citizenship tests, we will get gold one day. 'Sometimes I think I must be barking but I don't regret the career change. 'I've now tried everything off the human and hound menu, it's all healthy, so why not. Florence favourites are the dog-gestives and mine are the flap Jack Russles. 'I really do love servings my hounds and humans and I've discovered that I really do like trying to make the perfect cup of coffee and love making puppaccions for the dogs - it's very satisfying.' Treats at Scoobys include cheese bone biscuits, flap Jack Russels, dog-gestives and puppaccinos . A bone birthday cake (l) and a hound doing his best to resist a doggy lollipup (r) Scooby's has recently started hosting events, last month Lisa held a photo-call with a pet-friendly Photo Booth to launch a competition for flea and tick protection company Frontline Spot On, which named Christine Hanson as the UK's most dedicated pet owner. Lisa said: 'We hold all kind of different events here at Scooby's, this has been one of my favourites. 'We had a photobooth and the dogs loved dressing up more than the humans, it was a lovely afternoon. 'The most dedicated pet owners were nominated and Christie was a worthy winner. 'Every week Christie drove her dog Roxie to have chemotherapy after she was diagnosed with Lymphoma. 'Sadly in September, Roxie lost her battle and left Christie and her other pooch Copper heartbroken. 'It was an honour being involved in an event with people who adore their pets just as much as me.'

"Robin Boness, from Torquay, is finally working again after five years out of work . A 60-year-old former electrician is finally working again after five years of unemployment and 547 failed job applications. Robin Boness, from Torquay, secured just one interview while he was unemployed, despite applying for hundreds of jobs. A string of rejections and the constant isolation began to take its toll on Mr Boness and he developed severe depression. He said he began to 'hate the world' and wonder if he would ever find work again. He said he got so fed up that he even applied to be the managing director of Imperial Chemical Institutions (ICI) on one of his 'silly days'. But Mr Boness has now found work with Frontline Total Security, a firm based in St Austell, Cornwall, which carries out security contracts around the south west. The 60-year-old, who lives alone, said he is 'over the moon' to be working again and said the new job has turned his life around. When he received his first pay packet, he also went out and treated himself to a steak - for the first time in five years. He said: 'My story shows you should never give up - keep plugging away because there's always something round the corner. 'Now, I love every second of my job and I am so happy to be working. I get treated with respect, treated like a human being. I've completely turned my life around and I love doing the job.' Mr Boness had been working as an electrician for 30 years when he was made redundant. He had gone through brief spells of unemployment, but never more than around two or three weeks. But what Mr Boness thought would be a temporary gap in his CV turned out to be a five-year wait for a job, during which he relied on his weekly £74 state handout. He said: 'It was tight. No matter what people say, you've can't live on the dole. You might be able to survive, but you can't live. 'I used to go out for long walks around Torquay, because that's all I could afford. I love fishing but I couldn't even do that because I couldn't afford a bus fare, or take all my equipment on the bus. 'Even going to the cinema was something I had to save up for.' Although he began applying for electrical work, he soon began applying to do 'anything and everything' around the Torquay area. He could not apply much further afield because he did not have a car - and could not buy one because he did not have the money. Mr Boness also believes his age and the fact he computer illiterate - something he has now remedied - were to blame for his employment struggle. He said: 'I'd been an electrician for 30 years but because of my age I could no longer work at the same speed and I got made redundant, which resulted in me being unemployed for five years. Mr Boness was referred to Pluss, pictured, which finally helped him secure a job in security . 'I felt so low - I couldn't see a future. I applied for 547 jobs which resulted in only one interview. Every advert said you must have a car. 'You just feel so damn useless. It's the being ignored that really drives you down. 'The fact that nobody acknowledges the fact that you are even alive. But you can't give up - we've all got to work.' 'It got the point where I thought this is how it's going to be - I'll go stir crazy. I think I became introverted and snappy. 'For five years, apart from signing on, I didn't speak to people. I hated the world and myself.' Mr Boness's luck changed when he was referred to Pluss, a social enterprise which works across Torbay and South Devon to get people back into work. The group paid for him to get a new suit, shirt and tie and, after putting him on an employability course, secured his second interview in five years. Robin Boness (centre) applied for 547 vacancies during his unemployment spell. He is pictured with colleagues  Lee WIlliams and John Hargraves,both from Frontline Total Security . Staff from Pluss even drove Mr Boness to his interview - which later became a solid job offer. He said: 'They were a tremendous help - I did an employability course and they helped me get my Security Industry Authority badge. 'They helped fund my suit, shirt and tie for interview. They also drove me to interview and I was terrified. 'I couldn't believe it when I actually got the job. Pluss then helped me with a hire car until I had a couple of months' wages and could buy my own car. 'I could never have done this for myself. I think I was getting to the point of giving up and withdrawnig completely from society. Pluss made me see everything in a different way.' Mr Boness now works doing security and client and customer safety. The job could be based anywhere across the south west. He said: 'At the moment I am guarding an empty Grade II listed building. I patrol the building, secure windows and doors, check security of the building and make sure no-one can get in. 'Every hour we do a patrol. 'Someone actually gave me a chance and so I am doing my best to repay them by putting in 120 per cent effort. I am getting a wage.' Lee Williams, operations director at Frontline Total Security, said 'He's extremely smart, well mannered and has a good sense of humour. 'He is calm, respectful and has good judgement, he always turns up on time and is good with customers. Robin knows how to speak to people with respect. 'We are very busy so ultimately if we have people, like Robin, who really want to work that makes such a difference to us as a business.'","Robin Boness, from Torquay, had 30 years' experience as an electrician .

"Chancellor George Osborne, pictured today at the Tory party conference, said he will spend more than £800million to enable local authorities to avoid painful increases . Council tax is to be frozen again next year as the Government tries to show it understands the mounting pressures on family budgets, it was revealed today. Chancellor George Osborne said he will spend more than £800million to enable local authorities to avoid painful increases. The freeze will save the average family £72 next year, on top of another £72 saved from a similar move this year, and means council tax will not rise before April 2013 at the earliest. 'My message is I am doing everything, this Government is doing everything to help you, your family, to help the economy, to get people into work, to keep people in work,' he told ITV1's Daybreak. 'That is what we are working flat-out on. We reject the idea that governments can't do anything in the face of these global storms. 'My job is to take the difficult decisions that help families to put food on the table and keep the people in work who bring home the bread. That's my job. 'We are working flat-out, using every tool available to us. We are not standing on the sidelines.' No U-turn: David Cameron said he understood the shocks family finances were experiencing but said there 'was something better at the end of this' He . said the heart of the Government's economic policies remained the . overriding need to get the state deficit down, in order to maintain the . confidence of the markets and keep interest rates low. Mr Osborne will say: ‘I want to help families and pensioners with the cost of living.’ The . spending commitment, to be funded from ‘underspends’ in Whitehall, . comes as a surprise after repeated Government claims that there is no . room in the public finances for tax cuts. The Institute of Directors has said the top rate of tax should be cut to help growth . The body wants the 50 per cent income tax rate for the highest earners to be scrapped 'to kill the perception that the UK is a high-tax country'. It also wants corporation tax to be slashed from 26 per cent to 15 per cent by 2020 to create more jobs. Employment regulation needs to be shaken up to stop the 'gradual erosion of the UK's flexible labour market' to encourage businesses to take on more staff, it argues. They also want state spending to be cut from 47.1 per cent of GDP 35 per cent by 2020. IoD director-general Simon Walker said: 'No aspect of economic policy is more important than returning Britain to a growth trajectory. 'Without the belief that UK economic growth is expanding, confidence will wane, international investment will dwindle and British consumers and taxpayers will be left picking up the crumbs at the tables of faster-growing competitors. He also called for spending on infrastructure projects to be protected and for the Bank of England to announce a return to quantitative easing for the first time in nearly two years on Thursday by injecting a further £50 billion into the economy. The . Chancellor is also thought to be planning to use more unspent money . from Government departments to inject into capital projects to try to . kickstart the flatlining economy. Both . Mr Osborne and the Prime Minister will insist the cash can be found . without deviating an inch from the Government’s tight deficit reduction . plans. As the Conservative . party conference started in Manchester yesterday, David Cameron said . there were ‘elements of truth’ to the idea that Britain was in the . economic equivalent of a war. He said the debt crisis engulfing the eurozone was a threat not just to the British economy but that of the entire world. The Prime Minister ruled out any . U-turn on spending cuts, but went out of his way to suggest that he . understood the ‘shocks’ to family finances. ‘We have got to explain to . people there is something better at the end of this,’ he declared. ‘I . think one of the biggest shocks for people has been the electricity . increases, the gas increases. Put that on top of what’s happening to the . family shop, what’s happened at the petrol pumps . . . these things . combined are making life difficult. ‘We are doing the right thing, but we’ve got to explain all the time why it’s necessary, how we’re going to help people.’ Council tax in England doubled under Labour, with the average bill for a Band D home rising to £1,439 a year. Huge rises: The council tax rate for a Band D home doubled under Labour to £1,439 a year . In other developments at the Conservative conference: . The Government has been under pressure from Tory MPs to complement austerity measures with a coherent strategy for growth and measures to put cash in the pockets of hardworking families. Up to two million council houses could be sold to their tenants under plans to revive Margaret Thatcher’s ‘Right to Buy’ scheme. Ministers are to offer heavy discounts – worth up to 50 per cent – to persuade people to buy their homes. The proceeds will then be ploughed back directly into building new houses in the area. David Cameron suggested yesterday that the new drive could result in another 100,000 homes for rent being built, creating 200,000 jobs. Right To Buy was one of the most popular policies of the Thatcher era. Discounts of up to 60 per cent were offered, encouraging some two million tenants to buy their council homes between 1980 and 1998. Although the scheme continued under Labour, the level of discount was capped by John Prescott at a maximum of £38,000. Last year just 3,690 homes were sold under the scheme. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said local authorities would be required to replace every council house sold on a ‘one-for-one basis’. And he said limits would be set to ensure that council tenants in fashionable areas were not turned into overnight ‘millionaires’. Mr Cameron also announced that thousands of acres of  publicly-owned land are to be released by the Government  for house building, which has fallen to the lowest level since the 1920s. The Prime Minister insisted: ‘We are firing up the engines of the British economy. ‘There is a step change taking place right now. This Government is not just sitting back.’ Aides said the Chancellor will use his address to the conference today to accept that the cost of living is ‘the big issue’ for most families. But he will insist that the deficit reduction plan is more important than ever, given the debt crisis overwhelming countries such as Greece. A resolution to the turmoil in the eurozone, he will say, would be the biggest single boost to confidence in Britain. The Chancellor will insist that he has a longer term plan for growth, highlighting his plan to cut corporation tax to the lowest level in the G20 group of leading nations. He will also confirm that the qualifying period for unfair dismissal claims is to rise from one to two years, as the Daily Mail revealed last week. Last night Mr Osborne announced plans to set up new enterprise zones to deal with the fallout from the decision by defence giant BAE Systems to slash 3,000 jobs in the north of England. The zones will encourage firms to expand or relocate to the BAE sites at Warton and Samlesbury, in Lancashire, and Brough, in East Yorkshire. Angela Eagle, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘David Cameron is so out of touch with what’s happening to jobs and the cost of living that he seems more interested in protecting a plan that isn’t working than protecting our economy. ‘With unemployment rising and the recovery choked off last autumn the Prime Minister is stuck with the old lines and has nothing new to say.’ Warning: Lord Ashcroft says David Cameron must convince voters over the budget deficit if he is to win an outright majority in the 2015 General Election . David Cameron must do more than convince voters he is right about cutting Britain’s towering budget deficit if he is to win an outright majority at the next election, Lord Ashcroft warns today. The former deputy party chairman and polling guru says it is clear that Conservative support has held up since Mr Cameron entered Downing Street, despite economic turmoil and unpopular spending cuts. Many voters have decided that Ed Miliband is ‘weird’, Lord Ashcroft’s latest research shows, and the Prime Minister remains far and away the best-rated of the three main party leaders. The proportion of 2010 Tory voters staying with the party who give Mr Cameron very high marks for his performance has actually increased over the year, the peer says in an article for the Daily Mail. But while Conservative voters back the Coalition’s focus on the deficit and are relatively ‘sanguine’ about cuts, those whom the party needs to win over to gain an outright victory in 2015 are more concerned about the impact on public services. Lord Ashcroft argues that Mr Cameron must demonstrate that deficit reduction is part of a broader economic strategy for restoring growth. Floating voters see the deficit as part of a range of issues to be dealt with, including tackling crime and improving schools and hospitals.Lord Ashcroft’s poll of 8,000 adults showed people feel ‘uncertain’ and ‘anxious’ about the economy, and were not confident Britain would be in a better state even in three or four years’ time. The rising cost of living, he said, was a recurring theme. The NHS is widely thought to be suffering because of budget cuts, though in fact the Coalition has protected its budget. Voters also said they hoped for a tougher approach to immigration from a Conservative-led government, but were not clear that it was being delivered.","David Cameron says there will be no U-turn on cuts .

"Greece was threatened with expulsion from the European Union for at least a decade if it dared to press ahead with a referendum on the single currency rescue deal, it emerged last night. On a day of drama worthy of the Greek stage, prime minister George Papandreou hovered between defying Brussels, resigning and forming a new government of national unity. A vote of confidence, expected at around 10pm tonight in the Greek parliament, could yet see the present government collapse. Threat: Angela Merkel, pictured with Barack Obama, has warned Greece not to reject the bailout package it was offered last week . Last night it was still not entirely clear what the Greek government has decided to do – though it is certain that Mr Papandreou has been cowed into calling off his proposed referendum. Extraordinary details then emerged of how German Chancellor Angela Merkel threatened the Greeks not only with an end to bailout cash and ejection from the single currency, but also expulsion from the EU for at least ten years. But hopes in Brussels that a new coalition government led by someone other than Mr Papandreou could be installed were scuppered when the opposition insisted it would not join such an administration and instead demanded elections within six weeks. Mr Papandreou had horrified other EU leaders days ago by announcing that he would seek popular support for an agreement that would see half of Greece’s towering debts written off in return for a decade of deeply unpopular austerity measures. Pension payments are being slashed by 20 per cent, VAT has been hugely increased and a new property tax is being introduced. But economists argue the debt write-down is not dramatic enough to offer Greece any hope of emerging with a stronger economy. Defiant: Greece's prime minister George Papandreou speaking in parliament yesterday, when he insisted he was the right man for the job . Last night the Greek prime minister suggested he would be ready to drop a referendum on the bailout deal, as long as he could secure opposition support in Parliament. ‘If we had a consensus we wouldn’t have to go to a referendum,’ he said. ‘If the opposition is willing to negotiate then we are ready to ratify this deal and implement it.’ However, Mr Papandreou said the government was not afraid of asking the Greek people for their opinion in a referendum if necessary. Germany and France, fearing the single currency could collapse if the Greeks voted ‘no’, had already threatened to cut off existing cash lifelines for Athens until the vote was held. They also insisted any referendum must be on the country’s future membership of the EU and eurozone, rather than a more narrow question relating to deeply unpopular austerity measures, to maximise the chances of a ‘yes’ vote. And as the day went on, their threats escalated – culminating in the suggestion that Greece would not only have to ditch the euro and reinstate the drachma unless it supported the rescue deal, but also leave the EU. On his way out: Mr Papandreou leaving the G20 summit on Wednesday . Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson said Greece was ‘clearly going to fall out of the eurozone’. But former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling insisted the eurozone bailout deal had unravelled and said throwing Greece out of the single currency is ‘not going to solve the problem’. He said: ‘The real problem is that the Greek fix was never going to work. Even if it had worked, it was still going to be left with a debt of 120 per cent of its GDP and that doesn’t work. ‘The deal that they were being offered should never have been on the table.’ In a lengthy speech to the Greek parliament, Mr Papandreou declared: ‘For the last two years we have waged a battle of titanic proportions. Our first duty being to fend off bankruptcy, to prevent the country collapsing. We were a guinea pig in a monetary union. ‘We are bearing a cross and, on top of that, they are throwing stones at us.’ He attacked Mrs Merkel and French president Nicolas Sarkozy for publicly humiliating Greece by ‘telling us how to hold our referendum, defining the rules’.","Greek PM's government could collapse as he faces confidence vote at 10pm tonight .

"Matthew Swale and Melanie Cunningham were terrified when they were woken up early one morning to see a hoodie-wearing gang armed with crowbars hammering on their front door and shouting obscenities. The flat-mates became even more distraught when the men sprayed chemicals through their letterbox in a bid to subdue Matthew's anxious Labrador, Jake. But that fear has now been replaced by anger after it was revealed that last month's 7am raid was carried out by bailiffs sent to sort out an unpaid gas bill - which had been left by a former tenant. Wrong target: Matthew Swale and his Labrador, Jake. He was eventually able to convince bailiffs they had targeted the wrong man by producing identification . And now Matthew and Melanie are . demanding compensation from energy supplier npower after having to pay . hundreds of pounds in vet and repair bills. Market trader Matthew, 28, and . Melanie, 29, moved into the railway cottage in Grimsby at the beginning . of September, and insist that they and their landlady contacted npower to . inform them of the new tenancy. But six weeks later, the company sent . round the bailiffs because the previous tenant had still not paid bills . totalling £980. The bailiffs were instructed to rip out the gas meter . and replace it with a pre-pay one. 'I looked out of the window and saw a . group of men wearing scruffy hoodies and tracksuit bottoms who had . driven up in a pick-up truck,' Matthew told the Sunday Mirror. Railway cottage: Npower insists Mr Swale made no contact to tell them he was one of the new tenants of the Grimsby property, above . 'The man in charge was shouting, ""It will make your life a lot easier if you answer the f***ing door"". 'I thought they looked dangerous. They were kicking my front door and trying to open it with a crowbar. My . flatmate was in tears.' Matthew said he called the police . rather than open the door because the gang - some of whom were sitting . on the bonnet of his car - refused to reveal their identities. After failing to gain access, the . bailiffs shot chemical spray into the eyes of Matthew's labrador before . breaking in through a back door. Matthew was eventually able to . convince them they had targeted the wrong man by producing his driving . licence and his tenancy agreement. He claims his dog needed £350 worth . of veterinary treatment, and he has also had to pay out an additional . £400 to get his doors repaired. 'Jake is the most placid dog you could imagine,' Matthew said. 'When they sprayed him, he just . collapsed on the floor. He was throwing up and his eyes were watering. I . thought he was going to die. 'Since this happened I have telephoned npower dozens of times but nothing has been done.' Last month regulator Ofgem hit npower with a £2million fine for its sloppy customer service. An npower spokesman told MailOnline . that a trained dog handler had used the spray because 'the dog was still . being aggressive and we were unable to gain access' - but insisted the spray was harmless and has no long-term effects. The spokesman acknowledged that a . door lock had been drilled out but that 'both the dog and the door were . inspected prior to leaving by both the police and the agent and were . deemed to be fine'. And the company denied that Matthew had made contact to tell them he was a new tenant. The spokesman said: 'We cannot stress enough the . importance of letting your energy supplier know as soon as you move in . to make sure you're not picking up the previous tenant's bills. 'We will only ever visit a property . under these circumstances when all other options have been exhausted - . and all personnel on site adhere to strict guidelines and we feel they . were fully complied with in this instance. 'We would be more than happy to check any vet bills the owners says he has had to bear.'","'When they sprayed him, he just collapsed on the floor. he was throwing up and his eyes were watering.

"Resignation: Sir Paul Stephenson quit as Metropolitan Police Commissioner this evening . Britain's top police officer accepted a free five-week stay at a top health spa where News of the World hacking suspect Neil Wallis was a PR consultant. Sir Paul Stephenson was today facing a battle to cling onto his job as it was revealed he accepted the £12,000 freebie from Champneys where the ex-executive editor worked. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner was already under pressure after it emerged that he hired Mr Wallis as a PR consultant for the force. Scotland Yard denied that it was the 60-year-old ex-journalist who had arranged the stay for the top officer as he recovered from surgery. Stephen Purdew the managing director laid on the stay at the resort to provide him with the accommodation. But the disclosure will raise further questions about Sir Paul's judgment, days after he faced a dressing down from London Mayor Boris Johnson over the PR contract. Mid-range premier double rooms at the exclusive health resort cost £598 per person in Tring, Hertfordshire. Neil Wallis - known as Wolfman for his no-nonsense approach in the newsroom - was paid £24,000 by the Met Police in 2009 and 2010 for  'provide strategic communication advice and support'. His contract was cancelled less than six months before the launch of the Operation Weeting investigation into phone hacking. The ex-journalist, who was Andy Coulson's deputy editor, was arrested on suspicion of intercepting mobile phones in a dawn swoop on his home in Chiswick, west London on Thursday. He was later released on bail. After leaving the News of the World in 2009, Mr Wallis had created the set up his own PR consultancy Chamy Media. Hacking suspect: Neil Wallis, pictured here leaving Hammersmith police station after being grilled by detectives on Thursday, worked as a PR at Champneys and was a £1,000-per-day Met Police consultant . Neil Wallis worked as deputy to Andy Coulson, pictured, when he was editor of the News of the World . A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said the accommodation had been provided by the Champneys managing director Stephen Purdew who was a personal friend of the Commissioner. He added that Sir Paul, 57, had 'no idea' that Mr Wallis was employed by Champneys when he accepted the hospitality. Sir Paul underwent an operation to remove a pre-cancerous tumour from his femur in an operation before Christmas. In January, Scotland Yard said the growth had caused further damage to the bone, which led to a fracture. As a result, Sir Paul was . readmitted to hospital and underwent a second 'lengthy and complex' operation which prompted a lengthy period of recuperation. Scotland Yard tonight issued a statement saying: 'Following his operations the Commissioner stayed, with his wife, at Champneys Medical from Monday to Friday over a period of five weeks earlier this year where he underwent an extensive programme of hydro and physiotherapy. 'This enabled him to return to work six weeks earlier than anticipated. As with many officers, the Met paid the intensive physiotherapy costs. 'The accommodation and meals were arranged and provided by Stephen Purdew, managing director of Champneys, who is a personal family friend who has no connection with, or links to, his professional life. Sir Paul Stephenson stayed at Champneys in Tring, hertfordshire, where mid-range rooms cost £598 per night for two people . Luxury: Champneys in Tring, Hertfordshire is set in a stately home in 125 acres of parkland and offer an array of health treatments (file pictures) Andy Coulson's deputy Neil Wallis was . nicknamed 'Wolfman' because he is short, used to have lots of facial . hair and is aggressive. The 60-year-old suspect has been described as a 'no-nonsense, larger-than-life character whose every utterance is peppered with expletives'. He stood down as News of the World's executive editor in 2009 and had been working in PR. He started working for . News International in 1986 for 12 years where he held senior positions . before taking the job of News Editor at The Sun. In . 1998 he became editor of the People, a job he held for five years . before returning to become deputy editor of the News of the World in . 2003 working under Andy Coulson. Wallis led a redesign of the newspaper in 2002 and . launched a sports supplement to help in a battle against the Daily Star. 'The Commissioner only learnt who the PR consultant for Champneys was following a media enquiry today. 'Although the provision of accommodation was as a result of a family friendship, unconnected with his professional role, in the interests of transparency it was nonetheless recorded in the Commissioner's Gifts and Hospitality Register on his return to work in April. 'This register is published quarterly on the Metropolitan Police service website and the entry for the quarter April to June is due to be published shortly. 'The Commissioner personally paid for all other treatments and extras, including a number of subsequent physiotherapy and cryotherapy appointments at Champneys Medical.' Mr Wallis's solicitor Phil Smith, of Tuckers Solicitors, said: 'There is no connection whatsoever between any stay Sir Paul Stephenson may have had at Champneys and Neil Wallis. 'Neither Neil Wallis nor anyone connected to him had any involvement whatsoever in any visit or stay by Sir Paul Stephenson at Champneys.' Stephen Purdew said he was 'outraged' by suggestions the stay was arranged by Mr Wallis. He said: 'He (Sir Paul) came here to recover from cancer and a broken leg, to say it was a gift or a jolly is outrageous. It is a bloody disgrace. 'He was here for about a month. He was seriously ill so he stayed with me and this has backfired terribly.' He said the fact Mr Wallis was working as a consultant for Champneys at the same time was coincidental. 'Neil Wallis, by coincidence, did some work for us. I have known Sir Paul Stephenson for twenty-odd years and this is totally unrelated. 'Neil Wallis does not work for us any more. It was a company he was working for, Outside Organisation, that did and this is a diversion. I didn't even know Neil Wallis had done any work for us. 'I don't need my name tarnished in this way, this is wrong.' A spokesperson for the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'The Metropolitan Police have made assurances that accommodation provided for the Commissioner at Champneys was recorded in the latest update of his Gifts and Hospitality Register, which is due to be published shortly. 'The Mayor has already written to Lord Justice Leveson to request he consider the contract between Chamy Media and the Metropolitan Police as part of his inquiry. 'He expects that the Judge will look to consider this arrangement as well.'","Neil Wallis was PR consultant for Champneys when Sir Paul took free stay .

"Britain has been stripped of its power to return asylum seekers to Greece - after a ruling by European judges. The decision by the Luxembourg court . risks plunging the entire European asylum system into chaos - and . leaving border controls in this country hamstrung. An immigration watchdog warned the ruling would open a ‘perfect back door into Britain’. Ruling: Britain and Ireland were today told they cannot send asylum seekers back to Greece because of the country¿s inadequate asylum arrangements . Under EU rules British officials can return asylum seekers to the first European country they set foot in. But today the European Court of . Justice said no-one should be returned to a country if it did not uphold . their ‘fundamental rights’. This means Britain cannot send asylum seekers back to Greece because its asylum system is such a mess. The ruling also opens the door for claims against other countries on the grounds their asylum systems are not up to scratch. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migrationwatch said: ‘This makes Greece the perfect back door into Britain. ‘In future, asylum seekers who are . not, in fact, genuine will claim that they have come through Greece, . whether or not they have. ‘It also undermines the agreement . which provides for asylum seekers to be sent back to the first EU . country in which they arrived.’ Around 90 per cent of illegal . immigrants who arrive in Europe do so through Greece, placing enormous . strain on the country’s immigration system. The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg (pictured) ruled that no EU government can take it for granted that another member state¿s asylum procedures complied with fundamental rights . The court ruled on a case brought by . an Afghan national known as ‘NS’ who was arrested in Greece in 2008 then . expelled to Turkey. He escaped and travelled to the UK where he applied . for asylum. Britain ordered his return to Greece but he launched a legal challenge. The court’s ruling said no EU . government could take it for granted that another member state’s asylum . procedures complied with fundamental rights. The judges said: ‘An asylum seeker may . not be transferred to a member state where he risks being subjected to . inhuman treatment.’ As a result member states cannot send . an asylum seeker back if they have ‘substantial grounds for believing . that the asylum seeker would face a real risk of being subjected to . inhuman or degrading treatment.’ Between 2006 and 2010, the UK removed . 6,034 people to other member states under the asylum rules - known as . the Dublin Regulations. Conservative MEP Timothy Kirkhope said it was time to ‘get tough’ with Greece. ‘Of course, it is not right that genuine asylum-seekers are returned to a country where they face further persecution’ he said. ‘However, there is also now a clear . incentive for people with other motives to enter the EU via Greece, safe . in the knowledge that other countries are powerless to return them.’ But Donna Covey, chief executive of the Refugee Council welcomed the ruling. She said: ‘The responsibility to . receive and determine claims of people seeking safety in Europe should . be shared across the continent, particularly in Western European . countries who see far fewer asylum seekers annually. ‘The focus for the member states must . now be on improving asylum systems across Europe to ensure people are . treated humanely while seeking safety in any country.’ Immigration minister Damian Green said: ‘Asylum claims should be dealt with in the first country of arrival. ‘We expect every member state to . ensure that the Dublin Regulation can operate effectively across the EU, . and we are working with Greece to improve their asylum processes.’","European Court of Justice rules no EU country can assume it can return asylum seekers to another member state .

"Backing: The family of an officer killed in the hunt have called for Sgt Sean Murphy to be reinstated . The family of a police officer slain during the Boston bombing have leapt to the defence of a colleague who faces the sack for releasing pictures of the moment suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured. Tactical photographer Sgt Sean Murphy was so enraged by a cover of music magazine Rolling Stone depicting the suspect as a rock star that he handed images he had taken on the night Tsarnaev was apprehended to Boston Magazine. He argued Rolling Stone had glamorised terrorism by running the picture Tsarnaev, who turned 20 yesterday, had taken of himself looking like a hippy. Murphy argued his images showed the . true face of terrorism, but he was reprimanded for releasing them . without authorisation and suspended. He is due to attend a hearing with . his bosses later this week. He . has now received the backing of the dead MIT police officer Sean . Collier's family, who have slammed Rolling Stone for for 'portraying the . face of evil', and have called for the Massachusetts State Police . officer to be reinstated. A . statement, printed by Boston Magazine, read: 'We, the family of slain . MIT police officer, Sean Collier, were fortunate to get to know Sgt Sean . Murphy in the days following Sean’s death. 'Sgt. Murphy was a member of the . dedicated contingent of Massachusetts State Police Officers who are . responsible for helping families plan and organise the funerals of . police officers killed in the line of duty. 'With . the help of Sgt Murphy, his fellow state police, and the officers of . the MIT Police Department, our family was able to get through those dark . days. Suspect: The moment Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured covered in blood and with the dot of a sniper's rifle laser on his forehead. Right, the Rolling Stone magazine cover that caused the furore . Hero: Police believe the Boston bombing suspects shot Sean Collier five times before attempting to steal his gun . Angry: Sgt Sean Murphy said he was so incensed by what he saw as the glamorisation of Tsarnaev by Rolling Stone magazine, that he released these photos . 'We believe that Sgt Murphy’s motives were selfless when he released the photos, taken the night after our son and brother was murdered and the terrorist was apprehended. 'In our opinion, he has been sufficiently punished. Sgt Murphy wanted to right what he and many in Boston and around the country saw as a wrong, and to counter the aggrandisement of terrorism by Rolling Stone magazine. Support: Murphy's actions have received a lot of support on social media platforms, with more than 66,000 people having 'liked' a 'Save Sgt. Sean Murphy' Facebook page . 'Terrorists are not rock stars and they should not be rewarded with fame and magazine covers. 'The real heroes are the law enforcement officers, first responders, and victims of this terror. It is they who should be honoured. 'Images are very powerful and they have the ability to shape our thoughts and actions. 'The images from the night that we lost Sean are now burned in our memories. No amount of fluffing and buffing will make them softer. 'We are sure that all the other marathon victims have similar images. It’s too bad Rolling Stone only wanted to portray the face of evil. 'The ongoing support of the family of police officers who we have come to know these past three terrible months, including Sgt Murphy, is something we will never be able to repay.' Support: A Facebook page set up to back Sgt Murphy has now received 21,392 likes . The images, which Murphy took, show the alleged bomber bruised and bloodied with his hands in the air as he emerges from his final hiding place. It is thought Tsarnaev had shot Collier five times before attempting to steal his gun. 'Sgt . Murphy was a member of the dedicated contingent of Massachusetts State .

At . the time, Murphy said: 'I hope that the people who see these images . will know that this was real. It was as real as it gets,' wrote Murphy . in a posting on the magazine’s website. 'This may have played out as a television show, but this was not a television show.' Murphy . has been labeled a 'hero' for his actions by many with popular option - . especially in Boston - that he did the right thing to counteract the cover of the current issue of Rolling Stone. Murphy's . actions have received a lot of support on social media platforms, more . than 10,000 people have 'liked' a 'Save Sgt. Sean Murphy' Facebook page and supporters have also taken to Twitter to call him a hero. Federal prosecutors however were quick to voice their displeasure at Murphy’s actions. 'The release of these photos was completely unacceptable,' said a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen M Ortiz, whose prosecutors . are preparing a case against Tsarnaev on 30 federal charges, 17 of them . capital offenses. 'We . have spoken with the Massachusetts State Police, who have assured us . that the release of the photos was unauthorized and that they are taking . action internally in response.' It . is unclear whether the photos could damage the federal case against the . man accused of setting off pressure cooker bombs that killed three . people and injured more than 260. Murphy accompanied the Swat teams as . they descended on a boat in the backyard of a Watertown home, where . Tsarnaev sought refuge following one of the biggest manhunts in U.S. history. Murphy, who has worked in law enforcement for 25 years, has been ordered by his bosses to refrain from speaking to the media.

"Los Angeles police expected to receive hundreds if not thousands of handguns, rifles and shotguns when they held their gun buyback on Wednesday. But even hardened officers were surprised two rocket launchers were handed in by the city's residents. The hefty weapons were among nearly 2,000 guns given up to police in exchange for $100 and $200 grocery store gift cards. Rocket launcher: Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck, left, shows off one of two rocket launchers turned in during the Los Angeles, California, gun buyback program, with Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa . According to Gawker, the LAPD received 901 handguns, 698 rifles and 363 shotguns in the program, as well as the two rocket launchers. However, Gawker quoted a police source as saying that the guns were not that unusual, and that 'we've had them in the past.' According to police, such weapons are generally antiques picked up by collectors or passed down by family members. The Los Angeles buyback program was aimed . at getting weapons off the streets in the wake of the devastating . shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, on . December 14. Guns: Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, left, and Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck, second from left, look over the weapons handed in . Buyback: The weapons were among nearly 2,000 guns given up to the authorities in exchange for $100 and $200 grocery store gift cards . Lines of cars and people stretched around the block in the first hours of the exchange on Wednesday morning to take advantage of the guns-for-groceries deal. Police officers filled bins with a variety of rifles and handguns outside the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and the Van Nuys Masonic Temple. Police reported netting nearly 500 . fire arms and 31 assault weapons between both LA locations in the first . few hours of the buyback. 'No . ID checks, we're not taking down license plates, people drive up, they . have a gun in their trunk, we have one of our gun experts take that gun . out, make sure it's safe, they walk over, get a gift card, and away they . go,' Police Cmdr Andrew Smith told CBS Los Angeles on Wednesday. Success: Hand guns, pictured, were left by their owners in a trash bin at the LA gun buyback on Wednesday . Assault weapons: Police collected a range of weapons including assault rifles, hand guns and shot guns . 'It's very quick and painless.' Handguns, rifles and shotguns were swapped for $100 Ralphs grocery store gift cards while assault weapons earned a $200 card. Officials were mindful of both the . Newtown massacre, in which Adam Lanza, 20, shot dead his mother then . stormed an elementary school, killing 20 students and six staff in a . barrage of bullets. They were also thinking of a gunman's ambush that killed two firefighters in Webster, N.Y. on Christmas Eve. 'All of us are still mourning the . tragedy at Newtown, Connecticut,' said Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Well received: A police officer walks away with three rifles received by the program that had already pulled in hundreds of firearms in the first hours . Tragic inspiration: Police officers load bins containing guns onto a truck during the gun buyback whose date was moved up after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School earlier this month . Positive effect: Since the program's creation in 2009, there has been a 39 per cent drop in gang crimes and 22 per cent drop in calls reporting shots being fired . 'So . many young innocent children were mass-murdered in the way that they . were, and now the assassination of two firefighters ... just breaks the . heart of so many of us, particularly in this holiday season.' The program was originally scheduled for May but in the wake of the December 14th shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary, Mr Villaraigosa decided to do it now. The last buyback program netted about 1,700 guns. Since the program's creation in 2009, there has been a 39 per cent drop in gang crimes and 22 per cent drop in calls reporting shots being fired according to police. Los Angeles resident Commorah Fisher said she participated in the program to ensure her weapons didn't get into the wrong hands. Process: When drivers pulled up the unloaded weapons would be removed from their trunks by gun inspectors before they were taken away and a gift card presented in exchange . Worth: A police officer inspects one of the guns where automatic weapons would receive a $200 grocery store gift card and shotguns, handguns and rifles $100 gift cards . 'To . turn in some ammunition, and guns that may be stolen from our house and . you know someone may do something really bad with them,' she told CBS of her reasoning. 'That's why . I'm turning them in.' In 2004, a report by the National Academy of Sciences, however, argued that such exchanges were ineffective in the fight against gun violence. 'The theory underlying gun buyback programs is badly flawed and the empirical evidence demonstrates the ineffectiveness of these programs,' the report reads. Authors argued that the majority of guns received are those least likely to be used in criminal activities. They were generally guns that were old, malfunctioning, or those owned by people who don't see the value in owning a weapon.","Weapons were among 1,962 guns given up to police in exchange for $100 and .

"An engineer working 240 feet above ground on a cell phone tower in Kentucky was decapitated after a cable broke with emergency services unable to bring down his body for five hours. Police said that the man, who was in his 20s, was one of two workers on the Verizon tower in Harrison County near Cynthiana when a heavy antenna fell and a cable struck him yesterday. It is thought the men were taking down an old boom when the incident occurred, decapitating the worker and ripping off his right arm. Emergency services at the Verizon Tower in Kentucky where a worker was decapitated after being struck by falling cable . Local sheriff Bruce Hampton said that the man was suspended hanging from the tower in his safety harness as the emergency services struggled to bring down his body. Crews from the Northern Kentucky Technical Rescue finally removed the body five hours after the incident took place. He also confirmed that another two workers were on the ground when the incident happened and that nobody else was injured. He told WKYT: 'Not too many people are used to seeing that. And it's a guy that you've been working next to. And it could have been him. Nobody else was injured. And they are just very much beside themselves. Harrison County Sheriff Bruce Hampton said the man was in his 20s and was with another worker when the incident happened . ‘It got within two feet of where it was going and something broke and then the 1,800lb boom fell,’ said Sheriff Hampton. It has been reported that the workers, who were all in their 20s were working for an independent company contracted out by Verizon. The victim has not yet been identified and his body has been sent to Frankfort for an autopsy. Police didn't release the name of the company he worked for or any other information. In a statement Verizon Wireless said: 'Our thoughts are with the family and colleagues of those impacted by today's incident near Cynthiana, Kentucky. 'We are working closely with our vendor and first responders on the scene as we continue to gather additional information.'","Engineer was working 240 feet above ground on Verizon tower in Kentucky .

"A storm system that buried parts of Wyoming and South Dakota in heavy, wet snow on Friday also brought powerful thunderstorms packing tornadoes to the Great Plains. A storm dumped at least 33 inches of snow in a part of South Dakota's scenic Black Hills, National Weather Service meteorologist Eric Helgeson said Friday afternoon. Later in the day, thunderstorms rolled across the Plains, and witnesses reported seeing tornadoes in Nebraska, Iowa and South Dakota. There were no reports of deaths from any of the tornadoes. Earlier in the day, snow was blamed for the deaths of three people who were killed in a traffic accident on snow-slicked U.S. 20 in northeast Nebraska. Scroll down for video .

Some of the greatest damage from tornadoes seemed to be in Wayne, Neb., a town of 9,600 where witnesses said as many as 12 homes were destroyed. Mayor Ken Chamberlain said all of the residents in town were accounted for, but the storm caused millions of dollars in damage to an area that includes businesses and the city's softball complex. At least 15 people were hurt in Wayne, but Chamberlain said none of the injuries was considered life-threatening, Chamberlain said. Seven of the injuries stemmed from two separate automobile accidents.

Meteorologists with the National Weather Service said they were still trying to figure out exactly how many twisters touched down Friday evening from storms that also brought large hail and heavy rain. The snow in South Dakota prompted officials in Deadwood to postpone their annual Octoberfest, including Friday night's dancing-and-singing pub crawl and Saturday's Wiener Dog Races and Beer Barrel Games. Julie Lee said she and fellow members of her White Rose Band were accustomed to snow, just ""not for the fourth of October.""

Officials were warning drivers to stay off the roads in the Black Hills and in eastern Wyoming, where reports of 5 to 10 inches of snow were common. Forecasters urged travelers to carry survival kits and to stay in their vehicles if stranded. 'I've lived in Wyoming my whole life and I've never seen it like this this early,' Patricia Whitman, shift manager at the Flying J truck stop in Gillette, said in a telephone interview. She said her truck stop's parking lot was full of travelers waiting out the storm. 'I know several of the businesses nearby are completely closed because they can't even get workers into work — it's pretty nasty,' she said.

Shaking the snow off: Betty Adams knocks off a dusting of snow on the trees in her front yard in Casper, Wyoming . The snow also snapped tree limbs that knocked out power lines in parts of the state, causing thousands of people to lose power. By Friday night, South Dakota officials had closed I-90 from the Wyoming border to Murdo. And no travel was advised in Rapid City, where first responders were overwhelmed with calls for stuck vehicles and downed trees and power lines making some roads impassable. Police spokeswoman Tarah Heupel said snow and ice was accumulating on traffic signals, making the lights difficult to see. 'I couldn't say when the last time we've had one like this. It's been quite a while,' Trimarchi said. Fall wonderland: The accumulation in Colorado was more beautiful than destructive. Above, snow piles on Aspen trees in Frisco, Colorado .

Though much of the Midwest and Southeast may get soaked, it won't be as devastating as past combination storms, such as Superstorm Sandy, said William Bunting, operations chief at the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Okla. Sandy resulted from the merging of cold fronts and a tropical storm. The Midwest, especially Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa, are at most risk for large thunderstorms, tornadoes and hail, 'perhaps baseball-sized hail,'x Bunting said. On Thursday night, a tornado that touched down damaged homes and businesses in several communities, knocked out power and toppled trees. No injuries were reported. The storm system also blanketed Colorado's northern mountains with snow.","Storms across the Great Plains yesterday caused snow, thunderstorms and tornadoes to touch down across the region .

"A Texas man who went on the run in 2007 after being sentenced to 23 years in prison for murdering his girlfriend, has been caught in India. Amit Livingston was found guilty of killing Hermila Hernandez in 2005, but when a judge allowed him time to get his affairs in order before starting his sentence, the killer fled. Livingston, who is now 46, was caught in the Indian city of Hyderabad on Tuesday, and is being held while authorities wait to extradite him. Caught: Amit Livingston, who went on the run after being found guilty of murder in Texas in 2007, has been arrested in India . Victim: Hermila Hernandez was shot in the back of the head in 2005 after she told Livingston she wanted to end their relationship . It is not clear what led authorities to Livingston, who has evaded capture for seven years. He had been found guilty of shooting Ms Hernandez in the back of the head in September 2005, when she told him she wanted to end their relationship, the Cameron County district attorney's office said. After shooting the 31-year-old, who had three children, Livingston dumped her body on a beach at South Padre Island. He disappeared after the judge, Abel Limas, took the . unusual step of allowing Livingston time to get his affairs in order before . reporting to prison. Limas, and the district attorney at the time, . Armando Villalobos, were both later convicted in a bribery conspiracy. Manhunt: Amit Livingston was sentenced to 23 years in prison for murder but fled the U.S. Attacked: The body of mother-of-three Hermila Hernandez was dumped on a beach after the shooting . 'The mishandling of the Livingston case . and flight from justice were the cornerstone and the centerpiece of the . corruption scandal suffered by Cameron County,' District Attorney Luis . Saenz said in a statement. 'With the convictions that followed in . federal court, the citizens of Cameron County were ready to turn the . page and move forward, but something was still missing: the capture of . Amit Livingston.' The scheme that allowed Livingston to escape featured prominently in the federal corruption trial of Villalobos. Villalobos had arranged to have a friend and former law partner represent the interests of Ms Hernandez's three children in a related lawsuit. Closure: Hermila Garcia, pictured holding a photo of her daughter, says the family feel robbed of justice . By agreeing to convict and sentence Livingston on the same day, Limas freed up the $500,000 bond that had been posted for his release before trial. An agreement was reached to use that bond money to settle the lawsuit. The lawyer representing the children took $200,000 of it in fees, passing $80,000 to Villalobos and $10,000 to Limas. At Villalobos' sentencing in February, Hermila Garcia, the victim's mother, told the judge: '[Villalobos] robbed us of justice to sell the murderer his freedom.' Villalobos was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Limas, who pleaded guilty to racketeering, received six years in prison.","Amit Livingston fled after judge gave him time to get affairs in order after convicting him of murder .

"Congress approved a $225 million package to replenish Israel's missile defenses with its last order of business before a five-week recess, as the Jewish state's cease-fire with Hamas unraveled and Israeli forces pushed deep into Gaza in search of a missing army officer. The House's 395-8 vote in favor late Friday followed Senate adoption of the legislation by voice vote earlier in the day. The money is directed toward restocking Israel's Iron Dome, which has been credited with shooting down dozens of incoming rockets fired by Palestinian militants over 3½ weeks of war. Scroll down for video . Congress approved a $225 million package to replenish Israel's missile defenses with its last order of business before a five-week recess . The bill now goes to President Barack Obama for his signature. At a White House news conference earlier Friday, the president reiterated his support for Israel's right to self-defense while urging greater protection for Palestinian civilians. Obama called for the immediate release of the soldier believed to be captured by Hamas and said it would be hard to put together another cease-fire after a 72-hour humanitarian truce collapsed almost immediately after going into effect Friday morning. He also cited Iron Dome as a concrete way the U.S. is helping 'make sure that Israel is able to protect its citizens.' The defense system has emerged as a game-changer in the current round of violence with Israeli officials citing a success rate as high as 90 per cent. Iron Dome uses radar, advanced tracking technology and anti-missile batteries to follow the trajectory of an incoming rocket or mortar and determine if it is headed for a major population center. If an urban area is threatened, interceptors are fired to detonate in the air in close proximity to the missile. Projectiles not posing a threat are allowed to fall in empty fields. The Israeli military said it was searching for the missing soldier and sent automated calls or text messages to residents to stay indoors . The system targets short-range rockets with a range between 2 miles and 45 miles; interceptors cost as much $100,000 apiece. Created by Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, Iron Dome has enjoyed strong U.S. technological and financial support. Throughout its history, the U.S. has provided more than $700 million to help Israel cover costs for batteries, interceptors, production costs and maintenance, the Congressional Research Service said. The total already appeared set to climb above $1 billion after Senate appropriators doubled the Obama administration's request for Iron Dome funding for fiscal 2015. Now it seems likely to rise even further, with Obama expected to sign any bill swiftly into law. It's unclear, however, how quickly the new supplies might reach the battlefield. And Israel and Hamas may be in for a prolonged fight. At least 140 Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers were killed Friday. Fighting near the Egypt-Gaza frontier continued into the night, with residents reporting airstrikes and heavy tank and artillery shelling. The Israeli military said it was . searching for the missing soldier and sent automated calls or text . messages to residents to stay indoors. The . soldier's apparent capture also prompting a shift in messaging by the . Obama administration, which had appeared increasingly irritated with the . mounting Palestinian casualties over the last several days. More than 1,600 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and more than 60 Israelis, mostly soldiers, have been killed in the conflict. Congress approved a $225 million package to replenish Israel's missile defenses with its last order of business before a five-week recess, as the Jewish state's cease-fire with Hamas unraveled and Israeli forces pushed deep into Gaza in search of a missing army officer . Despite almost universal support for Israel in Congress, the Iron Dome money appeared in doubt only a day ago as Senate efforts stalled after an effort by Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma to find cuts elsewhere in the budget to pay for the aid. Earlier, senators attempted to lump the Israel money into a broader spending bill that included border security and wildfire assistance money. That bill failed to get the necessary 60 votes on Thursday, and the House had little interest in it, anyway. Both chambers turned their attention to a separate Israel bill Friday. Voting against the measure in the House were Democrats Keith Ellison of Minnesota, Zoe Lofgren of California, Beto O'Rourke of Texas and Jim Moran of Virginia, and Republicans Justin Amash of Michigan, Walter Jones of North Carolina, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Mark Sanford of South Carolina. Some of Congress' Iron Dome money could go to U.S. defense contractor Raytheon, which can manufacture components of the system after a March 2014 agreement between Israel and the United States. The two companies also are collaborating on a system targeting mid-range rockets that can travel between 45 miles and 200 miles to protect Israel against Hezbollah in Lebanon and President Bashar Assad's government and Sunni extremists in Syria. With an eye on Iran, Israel also is developing a deterrent against longer-range threats. The next generation of the Arrow system is scheduled to deploy in 2016.","Package passes as Jewish state's cease-fire unravels .

"The pregnant Duchess of Cambridge has been forced to pull out of tonight's opening ceremony of the Invictus Games due to her continuing sickness. Kate, 32, who is expecting her second child by husband, Prince William, had been desperate to support her brother-in-law, Prince Harry. But doctors caring for her at Kensington Palace told aides this morning that she would not be well enough to join other members of the Royal Family at the Olympic Park in London tonight. Scroll down for video . Suffering: The pregnant Duchess of Cambridge has been forced to pull out of tonight's opening ceremony of the Invictus Games due to her continuing sickness, despite having been desperate to support Prince Harry . Missing out: Kate's first solo foreign visit to Malta on behalf of the Queen next weekend is also in jeopardy . She has also been forced to cancel plans to attend a solemn Drumhead service at Lee Valley Athletics Centre with the Duke and Prince Harry tomorrow, to remember all those who have died or been injured in conflict, and later, with William, watch Invictus competitors taking part in matches and heats. In a statement, Kensington Palace said: 'The Duchess of Cambridge will not attend the Opening Ceremony of the Invictus Games this evening or the Athletics event tomorrow.' They also made clear that her first solo foreign visit to Malta on behalf of the Queen next weekend was very much in jeopardy. Spectator: Kate, pictured at the Olympic Games in 2012, has also been forced to cancel plans to attend one of the competition's athletics events tomorrow . Fellow soldier: Harry, pictured meeting members of the British team at a reception yesterday, has been heavily involved in the Invictus Games . On their marks: The captains of the UK Armed Forces teams, who have been selected and trained by Help For Heroes, are pictured today as they prepare to take part in the opening ceremony . 'The Duchess's attendance on the forthcoming visit to Malta will be kept under review and a decision taken closer to the time,' they said. Kate is believed to be around seven weeks pregnant with her second baby but has sadly been hit by the same severe vomiting condition that blighted her first. A source told Mail Online: 'If she continues to be as sick as she has been in recent days then all bets are off as regards her royal duties.' She is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, which she experienced during the early stages of her first pregnancy. Advice: David Beckham, who has known William for a number of years, has advised the couple to 'get more sleep' before the birth of their second child . The condition, which affects 3.5 per 1,000 pregnancies, causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine, called ketosis. It is thought her illness began sometime last week and when William visited Oxford University on Monday without his wife to open the institution’s new China Centre, he said the Duchess had experienced a 'tricky few days'. David Beckham today offered his words of advice to William and Kate - get more sleep before their second baby arrives. As the father of four children, the former England footballer is speaking from experience and reacted to news of the royal pregnancy by praising the couple's parenting skills. Speaking during an interview with ITV’s Lorraine show, Beckham gave the couple some words of wisdom: 'Get some sleep because jumping from one child to two is a big step even though I thought jumping from two to three was bigger.' The former England midfielder was interviewed at New York fashion week where he is promoting his new collection for the brand Belstaff. Beckham has known William for a number of years having joined forces with him to promote England’s bid to host the 2018 World Cup, launched wildlife conservation campaigns with the Duke and been a guest at his wedding. The sportsman added: 'But I’m so happy for them both because they’re such great parents and obviously to be great parents and to have the roles that they have, as important as they have, is really incredible and I’m just happy that they’re going to have another little one running around the house.' The Prince of Wales greeted the news that he is to become a grandfather for a second time with joy and said he hoped the baby was a girl. Yesterday, during a visit to the studio of a young entrepreneur who has been helped by his Prince’s Trust  said he would like a granddaughter. As he left the premises in Bermondsey, South London he met Corey Johnson who congratulated him on becoming a grandfather for the second time. The heir to the throne replied: 'I am already. But it’s wonderful to be a grandfather again. I’m looking forward to it - but I hope it will be a girl this time.' Treatment: Kate leaves the King Edward VII Hospital in December 2012, where she was treated for hyperemesis gravidarum during her last pregnancy . Hyperemesis gravidarum is common, affecting around 15 per cent of all pregnancies. However in its extreme form - where a pregnant woman is admitted to hospital or suffers the condition throughout her pregnancy - it is much more rare. It is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers, and often develops around six weeks into the pregnancy, continuing until around 12 weeks. The condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of ‘pregnancy hormone’ HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, which increases after conception. Leila Hanna, Consultant Gynaecologist and Obstetrician at Queen Mary's Hospital in London and BMI The Sloane Hospital, told MailOnline: 'The condition is extremely common in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. 'It is associated with the changes in hormonal levels in the body, where the pregnancy hormones are quite high and it is the effect of those on the expectant mother. 'If anything it is associated with a normal, healthy pregnancy.' The Duke of Cambridge indicated his wife may be over the worst of her morning sickness in a 'few weeks' time' when he appeared in Oxford on Monday, following the announcement of her pregnancy. Hyperemesis gravidarum leads to severe dehydration and puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients. Sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day, with exhausting and hazardous consequences. They cannot eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week. This can trigger a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food. Hospital treatment for these women is essential, as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated. The condition can also affect the baby’s development and there is a risk it will be premature or have a very low birth weight. In severe cases, the sickness can trigger a miscarriage. But it did not seem to be a problem for Prince George – he was born a healthy 8lb 6oz, the heaviest future king in 100 years – and was several days overdue. In less severe cases the condition can be managed with supplementary hydration, medication and nurtrients. Some women take vitamin B6 – which prevents sickness – as soon as they know they are pregnant. Others may take stronger anti-nausea tablets such as cyclizine, which is also used to treat travel sickness and is said to be very effective. Sufferers are advised to take plenty of fluids and try to have small snacks throughout the day as an empty stomach can trigger nausea. If they cannot keep food down they will need anti-sickness medication and to be put on a drip. Miss Hanna said Kate is more susceptible to suffering hyperemesis gravidarum, having endured the acute sickness during her pregnancy with Prince George. She said: 'If you have suffered this condition before, it is more likely you will again.'","Duchess, 32, had been desperate to support Prince Harry at the ceremony .

"A £25million visitor attraction celebrating the life of famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes is set to be built. Ambitious plans for the ‘world-class multimedia experience’ are being put in place in Portsmouth, Hants. It will combine reenactments of plots and Sherlock’s life in Baker Street, London, with holograms of different characters. A Sherlock theme park is being planned for Portsmouth, which will include live reenactments of scenes from the books as well as holograms of the characters . The centre would use resources from the city’s Arthur Conan Doyle collection, the largest of its kind in the world. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle penned the famous detective stories after moving to Portsmouth in 1882. Steve Pitt, of the Portsmouth Cultural Partnership which came up with the idea, said: 'What we are talking about is a world class, Sherlock Holmes experience. 'It would be very interactive and high quality. There are so many tie-ins around the legacy of Sherlock Holmes being ‘born’ in Portsmouth. 'That’s something that when we look at it, has the potential to create a massive amount of jobs. 'There are 6.9 million people who search for Sherlock Homes and Conan Doyle on Google every month. There is a massive market for this.’ Lasting appeal: Experts hope the park will preserve Sherlock. The character has already survived 100 years and many adaptations, such as the 1984 series starring Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwick . Dr Christopher Pittard, a senior lecturer in English Literature at the University of Portsmouth, welcomed the plans. Dr Pittard, who specialises in the tales of Sherlock Holmes, said the modern screen adaptations on the detective have helped maintain an interest in the character which has already lasted over 100 years. Dr Pittard said: 'I’m a huge fan of Conan Doyle’s work and he has been incredibly influential on the development of crime fiction. 'This would be a great idea because this is where he created Sherlock Holmes. It’s a natural place to have it.' The idea is expected to go to a private consultation next month.","Sherlock theme park being planned for Portsmouth .

"Most Britons have ‘lost any real connection with the land’ and many are ‘increasingly suspicious’ about farming, Prince Charles has warned. While people still treasured the countryside, he said, they should not take it for granted or benefits such as landscapes and local food could be lost. In a foreword for Country Life magazine to mark his 66th birthday this week, the prince wrote: ‘Unlike in most parts of the continent of Europe, many people in the UK are now four or more generations removed from anyone who actually worked on the land – and it frequently shows in their attitudes. The Prince of Wales, who says that many Britons have lost any real connection with the land'. He was pictured last night visiting an exhibition at Dulwich Picture Gallery in London . The Prince urged people to value and protect the countryside or risk losing its landscapes and local foods forever . ‘They have only a vague understanding of what farming is or does; and – as outsiders looking in – they are increasingly suspicious of it.’ On a more positive note, however, he maintained that people still treasured the countryside and urged them to value and protect it or risk losing its landscapes, farmers, village pubs and local foods forever. The prince wrote: ‘One of the things that strikes me most forcibly is the extent to which the majority of the population has lost any real connection with the land.' Charles also warned that if people continue to take the countryside for granted the nation risks losing an irreplaceable part of its landscape, community and economy. Charles also warned that if people continue to to take the countryside for granted, it would affect the economy . He added: ‘The rich, natural tapestry that is the countryside we value so highly does not just happen by itself. But that delicately woven tapestry is facing unprecedented challenges. ‘Start pulling out the threads and the rest unravels very rapidly indeed, and is very difficult to put back again - no farmers, no beautiful landscapes with hedgerows and stone walls; no thriving rural communities, no villages - or village pubs; no local markets, no distinctive local foods ... Somehow, we need to find a way to put a value on our countryside, with all its facets.’ And he once again highlighted the importance of farmers, insisting: ‘I simply cannot see a viable future for the countryside that does not have the farmer - and the family farmer is a vital element in this - as food producer, at the front and centre of the picture. The Prince makes the comments in a foreword he wrote for the new edition of Country Life magazine, which marks his 66th birthday . ‘It would not only be a folly to lose agricultural land, it would be equally foolish to use it in ways that are not environmentally sustainable in the long term.’ The prince is one of the few royals to personally put his money where his mouth is. His Prince’s Countryside Fund, which was established in 2010, has provided £4.4 million in grants to those who care for the countryside, helping more than 80,000 people and 140 communities. Mark Hedges, editor of Country Life, said: ‘We are delighted that the Prince agreed to mark his 66th birthday by writing a powerful leader on the importance of preserving the countryside and its way of life. ‘The Prince has a deep understanding and connection with every aspect of people working and living in rural Britain, from highlighting the hardship facing hill farmers who, last year, earned on average £8,000 to the 60,000 new entrants needed in the UK farming sector to secure its future, to the importance of preserving village schools, pubs and shops at the heart of country communities.’ A Defra spokesperson said last night said the department agreed with the future king. ‘Prince Charles is right that we need to value our countryside and protect it for generations to come,’ they said. ‘The rural economy is worth £210 billion and that’s why the government is improving the environment and providing better broadband so we can add to the almost 10,000 new countryside jobs we’ve already created. ‘Our £100 billion food and farming sector is a powerhouse of the economy, employing one in eight people.’","Prince said people should not take the benefits of countryside for granted .

"The Duchess of Cambridge was tonight consulting with doctors over whether to go ahead with her first solo foreign royal trip to Malta this weekend. Kate, 32, who is around eight weeks pregnant with her second child with husband, Prince William, has been suffering from hypermesis gravidarum, a severe vomiting condition. The illness saw Kate hospitalised in the early weeks of her pregnancy with her first baby, Prince George, now one. Scroll down for video . The Duchess of Cambridge (last pictured with Prince William on August 5) has consulted doctors over her impending trip to Malta after suffering severe bouts of morning sickness in the early stages of her pregnancy . The Duchess is due to represent the Queen this weekend on a two-day visit to the Mediterranean island as Malta celebrates the 50th anniversary of its independence from Britain. The trip was seen as being a sign of Kate's growing royal role, not least because the island holds such a special place in the Queen's heart. The monarch spent many happy months there before she acceded to the throne when her husband, Prince Philip was stationed there with the Royal Navy. Royal sources have told the Mail that the Duchess is hanging on to the last possible minute to decide whether she is medically fit to go. The Duchess of Cambridge suffered the same illness throughout her first pregnancy with Prince George and was admitted to the King Edward VII Hospital . The trip to Malta is to be one of the first in which the Duchess of Cambridge acts alone on behalf of the Queen . 'She has been terribly sick again but is desperately keen to go if she can,' said one. A Kensington Palace spokesman said last night:'The Duke and Duchess will make a final decision this evening, in consultation with the Duchess's doctors.'","Duchess of Cambridge is around eight weeks pregnant with second child .

"Airlines and airports are continuing to trial technology such as Google Glass and smartwatches in the hope of cutting check-in times for passengers. Virgin Atlantic  staff are set to use hi-tech Google Glass headsets to scan flyers' passports and will also use mini-printers to print off boarding passes. Passengers  could see check-in times cut as staff use hi-tech Google Glass headsets to scan flyers' passports. Virgin Atlantic will also use mini-printers to print off boarding passes, the airline told the journal Marketing. The airline is set to extend its wearable tech trial, in which Virgin Atlantic staff wore the smartglasses and Sony smartwatches to greet passengers and supply tailored information ahead of their flight. Virgin is stepping up how it checks in passengers with a trial of more modern technology . It is hoped using more modern technology can provide a better customer experience for travellers . The trial, which began back in February at Heathrow Airport, was used for its first class passengers, but will now be expanded to general check-in areas. It has been seen as a bid to enhance the customer experience of flying which has been affected by a huge rise in air-travel numbers in recent years. And the results were favourable with senior management. 'The trial was a huge success with positive feedback from both our staff and customers on the usage of wearable technology,' a Virgin spokeswoman told ITPro . Now it appears the company are preparing for a wider country-wide roll-out. David Bulman, chief information officer, said: 'We are going to start with Google Glass, but we are trialling a number of different glasses. 'We're trialling apps that allow staff to take a picture of your passport, which then works with our systems to find your booking and other information. 'We have done trials with printers that sit on people's belts, so that we can print off boarding passes.' Flying into the future: Edinburgh Airport's welcome team is using Google Glass to assist travellers . Privacy watchdog Big Brother Group said it is 'surprising' that the technology is being used at an airport . Last month Mail Online Travel reported how Edinburgh Airport had become the first to trial Google Glass for its staff. The headsets were used to provide flight information, answer queries or translate foreign languages for travellers. The three-month pilot project offers a glimpse into the future of customer service at airports as management teams take advantage of new forms of technology. The hands-free device displays digital information and allows users to access the internet or apps using voice commands or snap photos with just a wink. Until the end of the year, Edinburgh Airport's welcome team, Blackjack, will be using the headsets to assist passengers with questions about their flights, the airport, the city itself or other topics. There's an app for that: Iberia and Samsung have developed a wearable boarding pass using a smartwatch . Samsung Electronics' corporate vice-president says the device will make travel more convenient and simple . And Spanish airline Iberia has teamed with tech giant Samsung to become one of the first airlines to allow passengers to board planes with the flick of a wrist. The two companies have developed a wearable boarding pass using a new app that can be installed on Samsung Gear 2 and Gear Neo smartwatches – eliminating the need for a paper document. Similar to boarding passes on mobile phones, passengers who are wearing one of the devices simply have to scan the electronic bar code on the app to get through airport checkpoints and onto their flight. American Airlines are continuing to look into how to use modern technology to speed up the booking and boarding process also. The Google Glass trail by Virgin has been declared a success after starting in February . Virgin Atlantic now look to spread the new technology program through more airports . Back in July the airline, alongside Wearable World, held a convention where app developers, designers and technology providers joined forces to showcase possible future developments. 'At American, we're extremely sensitive to our customer's evolving needs, and wearable technology is a quickly-growing market,' Phillip Easter, director Mobile Apps at American Airlines told Wearable World. 'By working with these developers, Wearable World and our partners such as MasterCard in this event, American can help develop new and innovative technologies that will be part of tomorrow's connected travel experience.' Last month easyJet launched a new passport scanning function to its  mobile app last month, making it the first European airline to have such a feature. EasyJet’s app, which has been downloaded around 10 million times to date, now enables customers using an iOS or Android device to scan their passport details using their mobile phone camera as part of the check-in process. Virgin Atlantic is still firming up the details and has yet to decide where the new trial will take place and how long it will run. Virgin Atlantic is also testing wearable tech within its own operations, Mr Bulman said, such as smartwatches for ground staff and facial recognition technology. Virtual reality could be a cheaper, more convenient way to train up cabin crew, for example.","Trial began back in February at Heathrow Airport and declared a success .

"Former NFL star Fred Smoot was arrested and charged with domestic assault after allegedly beating up his girlfriend this weekend. Police were called to Smoot's house on Sunday morning, where his girlfriend claimed the former Washington Redskins cornerback pushed her against the wall in their bathroom when she tried to grab the keys to his truck so she could drive it to work, seriously injuring her. She later stated that she believed he wanted to prevent her from seeing the boxes of condoms and sheets of generic Viagra he had in the vehicle.

According to a report obtain by TMZ, she also claimed that Smoot scratched her on the knuckle and stomach. The girlfriend claims she then ran to a neighbor's to get help, but no one was home. She ultimately hid in a closet until police arrived. Smoot was eventually released on bail after being booked on misdemeanor domestic simple assault, with the NFL saying they would not make a statement. Hurt up: She also began sharing photos she claimed were from previous fights with Smoot . In this instance, Smoot grabbed her arms so hard she alleges he left marks . His girlfriend meanwhile began posting photos of what she claims were the results of past physical altercations, showing her neck reddened and sore, cuts on her hands, arms and neck, and even a bloody mouth. Another photo shows the emergency protective order she took out against Smoot, who has yet to comment on the incident. This is not Smoot's first brush with the law, as the footballer was caught up in a scandal when he played for the Minnesota Vikings back in 2006. Smoot and some fellow players were alleged to have chartered a boat to party with prostitutes in what became known as the Love Boat Scandal. Getting out: She also shared the emergency protective order she filed . Big guy: Smoot (left) was aN NFL cornerback for the Washington Redskins and the Minnesota Vikings . At one point someone claimed he used a double-headed dildo on two of the women in front of the boat's crew.

"Facebook has issued tough new guidelines on research using its system following outrage from users over experiments on the social network. The firm today tightened its research guidelines following uproar over its disclosure this summer that it allowed researchers to manipulate users' feeds to see if their moods could be changed. At issue was study in which Facebook allowed researchers to manipulate the content that appeared in the main section, or 'news feed,' of small fraction of the social network's users. Scroll down for video . The California-based firm carried out the experiment during a week in 2012. During that time, negative posts were deprioritised in the data feeds of 689,003 users, to see if it generated a more positive response. The California-based firm carried out the experiment during a week in 2012. During that time, negative posts were deprioritised in the data feeds of 689,003 users, to see if it generated a more positive response. Posts were determined by the experiment to be positive or negative if they contained at least one positive or negative word. The experiment affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2500. According to Facebook, nobody's posts were 'hidden,' they just didn't show up on some feeds. It found that negative posts elicited a swell of positive responses, but also that a reduction in positive news led to more negative posts. ‘When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred,’ said the researchers. During the weeklong study in January 2012, data-scientists were trying to collect evidence to prove their thesis that people's moods could spread like an 'emotional contagion' depending on what they were reading. 'Although this subject matter was important to research, we were unprepared for the reaction the paper received when it was published and have taken to heart the comments and criticism,' Mike Schroepfer, Facebook's chief technology officer, wrote in a blog post. 'It is clear now that there are things we should have done differently.' In the past three months, Schroepfer said, Facebook has given researchers clearer guidelines on research procedures and has created an internal panel that will review projects. But there will not be an external review process and Facebook will continue to encourage researchers to study how people use its site. 'We believe in research, because it helps us build a better Facebook,' Schroepfer wrote. 'Like most companies today, our products are built based on extensive research, experimentation and testing.' ‘The reason we did this research is because we care about the emotional impact of Facebook and the people that use our product,' Facebook data scientist Adam D. I. Kramer said at the time of the study. ‘We felt that it was important to investigate the common worry that seeing friends post positive content leads to people feeling negative or left out. The experiment affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2500. ‘At the same time, we were concerned that exposure to friends' negativity might lead people to avoid visiting Facebook. We didn't clearly state our motivations in the paper. 'Having written and designed this experiment myself, I can tell you that our goal was never to upset anyone.' During the experiment, Facebook deprioritised content in News Feeds, based on whether there was an emotional word in the post. Tests affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2500 - for a week, in early 2012. According to Kramer, nobody's posts were 'hidden,' they just didn't show up on some feeds. 'Those posts were always visible on friends' timelines, and could have shown up on subsequent News Feed loads.' It found that negative posts elicited a swell of positive responses, but also that a reduction in positive news led to more negative posts, according to the results of a study published in PNAS Journal.","California-based firm carried out the experiment during a week in 2012 .

"More nude and compromising snaps that appear to show Hollywood celebrities were reportedly published online, in a third massive photo leak. A-lister Anna Kendrick saw racy snaps that purportedly show her pop up on both Reddit and 4chan forums. The Pitch Perfect star wears clothes in each photo. Scroll down for video . Victims? Both supermodel Cara Delevingne (left) and actress Anna Kendrick (right) were reportedly targeted in a third dump of celebrities' private photographs . The third massive photo leak was first reported by The Daily Beast, which listed supermodel Cara Delevingne, former volleyball player Misty May Treanor, model Carly Foulkes and TV presenter Brook Burns as alleged victims. Mena Suvari, Alexandra Chando, Lauren O'Neil, Kelli Garner and Briana Evigan were also named as alleged victims by the website. The first leak, which occurred over Labor Day weekend, saw a number of celebrities targeted, including actress Jennifer Lawrence, supermodel Kate Upton, as well as  Kirsten Dunst, horror movie actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and 'Downton Abbey' actress Jessica Brown Findlay. An alleged list of 101 victims also made the rounds online at the time, many of whom are actresses and models - but it did not include Kendrick's name. Following news of the Labor Day weekend leak, Kendrick posted a photograph of a text message exchange between the actress and her brother Mike on Twitter. In the message, Mike texted her 'I have never been happier to see not see your name on a list.' Kendrick tweeted 'Don't worry bro, it would just be photos of food and other people's dogs anyway.' She told QMI Agency 'I’m paranoid, and with good reason, clearly, as we’ve learned from the last couple of weeks. 'It certainly makes me sad for the girls who were affected, and bummed out that people won’t be able to do that stuff, because it’s a part of life and if you want to you should be able to. 'When stuff like that happens, I feel really grateful for my paranoia and really sad for people who are just trying to live their life like a normal person. And I hope that guy goes to jail.' After the first leak, Upton's attorney Lawrence Shire said in a statement 'This is obviously an outrageous violation of our client Kate Upton's privacy. We intend to pursue anyone disseminating or duplicating these illegally obtained images to the fullest extent possible.' Was it really them? Misty May Treanor (left) and Briana Evigan (right) were also among the alleged victims . Winstead confirmed on Twitter the photographs were genuine, writing 'To those of you looking at photos I took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home, hope you feel great about yourselves.' FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller told CNN 'The FBI is aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusions and the unlawful release of material involving high profile individuals, and is addressing the matter. Any further comment would be inappropriate at this time.' Though Apple's iCloud system was said to contain a flaw that allowed the breach to occur, the tech giant said in a statement 'After more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet. 'None of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud® or Find my iPhone. We are continuing to work with law enforcement to help identify the criminals involved.' 'We take user privacy very seriously and are actively investigating this report,' Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris told MailOnline at the time. In the second breach, which occurred last weekend, actresses Gabrielle Union and Amber Heard were targeted, as well as soccer star Hope Solo, pop star Rihanna and reality star Kim Kardashian. In a statement to TMZ, Union and husband Dwyane Wade said 'our private moments, that were shared and deleted solely between my husband and myself, have been leaked by some vultures.' Actress and fellow victim Meagan Good said in an Instagram post 'For everyone re-posting the leaked nudes? You should be ashamed of yourselves.'

"It used to be Cowboys and Indians or Cops and Robbers, now school children are playing a new sickening game in the playground: Jihadi John and the hostages. The online plague of Islamic State propaganda has inspired a worrying new trend among some school children to shockingly re-enact the group’s disturbing execution videos. The latest video from Libya, showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians on a beach, has inspired a group of children in Yemen to film their own mock up version and post it online.

A similar video, made by a group of Egyptian teenage boys, was also posted online. Despite the victims being Egyptian nationals, the teenagers see little wrong in mocking the persecution of their fellow countrymen. Similarly the shocking influence of Islamic State’s videos has been seen outside of the Arab world with school girls in Japan producing their own dramatised version. Last month, Islamic State released a video demanding $200 million for the safe release of Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto. Two days later, a Vine video emerged on social media showing three Japanese school girls re-enacting the horrifying video.

"There are some moments when you just wish the ground would open up and swallow you - especially when you're a bloke trying to sneak out of a Fifty Shades of Grey screening. Just when he thought he'd got away with catching a sneaky peak at the raunchy new flick this not-so-secret fan walked straight into a TV camera. Local broadcaster TV2/Nord was filming an interview with a female film goer at the premiere of the film in Aalborg, Denmark. Scroll down for video . The man spots the camera while on his way out of the Fifty Shades of Grey premiere in Aalborg, Denmark . The now not-so-secret Fifty Shades fan turns around and heads back, perhaps hoping to find another exit . The man takes a look back over his shoulder at the camera, looking for all the world like a guilty schoolboy . In the cringeworthy 22-second clip a middle aged man appears in the background on his way out of the cinema but as soon as he realises he's being filmed he stops in his tracks. After an excruciating moment of indecision the man, who appears to have been to the screening on his own, turns around and heads back down the corridor, taking a sneaky peak back over his shoulder at the camera like a guilty schoolboy. Perhaps hoping to find a different exit he soon realises he's got nowhere else to go and makes another embarrassing about face and, head down, shuffles past the camera as quickly as he can second time around. Ironically the female interviewer and the TV reporter have just got on to discussing why men have been staying away from Fifty Shades as the hapless man finally makes his escape. Realizing he's got nowhere to go he turns around again as it's clear the crew won't be packing up and leaving . He desperately looks for a way out as two other film goers walk past, clearly less embarrassed at being filmed . Head down, he prepares to face the music and make the getaway he might have done the first time round . Just as the man walks past, the interviewee is asked just why it is men have been avoiding the film . The long-awaited flick, panned as dull 'housewife porn' by critics, is largely drawing female audiences in Denmark. The painfully awkward 22-second clip has been seen more than 1.7million times and racked up more than 2,000 comments on YouTube, mostly poking fun at the unfortunate man's embarrassment. 'That guy knows he just got his man card revoked… permanently,' read one comment. Another said: 'This man has balls of steel to go into this movie'. Others came to the Aalborg man's defence. 'Nothing wrong with this man watching Fifty Shades of Grey. Men are not supposed to be conventionalized by archaic gender roles. People are individuals, not herds of cattle,' wrote one viewer. Another added: 'Why does it matter if a man saw it? Just because a man sees a feminine movie, it doesn't make him weak, any less of a man, or a pervert.'

"Two endangered grey nurse sharks which are harmless to humans have been found dead on the seabed with bullet holes in their heads. The sharks were discovered at Box Beach, in Port Stephens, on the NSW mid-north coast, on the weekend. One was a baby male while the other was an adult female. The NSW Department of Primary Industries is now investigating what has been described as a 'grisly' random attack, with a spokesperson telling the Daily Mail Australia that they are 'very concerned' about the killings. Two grey nurse sharks were found at Box Beach in Port Stephens NSW at the weekend . 'It is disappointing to see these pictures and this type of action is totally unacceptable,' the spokesperson said. An autopsy on the male, which is 1.92 metres, and the female, which is 2.03 metres, will be carried out and it's hoped the bullets can be recovered to help the investiagtion. The sharks suffered what are thought to be bullet holes in their heads . Toonie Mahto, a Marine campaigner with the Australian Marine Coservation Society, said she was 'deeply saddened' to hear the fate of the two grey nurses. 'It's a deeply tragic situation especially when we know the majority of Australians have a real love and respect for sharks,' she said. Ms Mahto said even thought this type of attack has happened before, thankfully the people who 'do this are in a very small minority'. The Department of Primary Industries now have the carcasses and are investigation the tragic incident . The marine campaigner also said that the killing of one female of such a critically endangered species can have a huge impact on the already dwindling population. 'These are critically endangered sharks and the removal of even one breeding female can have serious implications.' The DPI estimate that there are only 1500 grey nurse sharks still living in NSW waters, and they are committed to the protection of these animals. If people who killed the sharks are found they could face fines of up to $220,000 . In 1984, grey nurses became the first sharks in the world to be protected, by the NSW Government. They are now protected under both state and Commonwealth legislation. Penalties of as much as $220,000 and up to two years in prison can be handed down for those who catch, keep, buy, sell or possess grey nurse sharks without the correct permit. The Department of Primary Industries have referred the matter to NSW Police.","One male and one female shark were found with bullet wounds .

"A cancer sufferer has received thousands of texts and calls from JLS fans after Aston Merrygold posted his phone number on Twitter - claiming it was for his band mate Oritse Williams. Bill Phillips, 65, started receiving texts and phone calls 'every five seconds' after the ex JLS singer announced his number to his 183,000 followers as an April Fool’s joke. The grandfather - who is undergoing treatment for prostate cancer - has since received more than 4,700 texts and calls from fans hoping to contact Oritse. Bill Phillips, 65, left, has received 4,700 texts from JLS fans after ex band member Aston Merrygold, right, posted his number on Twitter as an April Fool's joke. The singer has 183,000 followers . Mr Phillips, from Hornchurch, Essex, said: 'I’ve got girls ringing up crying at 12 at night asking why did I split up from the band. Girls have been asking ‘will you marry me?’ 'A joke is a joke but this is not a joke. It has made my life hell. I’m getting calls and texts at all hours, sometime one and two in the morning. 'The kid is most likely a millionaire - I’m not. I’m sure he thinks it is great - it’s not. It’s costing me money and grief.' JLS star Aston, 26, has now phoned Mr Phillips to apologise for the joke - and offered him tickets to a show. The star posted the grandfather's number on Twitter along with numbers he claimed belonged to other bandmates Marvin Humes and JB Gill. The singer put three numbers on his Twitter page claiming they belonged to each of his band mates. He then wrote: 'Call them if you don't believe me' He wrote: 'As u can all see I’ve decided to take the high road and not do any pranks on April fools day.' He then posted the numbers with the hashtag #sorrynotsorry before encouraging fans to ring them . He wrote: 'Call them if you don’t believe me. April Fools finishes at 12 if you are 12. We goooooo all day over here.' Mr Phillips says the messages and calls started within minutes - and are still continuing a week after the stunt. Mr Phillips says the ‘joke’ has cost him thousands of pounds in lost jobs after he was forced to turn off the phone he uses to run two of his businesses. One of the thousands of messages sent to the grandfather, who is having treatment for prostate cancer, from a JLS fan . The father-of-two, who runs a stadium seat installation business and is also a pest-control falconer, said: 'I’m 65 and I’m not in a boy band. I’m trying to run a couple of businesses and this is impeding it. 'I’ve had this number for 21 years and I use it for work and clients - it is not an option to change it. 'It has cost me money. I can’t get hold of my men on my mobile, I’m having to do everything from a landline which isn’t easy. I know already of one job it cost me. 'I had to turn my phone off and missed a job they wanted doing of clearing seagulls. I was first choice but they had to offer it to someone else when they couldn’t get hold of me.' Aston Merrygold phoned Mr Phillips over the weekend to apologise for putting his phone number on Twitter. He also took to Twitter to reassure fans the numbers he posted were fake - but still has not deleted them. On Saturday he wrote: 'Ok so let's go back to APRIL FOOLS for a sec! Jus to make sure everyone knows Those numbers I put up were a JOKE! A joke! Uno ha ha #nottrue.' Mr Phillips said: 'He couldn't apologise enough on the phone. His management are supposed to be contacting me to say what they are going to do about it, but I haven't heard anything yet. 'I've always liked the kids - they are good guys - and he said it was a prank. He offered me whatever I wanted - a package of tickets or whatever - but I'm more of a Michael Buble fan. 'But I'm still going to speak to my solicitor about it. It's ruined my business.' Mr Phillips was diagnosed with prostate cancer five years ago and is due to finish treatment in October. The international boxing referee - who represented England at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games - is also due to have an operation to completely reconstruct his knee this Friday. Mr Phillips - who runs two businesses - says the prank has cost him money as he has had to turn off his mobile and had therefore missed offers of work. He says he will speak to his solicitor about the joke . It will be the sixth operation to repair the sporting injury. Mr Philips added: 'This is really not what I needed. I was hoping to use the last few days to get stuff sorted for being off, but it’s been a nightmare.' Aston Merrygold has been contacted by MailOnline for comment. A spokesman for Essex Police confirmed the incident had been reported, but said it does not constitute as an offence. He added: 'A man from Hornchurch, east London, attended South Ockendon police station in Essex shortly before 4pm on Tuesday April 1 to report that his mobile telephone number had been inappropriately published on Twitter.

"The Colombian prostitute at the center of the Secret Service sex scandal, Dania Suarez, could be a future Playmate, according to local media reports. Miss Suarez, 24, will allegedly 'pose nude in Playboy and give an interview to a reputable journalist recounting everything that happened,' according to The Miami Herald. She attracted worldwide headlines following an incident at a hotel in  Cartagena when she spent a night with a Secret Service agent who then refused to pay her the agreed price of $800 for her services. Dania Suarez, 24, will allegedly 'pose nude in Playboy and give an interview to a reputable journalist recounting everything that happened' Theresa Hennessey, a spokeswoman for Playboy, said there are 'no plans to post her pictures in the magazine.' Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler, revealed he has pictures but has not yet finished writing the article to accompany them. 'There is a public fascination with people in the media and I have little doubt that there is a market somewhere for images like this and a personal revelation of her version of the story,' said Richard Wolf an attorney for the entertainment industry. It also emerged this week that Colombia’s diplomat in the U.S. has . demanded that President Obama say sorry for the secret service sex . scandal  - which he claimed has damaged the reputation of his country. Controversial: Suárez leaped into notoriety after she provoked an incident at the Caribe Hotel with a Secret Service agent who refused to pay her the agreed price for a night of sex . Gabriel Silva gave an impassioned interview to Colombian newspaper El . Tiempo where he criticised the American government's handling of the . scandal which saw federal agents buying hookers. The embarrassing prostitution scandal has resulted in the Secret Service sending about 100 of its agents on an ethics training course. The agents will take part in two days of training this week from professors at Johns Hopkins University near Washington. According to The Huffington Post, the Secret Service has originally scheduled training for just 20 agents. But following the scandal, it expanded the course to include about 100. The university has previously worked with the Secret Service and so was deemed a good choice. The Secret Service has also announced new conduct rules for its agents, including prohibiting them from drinking excessively or bringing foreigners to their hotel rooms. The incident became public on April 12 when Miss Suarez argued with a Secret Service agent over her payment in a hallway of the . Caribe Hotel. Mr Silva was furious that the media storm over the incident has focused . on the city's sex industry - where prostitution is legal. Mr Silva told the paper: 'It is necessary, and I want to hear it from the White House. 'A more clear expression of remorse is required to protect the reputation of Cartagena.' Last week, President Barack Obama described the prostitution scandal as . 'a little distracting' and branded the 12 agents involved . 'knuckleheads'. Since then, a dozen Secret Service employees, including two supervisors, and 12 military personnel have been implicated. Eight of the Secret Service officers have been forced out, the agency is . trying to permanently revoke the security clearance of one, and three . others have been cleared of serious wrongdoing but will face . administrative discipline. They all belonged to the advanced . security team of President Barack Obama, who visited Cartagena April . 14-15 to participate in the Summit of the Americas.

"Kim Smith, wife of Seth Adam Smith who wrote a blog post about his fear of commitment titled 'Marriage is not for you,' has admitted that her first reaction to the online article was negative. But after Kim read the post, which has been viewed more than 24million times, she realized it was not what it seemed. 'I had the same reaction any woman would have when I first saw the title,' she told Good Morning America. Kim Smith, wife of Seth Adam Smith who wrote a blog post about his fear of commitment titled 'Marriage is not for you,' has admitted that her first reaction to the online article was negative . When Seth began to struggle in his marriage of 18 months to Kim, who had became ever more dedicated to her graduate studies in theater, which led the couple to relocate to Florida, the Alaskan-native  said he felt isolated and began to push Kim away. 'We were living in the same house but we were growing apart,' he said. When the tension culminated in an argument, Seth anticipated a blowout with a defensive Kim. But instead, his wife responded with compassion. 'I felt like I had two choices, I could react in anger and our . relationship would get worse, or I could try and see past my own hurts . and my own frustrations and try and see what Seth was feeling,' she admitted. That moment reminded Seth of advice . his father had shared before the couple married, when Seth felt . 'paralyzing fear' about whether he was making the 'right' choice' After Kim read the post, which has been viewed 24million times, she realized it was not what it seemed . 'I had the same reaction any woman would have when I first saw the title,' she told Good Morning America . 'I'm going to make this really simple: marriage isn't for you,' Seth's father had said at the time. 'You don't marry to make yourself happy, you marry to make someone else happy.' So Smith turned to the Internet to share his experience. 'I realized that I had lost sight of what marriage was really about and . was losing Kim in the process,' Seth admitted. 'As well as her hopes and dreams.' 'I could react in anger and our . relationship would get worse, or I could try and see past my own hurts . and my own frustrations' Under the loaded title, 'Marriage is not for you,' Seth wrote on his blog: 'Having been married only a year and a half, I've recently come to the conclusion that marriage isn't for me.' Seth, a Mormon, met his wife Kim when they were just 15 years old. They were friends for ten years before their relationship became something more, and a year-and-a-half ago, they got married. 'The . nearer Kim and I approached the decision to marry, the more I was . filled with a paralyzing fear. Was I ready? Was I making the right . choice? Was Kim the right person to marry? Would she make me happy?' he . wrote. But a conversation with his father put rest to any doubts Smith had about his upcoming nuptials. 'Seth, you’re being totally selfish. So . I’m going to make this really simple: marriage isn’t for you. You don’t . marry to make yourself happy, you marry to make someone else happy,' Smith's father told him. 'More than that, your marriage isn’t for yourself, you’re marrying for a family. Not just for the in-laws and all of that nonsense, but for your future children. Who do you want to help you raise them? Who do you want to influence them? Marriage isn’t for you. It’s not about you. Marriage is about the person you married,' he said. Seth, adding his own commentary to his father's advice, concluded: 'No, a true marriage (and true love) is never about you. It's about the person you love - their wants, their needs, their hopes, and their dreams. Selfishness demands, ""What's in it for me?"" while Love asks, ""What can I give?""' Initially, the blogger, who also edits a site called ForwardWalking.com, received criticism from some . readers who feared he was forsaking his needs to tend to someone . else, but he insists that misses the point. Kim admitted she was touched by the post - and surprised when it went viral, with thousands of people commenting on her marriage. One commenter wrote, 'Loved it! After 15 . years of marriage, and several near misses with that grey line in the . affair department, my husband finally figured that out... I finally was . ready to walk away...  He would now tell you he was so wrong and not . thinking about that other ‘person’ he should have been taking care of – . our marriage.' Kim admitted she was touched by the post - and surprised when it went viral, with thousands of people commenting on her marriage . Seth, adding his own commentary to his father's advice, concluded: 'No, a true marriage (and true love) is never about you. It's about the person you love - their wants, their needs, their hopes, and their dreams . Another tweeted, 'Thanks for posting . that ""marriage isn't for you"" article it changed my mind on that . archaic, disenfranchising, and oppressive tradition!' It's also received backlash from cynics for what they called, an overly simplistic view of marriage. 'One of the most overrated institutions on the planet. Only makes sense if you don't have a Will,' wrote a commentator on HuffPost. 'Marriage isn't for men, with the divorce laws, child support and alimony what man wants to get married,' said another. 'And . marriage isn't for women either, because in most cases you just end up . being a nanny, nurse, housekeeper, second income, etc,' came the . retort. 'Sounds like a nice sentiment. Could . not help but thinking though that it would have a lot more credibility . if the author had made it past the 2 year mark first... It can be a lot . more difficult than you ever expected despite good intentions and a lot . of hard work. People can be unpredictable over the long haul,' wrote . another.

"Barcelona have sacked sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta, while club legend Carles Puyol has also left his position at the Spanish giants. Puyol was operating as Zubizarreta's assistant, but announced he had terminated his working contract at the club in the wake of Zubizarreta's sacking on Monday. The club will now discuss the future of coach Luis Enrique at an emergency board meeting on Wednesday. VIDEO Scroll down to see five star Neymar scoring for fun in Barcelona training . Andoni Zubizarreta unveils Luis Suarez in August after he completed his £75million transfer from Liverpool . Barcelona legend Carles Puyol has also left the club, terminating his working contract on Monday . Zubizarreta, pictured at Barcelona's training session on Monday, has been sacked as sporting director . Carles Puyol joined Barcelona's academy at La Masia in 1995 . He played for Barcelona C, before moving up to Barcelona B in 1997 . In 1998, manager Louis van Gaal agreed a deal with Malaga to sell the defender, but Puyol refused to move after seeing his best friend Xavi make his first-team debut . In October 1999, Puyol's persistence paid off as he made his first-team bow under Van Gaal . Puyol was named club captain in the summer of 2004 after Luis Enrique - now head coach - retired . On November 13 2010, Puyol made his 500th appearance in all competitions for Barca . In March 2014, Puyol surpassed Migueli to go second in Barcelona's all-time league appearance table, only behind Xavi . Shortly after, he announced his retirement after struggling with injury, and on May 15 2014, bid farewell to his playing career. He was then announced as Andoni Zubizarreta's assistant . Ben Nagle . The swift action follows the team’s defeat in the first game of the new year against David Moyes's Real Sociedad, although is also a direct consequence of the Court of Arbitration for Sport’s decision to uphold FIFA’s one-year transfer ban on the club for illegal signing of under-age players. Luis Enrique’s position is not believed to be under threat but a no-show from Lionel Messi in Monday’s training session added to speculation that the coach has lost the dressing room with players tired of his constant changing of the first XI. In a statement released on Monday, former Barcelona defender Puyol said: 'I would like to announce to you that I have decided to terminate my working relationship with Barcelona FC. 'These three-and-a-half months have given me the opportunity to see the other side of the club. I have learned a lot, I am very grateful, and now I would like to experience other things from another perspective and in different surroundings.' His colleague Zubizarreta has paid the price for a failure last summer to effectively strengthen Barcelona’s defence. The club signed Brazilian full-back Douglas and Arsenal’s central defender Thomas Vermaelen but the former has looked hopelessly out of his depth and started only one league game and the latter is yet to play because of injury and needed surgery towards the end of last year which is likely to rule him out for the rest of the season. Only Xavi has made more appearances for Barcelona than Puyol, who terminated his contract on Monday .

Spanish Super Cup: 1984, 1991, 1992 . Post-retirement: . Athletic Bilbao sporting director (2000-2010) Barcelona sporting director (2010-14) There is also a good argument for Barcelona not needing a sporting director now that they know they will not be able to sign any new players until January 2016. Puyol, in his statement, continued by thanking his former club, at which he played professionally for 15 years until his retirement in the summer. 'I want to develop not only professionally but on a personal level too so that in the future I could perhaps return to this home and give back everything that you have given to me during these unforgettable years,' he added. 'I continue to be enormously grateful to the employees, directors, president and to the sporting management for trusting and helping me in a transition that is no way easy for me. 'Above all, to the supporters, who I always felt so close to as a player, and now even since my retirement, I feel that it continues much more today. I have been and I am very fortunate to feel so much warmth, for this I can only say THANK YOU and that you know that I will always carry you in my heart.' Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu will speak on Wednesday about the decision when he is also expected to give coach Luis Enrique a vote of confidence but Messi’s absence with a stomach bug from Monday's training after he was left out of the starting line-up for the opening game of the year has added fuel to rumours the coach who took over at the start of the season has lost the dressing room. A Barcelona statement on the sacking of Zubizarreta read: 'The Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has decided to terminate as of today the contract of the club's director of football, Andoni Zubizarreta.

But Arsenal put in their best away performance in five years against Manchester City at the Etihad — they were happy to concede possession and were clinical in attack. I think they will go into the game with a better balance and if there’s any naivety in Tottenham’s play, Arsenal will punish them. It’s the Merseyside derby as well this weekend and another of my old sides, Everton, got a vital win last week. There might be some momentum from that while Liverpool had a tricky game against Bolton and will have less time to prepare. For people to question Roberto Martinez’s position is ridiculous. He just needs to be more consistent. And there’s no better place to make a mark than in a derby game.","Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere needs to be educated on his behaviour .

"The practice of Stop-and-Frisk in New York virtually ended in the second half of 2013. This is according to the New York Times, who mapped out police stops in New York City comparing the first half of 2012 and the second half of 2013. Supporters of the controversial policy warned of a resurgence in violent crime if it was banned, as Mayor Bill de Blasio campaigned to do, but so far New York has stayed as safe as ever. Over and done: Mayor Bill de Blasio came into office promising to end the controversial and 'unconstitutional' practice of Stop-and-Frisk . New York's first lady, Chirlaine McCray, has apparently taken an interest in NYPD policy as well, attending a meeting on Thursday of top officials examining the city's use of Compstat, which collects data on crimes throughout the city. Former Police Commissioner Ray Kelly made the practice of stopping people behaving 'suspiciously' a regular part of police practice for the NYPD during his tenure from 2002 to 2013. But with a federal court ruling that declared the practice unconstitutional and a new mayor dedicated to ending it, Stop-and-Frisk numbers fell drastically in the last half of 2013. According to New York Times reporting, in 2012 most of the stops were concentrated in central Brooklyn and those stopped were overwhelmingly African American or Hispanic. Police deployed in Precinct 77 in the northern part of Crown Heights, for instance, were stopping 75 to 100 people a day. That number has since fallen off. Former commissioner Ray Kelly promised last year on Meet the Press that 'violent crime will go up' if Stop-and-Frisk is ended, so far evidence has not borne that out. Stopped: A photographer snapped a photo of an unidentified young man being cuffed by the NYPD in a train station . Insiders: First Lady Chirlaine McCray and her son, Dante de Blasio, got a behind-the-scenes look at how Compstat programs work in New York . Unconstitutional: Critics called Stop-and-Frisk unconstitutional and said there was no evidence that it lowered violent crime rates . Reuters reported in June there was a 13% increase in shootings since January compared to a similar stretch in 2013. But the Daily News found that August was the safest month in the city since the Compstat program was instituted in 1994. Beyond stopping Stop-and-Frisk, the First Family has so far been very interested in how the NYPD patrol's New York's streets. DNAinfo reported that de Blasio's wife Chirlaine McCray attended a meeting on Compstat where high-ranking officials grilled NYPD supervisors and commanders about precinct-level crime rates. A city official only said that 'the first lady has been wanting to learn more about policing in the city and how the NYPD is structured' and did not explain further. de Blasio's son Dante also attended a meeting on Compstat focused on the Bronx while interning with Deputy Mayor Anthony Shorris. Residents interviewed by the New York Times who previously had been stopped and frisked said they still felt ill at ease. Tijay Lewis, 15, said he'd been stopped 10 times since he turned 13. He said hadn't been stopped for months and told the paper 'It feels a little bit different.'","New York's First Lady Chirlaine McCray attended a meeting of high-ranking officials on Compstat on Thursday .

"An American luger had the likes of Beyonce cheering her on today as she placed in the top 10 at the Sochi Olympics. Kate Hansen, a student at Brigham Young University, grabbed the star's attention after making headlines with her unique warm-up ritual.

Crazy in LUGE: American luger Kate Hansen warms up for each race by dancing to Beyonce . Secret ritual: She says her 'strictly Beyonce' playlist helps her get fierce and stoked for competition . Winner: Hansen placed 10th in Tuesday's luge race . When the star read Hansen's story on SBNation, she reposted it on her Facebook page and wrote: 'Go Kate!' And the good vibes seemed to have paid off. While Hansen didn't medal in the competition, she did place a respectable 10th in the race. Teammate Erin Hamlin won the bronze medal. Before the competition Tuesday, Hansen spoke with NBC about the entertaining warm-up routine. Hansen said her girl Bey 'gets me fierce and I get stoked'. Bey knows! Beyonce found out about Hansen and seemed delighted in her pre-race ritual . Star support: Beyonce wished Kate good look on her Facebook today . And she doesn't care what other people think of the ritual. 'I'm completely in my own world and it doesn't matter who's staring, I'm still going to dance.' While most find the dancing endearing, one NBC commentator wasn't impressed. Former luger Duncan Kennedy said he'd like to see a more 'sport-specific' warm-up from Hansen. 'What you see out of the top runners, the really-heavy-hitters, is they're working the arms and the shoulders and getting the power out of them because the start has to be a powerful explosive movement.

"Uber car service celebrated National Cat Day by delivering kittens to the doorsteps of customers in seven cities across American on Wednesday. Customers paid $30 to snuggle with the adoptable felines at their homes and offices for 15 minutes with all proceeds going to participating offices. The uber cute kitties showed up in offices and homes in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Austin, Washington DC, Seattle and Phoenix. Scroll down for video . Loves to cuddle: Uber delivered kittens for 15 minute cuddle sessions in cities across America on Wednesday and one of the participating celebrities was model Coco Rocha . Popular promo: Offices like social marketing firm Spredfast in Austin, Texas jumped on the Uber Kitten bandwagon . Social media perfect storm: Twitter and Facebook lit up with posts tagged #Uberkittens along with photos of the visiting furballs on Wednesday . According to the Uber blog, local shelters worked with customers who wanted more than just their 15 minutes and hoped to adopt their kittens. As the company predicted, the deal was too good to pass up as there were more customers than kittens in many of the participating areas. Photos of the snuggle sessions showed up on social media posts out of all six cities, where #uberkittens appeared to be especially popular among office workers eager for a break from routine. In New York, the kittens showed up in the offices of publishers Condé Nast and Hearst. Cuddle time: Uber added a special function to its app on Wednesday so users in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Austin, Washington DC, Seattle and Phoenix could get on the cuddling . All for themselves: Employees of Uber Phoenix tweeted out pictures of themselves cuddling with the kittens . 'We helped many lucky kitten-requestors adopt #UberKITTENS in need. We laughed, we smiled, and some even cried...' @UberPhoenix tweeted . At Condé Nast, one of the kittens was seen staring at a blown up magazine cover featuring actress Jennifer Lawrence. 'Catness meets Katniss at @VanityFair' tweeted the ASPCA. Celebrities also loved the event. Canadian model Coco Rocha seemed especially smitten. 'PURE GENIUS,' the 26-year-old tweeted along with a picture of her holding a grey kitten. '@ASPCA & @Uber teamed up to bring you adoptable kittens on demand.' This was the second year of Uber's promotion and was available in twice as many cities this time around. Last October, only cat lovers in Seattle, New York and San Francisco could participate. Success! Uber Seattle tweeted a photo of this woman and the cat they helped her adopt Wednesday . Animal rights advocacy group PETA's Senior Vice President of Cruelty Investigations Daphna Nachminovitch told MailOnline in an email: . 'A kitten isn't for 15 minutes but for life, so hopefully, these interludes will lead to a real home for a real cat for the rest of his or her life. PETA urges careful screening of all adopters, just as should occur with the adoption of a human child.' Uber's blog refers potential adopters back to their participatng local shelters, where the policies on screening adopters differ. At Chicago's Anti-cruelty Society, for instance, adopters are urged to spend as much time as possible with the pet before making the decision to apply to take it home. At the San Francisco SPCA, meanwhile, potential pet parents are required to attend a training class before they are sent home with a pet.","Uber teamed with the ASPCA and meme site Cheezburger for the Wednesday promotion .

"Andrew Strauss insists that it is a 'good thing to have conflict' in a team - as long as the whole side are 'united by a common purpose'. The former England captain's comments come in the wake of allegations made by Kevin Pietersen in his explosive book, KP: The Autobiography, of 'bullying' in the national side. But Strauss believes it is a 'myth' that all successful sides are fully harmonious and act like the characters in The Waltons - an American television series based around a family who all get along well and achieve a positive outcome from a difficult situation as a result.

The 37-year-old, speaking to London Loves Business, said: 'Sometimes I think there’s this myth that all teams need to get on brilliantly, a kind of Waltons myth - that you need to be like the Waltons if you want to perform well as a team - but that couldn’t be further from the truth. 'You actually want a degree of conflict at times - you want people to feel comfortable enough to say their opinion. 'Conflict is a good thing as long as it’s well-meaning and it’s all coming from a starting point of: ""how do we get better and how do we improve?""'

"Andrew Strauss has called for an end to all the mud-slinging and ‘madness’ that has been ignited this week in the wake of Kevin Pietersen releasing his autobiography. The former captain believes damage is being done to the national side as scores are settled and major figures in the game line up on one side or the other supporting or condemning the controversial batsman. Strauss wants to see a period of calm. ‘A lot of this going on at the moment is madness,’ the former England skipper told Sky Sports. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Pietersen discuss alleged bullying and abuse in England camp . Kevin Pietersen poses with his autobiography at its launch in London, extracts had already been published . ‘The victim here isn’t Kevin Pietersen or (Andy) Flower or (Matt) Prior; it’s actually the England cricket team and Alastair Cook and Peter Moores, who have got to try to take the side forward. That to me is the disappointing thing about this whole episode. ‘There has been a lot of rumour, innuendo and opinion. I prefer to stick with the facts. All this tit-for-tat stuff, I don’t think it helps the England team.’ Strauss acknowledged that Pietersen could be proud of playing some of England’s ‘most memorable innings’ and described him as one of the country’s ‘finest players’. Andrew Strauss and Pietersen had a complex relationship during their time playing for England . Strauss and Pietersen celebrate becoming world No 1 in 2011 (left), and a ton for the skipper in 2012 (right) Yet he also defended Prior and Flower, the two men who had scorn and vitriol poured upon them in the book, which went on sale yesterday. ‘Matt had a massive impact on the team, with the bat and behind the scenes — he was the embodiment of a culture we were trying to produce of putting the team first. Andy Flower is a guy of complete integrity. 'He’s achieved phenomenal things, and should be regarded as one of England’s great coaches. The idea the team comes first was central to what we did, and something he was very conscious and protective of.’ Pietersen's book has caused considerable controversy, with the former batsman pulling no punches . England bowler James Anderson, when asked about Pietersen’s allegations, said: ‘It’s just sad that what was a successful period for England has now been overshadowed by what has come out. ‘What I remember about the time Kevin is talking about is that this was one of the most successful periods English cricket has ever had and that comes down to Andy Flower and the guys in the dressing room at the time. 'We won three Ashes, including winning them away from home for the first time in 24 years, and we beat India and became No 1 in the world, so what is being talked about here are many of the highlights of my career. Bowler James Anderson has said that the story is taking away from England's impressive record . Speaking at a Hardys wine event at Lord’s, Anderson added: ‘I have really fond memories of this time, like sitting on the outfield at Sydney with all the guys, when we beat Australia 3-1. ‘Sharing that moment with Kevin and everybody is something I will cherish for the rest of my life. ‘To be overshadowed by this is unfair on Andy because you can’t argue with what he achieved as a coach. ‘Hopefully what has happened this week will not be remembered as much as all the memories we all cherish.’ Former South Africa captain Graeme Smith (R) claims there is some truth in Pietersen's comments . Former South Africa skipper Graeme Smith also weighed in, adding: ‘Some of the stuff (Pietersen) touches on in his book I certainly believe. ‘Having played against them, we always used to say if we could get a win or get ahead they would turn on each other. ‘The bullying stuff you did experience when you played against them, and you knew you could use it as an asset to get on their other side.’ VIDEO Pietersen calls ECB report 'an embarrassment'","Kevin Pietersen's autobiography has caused huge controversy .

"A celebrity porn website owner has blocked access to hacked naked pictures of leading celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton after his sleazy website was exposed. The Russian - who ran the site from his home in industrial Samara - admitted: 'I am not thinking about further promoting of this website.' Sergei Kholodkovskii's lucrative exploitation of hacked pictures was highlighted by MailOnline but since then he has stopped updating the site with new images, and appears to be blocking access to images of women who have complained about their private pictures being used. Sergei Kholodovskii (right) was unmasked as an IT expert behind a site which hosts nude celebrity images - and insists his wife Yana Sotova (left) has no problem with it . Sergei Kholodkovskii's lucrative exploitation of hacked pictures was highlighted by MailOnline. His pole-dancing wife Yana (right), 25, said the pictures were all taken 'from open sources' Lucrative pop-up advertising also no longer seems to be part of the site. Images of Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, Rita Ora and a number of other women appear to be blocked, while others for Kim Kardashian, Kelly Brook, and Scarlett Johansson remain on the site, though no new pictures have been posted for almost two weeks. Drag racer Kholodkovskii, 28, was tracked down to Samara in southern Russia. He used a website registered in Arizona to post indecent pictures of the stars. Kholodovskii appears to be blocking access to images of women who have complained about their private pictures being used . Drivers: The couple are both drag racing drivers and live in a southern Russian town where he runs the site . Actresses and models were outraged after intimate photos of them emerged online at the end of August, when they were shared by users of the anonymous photo-sharing site 4chan. The images had been uploaded to iCloud, an online storage system available to all Apple users which synchronises with iPhones and iPads. It is thought many of the victims would have had their photos uploaded automatically without realising they had allowed the process to happen through their devices' security settings. Users' iCloud accounts are private, but hackers found a vulnerability in one of the site's login pages which allowed them to enter multiple passwords until they cracked users' details. Apple quickly fixed the glitch, but by then the damage had been done. Today it emerged 100,000 more videos and images have been leaked online after they were intercepted from Snapchat (above). The pictures are feared to contain a large cache of child pornography, as half of the app's users are aged between 13 and 17. Images sent using the app are designed to disappear after they have been viewed once, but recipients can take screenshots of the pictures and forward them to other people. He strongly denies that he was responsible for the hacking, as did his pole-dancing wife Yana, 25, who said the pictures were all taken 'from open sources'. She admitted on her social network that her husband's exposure had been salutary after the story about the website, featuring naked pictures of stars, was taken up by by the Moscow media. 'In Russia this story was broadcast on all the channels and all the media wrote about it. In one day our life turned to something like hell,' she complained, not mentioning the angst for celebrities whose private pictures were featured by her husband without their permission. But she admitted the couple may avoid travelling to the West where her husband could be at risk of prosecution. 'We should probably only go on holidays to Crimea now,' she said. Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence, 24, called the publication of pictures 'a sex crime, a sexual violation'. Kelly Brook, 34, complained of 'a sex crime and a complete invasion of privacy.' Kholodkovskii initially claimed that the site belonged to a mystery Russian living in Europe but later admitted he collected thousands of hacked images and videos after they were posted on various web sources. 'The first pictures appeared on the internet on August 31 and I decided to make a website and to carry out an experiment if people were interested in such photographs. 'And it turned out they were very much interested. I posted the pictures to the website and it quickly became popular.' He alleged stars sent him their pictures to be included on his site - which we are not naming. Asked who volunteered their naked images, he said: ' I do not remember the names of those celebrities.' He also complained to the Russian media that he had been found by British journalists even though 'all my personal details were closed'. In fact they were not, since he had openly registered his name as a website owner and registered the address of his mother - who works in a jewellery shop - in Togliatti, a Russian city best known as the home of Lada cars. He did not appear to give the same privacy concerns to the women whose pictures he uploaded, after they were stolen from Apple's iCloud. He said his site is now 'living its own life' and he was no longer promoting it. Earlier he alleged that many of the stars got 'good publicity' from the exposure. Speaking out: The actress Jennifer Lawrence said of the leak: 'It's disgusting. The law needs to be changed'","Sergei Kholodovskii, 28, is technical brain behind Arizona-registered site .

"A long-awaited rescue of passengers on board a research ship trapped in Antarctic ice for more than a week was today successfully completed. A helicopter airlifted passengers to a nearby vessel after landing on a makeshift helipad next to the stranded ship. The helicopter was originally going to fly the passengers to a Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, with a barge then ferrying them to a nearby Australian vessel. But sea ice was preventing the barge from reaching the Snow Dragon, and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's Rescue Coordination Centre, which is overseeing the rescue, said the operation would consequently be delayed.

"Sir Dave Brailsford has leapt to the defence of Andy Flower in the Kevin Pietersen storm, arguing that big personalities sometimes have to be excluded for the benefit of the team. Former England coach Flower has been heavily criticised for what has been seen in some quarters as a failure to manage a maverick personality like Pietersen in a dressing room environment. But Brailsford has admitted he omitted Sir Bradley Wiggins from the Team Sky Tour de France team this year because of the issues that exist between the 2012 Tour winner and 2013 champion, Chris Froome. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sir Dave Brailsford say he has sympathy with Andy Flower . Sir Dave Brailsford defended Andy Flower and said his exploits as England coach must not be forgotten . Kevin Pietersen (left) claimed Flower (right) had it in for him from the moment he took charge of England . Pietersen also commented that he felt there was a culture of bullying within the England dressing room . Asked specifically about Flower and Pietersen on Wednesday, the man who has masterminded Great Britain's phenomenal cycling success on the road and the track over the past decade said: 'Sport is all about managing difficult personalities. The best sports people in the world aren't normal people. So you're bound to get difficult scenarios and conflict. 'I've never met Kevin Pietersen, but I do know Andy Flower. I rate Andy Flower. 'I can't draw a conclusion or comment because I don't know the full story or the full detail of the facts. But we shouldn't forget that he's had a fantastic run at managing the national team. 'You're always going to have a degree of conflict when you're managing very, very driven individuals. 'You've got to decide if you want a team and if being a team is the optimal way of winning. And if you've got somebody who is contrary to that process of having a team, you've got to think very carefully about what you're trying to do. Brailsford said since his appointment as coach in 2009, Flower has had a fantastic run at managing the team . England’s highest ever run scorer Pietersen claims he's not sure why he was sacked by the ECB in February . Pietersen leaves the field after being dismissed during day two of the Fifth Ashes Test in January . 'We all face challenges over time, in all walks of life. When you've got flair players, or big characters, the guys who don't quite fit. It's a challenge for all of us to try to marry those into a team. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. 'Ultimately what we think about a lot of the time is team. I'm more inclined to think about what we want to win. 'If you get the right guys, they're motivated, passionate about it, we put the right group together, the team will look after itself. 'You have to have the values and the team aspect of it, but ultimately you get people driven. 'There's an element, if we're not careful, of the whole team ethic and values which doesn't penetrate right down to individual performance on a day to day, granular level.' Brailsford stressed that Flower's achievements should not be forgotten amid the controversy. 'I'm very sympathetic to Andy Flower,' he said. 'People forget that we hadn't won the Ashes for such a long time and he took us on a journey down to Australia and he took the Ashes back. 'I'm not a cricket aficionado, but, to me, I think he changed the mentality. From a pretty poor run, all of a sudden we were winning the Ashes and we were expected to win the Ashes. 'He's getting criticised for having not won the Ashes and we should stop and think about that. We're very much about the moment that we're in. Andy Flower did a fantastic job as far as I can see.' Brailsford received criticism for omitting Sir Bradley Wiggins from Team Sky's Tour de France team this year . Wiggins' fractious relationship with Chris Froome was the reason behind his exclusion from the Tour de France . Speaking at the Leaders in Sport conference at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday, Brailsford admitted he omitted Wiggins because of his fractured relationship with Froome. Brailsford faced some criticism for excluding Wiggins, particularly after Froome crashed out only a few days into the race. But Brailsford says he had to put the feelings of team leader Froome first, and felt the inclusion of Wiggins in the nine man team when they clearly loathe one another would be counter-productive. Sportsmail's Paul Newman reveals how Kevin Pietersen tried to woo England coach Andy Flower . Graeme Swann: Kevin Pietersen is wrong. There was absolutely no bullying in the England camp . KP: 'Divisive' Andy Flower wanted to get me out of the England team . Kevin Pietersen brands Andy Flower as 'f****** horrendous' and a 'Mood Hoover' Pietersen reveals how Andy Flower wanted a team of eager Boy Scouts . 'You can have a nice popular team if you want but popularity doesn't always win,' said Brailsford in clear reference to the disappointment felt that Wiggins would not be riding the three English stages of this year's Tour. 'Forget Kevin Pietersen,' he said. 'I had a few of my own to deal with, and there are challenges. 'We had a tricky season with two big champions, big personalities - very driven. 'A number of times people said to me 'why don't you get Chris and Brad in a room, bang their heads together and tell them to get on with it'. 'That would have been the easiest thing to do. But over three weeks in France you are travelling together in the morning, racing, then travelling after and eating together. It would have been like a Big Brother scenario. 'I had to ask myself if that was going to be optimal for the team in that environment. And the answer was no. Brailsford and Team Sky have had a disappointing year following their back-to-back wins at the Tour . 'Our best chance of winning the Tour lay in Chris's hands and I had to build the team around Chris. 'You get challenging scenarios; difficult decisions that can be fairly uncomfortable. But my analysis was, do we want to win?' After a difficult year for Sky – that followed back-to-back wins at the Tour – Brailsford said he was considering ripping up the blueprint that has delivered so much success and starting again. 'I'm not trying to work out what a sports team in 2020 is going to look like,' he said. He also said Wiggins would be targeting the iconic hour record in June. 'There is a plan for him to do it and I'm sure he can do it,' said Brailsford. 'When you look at the riders who could go for the hour record, and feasibly achieve a better distance than Jens Voigt's just achieved, then I think Bradley's probably one of the most accomplished.'","Andy Flower has been criticised for failure to manage a big personalities .

"A much-loved local radio talk show host who was known for her activism on veterans' issues has been found shot dead in her home near the Jersey shore. The bullet-riddled body of April Kauffman was found at around 11:30 a.m. on Thursday by a hosue worker who called 911, according to Atlantic County Prosecutor Ted Housel. Housel said the 47-year-old had been shot numerous times in the bedroom of her home in Linwood, about 12 miles from Atlantic City. Scroll down for video . Murdered: April Kauffman had been shot numerous times in the bedroom of her home in Linwood, about 12 miles from Atlantic City .

Neighbour Lou Tate told ABC that the endocrinologist spoke briefly to his wife and kept asking, 'Why now?' 'I think he's getting ready to retire,' Tate told the station. 'They bought a home in Arizona, and I think they wanted to relocate possibly.' Kauffman, a grandmother, hosted a weekly talk radio program on WOND, where she advocated for veterans causes and other issues. Harry Hurley, who did several radio broadcasts with Kauffman, told The Press of Atlantic City that she ‘did the work of 100 people.’ He was shocked that somebody who did so much to help other people could be murdered so viciously.

"After undergoing the new 'spray-on' skin treatment, Alison Portass can wear her bikini with confidence . Scars are a constant and vivid reminder of an injury or illness that many people would prefer to forget. Every year, countless hundreds of thousands are left with scarring following accidents, bad acne or surgery. But could a form of 'spray-on' skin made from the patient's own skin cells help? One of those who have had the treatment is Alison Portass. When she discovered she had breast cancer for the second time at the age of 57 - nearly three decades after getting the all-clear - it came as a huge blow. But a double mastectomy, although traumatic, cut the risk of her cancer returning, and an immediate reconstruction meant it had minimal impact on her figure. However, Alison was left with a large scar stretching from hip to hip, where doctors had taken skin to use in the reconstructive surgery. 'The surgeon did a wonderful job, with any scarring on the breast hidden,' says Alison, now 62, a nurse from Wisbech in Cambridgeshire. 'But I hated that scar on my abdomen - it was shrunken, lumpy and red with white patches, around 10in long and nearly three-quarters of an inch wide. I was grateful to the surgeons for saving my life, but it left me with a very poor body image. 'I'm not fat and I'm not old, but I still felt I had to cover up, even on the beach.' Today, however, thanks to treatment with the new spray-on skin, her scar has almost disappeared. Scars form when the dermis - the deeper, connective layer of the skin - is damaged. Their severity depends on the extent of injury as well as the skin's repair response, and on the behaviour of collagen, a protein that acts like a glue in wound healing. In normal skin, the collagen bundles are laid down in a neat, criss-cross pattern, and when healing goes smoothly, scars are flat and often improve in colour over time. But sometimes the repair process gets out of hand. Cells known as fibroblasts, which produce collagen, go into overdrive and a new system of blood vessels is set up to feed the scar, which triggers extra collagen. The bundles of this protein then form rigid, parallel lines, sometimes gluing layers of tendon and tissue together to form lumps. Damage to the epidermis (the top layer of skin) can also affect the keratinocytes - cells that create healthy skin - and the melanocytes, which produce the pigment responsible for skin colour. 'Most scars improve by themselves over time, so it can be worth waiting a few months to a year before embarking on treatments,' says Dr Sajjad Rajpar, consultant dermatologist at the Midland Skin Institute at BMI The Priory Hospital Birmingham and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. 'Options for treating severe scarring include excising or cutting out the scar to renew it and replacing it with a matrix - essentially substances that contain collagen and allow new tissues to grow through them to fill the depth of a burn scar - but this can create more scarring. 'Laser treatment can help reduce the redness in fresh scars, perhaps by reducing the blood vessels, and in some instances help flatten raised scars.' New technology called ReCell sprays the affected area with healthy skin cells, stimulating the growth of new, vibrant skin . Chemical peels can also be used for acne scars, stripping away the damaged layer of skin, which the body replaces with healthy skin. With severe burns, doctors repair the damaged area with a skin graft. However, the cosmetic results can be variable and the grafts can shrink over time. But with a new technology, known as ReCell, a sliver of healthy skin is removed under local anaesthetic. The active cells are scraped off and placed in the ReCell kit, which uses an enzyme to break down the healthy skin so that it can be suspended in a solution. With a syringe, this is then sprayed over the site of the injury, where the cells are stimulated to replicate and create healthy, new skin that can cover an area up to 80 times the size of the donor patch. ReCell allows for rapid healing by providing the right mix of cells for it to happen. One study, published in the journal Burns, which compared ReCell and skin grafting for partial-thickness burns (where the epidermis and dermis are damaged) found similar results for both methods. Although skin grafting was quicker, it caused more pain in the area where the grafting patch was taken from and was more invasive, said the researchers. A trial is to start at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge using ReCell to treat leg ulcers. Alison Portass had the treatment in August 2011. 'After years of not feeling my best, I . finally feel happy with my body again. I'm amazed such a painless . treatment could make such a difference.' First, she was given a local anaesthetic in her thigh and then, using a scalpel, the surgeon removed a postage-stamp sized patch, about 1-2mm thick. Healthy skin cells were scraped off the patch and made into a solution. The surgeon then lasered the damaged scar tissue, and put the solution of healthy skin cells across the long scar, before covering the area with a light dressing. When Alison's dressing came off a week after the treatment, a thin layer of healthy skin was growing. Over the next year, it thickened gradually. As she recalls: 'The scar was changing day by day. It was less lumpy, and instead of being angry and red it was fading, and it looked almost like my normal skin - just a tad darker.' Within 12 months it was barely visible, and the following year, Alison wore a bikini on holiday. 'After years of not feeling my best, I finally feel happy with my body again. I'm amazed such a painless treatment could make such a difference.' As Zahida Butt, a cosmetic surgeon at the Norwich Cosmetic Clinic where Alison had the treatment, explains: 'ReCell is very exciting because it means we can create new healthy skin. It can be done immediately, and is more cost effective than other methods. 'Furthermore, those with severe burns need treatment immediately and there is a delay in transporting skin from labs. 'When the skin comes from another person, there is a risk of rejection. And over time, a skin graft will contract as a person grows, whereas ReCell cells divide and grow with the body.' ReCell is currently being used on the NHS for burns at  centres including Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London. It is also available privately for other conditions.","New treatment ReCell sprays healthy skin cells over the site of injury .

"From a curved design to faster processors, Samsung has been teasing upcoming features of its next Galaxy phone for weeks. Now, a pair of designers has created what they believed the handsets will look like, based on the latest leaks. Samsung is set to unveil the handset in Barcelona on March 1st. Scroll down for video . The Galaxy Edge will have curved screens on each side, and the Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. Created by designes Ivo Marić and Jermaine Smit, the new renders show both expected versions - a standard one and an 'Edge' with both sides having curved displays. Both phones are also expected to have all-metal bodies, in a move away from Samsung's current plastic range, and 5.1-inch screens. The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. And the curved screen has already been used in Samsung's Galaxy Note Edge. However, the S6 Edge will have the ability to work in a left or right-handed mode . Users will have an option to choose favourite contacts and an ability to assign specific colours to them. Both phones are also expected to have all-metal bodies, in a move away from Samsung's current plastic range, and 5.1-inch screens. The handsets are also set to include wireless charging capabilities. And now the Korean firm has heavily implied the device - or multiple new devices - will come with wireless charging built-in. Many current phones need specially-designed cases and accessories to charge wirelessly, but Samsung's next-generation models could add the feature within the handset on a single chip. In a blog post by Seho Park, principal engineer in Samsung Electronics' IT and mobile division wrote: '2015 will be a landmark year for the growth of wireless charging. The S6 is expected to look similar to Apple's iPhone 6 handset . It will also include a rumoured 20 megapixel camera . Previous leaks said the Galaxy S6 will feature a Quad HD 5.5-inch display. Other reports claim the screen will measure a smaller 5.1 inches. It is expected to have an octa-core processor and 16MP rear-facing camera. More recent rumours suggest the firm will also unveil an Edge version of its flagship phone. The S6 Edge is said to have a curved screen that covers both sides. The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. And the curved screen has already been used in Samsung's Note Edge. However, the S6 Edge will have the ability to work in a left or right handed mode. The use of the plural  'smartphones' in Samsung's latest blog post adds weight to these claims. Elsewhere, this post heavily implies the devices will have wireless charging built in. Both handsets are expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress on 1 March. 'With our upcoming Galaxy smartphones, users will be able to enter a new wireless world like never before.' The use of the plural 'smartphones' adds further weight to the fact Samsung will unveil at least two handsets at this year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March. These are expected to be the Samsung Galaxy S6, and the S6 Edge that is rumoured to have a curved screen that covers both sides. Until now, many phones and other products have predominantly used the 'magnetic-inductive' method of charging. This involves pairing a device with a dock and is used from phones to electric toothbrushes and shavers. There are three wireless charging organisations including the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), and its Qi standard, the Power Matters Alliance (PMA) and the Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP). Samsung is a member of all three groups. This means that manufacturers have to choose which standard they use, and not every standard is supported across different charging points, for example. However, last year, components that support multiple standards on a single chip were released and in January, the PMA and A4WP announced they would join forces to offer better wireless charging features. The S6 won't be the first phone to have wireless charging built in - the Nokia Lumia 920 already offers this feature - but the Lumia 920 runs on the Qi standard.

It will also beat main rival Apple to introducing the technology. Samsung surprised audiences at the Berlin-based trade show IFA in September when it unveiled its original curved device. The screen was described by Samsung's David Park at the event as working like a 'ticker', with notifications and news scrolling along it. The Galaxy Note Edge's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts. The curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom, while viewing a video without disruption, for example. Earlier this month, in the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year. Instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better. The South Korean manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply. The use of the plural 'smartphones' in the blog post adds further weight to the fact Samsung will unveil at least two handsets at this year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March. Samsung's invite (pictured) hints at a curved device and the firm is expected to announced the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge . The strategy was unveiled during a presentation in New York by Samsung's head of investor relations, Robert Yi. He said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third. Executives at the South Korean firm said it would overhaul its lower-tier line-up to boost price competitiveness, and use higher-quality components to set its devices apart. 'The mid-to-low end market is growing rapidly, and we plan to respond actively in order to capitalise on that growth,' said Samsung Senior Vice President Kim Hyun-joon during a conference call with analysts. In a rare acknowledgement, Mr Yi added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions. The company's response 'was not quick enough,' said Mr Yi. Both phones are expected to have all-metal bodies, in a move away from Samsung's current plastic range, and 5.1-inch screens. The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. And the curved screen has already been used in Samsung's Note Edge (pictured)","Designs show off Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge with screens on both sides .

"British mathematician Alan Turing is famed for designing the machines that cracked German military codes in the Second World War and for pioneering artificial intelligence. But one of his lesser known theories saw him turn his hand to mathematical biology - and the conclusion he came to  has just been proven. In 1952 he published a paper that offered a theory on the mathematics of patterns including zebra stripes and ridges on sand dunes - and his theory even explained how human fingers formed. Scroll down for video . Like strips and dots in many animals, fingers can be considered as patterns. Alan Turing's model, first published in 1952, suggested that the development of limbs while humans were in the womb could be explained using mathematics, a theory that has now been proven by modern researchers . Turing, who died in 1954, discovered that a system with just two molecules could, in theory, create spotty or stripy patterns if they diffused and chemically interacted in just the right way. His mathematical equations showed that starting from a system with no pattern the molecules could spontaneously self-organise their concentrations into a repetitive spatial pattern. This theory has come to be accepted as an explanation of fairly simple patterns such as zebra stripes and even the ridges on sand dunes, but it can also explain how structures such as fingers are formed when a human is in the womb. Now a group of researchers from the Multicellular Systems Biology lab at the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) in Barcelona has provided the long sought-for data which confirms that fingers and toes are patterned by this Turing mechanism. The approach taken was that of systems biology - combining experimental work with computational modelling. Their model predicted how the pattern of fingers should change during the development of a human, explaining how molecules align to produce certain organs based on Turing's theory. When the same experiments were done on small pieces of limb bud tissue - structures formed in early limb development - cultured in a petri dish the same alterations in finger pattern were observed, confirming the computational prediction. This result answers a long-standing question in the field, but it has consequences that go beyond the development of fingers. It addresses a more general debate about how the millions of cells in our bodies are able to dynamically arrange themselves into the correct 3D structures, for example in our kidneys, hearts and other organs. On 8 June 1954, Turing's cleaner found him dead. A post-mortem examination established the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide, and he was cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June. Several scholars, and even his family, have suggested Turing's death was not suicide - and instead either an accident or linked to a conspiracy. When his body was discovered, an apple laid half-eaten next to his bed. It was never tested for cyanide but it is speculated it was the source of the fatal dose. Some more peculiar theories suggest Turing was 'obsessed' with fairytale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and his death was inspired by the poison apple in the story. The theory was supported in an article in The Guardian written by Turing's friend, the author Alan Garner, in 2011. However, later evidence suggested that Turing habitually ate an apple before bed, and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half-eaten. His mother is said to have thought the ingestion was accidental, cause by her son's storage of chemicals in his home. Speaking on the 100th anniversary of Alan Turing's birth on 23rd June 2012, Professor of Philosophy Jack Copeland, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand, questioned the evidence given to the inquiry in 1954. He said there was no evidence of premeditation - there was no suicide note and he seemed to be in a cheerful mood in the days leading up to his death. He added that Turing's career was at an all time high and that he would not want to intentionally kill himself. He pointed out that his friend Robin Gandy stayed with Turing a week before his death and he remarked how happy Turing seemed. Finally, the academic remarked that the inquest was so bad that Turing could even have been murdered. Although it is is unclear who would have wanted to murder him Mr Copeland said his work at Bletchly Park was under strict secrecy until well after his death. On the left is an illustration showing how molecules can align in certain patterns to produce limbs such as fingers, as predict by British mathematician Alan Turing (right) in 1952 . Turing's theory also challenges the dominance of an important traditional idea called positional information, which states that cells know what to do because they all receive information about their 'coordinates' in space (a bit like longitude and latitude on a world map). The research highlights instead that local self-organising mechanisms may be much more important in the development of organs than previously thought. Arriving at the correct understanding of multicellular organisation is essential to develop effective strategies for regenerative medicine, and one day to possibly engineer replacement tissues for various organs. In the shorter term, these results also explain why polydactyly -the development of extra fingers or toes - is such a common birth defect in humans; Turing systems are mathematically known to have slightly lower precision in regulating the number of 'stripes' than alternative models. At first glance, the question of how an embryo develops seems unrelated to the problems of computing and algorithms with which Turing is more commonly associated. In reality however, they were both expressions of his interest in how complex and clever biological 'machines' arise in nature. In a sense, he sought the algorithms by which life builds itself. It is perhaps fitting that this study, which has confirmed Turing's 62 year-old theory on embryology, required the development of a serious computer model. It brings together two of his major life achievements into one result.","Researchers in Barcelona confirm British mathematician's 62-year-old theory .

"A 23-year-old man has spoken of his horror at needing a new bladder at just 17 after snorting ketamine. Chris, from Hampshire, began using drugs when he was just 12 years old and his cannabis use quickly spiralled to hard drug abuse. He began taking ketamine at 16 and within just a year, he had taken so much that he had caused irreversible damage to his body. Old before his time: Chris needed a new bladder at just 17 after snorting ketamine excessively. He began using drugs when he was 12, his cannabis use quickly spiralling to hard drugs. He began taking ketamine at 16 and within just a year, he had taken so much that he had caused irreversible damage to his body . Ketamine is known for shrinking and scarring the bladder - and Chris'  had shrunk to the size normally seen in a pensioner. At just 17, he needed to have his bladder removed and a new one made from his bowel - or face a life of incontinence. Chris is one of several young people featured in a BBC3 documentary airing tonight. Called Old Before My Time, presenter Cherry Healey follows people who have ailments typically seen in pensioners because of drug abuse. Although he has a new bladder, he is by no means free of health problems . Every two weeks he must insert a catheter - a thin, flexible tube - into his belly button and syringe out mucus sitting in his bladder. Chris went to see a specialist who gave him shocking news - his bladder had shrunk to a fraction of its normal size - and was smaller than a pensioner's. A normal bladder can hold up to 500ml - but Chris' could hold just 5ml . Viewers see the stomach-turning moment where the mucus fills the syringe attached to the tube in his stomach – a far cry from the hard core raver he once was just a few years ago. Ketamine use in the UK has doubled since 2006 – around the time Chris began taking it. In the documentary, he explains: ‘I started taking drugs when I was 12 – starting with cannabis and gradually working up to heavier things. ‘When I started taking K I took a gram a night, but before long, as I was taking 10-15g a night – I had a wicked time.’ But within months, his body began to object violently to his drug abuse. At just 17, he needed to have his bladder removed and a new one made from his bowel - or face a life of incontinence . Although he has a new bowel, he is by no means free of health problems. Every two weeks he has to insert a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) into his belly button and syringe out mucus sitting in his bladder . ‘I was at a party, tried to go to the loo and it was really painful. Then a big lump of goo came out – blood, mess… it as horrible.’ Chris went to see a specialist who gave him shocking news – his bladder had shrunk to a fraction of its normal size - and was smaller than a pensioner’s. A normal bladder can hold up to 500ml – but Chris' could hold just 5ml. Normally, the bladder wall expands when filled with urine and contracts when emptied. But extreme ketamine use can cause stiffness and scarring in the bladder walls which means it can only expand to a tenth of its normal size. While the bowel material can act as a bladder, it is probe to collecting mucus that must be washed out . Viewers see the stomach-turning moment where the mucus fills the syringe attached to the tube in his stomach - a far cry from the hard core raver he once was just a few years ago . To avoid a lifetime of incontinence, Chris had two options. He could have a bag attached to his hip – or have his bladder removed totally and a new one made from his bowel – surgery typical in someone 60 or 70 years of age. He went for the latter – but must now syringe mucus out of his bladder for every two weeks of his life. His days of playing rugby are over and he is at risk of dangerous kidney infections. His new bladder won’t forever, either – he will need it replacing again in 20-30 years. But ketamine doesn’t just cause physical problems such as Chris' – it can severely affect the brain, too. The documentary also follows 29-year-old Dave, who has been using ketamine for eight years. He . has noticed a disturbing deterioration in his memory – to the point . where he can walk into a room 10 times and not remember why he is there. The documentary also follows 29-year-old Dave, who has been using ketamine for eight years. He has noticed a disturbing deterioration in his memory - to the point where he can walk into a room 10 times and not remember why he is there . Ketamine blocks receptors in the brain that are important for how we learn and respond to new experiences. These receptors are hugely concentrated in the areas critical for memory – the hippocampus – and people who take a lot of the drug can have memory problems as bad as the early stages of dementia. Like Chris, Dave began taking ketamine at raves – but he soon became addicted. In memory tests conducted during the documentary, Dave struggles with basic recall tasks such as naming words that begin with the letter F – or thinking of different types of fruit. Professor Val Curren explains that ketamine users often have problems recalling names, words and conversations – all common signs of dementia in old people not someone in their twenties. Dave vows to stop taking the drug – claiming he is now only using it once a month. If he doesn’t, the tests show his memory will only get worse and worse.","Chris, now 23, began smoking cannabis when he was just 12 years old .

"This is the heart-wrenching moment a dying wife renewed her wedding vows in a moving ceremony on her 60th wedding anniversary - with just days left to live. Brave Janet Jones, 79, was diagnosed with terminal cancer earlier this year but vowed to stay alive long enough to see her diamond wedding anniversary. And yesterday her dying wish was realised as she renewed her vows with beloved husband Gethin, 85, at Compton Hospice in Wolverhampton. Terminally ill Janet Jones and her husband, Gethin Jones, lock lips, after renewing their wedding vows while surrounded by friends and family, at a ceremony at Compton Hospice, Wolverhampton . Mrs Jones said her husband had always been 'so kind to me' and she couldn't imagine her life without him . Close friends and family members all attended the ceremony 60 years to the day that the couple first tied the knot in 1954. Pictures taken at the service show the couple still very much in love, holding hands and cuddling one another. Others show a frail Mrs Jones grinning from a hospice chair. Mrs Jones said her life now feels 'complete' after defiantly vowing she 'wasn't going anywhere' until she had celebrated her wedding anniversary. She said: 'They can keep knocking that door, but I said I am not going anywhere until I have seen our diamond wedding anniversary. The Jones', with long hair and wrinkle free faces, pose for pictures on their wedding day on June 26, 1954 . 'And depending how I feel, I might even stay a few days longer. I now feel my life is complete. 'If the good Lord will give me a little more time to tell everybody how much I love them. 'I would very much like that, but if not, I will thank him for the time he has given me with Gethin. 'He has always been so kind to me and has always looked after me. 'I've loved every second with Gethin, I can't imagine having my life without him. Mrs Jones threw a custard pie in the face of another female suitor at a dance they met at in the West Midlands . 'I know the time will come soon when I am away from Gethin for a bit, and I know he will miss me. 'But I know one day we will all be back together again.' The pair met at a dance in Willenhall, West Midlands, and got married at St Anne's Church in the town on June 26, 1954. They didn't have any children and devoted their lives to running a baby clothing shop in the town. Mrs and Mrs Jones share a cuddle after the ceremony, left, and looking at the programme during the service . Speaking about how they first met, Mrs Jones told how she threw a custard pie in the face of another girl who was eyeing up her husband-to-be. She said: 'There was another girl, Hazel, who had eyes for him. 'I told her to stay away because I wanted him, but she said 'We'll see about that'. Mrs Jones then left the room and brought a large custard pie. When she returned she asked Hazel if she liked the desert, and she replied 'yes'. Mrs Jones said: 'Then I splattered the pie in her face and said 'Well try that one for size and don't come back here again'. 'Later my Gethin told me I needn't have worried because I was his light and shining star and that I was the one he wanted, and no one else.' Mrs Jones has asked her nephew Ralph and his wife Lynn to keep her ashes until her husband's death. She said: 'When my Gethin is ready to come to me, they are going to put our ashes together and take them to Barmouth where we loved to go.

"Spy network: CCTV cameras are linked to TrapWire, a U.S. system designed to catch terrorists . Anyone who takes a photograph at high-risk locations is logged as a suspected terrorist on a vast network of secret spy cameras linked to the U.S. Government, according to leaked emails. People pointing cameras in New York are regarded as suspicious and the facial recognition images of them from the civilian CCTV are fed into a data centre run by U.S. firm Abraxas. The system then connects with hundreds of other cameras in a bid to pinpoint potential terrorist activity, it is claimed. Details of the system emerged from emails released by whistle-blowing website Wikileaks. The issue has caused outrage among privacy campaigners amid fears that it could be abused. It has disturbing echoes of the film, The Bourne Identity starring Matt Damon, in which CIA officials use a network of spy cameras to track around the world someone they though they had assassinated. According to the email released by Wikileaks, pictures of people's faces are encrypted and sent to a fortified data centre at a secret location. The TrapWire system is linked to civilian CCTV cameras. TrapWire is used by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in a bid to deter terrorist attacks - or catch those responsible once an incident has happened. According to the company's own documents from 2007, TrapWire is 'a unique, predictive software system designed to detect patterns of per-attack surveillance.' This includes 'photographing, measuring and signaling'. More than 500 cameras using the technology have been installed on the New York subway. There are estimated to be thousands more around various U.S. cities and in London at potential terrorist targets such as Downing Street. Disturbing: Matt Damon in The Bourne Identity. CIA officials use a network of spy cameras to track his movements, just like TrapWire devices are said to be doing with suspected terrorists . The firm also operates in several other U.S. states, in Canada and in London. It is said to have cameras also placed at high rick targets in the UK, including Downing Street. An . email from an employee at Strator - a Texas-based intelligence firm . linked to Trapwire - in 2010 said the cameras were focused on . 'per-operational terrorist surveillance'. It . stated: 'This week, 500 surveillance cameras were activated on the NYC . subway system to focus on per-operational terrorist surveillance. The . surveillance technology is also operational on high-value targets (HVTs) in DC, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and London and is called TrapWire. Surveillance: Five hundreds of the TrapWire cameras have been installed in the New York subway, according to an email from the firm released by Wikileaks . Terrorist target: TrapWire cameras are also in use at Ten Downing Street, home of the British Prime Minister, according to another email from the firm behind them (file picture) 'TrapWire is one of the most . innovative tools developed since 9-11 to help mitigate terrorist . threats. From a protective intelligence perspective, TrapWire does have . the ability to share information on suspicious events or suspects . between cities.' Trapwire is a security system that uses CCTV cameras to relay encrypted images of people to a data centre. These are then compared with images from various other cameras to track suspicious activity. The system was developed by security intelligence firm Abraxas Applications now known as Trapwire Inc. The system is linked to a separate company Stratfor, which sent emails between staff discussing the system. When these emails became public through Wikileaks, they revealed details of the Trapwire spy network. The people behind Trapwire are understood to be former high-ranking CIA and intelligence officials. The Trapwire website describes it as a 'unique, predictive software system designed to detect patterns indicative of terrorist attacks or criminal operations'. In another email, Stratfor president . Don Kuykendall wrote: 'Their clients include Scotland Yard, #10 Downing, . the White House and many [business]. 'Our consideration is introducing them to companies like Walmart, Dell and others.' In . a separate email, vice president Fred Burton wrote: 'Salesforce HQs in . San Fran is interested in TrapWire after I briefed them on their . wonderful capabilities'. The emails have caused uproar among activists who believe that the use of the cameras is an infringement on people's freedom. After the emails were released, WikiLeaks said it has been the victim of a sustained denial-of-service attack which has left its website sluggish or inaccessible for more than a week. In a statement released late Saturday the group said the assault intensified around the beginning of August and has since expanded to include attacks against affiliated sites. Denial-of-service attacks work by overwhelming websites with requests for information. WikiLeaks has said it's been flooded with 10 gigabits per second of bogus traffic from thousands of different Internet addresses. Josh Corman, with online content delivery company Akamai, characterized that as 'a bit larger' than attacks commonly seen in the past few years. WikiLeaks, which has angered officials in Washington with its spectacular releases of classified U.S. documents, remained inaccessible Sunday.","Cameras use facial recognition to log people's activity .

"Napoleon Bonaparte’s mysterious death has generated a host of murder conspiracy theories over the years. And now a large piece of wallpaper from the Emperor’s bedroom is up for auction, which could prove whether he was murdered by the British. The French emperor mysteriously died while in British custody on the South Atlantic island of St Helena on May 5, 1821 at the age of 51. Deadly? The book is bound in wallpaper from the bedroom of Longwood House, St Helena, where Napoleon Bonaparte died. Since his death, it has been suggested that he died from cancer or was poisoned by British soldiers. A third theory says he died after inhaling toxic vapours from wallpaper which was laced with arsenic . Since his death, it has been suggested that he died from cancer or was poisoned by British soldiers. A third theory says he died after inhaling toxic vapours from wallpaper which was laced with arsenic. Napoleon (pictured) became the Emperor of France in 1804 and secured a streak of victories in war, cementing the countries place as a dominant force in Europe . The largest piece of the patterned paper is around the same size as a piece of A3 paper and is expected to fetch £2,000 when it goes to auction on March 18. Richard Westwood-Brookes, a documents expert at Mullock Auctioneers in Shropshire, believes the item could finally solve the mystery of Napoleon’s death. ‘I have estimated it at £2,000 although it could easily go for more considering the other two items went for near that figure and were a lot smaller,’ he said. ‘It is the biggest piece ever found and is extremely rare. Everything that has been sold in the past have been tiny, this is the size of an A3 piece of paper.’ Explaining how the sizeable scrap of wallpaper came to be liberated from the Emperor’s bedroom, Mr Westwood-Brookes explained: ‘When Napoleon died, the place was full of British soldiers and after he died, they obviously decided to take things from his bedroom. ‘I would assume this was to bring home as souvenirs, many of them took small pieces of wall paper, but this is a huge bit. The inside of the book reads: 'The paper covering this scrapbook and formings is binding was taken from the bedroom of Buonaparte and once decorated its walls at Longwood in the Island of St Helena. June AD 1813' ‘It is of exceptional rarity due to the rumours of him being killed by it. ‘It would give a researcher ample amounts of specimens to be able to test it.’ Despite the possibility of the wallpaper containing traces of arsenic it is not thought it will pose a threat to potential buyers. Mr Westwood-Brookes said: ‘The piece of wallpaper is in excellent condition considering how fragile it is and how old it is. ‘The family who are selling it are of a fairly high status, that is all I can say, and they have clearly looked after it. ‘This would obviously make the piece more valuable and easier for a researcher to do tests on it. It is estimated that the book will fetch £2,000 at auction although it could go for more considering the other two items with traces of the wallpaper went for near that figure and were a lot smaller . ‘I wouldn’t like to say how Napoleon died, it is unfair to speculate, but if it was from this wallpaper, I am sure we will be able to find out very soon.’ Napoleon became the Emperor of France in 1804 and secured a streak of victories in war, cementing the country’s place as a dominant force in Europe. However, during the Peninsular war between 1807 and 1814, he decided to invade Russia, which showed France’s military frailties. He was forced to abdicate and go into exile to the Italian island of Elba in 1814, before escaping a year later and returning to power. Napoleon was finally defeated by the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815 and spent the last six years of his life in confinement by the British at Saint Helena. The piece of wallpaper will be auctioned at Ludlow Racecourse in Shropshire on March 18. Napoleon Bonaparte, the French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the latter stages of the French Revolution, was born in August 1769 and died on May 5 1821. The Emperor was said to have died from stomach cancer. The physician who led the autopsy found evidence of a stomach ulcer but some people said it was the most convenient explanation for the British, who wanted to avoid criticism over their care of the Emperor. Napoleon's father died of stomach cancer. In 1955 the diaries of the leader's valet were published, which included the description of bed-bound Napoleon months before his death. Based on the description, scientists put forward other theories as to why he died - which included arsenic poisoning. Arsenic was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period. It was noted in a later book that Napoleon's body was found to be remarkably well preserved when moved in 1840 and arsenic is a preservative. In 2007 a toxicologist said he found mineral arsenic in napoleon's hair shafts, which supported the theory that he was murdered. The wallpaper used in Longwood contained a high level of arsenic compound used by British manufacturers as a dye. It has been suspected that if the wallpaper got hot it might have emitted the poisonous gas arsine, but other scientists think the poison would have had to be consumed internally - or that the leader really did die of cancer.","Large piece of wallpaper from his bedroom could prove whether he was murdered by the .

"Law enforcement officials in Los Angeles have confirmed that they are in possession of a video that shows Bruce Jenner was responsible for starting a chain-reaction crash that resulted in a woman's death on a Malibu highway earlier this month. Jenner was hauling an off-road vehicle on a trailer behind his Cadillac Escalade on February 7 when he steered to avoid cars slowing for a traffic light in front of him on Pacific Coast Highway. Jenner's SUV rear-ended two cars, pushing a white Lexus into oncoming traffic, the official said. The driver, Kim Howe, 69, was killed when it was struck head-on by a Hummer. Scroll down for video . Law enforcement officials have confirmed they are in possession of a video that shows Bruce Jenner was responsible for starting a chain-reaction crash that resulted in a woman's death earlier this month . The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department is investigating the cause of the wreck and will consider whether to issue a citation that could result in criminal charges - possibly vehicular manslaughter. The official briefed on the video was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on Wednesday on condition of anonymity. The official said the video taken by cameras on an MTA bus in the area showed Jenner's vehicle continued forward and rear-ended a Toyota Prius. Officials initially said the victim's white Lexus had struck the Prius. Most significantly  the video shows that the Lexus driver didn’t make contact with the Prius involved, reports TMZ. A video showing a possible recreation of the accident has been created by Integral Media Works. Investigators have sought cellphone records to see if any drivers were distracted, but the video appears to show that Jenner was not using his phone. His publicist, Alan Nierob, has said Jenner was not texting and is cooperating with investigators. Jenner was hauling an off-road vehicle on a trailer behind his Cadillac Escalade on February 7 when he steered to avoid cars slowing for a traffic light in front of him on Pacific Coast Highway . Jenner's SUV rear-ended two cars, pushing a white Lexus into oncoming traffic, the official said. The driver, Kim Howe, 69, was killed when it was struck head-on by a Hummer . A video showing a possible recreation of the accident has been created by Integral Media Works . The video shows Jenner rear-end the Lexus and when the Lexus clears his lane, his SUV keeps moving and crashes into the Prius . The MTA video is alleged to show that Jenner hits the Lexus, propelling it into a Hummer coming the other way. Jenner then continues on and hits the Prius . According to earlier reports, the Lexus had been in Jenner's path after coming to a halt when it hit a Prius travelling ahead. The Lexus was then pushed into the path of a Hummer coming the other way, leaving the vehicle a crumpled wreck and the sole occupant, 69-year-old Kim Howe, dead. The Kardashian family patriarch, who escaped the crash unscathed, took a roadside sobriety test in front of officers in the wake of the collision, which he passed. This latest evidence suggests that rather than the chain reaction being caused by the victim's Lexus hitting the Prius in front of her, Jenner may have hit both cars, claims TMZ. Law enforcement sources told the celebrity news site that one operating theory is that the Prius had been stopped behind cars and, as a traffic light turned green, vehicles began moving. It was at this point, sources say, that Jenner rear-ended the Lexus and when the Lexus cleared his lane, his car kept moving and crashed into the Prius. TMZ reported that police say when Jenner hit the Lexus, it veered left while his Escalade moved to the right. Detectives in Malibu have opened a vehicular homicide investigation. If any of the drivers in the crash are found criminally negligent, felony charges could be filed - which carry a sentence of up to six years in prison. Jenner's Cadillac Escalade hit the back of the victim's white Lexus on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, which caused a chain reaction that resulted in the luxury sedan veering into oncoming traffic . An aerial view of the crash scene on February 7 shows the damaged cars, and police markings as they work to investigate the cause . If it is determined that Jenner's Escalade struck both cars and authorities find he was following too closely, it would make prosecution for vehicular manslaughter more likely than if he was just part of the chain reaction, TMZ claims. Investigations will determine if Jenner, or any of the other three drivers involved in the collision, were texting or on their mobile phones at the time of the collision. It is illegal to text while driving in California. The star's representative has denied that he was texting behind the wheel. Breaking his silence on the crash the following day, Jenner said in a statement: 'My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident.' 'It is a devastating tragedy, and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.' But three days after the crash, Jenner was seen talking on his phone while driving in Los Angeles. The reality star had the device pressed to his ear while behind the wheel in Thousand Oaks, California. Bruce married Kris Jenner, pictured together,  in 1991, but their divorce is expected to be finalized next month .","Cops have confirmed that they are in possession of video that shows Jenner was responsible for chain-reaction crash that resulted in a woman's death .

"Fierce: Russian President Vladimir Putin, 62, spoke fiercely against the West in a speech Friday . Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the United States Friday of trying to 'remake the whole world' based on its own interests and imposing a 'unilateral diktat' on the rest of the world. Putin spoke fiercely against the West and referred to the U.S. as the 'so-called winners of the Cold War' in a 40-minute diatribe Friday where he denied trying to rebuild the Soviet empire at the expense of Russia's neighbors. 'Statements that Russia is trying to reinstate some sort of empire,' Putin said, 'that it is encroaching on the sovereignty of its neighbors, are groundless.' Putin spoke to a group of political scholars known as the Valdai Club, which reportedly included Western specialists critical of him, at an annual meeting in a resort above the Black Sea city of Sochi. Putin faulted the U.S.'s actions in conflicts including, Syria, Iraq, and Libya and said that Washington's policies do not strengthen peace and democracy. Putin said that the U.S.'s 'unilateral diktat' and 'imposing of schemes' weaken both peace and democracy. Putin also accused the U.S. of trying to cast Russia in a negative light, leading people to view Russia as a danger to the rest o the world. However, Putin warns that the U.S. has made the world a dangerous place with its approach to global affairs. Scroll down for video .

Putin returned to the Kremlin in 2012, and the 62-year-old president has since increasingly pushed his anti-Western views as evidenced by his harsh speech. The speech has been called the most hostile speech Putin has given against the West and it is believed that the fiercity of his words were an effort to show Russion voters his eagerness to defend their interests. The criticism of the U.S. at the meeting included repeated accusations that Western governements aided pro-Western groups in staging a coup to throw a pro-Moscow leader out of office rather than a more civilized solution. 'Instead of a difficult but, I underline, civilized dialogue they brought about a state coup,' Putin said about Western governments.

"Alec Stewart says he reported to the England and Wales Cricket Board that he had been told Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann all had access to a parody Kevin Pietersen Twitter account. Stewart made the claims on Wednesday night, saying he was told by the account's owner, Richard Bailey, at a Test match in 2012. The 'KPgenius' account is a prominent topic in Pietersen's autobiography, published this week. Pietersen cites the account as one example of a culture of 'bullying' inside the England dressing room. Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann are among three ECB players said to have had access to parody account . Kevin Pietersen claims there was a bullying culture inside the England camp . Bailey is a cricket fan and a friend of Broad, but has always maintained he ran the account alone with no input from the dressing room, telling the Guardian on Wednesday: 'They 100 per cent did not tweet from it.' Swann used his column in Wednesday's edition of The Sun to refute the claims, insisting that while he did follow it, he did not have a hand in running it. That came after Pietersen's book told a story of Stewart claiming Bailey had confided in him that three members of the England team had access to the account. Angered that his 'integrity' had been questioned by Bailey's denial, Stewart told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'The reason I am prepared to talk about is that he (Bailey) has said he didn't say anything to me and therefore is doubting my integrity and I won't have that. Alec Stewart passed on information he received to the ECB . 'I aren't here to nail Pietersen, Broad, Swann, Bresnan. I'm an ex-England player and an England fan. 'What happened, back in 2012 at the Oval, at the top tier of the OCS Stand at the Vauxhall End of the ground, this gentleman came up and said to me: 'I understand you follow the KPgenius twitter account'. 'I said 'yes, some of it is funny, some of it is close to the bone'. He then said 'that is me', I said 'very good, well done'. He then came back and said, 'can I keep a secret?', I said 'yes, but it depends what you're going to tell me'. 'He said 'I can't tell you' and then walked away. Thirty seconds later he came back and said 'three players have access to the account, they have the password' and he told me the three names. Andy Flower (right) was made aware of the information, says Stewart . 'The names were Bresnan, Broad and Swann and it didn't sit comfortably with me. Not because I wanted them three players to get fined, but it didn't sit comfortably with me if what he was saying was factually correct. 'I then made Hugh Morris, and Andy Flower at a later date, aware of the conversation, passed on that information and left it at that. If the ECB wanted to investigate or ignore, they could. 'I'm not going to doubt what Pietersen, Broad, Swann, or whoever has said but I will guarantree 100 per cent this lad said that to me.' There was no comment from the ECB on Stewart's claims on Wednesday night. Stewart's comments came after Pietersen described the ECB as 'dinosaurs ... shooting themselves in the foot'. Tim Bresnan is the third England player said to have had access to the parody account . The sacked batsman was referring to the emergence on Tuesday night of a leaked document, which appeared to log the ECB's list of his alleged misdemeanours during last winter's descent to Ashes whitewash in Australia. A month after his return, Pietersen was told he would not be picked by England again - bringing an apparent end to his record-breaking but controversial career. As he was promoting his autobiography in a series of interviews, the document - which ECB swiftly made clear was a draft of a private internal email - somehow came into the possession of website Cricinfo. It is unclear how the document reached the public domain but was, in any case, a turn of events which did not impress Pietersen. Pietersen has accused the ECB of shooting themselves in the foot over a leaked document . Speaking before an appearance on BT's The Clare Balding Show, to be broadcast on Thursday, he said in quotes carried on www.cricketworld.com: 'I think there are times in your life where you shoot yourselves in the foot, and I don't think the ECB helped themselves last night. 'It's embarrassing what happened last night. 'When you're dealing with dinosaurs that don't understand social media they are going to shoot themselves in the foot - and they've done it.' Several issues are sure to rear their head again along with plenty of others as Pietersen continues a marathon promotional tour. But the 34-year-old had braced himself for the experience. 'I said to my wife and 'team' last week, 'this week will be carnage - I'll be in the eye of the storm, and it'll happen and then it'll go.'' Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has corroborated Pietersen's claim of bullying . Pietersen's recollection of bullying on the field, often directed by bowlers towards fielders who made mistakes, has been corroborated by former Australia captain Ricky Ponting. He has made it clear in an interview with the Australian press that he too often noticed the intimidating behaviour among his Ashes opponents. Pietersen said: 'You write books like this when you've got evidence to back it up and you've got people who are prepared to back it up. 'I haven't even spoken to Punter [Ricky Ponting]. When I woke up this morning and I saw this, one of the greatest cricketers to have ever played the game, how do you think he views it when he's in the opposition and he's seeing team-mates abuse each other and bully each other on a cricket field? 'How do you reckon it feels for the individuals that are going through it in the dressing room. I've been speaking to the coach about it for years.' 'Six months' time, you never know, there could be a change at the top, I live in hope. And one day I hope to be able to play Test cricket again. If I got the call now, I'd leave your show!'","Stewart was informed three ECB players had access to Twitter account .

"Meet a celebrity, visit the U.S and take a ride in a police car and fire engine - all could feature on the wish list of any nine-year-old. But a closer look at the bucket list compiled by Romeo from British Columbia in Canada, reveals hidden clues to his identity. 'Get a pawicure' and 'take a trip to the first park where I first had walkies', are the dreams of the boxer dog seen through the eyes of his owner, Riina Cooke, 32. Romeo was diagnosed with inoperable bone cancer by vets. These pictures reveal the poorly pet pooch ticking off all 22 entries dreamt up by Ms Cooke for her treasured dog and best friend. Romeo, the nine-year-old boxer, was diagnosed with inoperable bone cancer late last year. Determined to make the most of his last few days, his owner Riina Cooke, decided to compile his very own Bucket List . The last of the nine-year-old boxer's adventures was to visit the U.S. Miss Cooke, 32, from British Columbia in Canada was devastated to learn her beloved companion was terminally ill, but vowed to enjoy a string of adventures with her pet pooch . On his ninth and final birthday, Romeo was treated to a 'pawicure' Ticking off wish number three, Romeo is pictured in the pub sharing a beer with his dad . Wish number 20 completed - to celebrate Valentine's Day and find love . Miss Cooke was so upset to hear the cancer diagnosis that she decided to fill Romeo's last four months with 'happy memories and adventures'. She said: 'I was just so upset for the first few days, I needed to do something to occupy my mind. 'Osteacarcoma is not treatable. The only treatment is amputation and the rest of his body isn't strong enough as he was too old. 'I . decided to put together a list of fun thing for us to do together, for . example, riding a police car and fire engine, having a steak dinner, . professional massage, try sushi and to go on a blind date with another . boxer. 'We were able to complete them all and Romeo even visited the USA.' To mark Romeo's ninth birthday, Miss Cooke arranged for him to be taken to a dog spa, where he was pampered and enjoyed a 'pawicure'. 1. Trip to the first park where he had walkies . 2.

Find myself a Valentines . 21. Have lots of doggy treats . 22. Visit the USA . Woolfing down his birthday cake, Romeo was treated to a birthday party by owner Miss Cooke . Miss Cooke said the bucket list gave her precious memories of Romeo. She said: 'It gave my dog the chance to experience things most will never get chance to. I enjoyed spending so much time with him, I loved seeing him really happy' Miss Cooke treated the nine-year-old boxer to trying Sushi before he passed away on March 16 . In the months since he was diagnosed, he managed to complete all 22 of the dreams on his wish list, including taking a ride in a police car . And the poorly pooch added another of the emergency services to his list, getting the chance to take a ride in a fire engine, even dressing up in fire helmet and boots . Miss Cooke said she was inspired to write the list to make the most of her time left with Romeo, she said: 'I was just so upset for the first few days, I needed to do something to occupy my mind' Miss Cooke said: 'I hope by sharing Romeo's bucket list on Facebook that it will bring light to other people who are going through something similar. 'It gave my dog the chance to experience things most will never get chance to. 'His favourite thing on the bucket list was definitely the steak dinner. 'I enjoyed spending so much time with him, I loved seeing him really happy.' Soon after Romeo and Miss Cooke accomplished wish number 22, to visit the U.S., his condition declined. 'I made the heart breaking decision to put him down as he was in horrendous pain with his back legs,' she said. Despite being petrified of losing her companion, Miss Cooke, who has no children, said she was inspired by a need to make Romeo's last days count. Also on the list Miss Cooke compiled, was treating her best friend Romeo to a hamburger . Indulging in a little relaxation, Romeo is pictured enjoying a doggy massage - wish number 16 . Another 'to do' item, having breakfast in bed, was also ticked off Romeo's final adventures . Miss Cooke said: 'I decided to put together a list of fun thing for us to do together, for example, riding a police car and fire engine, having a steak dinner, professional massage, try sushi and to go on a blind date with another boxer. We were able to complete them all and Romeo even visited the USA' Romeo (left) pictured on a date with fellow boxer dog Pearl (right) Romeo enjoying an ice cream with Miss Cooke and friends . But four months after being diagnosed, vets had to put him to sleep on March 16 - but not before he had ticked everything off the bucket list. She said: 'It was bittersweet, I had to let Romeo go, we had so many great memories together but it wasn't fair to keep him alive when he was in so much pain. 'Everyone loved him, he was such a kind hearted dog.' After years of sharing her home with Romeo, Miss Cooke said she missed his company and has decided to welcome a new pooch, Elvis, into her home in Romeo's memory. She added: 'I'll never forgot Romeo, he will always have a place in my heart, he was like my first child. 'Elvis will grow up knowing how brave his big brother, Romeo, was. 'I will also be documenting his adventures on Facebook too.' Devastated by losing Romeo after vets had to put him to sleep on March 16, Miss Cooke now has a new boxer, Elvis, in Romeo's honour .

"In popular sci-fi films, teleportation allows you to travel between places faster than the time it takes to say 'Beam me up, Scotty'. British physics students believe the reality - even if the technology existed to make it possible - would be somewhat different to how it is depicted in Star Trek. University of Leicester students said teleporting just one person off the surface of the Earth to a waiting spacecraft would take 350,000 times longer than the universe has been in existence. University of Leicester students said teleporting just one person - such as Captain Kirk or Spock (pictured) - off the surface of the Earth would take 350,000 times longer than the universe has been in existence . In 2009's Star Trek, Scotty is able to transport himself and Captain Kirk across space and into a ship travelling at warp speed. In their world teleportation is the preferred way to get around - apart from enormous intergalactic starships. Inspired by sci-fi, the university students set out to find out how long the teleportation of a human from the earth’s surface to a space in circular orbit directly above would take. The answer is a staggeringly long amount of time, which might not be so surprising if you consider the amount of information being transmitted. University students set out to find out how long the teleportation of a human from the Earth¿s surface to a spacecraft in circular orbit directly above would take and the answer is a staggeringly long amount of time. This is in contrast to the scenario seen in episodes of Star trek (pictured) If teleportation technology did exist, a human would need to be distilled into transferable data, right down to DNA, and all of the data making up the brain. The data in the traveller's brain would amount to around 2.6 times 10 to the power of 42 bits. David Starkey, a member of the University of Leicester team, said: 'We decided to investigate the practicalities of teleportation as a means of everyday travel. 'We employed several approximations to determine the amount of data required in bits to fully store a human genetic code and neural information and the signal to noise ratio of typical signalling equipment. If teleportataion technology did exist as pictured, a human would need to be distilled into transferable data, right down to DNA, and all of the data making up the brain. All the data in the traveller's brain, would amount to around 2.6 times 10 to the power of 42 bits . 'Our results indicate the time scales to complete a full teleport of an individual are a little too lengthy at this time. 'Current means of travel remain more feasible,' he joked. The students, all in their final year of a physics masters degree, worked out what it would take to represent a human as transferable data. They found that the energy required to teleport into a person was dependent on bandwidth. The less time it took, the more power was consumed. Assuming a bandwidth of 29.5 to 30 gigahertz, the transfer of Scotty would require up to 4.5 times 10 to the power of 15 years. Beaming someone up to an orbiting spacecraft would therefore take about 350,000 times longer than all the years that have passed since the Big Bang. The universe is thought to be around 14 billion years old. The students found the energy required to teleport a person was dependent on bandwidth.The less time it took, the more power was consumed. Scientists in Australia have previously suggested the travel technique could be realistic engineering proposition, as suggested in this diagram . Huge amounts of power would be needed to beam up the data. The physicists said it would be significantly quicker for Scotty or Spock to walk into Space (it that too were possible). The students concluded that teleportation will only exist in sci-fi for a long time. The findings are published in the University of Leicester's Journal of Physics Special Topics.

"Decision: The clinical drug watchdog Nice has put a ban a drug used to treat men with prostate cancer. Paul Burstow, a Liberal Democrat MP, said the Department of Health must step in . Health ministers are being urged to stop a ban on one of the most popular drugs used to treat men with prostate cancer. The rationing watchdog Nice is poised to make a ‘bizarre’ decision that would needlessly condemn men to hair loss and other unpleasant side effects from chemotherapy, it is claimed. The drug abiraterone can give men with advanced prostate cancer months or even years of relief before they need chemotherapy, but Nice insists chemo must be used first. More than 3,000 men benefited from the drug last year via the Cancer Drugs Fund in England, special funding used for medication not approved for routine NHS use. It was the second most-requested treatment – around one in six total requests – and they were all for use prior to chemotherapy. Paul Burstow, a Liberal Democrat MP, said the Department of Health must step in to halt the plan. The ex-Minister of State in the Department of Health himself intervened when he was in charge two years ago after Nice threatened not to allow the drug to be used at all. As a result Nice did a U-turn and doctors were allowed to give the drug on the NHS after chemo. But advances mean it could now be used earlier in treatment with men having fewer side effects and improved quality of life before needing chemotherapy. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice) says the drug would not be cost-effective at this stage of treatment. Mr Burstow said ‘The idea of restricting the drug so men have to have chemotherapy first, when their hair may fall out and they suffer other side effects, seems bizarre. ‘There is no reason why this drug could not be assessed in the same way as before, giving men added quality of life towards the end of their life.’ The drug abiraterone can give men with advanced prostate cancer months or even years of relief before they need chemotherapy. Pictured, prostate cancer cells. He has written to the current health minister Jane Ellison urging her to act as he did in 2012 to prevent the ban as there would be guarantee it would remain available to patients before chemo and some might not get it all. Campaigners say the latest plan is stark evidence of the neglect of sufferers from a disease that strikes 40,000 British men each year. Some Britons have survived on abiraterone for almost five years. The official price of a month’s treatment is £3,000 but the NHS pays less through a discount scheme from manufacturer Janssen. Cancer Research UK says the plan makes no sense as the drug is likely to be more effective before chemotherapy. Abiraterone, also known as Zytiga, was developed by British scientists. Professor Paul Workman, Deputy Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, where the drug was developed, said: ‘Abiraterone is now used as standard after chemotherapy and has extended the lives of thousands of men in the UK with advanced prostate cancer, with fewer side-effects than chemotherapy. ‘The decision to refuse use of abiraterone before chemotherapy will deny many thousands of men the opportunity to access the drug earlier in their course of treatment.’ Christine Emerson, 61, who lives with her 66-year-old husband Terry in north-west London, says he was fortunate in getting the drug for eight months before he needed chemotherapy. She said ‘It gave him a good quality of life with no side effects at all. It has given him further quality time with his family. ‘He experienced none of the weariness and fatigue that he had with other medications. ‘Abiraterone allowed my husband to live an independent life and it delayed the use of doxetaxel chemotherapy. ‘Once that failed, the tumour in his spine progressed and he is now confined to a wheelchair and also has the debilitating effects of the chemotherapy treatment.’ In 2012, Nice attempted to ban the use of abiraterone altogether but was forced into a U-turn after a public outcry and a rare intervention from the Department of Health. Owen Sharp, Chief Executive of Prostate Cancer UK said ‘It is no secret that we think it deplorable that abiraterone pre-chemotherapy could be denied for use on the NHS in England and Wales. ‘We know first hand from those who have been able to access abiraterone through the cancer drugs fund for use in this way, that it can offer a vital chance to delay chemotherapy and the debilitating side effects which can come with it. ‘We have urged Janssen and NICE to work together to do everything in their power to make this vital treatment available as soon as possible for all who need it. We welcome any intervention which could lead to the right decision being made for men.’ A Department of Health spokesperson said ‘Abiraterone is already available through our Cancer Drugs Fund to prostate cancer patients.’","Abiraterone can give prostate cancer sufferers years of relief before chemo .

"Thousands of patients needing urgent medical treatment could have their conditions diagnosed remotely by doctors using Skype video calls under proposals to close and downgrade Accident and Emergency departments. Under plans seen by The Mail on Sunday, patients suffering from potentially serious symptoms such as chest and abdominal pains, pneumonia and fractures will be sent to walk-in centres to see GPs rather than go to casualty wards. But because the centres are staffed by less qualified medics, advice could come from specialist colleagues at a separate A&E ward using Skype calls. The astonishing proposal is among those being considered by the Shropshire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), which is planning to centralise emergency services in the region. Scroll down for video . The walk-in centres are staffed by less qualified medics, advice could come from specialist colleagues at a separate A&E ward using Skype calls . The plans mean there could be only one A&E department for more than 600,000 people across Shropshire, Telford, Wrekin and Powys. Campaigners warn it is ‘like death is being built into the system’. The draft proposals, contained in official documents lodged within the July board minutes of the CCG, also say: . The proposals are the latest planned cuts to casualty units up and down the country, and come despite a new independent report insisting A&E provision needs to expand to meet rising demand for services. The Mail on Sunday has been fighting for two years to save A&Es from closure. The latest threats mean there are now 18 units across England facing the axe. Gill George, from the Shropshire Defend Our NHS campaign group, said: ‘This is terrifying and means a death sentence for a lot of people. In a rural area, the idea of centralising everything – with already long travel times to get to A&E – is mad. ‘But there’s got to be a clinical risk in diagnosing patients over Skype because you lose so much crucial information if it’s not done in person. It’s scary they’re building risk – and possibly death – into the system.’ The region currently has two A&E departments – at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and at the Princess Royal in Telford, both district general hospitals. The ‘Future Fit’ programme is examining three options – locating a single A&E at either the Royal Shrewsbury or the Princess Royal, or building a new single A&E at a site between Shrewsbury and Telford. This means patients will have up to travel an additional 18 miles – around 30 minutes – for A&E services. The CCG is considering how many UCCs will be needed. David Wright, the Labour MP for Telford, said: ‘Residents are extremely concerned to yet again see a review of A&E at a time of large-scale growth in the town. We want to see full, 24-hour A&E services at our hospital and this process brings massive uncertainty.’ The current A&E service is already under pressure and paramedics were forced to wait eight hours, 11 minutes with patients outside a hospital recently because of a shortage of beds. But the ambulance service is also struggling and was fined £2.6 million after failing to meet strict eight-minute targets to reach seriously ill patients on time – one critically ill six-week-old baby had to wait 41 minutes for paramedics. The plans come as a joint report by the respected Nuffield Trust and Health Foundation found the ‘obvious answer’ to dealing with the A&E crisis ‘might appear to be increasing the capacity of A&E’. A spokesman for Shropshire CCG said: ‘Doctors and health professionals believe one single emergency centre in the area supported by UCCs is the safest way to treat the most seriously ill patients.’","Proposals by Shropshire Clinical Commissioning Group to close and downgrade Accident and Emergency departments .
Patients with potentially serious complaints will be sent to walk-in centres .
Plans mean there could be  one A&E department for more than 600,000 people across Shropshire, Telford, Wrekin and Powys .
A&E could be ‘ambulance only’ – so walk-in patients would be diverted to an Urgent Care Centre (UCC).
Unwell or feverish children would need to go to an UCC rather than A&E – but the report acknowledges that ‘not all GPs and generalists have [the skill set to treat them]’.
Paramedics may have to decide on the scene whether patients need to go to hospital or an UCC. But the report also says studies have found paramedics cannot ‘safely and accurately’ predict this.
Patients who have attempted suicide, are suffering from potentially life-threatening deep vein thrombosis, and children having a wheezing fit would all be brought to UCCs.
UCCs will be dealing with more serious cases, so staff will need specialists on the rota or ‘timely access’ to them via Skype."
"Former England fast bowler Matthew Hoggard has labelled Kevin Pietersen 'a very bitter man' and does not see any way back for the 34-year-old in international cricket. Pietersen, sacked by the England and Wales Cricket Board eight months ago, has been highly critical of some of his former team-mates and former team director Andy Flower in his autobiography, which went on general sale on Thursday. In an interview with the Evening Standard, the 34-year-old claimed he could yet return to international cricket - if ECB chairman Giles Clarke departed the scene - but Hoggard thinks that idea is fanciful. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pietersen calls ECB report 'an embarrassment' Former England fast bowler Matthew Hoggard has labelled Kevin Pietersen 'a very bitter man' 'I think it's a little bit tit for tat,' the Yorkshireman said of this week's war of words. 'I think he's a very bitter man. I think Kevin Pietersen wanted to get rid of Andy Flower when he was the captain as well, so I think there's a little bit of personal vindictiveness in there. 'But man-management is part of the skill of being a good leader and a good coach. If Andy Flower had been lacking and hadn't been able to rein in one of the best England players we've had in recent years, it's a very sad state of affairs.' Asked whether he thought there was a way back into the international fold for Pietersen, Hoggard replied on Sky Sports News: 'No.' 'KP: The Autobiography' includes Pietersen's account of a culture of 'bullying' in the dressing room under Flower's regime and allegedly orchestrated largely by Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann and Matt Prior. Hoggard (second right with Ian Bell, Andrew Flintoff, Pietersen and Simon Jones) at Old Trafford in 2005 . Prior came in for most stinging criticism, tagged the 'schoolyard bully who was also the teacher's pet'. Hoggard defended his former team-mate, saying: 'His nickname is ""The Big Cheese"". He came from Sussex with the name ""The Big Cheese"". 'I've played a lot of cricket with Matt Prior. He's very much a team man, very much wants to win, demands high standards and wants to push everybody. I don't know if he's a bully - he does have high standards and wants everybody to achieve the best they can do.' Former Twenty20 captain Paul Collingwood, speaking at a wine-tasting event at Lord's, struggled to contain his laughter when asked whether he could see Pietersen in an England shirt again. 'I would have thought there'd be no chance after this book's come out, to be honest, but you never know what happens in the future!' he said. 'I'm sure if he got back in the nets and played for a county and scored the runs he'd put the pressure on them. '(But) certainly there's a few people disgruntled with his book, so I can't imagine that'll happen in the near future.' Hoggard vehemently defended Matt Prior, who came in for stinging criticism from Pietersen in the book . Collingwood, who retired from Test cricket in 2011, played down talk of bullying within the England camp, but acknowledged there were 'niggles' and 'discrepancies'. 'I think 'bullying' is probably a very strong word,' he said. 'It's quite disappointing that people are forgetting these times we've had over last seven years have been one of probably most successful times in English cricket. It's been a great era - we've won three Ashes, a Twenty20 World Cup. 'If there was so much going on behind the scenes, I'd be very surprised if you could go on and win all these things. You're always going to have niggles in a team environment. The England team travel around together probably 300 days a year, so you're always going to have behind-the-scenes niggles going on, but in the end the performance on the pitch is what counts. 'You always get discrepancies in the dressing room. How you iron things out is the main thing, and how you move forward. There are times when players go overboard. But as long as you can have a beer with these guys and move forward, all should be good.' He added: 'I wouldn't say KP was the easiest to manage, but he was manageable at the time I played. The last two years I haven't been involved with the dressing room. The sad thing is it looks as though it's all broken up, the relationships in the dressing room.'

"Ukrainians gave decisive backing for a pro-Western future today as election results showed a massive rejection of parties wanting to cosy up to Moscow. The historic parliamentary poll gave the green light to President Petro Poroshenko to seek membership both of the European Union and NATO and he signaled he wanted to begin talks as early as today. With 60 per cent of the vote counted, the three main pro-Western parties alone stood to win 54 per cent of the vote combined. Scroll down for video .

All black everything: A moody looking Yulia Tymoshenko, a former prime minister of Ukraine, casts her vote as her entourage look on . But the result leaves the country more divided than ever, with no vote taking place in pro-Moscow areas of Lugansk and Donetsk, nor in Crimea which was annexed by Vladimir Putin earlier this year. As the results came in heavy shelling erupted near Donetsk, ending a calm period during parliamentary elections. Several dozen Grad multiple rockets could be heard exploding early in the morning in the area of Putilovsky, a Donetsk neighbourhood near the city's ruined airport. Because no voting took place in Lugansk, Donetsk and Crimea, 27 seats will remain empty in the new parliament. Donetsk and Lugansk will vote next week in an unofficial poll likely to bring closer a full-scale separation from Kiev. Yesterday the regions switched their clocks to Moscow time. 'More than three quarters of voters who took part in the polls gave strong and irreversible backing to Ukraine's path to Europe,' said Poroshenko, a 49 year old chocolate baron whose party scored well, giving backing to his peace plan. The president thanked voters for backing a 'democratic, reformist, pro-Ukrainian and Pro-European majority'.

The BBC reported him as saying: 'We have these 10 days when we must create... the best government in Ukraine because no other government will cope with the challenges that the country is facing today.' The partial vote count published today covers only 225 of the 450 seats. Results for constituency seats will not come in for a few days. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk's bloc was the other major pro-Western winner in the polls, gaining 21.6 per cent. President Petro Poroshenko's party had 21.4 percent. A new pro-European party based in western Ukraine was running third with 11 percent. The Fatherland party of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who has argued strongly for NATO membership and is likely to join a pro-Europe coalition, had 5.7 percent of the vote. Strongly nationalist groups - dubbed neo-Nazis by Moscow - performed badly, while no Communists were expected in the new parliament. The remnants of the pro-Moscow party of ousted president Viktor Yanukovych secured around eight per cent of the votes. Yanukovych, was driven from power in February after he refused to sign an agreement on closer ties with the European Union. The ousting prompted separatists to seize government buildings in April, and anger has simmered since. Some candidates were reportedly attacked during the election. The influence of pro-Russian groups looks set to be greatly diminished once the election results are finalised.This reality could fuel fresh tension in the future with Russia which condemned Yanukovich's ousting as a 'fascist' coup and went on to annex Crimea in March and back anti-Kiev rebellions by separatists in the east. At least 3,700 people have been killed since April, 300 of them in clashes between the Ukrainian army and separatists around Donetsk's airport despite a truce being agreed on 5 September. A man receives a ballot from an election commission member during a parliamentary election at a hospital in Izium, eastern Ukraine . The war with pro-Russian rebels in the industrial east and Russia's earlier annexation of the southern Crimean region has cast a dark shadow over the election . Russia had criticised Ukraine's election campaign before the vote but Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said today that Moscow would recognize its outcome. He told Russian media: 'It is very important that in Ukraine, at last, there will be a government that is occupied not with ... the pulling of Ukraine either to the West or to the East, but with the real problems that are facing the country.' President Poroshenko has laid out an ambitious agenda envisioning significant changes to Ukraine's police, justice and tax systems, defence sector and health care - all to be completed by 2020. Among the tougher decisions ahead will be allowing the cost of utilities in the cash-strapped country to float in line with market demands. Anton Karpinsky, a 36-year-old doctor in Kiev, said he was delighted that Ukraine will now have a pro-Western government. He said: 'Our revolution and fight was not in vain. The election shows that Ukraine sees its future in Europe and NATO, and we will get there step by step.' Stepan Burko, a 67-year-old retiree whose $140 monthly pension barely covers his food bills, said difficult times remain ahead despite President Poroshenko's optimism. He said: 'The only certain winners in Ukraine are slogans. But it is much more difficult to overcome poverty and war. 'If it weren't for my children's help, I would go hungry. These are the problems the new authorities should tackle.' Some hoped that a strong government could negotiate an end to the war. Tatyana Rublevskaya, a 48-year-old shopkeeper said: 'The main thing is to put a stop to the war. We are so tired of killings, shelling and weapons.' Darth Vader, previously known as Viktor Shevchenko,  the leader of the Ukrainian Internet Party, waits to receive his ballot papers . Pollsters predict the Ukrainian Internet Party, which also includes a Stepan Chewbacca on its list, has little chance of getting into parliament in today's  vote . The snap election has come eight months after a street revolt overthrew Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovych . Although a low turn out is expected in the east of the country, amid continued fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian seperatists, Ukraine is expected to elect a pro-western parliament in a further move away from Russian influence . The main parties vying for seats are the Poroshenko Bloc, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk's People's Front, Oleh Lyashko's nationalist Radical Party and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko's Fatherland Party . President Poroshenko called the the snap election eight months after a street revolt overthrew Moscow-backed president Yanukovych, sparking conflict with Russia and a crisis between the Kremlin and Ukraine's Western allies. The war with pro-Russian rebels in the industrial east and Russia's earlier annexation of the southern Crimean region has cast a dark shadow over the election. Voters in Crimea and in separatist-controlled areas of the eastern Lugansk and Donetsk provinces were unable to vote. This is around five million of Ukraine's 36.5 million-strong electorate and means 27 seats in the 450-seat parliament will remain empty. The severing of those regions means the once peaceful, but now bloody divide between the mostly Russian-speaking east and Ukrainian-speaking west will take another step toward becoming permanent. Polls show a majority of Ukrainians support economic and democratic reforms - especially a crackdown on corruption - leading eventually to European Union membership. Last night, President Poroshenko promised 'an entirely new parliament' that was 'reforming, not corrupt, pro-Ukrainian and pro-European, not pro-Soviet.' A Moscow-backed truce signed by Kiev and the separatists on September 5 has calmed the worst fighting, although there are daily violations around the largest rebel-held city Donetsk. Insurgent leaders, who are not allowing polling stations to open in their areas, have announced their own leadership vote, which Kiev does not recognise on November 2. President Poroshenko insisted Saturday that there could be 'no military solution' to the conflict. 'No criticism, no matter how acute and painful, will stop me from finding a peaceful way out of the current situation,' he said. Thousands of Polish troops will be moved towards its eastern borders in a historic realignment of a military structure built in the Cold War, the country's defense minister has said. Tomasz Siemoniak said the troops are needed in the east because of the conflict in neighboring Ukraine, saying: 'The geopolitical situation has changed, we have the biggest crisis of security since the Cold War and we must draw conclusions from that.' Mr Siemoniak said that at least three military bases in the east will see their populations increase from the current 30 per cent of capacity to almost 90 per cent by 2017, and that more military hardware will be moved to those bases as well. He said it was not some 'nervous or radical move' but because of this 'situation of threat we would like those units in the east of Poland to be more efficient'. Although Poland joined NATO in 1999, most of its 120,000-member army is based along the country's western border, as a relic of its former status as a Soviet Bloc member. The units in the east, like the air defense unit in Siedlce, have only 30 per cent of jobs filled in line with a plan that calls for 100 per cent of troops 'only in the case of war.'","President Petro Poroshenko signaled he wants to begin pro-Western coalition talks immediately .

"Harry Redknapp’s travelling circus is still going strong. The away days from hell are being offered to Queens Park Rangers fans by a rabble of overpaid, under-performing clowns who are simply not prepared to do their jobs properly for the club, the supporters or their manager. Redknapp deserves better from these shirkers, who dress up and pretend to be footballers when they travel away from Loftus Road this season. Eleven games on the road in the Premier League this season, and 11 defeats. This useless bunch of wannabes even lost at League Two Burton Albion in the Capital One Cup. Joey Barton throws his arms up in the air after QPR's latest miserable outing away from Loftus Road . Barton, pictured in action against Charlie Adam, was responsible for Stoke's third goal at the Britannia . Queens Park Rangers have let Harry Redknapp down this season; he deserves better . Why am I picking on the players and not the manager? Just take a look at the ridiculous goals they conceded at Stoke on Saturday. For the first Karl Henry inexplicably lets the ball run across his body just outside his own box, Stephen Ireland robs him and instantly feeds Jon Walters who scores. Nobody is near Walters because Rangers players have taken up space making themselves available for the ball because they were in possession. Until Henry’s blunder. For the second, Eduardo Vargas, an international footballer who played at the World Cup, was lazy and sloppy in possession, under hit a simple pass in the opposition half, and gave the ball away cheaply. Now Walters is definitely not Usain Bolt – quite the opposite. But with no fewer than four QPR players chasing him he still managed to find time and space to score his second. Those four will be named and shamed: Leroy Fer was guilty of trotting back; Nedum Onouha looked like he was towing a caravan with flat tyres through a sea of treacle; Vargas chased like a headless chicken to atone for his error; and Henry was in the vicinity but didn’t exactly bust a gut. Jon Walters completes his hat-trick against QPR with a header from close range . The Stoke City striker wheels away in celebration after completing his treble against a poor QPR side . The third was a joke. Stoke launched a free-kick from close to the halfway line into the box. Joey Barton was outwitted by Victor Moses. Barton wasn’t concentrating, Moses got goal-side of him, and in his desperate attempts to recover the situation after he had dozed off, Barton launched himself at the ball, but only succeeded in heading it across his own penalty area straight into the path of Walters, hungry for a hat-trick. While Barton looked stupid, Yun Suk-young looked feeble: as Walters closed in on the ball, he was side by side with the QPR substitute. The South Korean makes a limp, pathetic attempt to beat Walters to the ball, leaning into the Stoke striker who probably didn’t even realise he was there. The Rangers man is brushed aside like he doesn’t exist. Tony Fernandes tweeted that QPR have good players, who fight. He failed to mention on social media that quite a lot of them fail to do their jobs properly and fail to give their all for the cause. Adam shields the ball from Eduardo Vargas, who needs to do a better job looking after it . Leroy Fer looks on in disappointment after Stoke's opening goal at the Britannia Stadium . So before these QPR wasters even got into their luxury expensive cars and headed to training this week, I hope they implore themselves to do the following: . Can any of this shower look Redknapp in the eye? A manager who took a team from the bottom three to the quarter-finals of the Champions League in a short space of time, a manager who has won more in English football than all of these players put together. These are players who were not professional enough in their work on Saturday, and I suspect they and some others could be accused of shirking responsibilities in all their away games this season. The QPR players are letting their extremely generous chairman down. They’re letting the fans down and they’re in danger of taking Queens Park Rangers down. It seems the only thing this embarrassment of players will succeed in doing is tarnishing Harry Redknapp’s proud managerial record.","QPR have lost all 11 of their Premier League games on the road this term .

"Critic: Montana State Senator Ryan Zinke is a former Navy SEAL Team 6 member . A former officer in SEAL Team Six, the unit that killed Osama bin Laden, said that ‘veterans and special forces community’ are determined that President Barack Obama be voted out in November. Ryan Zinke, who retired in the rank of commander in 2008 after 23 years of service, said on Tuesday that Obama was guilty of a 'despicable' attempt to divide veterans and discredit those who, like him, opposed the White House’s policies. A Republican state senator in Montana who served two tours in SEAL Team Six as a junior officer in the 1990s, Zinke was speaking to MailOnline at his party’s convention in Tampa, Florida. He was awarded two Bronze Stars and . rose to become acting commander of the US Combined Joint Special . Operations Task Force Arabian Peninsula and deputy commander of Special . Forces in Iraq. Zinke, 50, . has been singled out on the Obama campaign website as being part of 'an . interconnected web of Republican operatives who are launching ""Swift . Boat""-style smear tactics' -- a reference to the Swift Boat Veterans for . Truth group that assailed Senator John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic . nominee, over his Vietnam record. Some . of the SEALs who were on the operation that killed bin Laden in . Abbottabad, Pakistan in 2011 served under Zinke and he has met a number . of them since the al-Qaeda leader's demise. Zinke . is now heading up an anti-Obama Political Action Committee called . Special Operations for America and is in Tampa to unveil a new ad that . takes Obama to task for bowing to the king of Saudi Arabia. Scroll down to watch the political ads . Prideful: Zinke believes Obama has claimed too much credit for the success of the Osama bin Laden raid last year . 'Bow to Nobody': Special Operations for America PAC has produced an ad criticizing the president for bow to King Abdullah of Suadi Arabia . Furious: Zinke said the president's new ad, 'One Chance,' makes political sport of the Osama bin Laden raid, which risked the lives of the Navy SEALS who carried it out . 'The . veterans and the special forces community is firmly behind a change of . leadership of the commander-in-chief,' he said. 'There is no doubt about . that.' Obama crossed 'the . line,' he argued, by creating a campaign ad to coincide with the first . anniversary of the killing of bin Laden that trumpeted the President’s . role in ordering the operation. Titled 'One Chance,' it features President Bill Clinton as saying that if SEALs had been 'captured or killed' then 'the downside would have been horrible for [Obama].' 'No one ever disputed that he made the decision,' Zinke said. 'I respect that fact. What I find appalling is that he would make a political commercial with former President Clinton talking about it. That's where the line was and I think that action is what upset many. Hiding: Osama bin Laden hid from US troops for nearly ten years after the September 11, 2001, attacks . 'But don't tell me that the consequences of failure were just political, difficult thought the decision was. The consequences of failure would have been the troops on the ground losing their lives and military families back home losing a father, losing a husband.' Dissatisfaction amongst serving and former SEALs was first reported by MailOnline in April. The hard-hitting Special Operations for America ad, called 'Bow to Nobody,' shows U.S. special operations troops on maneuvers. Singer Jon Kahn speaks the words of a former Navy SEAL, saying: 'We sacrifice not because we have to. 'We bleed not because we want to. We fight because we need to. And sometimes we die because we love this country.' He . concludes; 'I believe in American exceptionalism. As a Navy SEAL I . fought so that I would never have to see my president bow to anyone.' A . photograph of Barack Obama bowing before King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia . at a G-20 gathering in London in April 2009 then flashes up on the . screen before the message: '2012 New Leadership.' Zinke said this action and that of bowing in 2009 to President Akihito of Japan, whose father was president when his country bombed Pearl Harbor, demeaned America. 'I’ve . seen tears cried watching our president bow. It has nothing to do with . protocol. It has to do with the symbol of America bowing,' he said. 'As . president, it's unacceptable. I believe this president thinks the world . is better off without America leading and his actions have stated that . he believes America is better off being one of the pack rather than . being the leader. I reject that theory.' The ad, he said, was the first of three focusing on the theme of American exceptionalism. 'This first one is very emotional, a personal story, to a degree, about me and about why I fought,' Zinke said. Opposition: Special Operations for America demands a new Commander-in-Chief in a commercial that blasts Obama for bowing to foreign leaders . Advocate: Obama enlisted the help of former President Bill Clinton to describe the possible fallout if the bin Laden raid had ended badly . Politics: Zinke believes Obama has also tried to draw Admiral William McRaven into the political fray . 'We need to maintain our leadership and the reason why we fought is that our president does not have to bow before any king or emperor.' Zinke said he was saddened but not surprised to be singled out by the Obama campaign. 'This is what the Obama administration does. They use misinformation, half facts, they try to distract from the issue and to a large degree they try to discredit. 'Our nation owes a debt of gratitude to anyone who serves honourably. I think it's despicable that a president would put veterans on his website and list them on an enemies list. 'We can have the debate about the issues and I don't dislike the president personally but I don't favour Chicago politics. We should stick to the issues.' Zinke said that Obama was seeking to politically exploit senior officers who were still serving, including Admiral William McRaven, head of U.S. Joint Special Operations Command, and General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and America’s senior uniformed officer. When facing questions about his role in the bin Laden operation, Obama said last week: ‘I'd advise that you talk to General McRaven, who's in charge of our Special Ops. I think he has a point of view in terms of how deeply I care about what these folks do each and every day to protect our freedom.' Zinke said that apart from botching McRaven’s rank -- he's a Navy officer, not in the Army -- Obama was attempting to politicise a senior officer. 'Active duty military should be apolitical. To try to somehow pin them in a corner I think is an act of desperation.' 'Americans don't want to see our military become Republican or Democrat. Americans appreciate that our military belongs to all of us. But there is a difference between a veteran speaking out and active duty. 'I respect Admiral McRaven, I know him personally and I think he's a great leader but if veterans can't speak out, then who can?' Toby Harnden is reporting from the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida. President Obama's ad, 'One Chance': .

"As the great quiz show philosopher Jim Bowen once said, you can’t beat a bit of Bully. Back in the old days, that meant you might have ended up winning a caravan. Or even a speedboat. Something that would block your driveway, anyway. Nowadays, if you’re Jimmy Bullard, it means you have seen off all the competition (and some disgusting bits of animal you’ve eaten) to become King of the jungle. Now of course plenty of football fans know all about Jimmy as a much travelled and gifted player. And quite a few of them also know that a sadly injury-blighted career meant that his hereditary cheeky chapiness (he’s an East End boy!) has made him a popular face on on football programmes. Former Fulham midfielder Jimmy Bullard reacts after being told he'd be taking the next trial . Bullard had previously said that he would 'jump through the roof' if he saw a spide or snake at home . The retired footballer looked a little sheepish while having to put his hand into a wooden box . But it is probably fair to say that to much of the audience tuning in on Sunday evening for the first night of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, he is more like ‘Jimmy who?’. Which hasn’t stopped many a vaguely familiar boy band member, or completely anonymous glamour model, making a bit of a name for themselves on the reality TV circuit, of course. But it’s been over ten years since Phil Tufnell wore the crown for the world of sport. So can Jimmy hit the bullseye this time around? Well, he certainly made an immediate impression when he made his entrance. Jimmy was meeting his team-mates at the hotel and nearly went down at the edge of the pool. The 36-year-old was a lucky member 'Group A', who spent the first night in luxury . His most famous celebration came in the form of a mock team-talk he gave his Hull team-mates in 2009 . You can take the man out of football….But he had nothing immediately to worry about as his half of the celebrity line up got an extra night of luxury, courtesy the great voting public. Straight into the thick of things with his half of the contestants was sports other contender beneath the canopy, Carl ‘I’m Foggy’ Fogarty MBE. Foggy seemed to have a less laid back approach to it all than Jimmy, as he began his jungle challenge. He told us in no uncertain terms that the three things he didn’t like were ‘being hungry, being bored, and being with people’. Erm? But Foggy, it turns out, is made of sterner stuff than that. As Craig Charles and Vicky Michelle both pointed out, he was quite the ‘boy scout’ on the first night when he immediately got a fire going. Bullard celebrates scoring from the penalty spot for Hull, against Arsenal at the KC Stadium in 2010 . Carl Fogarty had to complete the Buried Alive Bush Tucker trial as part of his first day in the jungle . The former Superbike champion was covered in snakes, but barely flinched during the challenge . Although I don’t think you can get a badge for putting up with TOWIE’s Gemma Collin’s snoring! And he was the first to take a Bush Tucker trial. ‘Bring it on’ he told the boys as he relaxed in a drain full of pythons. Although perhaps the most nervous part was having one of them gently removed from his shorts by a lady after he successfully completed the challenge. Quite frankly, nothing I have seen from him so far doesn’t suggest that by about Wednesday, he’ll have fashioned a spear, tied on a headband, slapped on the camouflage make up and headed off into the trees to catch his own dinner. Oh, and possibly garrotted Gemma. But is he going to be just too self-assured to win over the viewers? 49-year-old Fogarty looks as though he will take to life in the jungle quite easily . TOWIE's Gemma Collins enjoyed a cold shower after a dramatic start to life in the jungle . After a good night’s kip, Jimmy checked out of the hotel, and into hell. That is, if you can call hanging around on a beach with Melanie Sykes hell. While she then does all the hard work on the first challenge, with it! Yes, I suspect the only badges Jimmy has ever got are the ones on the front of his various football shirts. But Melanie didn’t seem to mind Jimmy did, quite frankly, nothing. Although the viewers weren’t quite so laid back, as he was given the first trial of day two. But will his efforts be enough to help him across the line? There is, by the way, a third chance, sort of, for sport to triumph in the undergrowth. ‘Model and Singer’ Nadia Forde is a one time girlfriend of Rory McIlroy and has yet to really make any real impact other than to have the pleasure of giving Gemma a shower. But as the Essex girl pointed out, ‘I’m A Celebrity...’ is all about ‘the turtle and the slug. Or horse and the rabbit?’. And you really can’t argue with that. Rory McIlroy's former girlfriend Nadia Forde hasn't managed to make an impact on the show just yet .","I'm a Celebrity 2014 started Sunday night on ITV1 .

"For years, millions of women have woken up on Mothering Sunday to be presented with a bouquet by their children, with the stems tied precariously in a bag of water. But no longer will they risk an untimely splash, as Marks & Spencer becomes the first High Street retailer to deliver flowers in a water-free, airtight container. Some 160,000 blooms ordered to celebrate the event today will arrive in the new packaging. Look, no water! Liquid-free flowers for Mothering Sunday have been introduced by Marks & Spencer . The move is expected to save 50,000 litres of water this weekend, and almost 500,000 litres over the year. The change is thanks to Modified Atmosphere Packaging, a method similar to vacuum-packing, which keeps flowers fresher for longer. This method removes oxygen, so carbon dioxide levels rise, slowing the respiration of the blooms and ‘putting them to sleep’ in transit. But when unpacked, cut and put in water, the buds ‘wake up’. The new packaging not only saves water, it reduces carbon footprint. Such bouquets take up less space and M&S says it will need 19 fewer lorries to deliver Mother’s Day flowers this year. The packaging is to be extended to all flowers sold in its stores as part of the company’s plan to become the world’s greenest retailer by 2015. Water pain! For too long mothers have had to flinch and await and almighty splash as they unwrap flowers .","No longer must Mothering Sunday stems be perched in a bag of water .

"A Russian actor has been 'outed' by Twitter addressing public meetings in Ukraine pretending to be an elected politician. In a plot that could have come from the pen of Jack Higgins, Anton Kosenko claimed to be a 'People's Deputy' from the self-proclaimed People's Republic of Donetsk. Kosenko was addressing a public meeting in Gorlovka, in eastern Ukraine when local journalists became suspicious and discovered that he was an actor from Moscow.

According to eyewitnesses, Kosenko appeared confident while answering questions, claiming the People's Republic of Donetsk only wanted a referendum to split from Ukraine and join with Russia. Small separatist groups have sprung up all over eastern Ukraine, looking to destabalise the country. Kosenko, from Moscow claimed on his website that he had a passport and was willing to work in any country . Pro-Russian activists have seized government buildings in 10 cities in eastern Ukraine. Denis Pushilin, a spokesman of the self-appointed Donetsk People's Republic, told reporters that the insurgents do not recognise the Ukrainian government as legitimate. Ukraine and Russia on Thursday agreed to take tentative steps toward calming tensions along their shared border after more than a month of bloodshed. Mr Pushilin said he wanted a referendum that would allow 'self-determination of the people'. On Thursday, thousands gathered at peaceful demonstrations in at least four eastern cities to denounce Russia for its perceived meddling in Ukrainian affairs. Political developments in eastern Ukraine have for weeks been dominated by a small but vocal and armed opposition to the interim government in Kiev.

"Leicester Tigers Geoff Parling has agreed to join the Exeter Chiefs in the summer on a two-year deal. The 31-year-old will leave the Tigers after six years at Welford Road which saw him win two Premiership titles and earn three caps for the British and Irish Lions against Australia in 2013. In an impressive double coup for the Chiefs, they have also secured the services of winger Olly Woodburn from Premiership rivals Bath on a two-year deal. Geoff Parling (top) is to leave Leicester Tigers after six years to join the Exeter Chiefs on a two-year deal . 'During our time in the Premiership we've slowly looked to add quality and experience to the squad,' Chiefs head coach Rob Baxter told the club's official website. 'Sometimes that happens by developing and working with your own players and them improving over time in the Premiership and Heineken Cup, but at the same time it's also important in key positions to add quality and experience and I think that's what Geoff does. 'There's no secret that this season we have looked a bit light in the second-row department at times and Geoff is a proven international performer. He adds great experience in running things like the line-out, he has got good leadership experience as well and all those things add up to it being a very good signing for us. The 31-year-old won two Aviva Premiership titles and three British and Irish Lions caps while at Welford Road . 'I'm expecting him to have a very positive influence on and off the pitch in how he helps the team prepare for big games and his experience of what needs to be a done at a certain time.' Parling has 21 England caps but looks likely to miss the Six Nations opener against Wales on Friday week, although Baxter insists his fitness is not a concern. 'As with most players we've done a full medical and we don't have any concerns about his physical state,' he added. 'He's just like a lot of guys who get to just over 30 and have played a fair bit of rugby, there's a few miles on the clock but physically he's in very good condition really.' Since their promotion to the Premiership in 2010 the Chiefs have qualified for the Heineken Cup and won the Anglo-Welsh Cup, and Parling does not see the move from perennial challengers Leicester to Sandy Park as a step down. 'Since Exeter came up they've done things in the right way,' he said. Rob Baxter is delighted with the signings of Parling and Bath's Olly Woodburn for 2015-16 season . 'The first few years they stuck with the core of the squad that got them promoted and since then they've added the odd face here and there over the years. There hasn't been a massive turnover of players and I think that has helped them to develop as a club. 'The Chiefs are also a lot like Leicester, they are very much a traditional rugby club, they have a great support base and it's a real hot-bed of rugby down there.' Baxter was eager to strengthen in the backs for the 2015-16 season and was delighted to sign Woodburn, who he feels can bring some versatility to the dressing room. Woodburn (left) was brought into the squad to add his versatility and says he's looking forward to the challenge . 'Although winger is his primary spot, he played outside centre for Bath against us in the A League a few weeks ago, so he's not just someone who stands on his wing and doesn't come to see the ball at all,' he said. 'We'll be encouraging him to come and find the ball, he's a big, strong, physical guy, he's tested very well in his physical tests and we'll look to develop his game and get him as many involvements when he plays as possible.' Woodburn added: 'I'm really looking forward to the challenge, I've only ever been at Bath as a professional so it's going to be good to have a change of scenery and test myself in a different environment. 'I've spoken to one or two players who know the club and the set-up and they all say positive things about the place and that it's quite a tight knit group down there.'","Geoff Parling agrees two-year deal with the Exeter from Leicester Tigers .

"A major snowstorm is set to cause travel havoc across the Midwest and Northeast in the next 24 hours with snow as deep as 12-inches predicted in some areas. Snowfall is expected in some areas from the Midwest to central New York later today, but by tomorrow two storms will have merged to produce a major snowstorm that will impact 70 million people, reaching from the upper part of the mid-Atlantic to southern New England. The storm is set to have a major impact on people traveling home from holiday destinations, going back to school or returning to work after the holidays. A major snowstorm is set to cause havoc across the Midwest and Northeast in the next 24 hours with more than 70 million people set to welcome in an extremely cold start to 2014 with as much as 12-inches of snow set to fall in some areas . A man clears snow from around vehicles in his neighborhood in Erie, Pennsylvania on Tuesday, more snow is predicted on Thursday . Travelers are warned to prepare themselves for flight delays and cancellations because of the snow and freezing temperatures. ‘The storms will not organize fast enough to make the perfect storm, but it will cause a significant amount of snow to fall over a large area,’ said AccuWeather.com Chief Operating Officer Evan Myers. Deicing operations, poor visibility and increasing winds will put some airlines behind schedule, he predicts, and even if the air is clear, aircraft and crews may not be where they are supposed to be. Then as colder air invades the storm, snow will stick to the roads and a layer of ice may form on some highways. The storm is set to have a major negative impact on people traveling home from holiday destinations, going back to school or returning to work after the holidays . If as expected the temperature fails to reach 20 degrees in New York's Central Park on Friday, it will be the first time this has occurred since Jan. 16, 2009 (pictured) The worst of the storm is likely to be on Thursday night in the Northeast but will cause enough snow to make roads slippery as early as Wednesday and Thursday in some locations from the Midwest to New England. The storm is forecast to bring a large area of 6- to 12-inch snowfall beginning near the Pennsylvania/New York state border to a large part of New Jersey and southern New England, that includes the entire metropolitan area of New York City and Long Island, northward to Albany, N.Y., and Scranton, Pa. Over a foot of snow will fall in localized areas of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut and the cities of Providence, R.I., and Boston. A winter storm watch has already been issued for the region. The cold temps could even reach record lows, bringing temperatures not seen in the Northeast since January 2009. 'If New York's Central Park fails to reach 20 degrees for a high temperature on Friday, it will be the first time this has occurred since Jan. 16, 2009,' said AccuWeather's long range weather expert Jack Boston said. Widespread snow will continue over the Great Lakes and stretch through the Northeast on Thursday, while cloudy skies and showers will cover the Southeast. High pressure moving into the Upper Midwest will push cold temperatures into the region under partly cloudy skies . The worst of the storm is likely to be on Thursday night in the Northeast but will cause enough snow to make roads slippery as early as Wednesday and Thursday in some locations from the Midwest to New England . Within the heaviest snow area, the snow will fall at the rate of two inches per hour in some locations, making it difficult for plows to keep up. A significant, but lesser snowfall is in store farther southwest in Philadelphia, and farther north in Portland, Maine, Burlington, Vt., and Pittsburgh. Around Baltimore and Washington, D.C., where a small amount of snow is forecast, a quick freeze and slippery travel is possible Thursday evening. For many areas this will be a dry, powdery snow. However, along the mid-Atlantic coast and even southern New England coast for a brief time, a wintery mix will occur early. However, as colder air invades the storm, wet areas will freeze and the snow will become powdery. The storm will strengthen quickly enough to kick up winds. Blowing and drifting snow will occur during the middle and last part of the storm from Pennsylvania to New England. In parts of New England to perhaps near New York City, a full-blown blizzard may evolve. Blizzard: A woman battles snow in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania as much of the country is set to welcome in a very wintery 2014 . The wind will cause waves to build along the New England and the mid-Atlantic coast. Where these winds are onshore longest, over eastern New England and along the north shore of Long Island, flooding at times of high tide is likely, along with beach erosion. The new moon on New Year's Day will contribute to higher tide levels during part of the storm. The coldest air of the season so far will empty out of eastern Canada on gusty winds in the wake of the storm. For some locations it will bring the coldest weather in several years. Areas from New England to much of the mid-Atlantic will be very cold Friday into Saturday, while travel conditions will improve. In the South, the colder air will be accompanied by a biting wind as well. The southern part of the two storms is set to join up in the Northeast and will bring drenching rain to parts of the South and along the lower mid-Atlantic coast for a time Wednesday night into Thursday. Central Park: Within the heaviest snow area, the snow will fall at the rate of two inches per hour in some locations, making it difficult for plows to keep up . The second of the two storms slated to join forces will spread a swath of accumulating snow eastward from Iowa and Illinois to Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia and part of lower Michigan and southern Wisconsin Tuesday into New Year's Day. Another storm may eye the Northeast with snow, a wintry mix and rain Sunday night and Monday as 2014 kicks winter up to a whole new level of intensity. Very cold air could also make a far-reaching appearance from the Midwest to the Northeast next week. Elsewhere the warmest temperatures in the country are to be found in Florida, in cities such as Fort Lauderdale and Miami. 'It will be balmy weather in the 70s,' said Bruce Terry, a forecaster with the National Weather Service. 'It will be the warmest part of the country.'","Major snowstorm set to cause havoc across the Midwest and Northeast in the next 24 hours .

It is crucial that England approach the Six Nations like a knockout competition because that is how they need to tackle the World Cup. In 2003 we ramped up the pressure on our players and challenged them to prepare for each game as if it was a World Cup semi-final. It’s time for Stuart Lancaster’s team to deliver. ONE TO WATCH: Alex Corbisiero . Injuries have hampered him and he won’t play against Wales but the Northampton prop is up there with the best in the world. He is destructive in the tight and loose. Alex Corbisiero (left, celebrating the Lions win in 2013) has been plagued by injuries in the last few years . HEAD COACH: Stuart Lancaster . CAPTAIN: Chris Robshaw . MOST CAPPED PLAYER: Dylan Hartley — 61 . HOME GROUND: Twickenham . Capacity: 82,000 . SIX NATIONS RECORD . Tournament wins: 26 (10 shared) Grand Slams: 12 . 2014 result: An opening defeat by France crushed Grand Slam hopes and the championship was lost on points difference. PREDICTION: 2nd . The pressure is on Stuart Lancaster (second right) and his coaching team in World Cup year . WALES . I liked Warren Gatland’s show of confidence in naming his team 48 hours early. It was an indication of how settled his side is and a statement that Wales don’t believe they have anything to hide or fear from England. I’d like to see more width on the ball but Wales clearly know their gameplan. KEY MAN: Jonathan Davies . On the 2013 Lions tour Davies proved to be one of the finest centres in the world. He is exceptionally strong with a low centre of gravity but also has excellent hands and a good kicking game. Jonathan Davies is regarded as one of the best centres in the world and is a key man for Wales . HEAD COACH: Warren Gatland . CAPTAIN: Sam Warburton . MOST CAPPED PLAYER: Gethin Jenkins — 110 . HOME GROUND: Millennium Stadium . Capacity: 74,500 . SIX NATIONS RECORD . Tournament wins: 26 (12 shared) Grand Slams: 11 . 2014 result: The defending champions were well off the pace, losing to England and Ireland. PREDICTION: 3rd . Warren Gatland (left) has won three Six Nations titles since taking over as Wales head coach . IRELAND . Joe Schmidt is the outstanding coach in the northern hemisphere and it’s no coincidence he is working in a system which prioritises the national team. As a result, Ireland are in the best shape for years. But can they cope with the favourites’ tag? ONE TO WATCH: Jonathan Sexton . The fly-half has struggled with concussion over the past year but looks as if he’ll be fit for Ireland’s second game. An exciting player who threatens with his pace and who has the all-round game to set his backline free. Fly-half Jonathan Sexton crosses for Ireland against France during the 2014 Six Nations . HEAD COACH: Joe Schmidt . CAPTAIN: Paul O’Connell . MOST CAPPED PLAYER: Paul O’Connell — 96 . HOME GROUND: Aviva Stadium . Capacity: 51,700 . SIX NATIONS RECORD . Tournament wins: 12 (Nine shared) Grand Slams: 2 . 2014 result: Despite losing to England, Ireland claimed the championship in Brian O’Driscoll’s final game. PREDICTION: 1st . Joe Schmidt stands alongside captain Paul O'Connell with the trophy Ireland are defending this year . SCOTLAND . Vern Cotter is a serious coach who has clearly knocked Scotland into shape, judging by their performances in the autumn when they pushed the All Blacks very close. Always highly committed but there are promising signs of their wide game developing. ONE TO WATCH: Finn Russell . I love the young fly-half’s confidence and willingness to back himself, which shone through during the autumn. The 22-year-old has an excellent passing game and is fiercely committed in defence. A very talented player with a big future. Young playmaker Finn Russell (left) impressed during the autumn internationals for Scotland . HEAD COACH: Vern Cotter . CAPTAIN: Greig Laidlaw . MOST CAPPED PLAYER: Sean Lamont — 91 . HOME GROUND: Murrayfield . Capacity: 67,144 . SIX NATIONS RECORD . Tournament wins: 14 (eight shared) Grand Slams: 3 . 2014 result: Managed a solitary win against Italy by just a point to avoid the wooden spoon. PREDICTION: 5th . New Zealander Vern Cotter took the Scotland job last year after eight successful seasons with Clermont . FRANCE . Philippe Saint-Andre has an even more challenging relationship than Stuart Lancaster with his clubs and France’s national team are clearly suffering as a result. Their opening match in Paris against Scotland will be an emotional one and could set the tone for the Six Nations. ONE TO WATCH: Camille Lopez . For years France have messed around playing scrum-halves at fly-half and vice-versa but finally seem to have settled on an out-an-out No 10. If Lopez can merit an extended run in the side it should pay huge dividends for Les Bleus. Clermont fly-half Camille Lopez cemented the No 10 jersey for France as his impressed in the autumn . HEAD COACH: Philipe Saint-Andre . CAPTAIN: Thierry Dusautoir . MOST CAPPED PLAYER: Nicolas Mas — 76 . HOME GROUND: Stade de France . Capacity: 81,338 . SIX NATIONS RECORD . Tournament wins: 17 (eight shared) Grand Slams: 9 . 2014 result: Scraped a dramatic late win against England on day one but poor after that. PREDICTION: 4th . France captain Thierry Dusautoir trains ahead of their Six Nations opener against Scotland . ITALY . Last year was extremely disappointing for Italy, which hinted for the first time in many years that their progress had stalled. They have some promising young players coming through but the loss of centre Gonzalo Canale is significant. ONE TO WATCH: Sergio Parisse . Injury blighted last season for him but the 31-year-old remains arguably the best No 8 in the world — alongside Kieran Read of New Zealand. He is such a powerful athlete who carries superbly but combines his running with the footballing skills of an international centre. Italy's captain Sergio Parisse has been consistently rated among the world's best players for years . HEAD COACH: Jacques Brunel . CAPTAIN: Sergio Parisse . MOST CAPPED PLAYER: Marco Bortolami — 110 . HOME GROUND: Stadio Olimpico . Capacity: 82,307 . SIX NATIONS RECORD . Tournament wins: 0 . Grand Slams: 0 . 2014 result: After finishing 4th in 2013, Italy resumed their traditional place at the bottom of the pile. PREDICTION: 6th . Head coach Jacques Brunel knows he must improve on Italy's dire showing at last year's Six Nations .","Six Nations Championship kicks off on Friday, February 6 .

"It is often the toughest players who are targeted on the field. In football, people have regularly tried to wind up Roy Keane and Joey Barton because they are going to react. Dylan Hartley is one of the hardest men for England and Northampton but he must be coached how to handle himself if he is going to be trusted in key World Cup games. His red card against Leicester on Saturday was daft. Somehow his team still managed to win, but you’re not going to beat South Africa or New Zealand if you’re playing most of the match with 14 men. England international Dylan Hartley seems perplexed at why he has been sent off at Franklin's Gardens . Hartley (right) was adjudged to have elbowed Leicester's Matt Smith (left) before the pair had to be separated . Hartley's elbow appears to make strong connection with Smith's face during the incident . April 2007: Banned for 26 weeks after gouging Wasps’ James Haskell and Jonny O’Connor. March 2010: Claims of gouging versus Scotland dropped when alleged victim, Ross Ford, chose not to complain. March 2012: Banned for eight weeks for biting Ireland flanker Stephen Ferris during Six Nations Test. June 2012: Sin-binned against South Africa in first game as England captain. December 2012: Given a two-week ban for striking Ulster’s Rory Best. May 2013: Eleven-week ban after being sent off for swearing. December 2014: Sent off for elbowing Leicester’s Matt Smith. It is the same in the two pool games against Wales and Australia — you have to pick players who can 100 per cent handle themselves if they’re intimidated, kicked or punched. It is one thing to be sent off in a league game, a Six Nations match or an Autumn International, but to see red in a key World Cup game would be unforgivable. Hartley is England’s No 1 hooker and you want him in your side, but not at the risk of him blowing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity — to win the World Cup on home soil. He must take responsibility and so must Stuart Lancaster. This is part of coaching and you can coach players how to react because one moment of madness can ruin years of dreams and preparations. If Hartley can’t be trusted to keep his cool, he doesn’t play. The best rugby teams are not angels. Look at any World Cup-winning side and you’ll find tough men whose immediate instinct is to react, but they learn how to handle themselves. That control makes the toughest players even tougher. We used to have a buddy system that would be used if there was a flashpoint in a game. Every player had a buddy, someone they stood near to on the pitch. Smith is struck straight in the mouth by the right elbow of England's No 1 hooker Hartley . Joey Barton loses his cool against Manchester City in May 2012 when he was given his marching orders . You became responsible not only for your actions, but also your buddy’s. If something kicked off, they would go in straight away and defuse the situation. The big personalities might not have liked it, but it was absolutely critical. Hartley needs similar support and, with his poor disciplinary history, there will be no hiding place when he is scrutinised in the media. Lancaster has to make some big calls ahead of the opening Six Nations match against Wales — which is huge — but, if available, I would pick Hartley. He will be targeted and Wales coaches Warren Gatland and Shaun Edwards will try to get under his skin. Gatland has tried to wind up Hartley before and he has experienced players in his squad who will try to light his fuse during the game. Manchester United skipper Roy Keane hits out at Newcastle striker Alan Shearer at St James Park in 2001 . Wales' flanker Sam Warburton (second left) is sent off in the Rugby World Cup semi-final against France . Sam Warburton, the Wales captain, is one of those guys. He was sent off in the 2011 World Cup semi-final against France and that ultimately killed off a country’s hopes. It probably should not have been a red card but he didn’t need to get into the situation in the first place. Even losing a player for 10 minutes can upset the balance of a game — as Hartley found out last month when he was sin-binned during the defeat by the Springboks. You show your toughness in the scrums, lineouts, rucks and mauls. Brawls, cheap shots and daft fights don’t win you matches. Hartley must learn how to keep his cool.","Dylan Hartley was sent off for Northampton against Leicester on Saturday .
Luckily for his side they went on to win the match .
However that would not happen on the international stage against top quality opposition like South Africa and New Zealand .
Sir Clive Woodward maintains Hartley is a key player for England but he must be tamed or risk ruining England's 2015 Rugby World Cup hopes .
Head coach Stuart Lancaster must also take responsibility ."
"Mike Jones put himself in the running for the worst Premier League decision ever when he cautioned Sergio Aguero for simulation earlier this season at St Mary’s after Jose Fonte wiped him out; he now has the worst two after a shocking penalty for Liverpool against Leicester. Raheem Sterling broke away down the flank and crossed the ball. Leicester centre-half Wes Morgan was sliding to try and block the cross which he did as the ball hit him flush in the face. Jones, who was well positioned, considered the incident for a second or two and then blew his whistle and pointed to the penalty spot. Liverpool were awarded a controversial penalty after Raheem Sterling's cross hit Wes Morgan in the face . The ball hits Morgan (right) in the face but referee Mike Jones gave Liverpool a penalty . Leicester players surround the official after Liverpool were given a penalty in the first half . Jones books Manchester City's Sergio Aguero for simulation earlier this season at St Mary's . Sometimes players contribute to poor refereeing decisions with dives or play-acting but this was an error all of Jones’ making. He also awarded Liverpool a second penalty, again for handball although this time the ball did actually strike the hand of defender Danny Simpson. Whether it was deliberate could be debated for a long time but Leicester manager Nigel Pearson summed up these decisions by saying they are random and that cannot be right. One that could not be disputed was when Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper Rob Green slid out of his penalty area to stop Swansea’s Wayne Routledge. Somehow referee Anthony Taylor and his hapless assistant Matthew Wilkes missed the offence which would surely have resulted in a red card for Green had it been seen. Referee Anthony Taylor failed to send off QPR goalkeeper Robert Green for this handball outside his area . Taylor did show his red card later but he was wrong. Karl Henry went through Routledge with an overly physical challenge which did merit a dismissal and Routledge reacted by confronting his opponent. Quite how Henry ended up with a yellow card and Routledge a red defies all natural justice and hopefully the FA will rectify on appeal. No wonder Swansea manager Garry Monk feels aggrieved at refereeing decisions. Wayne Routledge gives Karl Henry a kick as he is on the floor and received a red card for his trouble . Anthony Taylor shows Routledge a red card for his dig after failing to punish Green earlier in the game . Kevin Friend joined the New Year’s Day fun as he awarded Hull a free-kick just outside the penalty area when Abel Hernandez was clearly fouled inside. Friend later dismissed Antolin Alcaraz for the softest – wrong – second yellow card which of course cannot be appealed. Add in the penalty that Stoke should have had against Manchester United for a Chris Smalling handball and Southampton’s Florin Gardos escaping a clear and obvious red when bringing down Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez when clean through on goal. As you can see, it was another poor match day from the select group of referees. Antolin Alcaraz was given his marching orders by Kevin Friend after picking up two second-half yellow cards . The ball clearly hits the arm of Manchester United defender Chris Smalling at Stoke . Referee Michael Oliver (bottom left) has an unobstructed view of the incident between Stoke and United . Alexis Sanchez (right) is tripped by Florin Gardos during the match between Southampton and Arsenal .","Mike Jones cautioned Sergio Aguero for simulation this season .

"Do you live in Scotland? You're blessed with bigger breasts, according to the latest research. Scottish girls are on average a 34DD - that's two cup sizes bigger than their 34C English neighbours. Welsh women came out with the smallest average cup size at 34B, while Irish ladies measured in at 34C, the same as the English. Big up north: Scottish girls, like Michelle Mone (left) and Lorraine Kelly (right), are among their fellow Scots who are, on average, a 34DD - that's two cup sizes bigger than their 34C English neighbours . Inverness came out on top, with the average bra size coming in at a 36F, whereas Methyr Tydfil has a more petite bra size average at 34A. The research reveals that Northern English women are more likely to have bigger boobs - with the average Northern lady wearing a D cup. Northern towns to top the . biggest breast poll are Liverpool, Leeds, Aberdeen and Glasgow, while . southern towns are at the lower end of the spectrum. Big breasted: Ladies of Liverpool, like Coleen Rooney, left, are, on average, a 34E, while women from Leeds, like Mel B, right, are a 34DD . Women in Portsmouth, where the average cup size is 34A, came bottom of the poll. A spokesperson for Debenhams Lingerie, who commissioned the research, said: 'We have seen a dramatic difference in Scottish bust sizes vs. the rest of the UK, our fuller bust ranges have been particularly popular with Scots.' The research by Debenhams also showed that 63 per cent of women are wearing the wrong size bra. The retailer sells on average 10,000 bras per week which means worryingly around 6,000 bras are being bought in the incorrect size for the wearer. The research also shows that only 21 per cent of women have been fitted for a bra in the last 2 years and an alarming 37 per cent of women have never had a bra fit. Top ten: Women from Newcastle, like Cheryl Cole, left, are a 34D and came in sixth place in the top ten biggest bus regions, and Manchester, came in seventh place, where ladies like Helen Flanagan, right, are a 32D .

"Newcastle tight-head Kieran Brookes has been called into England’s training squad after David Wilson became the latest player to join Stuart Lancaster’s lengthy casualty list. Wilson, 29, has started England’s 10 previous Tests but a nerve problem in his neck means he will sit out Friday’s training session, before facing further assessments by team medical staff. Brookes has been capped six times by Lancaster, who could also be without key players including Tom Wood, Brad Barritt, Geoff Parling, Owen Farrell, Manu Tuilagi, Ben Morgan, Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury for the opening RBS 6 Nations fixture against Wales next week. Newcastle tight-head Kieran Brookes has been called into England’s training squad . David Wilson became the latest player to join Stuart Lancaster’s lengthy casualty list . ‘We have brought Kieran in as cover at tight-head as a precaution because Davy has a small nerve impingement which should settle down,’ said Lancaster. Also joining the group at Pennyhill Park is London Irish centre Shane Geraghty, who last played for England in 2009 and has rediscovered his form with the Exiles this season. Lancaster added: ‘I didn’t want to cause any further disruption to the Saxons so Shane’s addition is a good opportunity for him on the back of good form and helps us to train with appropriate numbers on Friday.’ Tom Wood has an ankle injury which will rule him out of England's clash with Wales .

"Russell Wilson fired a 35-yard touchdown strike to Jermaine Kearse in overtime to give the Seattle Seahawks a stunning  comeback win over the Green Bay Packers on Sunday and seal a return trip to the Super Bowl. The Seahawks, bidding to become the first team in a decade to win back-to-back Super Bowls, will now play the New England Patriots after they hammered the Indianapolis Colts. Trailing 19-7 the Seahawks scored 15 points in 44 seconds late in the fourth quarter - Wilson and Marshawn Lynch each powering their way into the end zone for touchdowns and adding a two-point conversion to surge ahead 22-19.

Willson celebrates with wide receiver Kearse  after catching a pass for a two-point conversion score against Green Bay Packers free safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix  during the second half in the NFC Championship game . Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll and  Russell Wilson  celebrate making the Super Bowl . The drama was far from over, as the Packers' Mason Crosby booted his fifth field goal of the day to send the NFC championship into overtime where Russell hit a streaking Kearse for the winning score as CenturyLink Field exploded in celebration. The touchdown was a spectacular and breathtaking end to a game pitting Seattle's top-ranked defence against the NFL's No 1 scoring offence led by quarterback Aaron Rodgers. The contest had taken on a funeral atmosphere for much of the game as Seattle's Super Bowl reign appeared headed to an end. But Wilson, who had misfired most of the day throwing four interceptions, flashed his champion's pedigree when it mattered most, leading a fourth-quarter rally and engineering what is already being hailed as one of the greatest post-season comebacks in NFL history. Rodgers, playing with an injured calf, removed any doubts about his fitness, dissecting the Seahawks vaunted defense as the Packers dominated the opening half and stormed to a 16-0 lead to silence the famously raucous Seattle crowd known as the 12th man.

The Packers were in command on both sides of the ball, their defence intercepting Wilson three times in the first half as the Seattle quarterback failed to complete his first pass until late in the second quarter. Seattle finally got on the scoreboard with a bit of razzle dazzle, faking a punt and holder Jon Ryan hitting a wide open Garry Gilliam with a 19-yard touchdown pass to chop the Green Bay lead to 16-7. The Packers took some of the steam out of Seattle's comeback bid in the fourth quarter when Crosby booted a 48-yard field goal to put the visitors ahead 19-7. But with time running out Wilson kept hopes alive when he ran over from the one with 2:09 left on the clock, then Seattle recovered the onside kick. Lynch sprinted 24 yards for a touchdown and the Seahawks added a two-point conversion to push in front 22-19. But with 1:25 to play a limping Rodgers marched Green Bay into Seattle territory where Crosby booted a 48-yard field goal to send the contest into overtime.","Seattle Seahawks make the Super Bowl for the second year in a row after staging a comeback against the Packers .

"Donald Trump insists that he hasn't made any commitments to headline a new season of 'Celebrity Apprentice' for NBC, saying 'all options are on the table' for his future – leaving open the possibility that he might make an earnest run for president in 2016. 'I am greatly honored for the renewal by NBC of ""Apprentice"" for a 15th season,' the on-again, off-again political hopeful told Daily Mail Online. 'But, as I said on live television, I will be taking my time meaning all options are on the table.' Trump's spokespeople were quick to issue clarifications after Monday night's season finale when he announced what amounts to NBC asking for a contract extension. 'But Mr. Trump is taking his time and he has no commitment to have it on,' his spokesman Sam Nunberg said Wednesday. 'It's on at his discretion.' 'He has the option but he is exploring other options. This is nothing like 2011 – that I can guarantee you. ... A lot of serious announcements are going to be made in the coming weeks.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Donald Trump, seen with 'Celebrity Apprentice' runner-up Geraldo Rivera (left), said on the Fox News Channel that he hasn't actually committed to produce another season of the show and he might still run for office . Trump, shown in 2013 speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference, will be back at the event next week along with a parade of other potential presidential candidates . Four years ago Trump dangled the possibility of a challenge to President Barack Obama, saying he would run an unconventional campaign with his own money. But that effort failed to push aside his real estate deals and TV appearances. 'The last time I did have a problem. ... I had a signed contract,' he said Tuesday night on the Fox News Channel. This time around, Trump stressed, he isn't playing around. Asked for a 1-to-10 number indicating his enthusiasm for running, he told host Sean Hannity that it's 'much more than 5 on the scale.' Trump that NBC executives 'want to renew me as long as I live, I guess.' But again he insisted that his mind isn't made up. A spokesperson for the Trump Organization, the tycoon's principal holding company, explained that while the NBC show has had ratings successes, he's on the fence about keeping it going. And politics is just one option, including more real estate deals and other entertainment ventures. Nunberg rattled off a list of political appearances that Trump will make in the coming months, starting with a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on February 27 near Washington, D.C. On February 22 he will speak at a Citadel Republican Society event in Charleston, South Carolina, appearing at a 'Patriot Dinner' with Republican SenatorTim Scott. He's making enough appearances in early primary states to convince some observers that he's serious about trading in his Manhattan address for a bedroom at The White House. 'There's no way to know what a guy like that is thinking,' said an Iowa Republican political consultant who hasn't yet committed to working for a specific candidate. 'But if he's burning jet fuel to speak in New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina, at this point you have to consider him at least as serious as some of the other people who we assume are actually running.' On March 7 Trump will speak at the Iowa Agriculture Summit in Des Moines at an event where most of the top-tier GOP hopefuls will give remarks. Later in the month he will be the inaugural guest in a series of speaker events hosted by former New Hampshire House Speaker Bill O'Brien. The New Hampshire Journal describes the series as a chance for potential presidential candidates to recruit support from among conservative activists in the state. Some participants are expected to pay for the privilege, with reported figures reaching $50,000. Nunbeg also said Trump has commitments to appear in Iowa in mid-May, and will help Republican politicians with fundraising events in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. NOT FIRED: Trump says he's not out of political contention even though NBC says it wants him back on the air this fall . Trump said the Obama administration's foreign policy experts 'don't know what they're doing,' especially in Iran . 'Celebrity Apprentice' runner-up Geraldo Rivera told Hannity on Tuesday that Trump's interest in the presidency shouldn't be treated as a joke. 'He has far more experience in management than the current occupant of the White House,' Rivera said. 'I think he'd be an excellent president, but Donald has to do it this time. He can't just flirt with it.' 'He has to commit to it,' Rivera said, 'and he has to articulate the conservative philosophy that he does in the boardroom, on and off camera.' Trump said on the show that the Obama administration's foreign policy experts 'don't know what they're doing. That's where it all starts.' 'They can't negotiate,' he said. 'You look at what's going on with Iran, where they take the sanctions off in the middle of the negotiation. You should make the sanctions tougher.' NBC did not respond to a request for comment about the status of Trump's contract.","Confusion erupted at the end of Monday night's 'Apprentice' finale when Donald Trump said the show had been renewed for another season .

"You may not like it. But you can’t ignore it. Part of the bundle you buy when you sit down in front of the box for some Premier League football is the sideline show provided by the bosses for our entertainment. Some of the gaffers do much of their best work post-match in front of that logo wallpaper. Look nice in the kitchen, that. Steve Bruce is often given to scrunching up his face in an attempt not to savage the officials. But the best he can usually manage is to tell us the various reasons he’d LIKE to, but won’t. Jose Mourinho and Louis van Gaal embrace in the dug-outs at the final whistle as the two old friends went head-to-head at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon. Manchester United and Chelsea drew 1-1 . Mourinho worked as Van Gaal's assistant at Barcelona between 1997 and 2000 . While he now has Neil Warnock back there for company, too. The Palace manager’s hair may not budge, but he just can’t stop that tongue from wagging. There are then those other managers who are quite happy to use the touchline to put on a show. Alan Pardew has been a leading candidate there, but has been polishing up his act a bit of recent times. But I bet he comes back all singing, all dancing. And grumpy old stagers Manuel Pellegrini and Arsene Wenger have been so animated of reason seasons, they have quite the Statler & Wardorf act going on. But leader of the pack in all areas is of course Jose Mourinho. And on Sunday afternoon we got to see quite what performance he’d come up with against an old friend, then foe, Louis van Gaal. The Sky Sports cameras captured an embrace between Mourinho and Van Gaal in the tunnel pre-match . The pair have been friends for many years and Mourinho encouraged Van Gaal to come to the Premier League . Sky Sports hoped they’d be on to a winner with this one and opened their Super Sunday coverage at lunchtime from an Old Trafford dug out to set up what was to come later in the afternoon. Complete with opening credits bearing the music from Disney’s Sorcerer’s Apprentice. Although I’m sure no one expected this to be a Mickey Mouse confrontation. There was also a nice short film featuring the two masters at work with the media over the years. Just enough to suggest that although it has all been something of a love-in in the past and during the build up to Sunday’s game, there was still just the chance that something was gonna give. Well, that ultimately didn’t happen but nevertheless there was still much fun to be had watching these these two old pals keep it together as their teams went at it on the pitch. Geoff Shreeves was going to be the man in the middle for this and pre-match Sky Sports wisely kept the cameras rolling to provide a very real moment. Shreeves was half way through interviewing the visiting gaffer when Jose looked up and gave a smile and a wave to someone over Geoff’s shoulder. Turned out it was Van Gaal. Their reunion was the centre of attention off the field at Old Trafford as the heavyweights went head-to-head . Chelsea veteran Didier Drogba headed his team into a second-half lead from a corner . Robin van Persie snatched a point for Manchester United in the third minute of stoppage time . As was revealed when the interview finished and the camera swung around to capture the two friends hugging out a big hello. It then carried on filming and went straight into the chat with the Manchester United boss who told us his old colleague was ‘special. There you are - special’. Not exactly Ali-Frazier, eh? Come game time, there was even time for the camera to follow Jose into the United dug out for yet more friendly grappling. Then the two men finally took up their more familiar roles - Jose commanding his technical area, and Louis sat firmly in amongst his coaching staff. Which is how the next 90 minutes or so played out. But for that added bit of drama, it is always handy that Mourinho does stand centre stage. Because it provided us with a brilliant Jose-eye view of the United equalizer. Complete with the Chelsea manager’s slumped shoulders of resignation and what appeared to be a short, but to the point piece of unprintable English. Mourinho was very animated on the touchline all afternoon, issuing frantic instructions to his players . Van Gaal, by contrast, remained in the dug-out alongside his coaching staff . Yet even this late disappointment couldn't shake The Special One out of his bonhomie for the day out at his mate’s place. He told us he was ‘yes, happy. Very happy’. And even his attempt to give referee Phil Dowd what for - ‘if I speak of the second yellow I have to start in the first half’ - petered out into the verbal equivalent of a mild finger wag. We even got a decent chortle out of Van Gaal. ‘We could have win’ - his ‘wins’ and ‘wons’ get a bit mixed up - before chuckling ‘but I say that every game’. So all in all, it was very much honours even all around. With Christmas card lists remaining firmly intact. Except for poor old Branislav Ivanovic. Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic was sent off late on and United scored from the resulting free-kick . Geoff Shreeves had once famously announced to him on interview he’d be missing the Champion’s League Final. This time, Branislav was having his early bath when Shreeves once again stuck it to him. Albeit inadvertently. This happened when he informed goalscorer Robin Van Persie the red carded Chelsea right-back ‘would have picked Fellaini’ in the build up to the goal. ‘Is that so?’, smiled the Dutchman. ‘Makes it even better for us’. Ouch!","Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho were re-united at Old Trafford .

"We did try to warn you. On Friday here at MailOnline Sport, Phil Duncan spelled out the kind of sporting challenge 15 Brownlee brothers couldn’t manage. Yet in delivering his ‘Definitive Armchair Guide to 24 Hours of Sporting Heaven’, he was only scratching the surface. From where I was sitting, the weekend actually started on Friday evening on BBC2. The Corporation had live football back on the station. Last time we saw that, it was Gary Lineker and Co high above Copacabana Beach for the World Cup. Friday night, it was Dan Walker and his team, their loafers sinking gently into the soggy grass, as they got up close and personal with the FA Cup at a first-round visit by Exeter City to non-League Warrington. Warrington started the mammoth weekend of televised sport by beating Exeter in the FA Cup . And the weekend ended with some NFL action at Wembley, with the Cowboys taking on the Jaguars . And clearly the plan was to get the telly audience right inside the game because the pitch was very much their set. Walker covered more turf than your average Premier League midfielder in his quest for chats and sights that would illustrate that Cup ‘magic’. Robbie Savage, all dolled up, was also out there to interview Exeter’s dapper boss Paul Tisdale, who he described as ‘the second best dressed man in the ground’. I can only assume Robbie had seen Bryan Ferry in the crowd, then? But star of the BBC show was without doubt Warrington Town boss Shaun Reid. The younger brother of Peter, he is blessed with the kind of craggy countenance that looks like it might have been formed on a lathe. Those features were under constant surveillance throughout the game, in various states of anxiety. But at the end - with the presenters and crowd now massed on the pitch like an al fresco version of Top Gear - he was all smile when he proclaimed after Warrington’s famous win, ‘No-one will want to come here, pal, I tell ya’. I for one didn’t doubt him. As pundit Trevor Sinclair reminded us at the end of that game on Friday, . New Zealand came out 24-21 winners at Twickenham against England in the first Autumn international . Warrington is a rugby league town. Come early Saturday morning, that particular sport was actually taking place half a world away in New Zealand, where England’s Four Nations future was on the line. It was a game that didn’t exactly ease us gently into a packed weekend of action. Described variously on commentary as ‘exquisite’ and ‘end-to-end basketball’, what these untrained eyes saw was a blistering clash that went right to the wire. It was at times breathless stuff, leaving England so near, yet so far - and me needing a bit of a lie down before the next event. That took place over at BT Sport where Jake Humphrey’s version of the ‘Walker walk’ was conducted inside the more familiar surroundings of Anfield before the start of the lunchtime game. His stroll started outside the visiting team’s dressing room where Jose Mourinho, a flamboyant scarf defying gravity around his shoulders, was on hand to explain it wouldn’t be him giving the team talk behind that dressing room door. ‘Not me. Matic. I finished my work with them in the hotel’, said Jose. Paul Scholes was lost for words pitchside at the prospect of making a dressing room speech. Back in the day it was clearly the fella’s size sevens that did all the talking. Diego Costa (right) lashes the ball home for Chelsea's second goal at Anfield in the 2-1 win over Liverpool . Saturday afternoon was also to provide the emotional barometer on what was of course a weekend that was about so much more than sport. Rugby union’s home Twickenham was the backdrop for the second clash of the day between England and New Zealand. And a viscerally vivid visit to the home team’s dressing room captured the tension that was already in the air. From the studio, Jonny Wilkinson talked about it being a ‘stressful time’ as we saw a group of tight-lipped rugby players trying to get their act together. Some read match programmes, others wet dry mouths with bottles of water, while a couple just stared into the distance. However, it was a different set of emotions that were drawn upon elsewhere in the build-up. Sky Sports did a sterling job of commemorating the centenary of the Great War. In particular by taking England captain Chris Robshaw to visit the grave of his counterpart from 100 years ago, who lost his life on the battlefield in May 1915. This then became more immediately real as the camera looked into the tearful eyes of Lance Corporal Semesa Rokoduguni, in line for the national anthem wearing his first England shirt. This particular playing field in England certainly felt like the perfect place for two sets of sporting warriors to also be representing a united front of remembrance. Kei Nishikori of Japan shakes hands at the net after his straight-sets victory against Andy Murray . On to Sunday lunchtime then, and the yes/no debate was now clearly over. ‘Even the marketing guys didn’t think he’d make it’ Sue Barker told us on BBC2 as she stood below the Andy Murray-bereft banner advertising the ATP World Tour Finals from the O2 Arena. Having had a big World Cup and plenty of athletics, Auntie will have been delighted with their long weekend’s work. What with their involvement in the rugby, and Sunday also being wallpapered with their on-going FA Cup coverage, they are steadily reaffirming themselves as a competitive sport broadcaster. Of which, much of Great Britain would surely approve? On Sunday though, the big question was would nearly 20,000 of them be welcoming Murray with open arms? ‘London town. His town. Where Andy Murray made history’ is how Sue sold it up. And as the proud Scot made his way through the smoke in The Smoke, and on to the court, it was clear it was the return of a favourite son. This location provides a fabulously atmospheric setting for watching tennis on the box. An arena that can be dressed dramatically, and exude a sense of the atmosphere inside it. However, with this first game of the week, there may have been smoke, but there wasn’t much fire from Murray, as he lost in straight sets. Nico Rosberg set up a nail-biting final weekend of F1 action with his win in Brazil on Sunday . Which of course was disappointing, but did mean that with a deft flick of the remote control, it was straight over to Sky Sports F1 channel just in time to watch Lewis Hamilton launch himself from the grid in Brazil, and possibly on towards the title. And for a moment there, as the laps hit the mid-fifties, it felt like that title might be nailed on. Especially if you got caught up in the fizzing commentary of David Croft and Martin Brundle, who were going through the gears as Hamilton edged ever closer to Rosberg’s Mercedes. But in the end the difference between Hamilton finishing first and second was sealed back on lap 29. In the best piece of filmed action of the weekend, we were right there inside Lewis’ car as he spun off, stopped, then dragged himself straight back into the action. Exhilarating stuff! Yet this weekend was still not over. Off now to Wembley and Channel 4’s coverage of the NFL, where they were showing London’s latest live regular season game. The channel’s remit with this sport is to welcome in as many of the casual and the curious as possible. So it looked a very smart move indeed when they threw a couple of well-known speed merchants at their coverage. Dez Bryant (no 88) holds on tight as he gets a battering after scoring a first-half touchdown for the Cowboys . Iwan Thomas was enlisted to report from the touchline and help track down a few familiar faces. And I was a little surprised not to see a disgruntled Roy Hodgson among them, clutching a gardening fork and bucket of sand. While in the studio up in the stands, The American Football Show highlights programme co-hosts Nat Coombs and Vernon Kay were joined by the man whose punditry work in athletics is, much like his running had been, pure gold. Michael Johnson may have been there as a ‘superfan’ but he really knew his stuff. Add in that voice and sheer presence, and it’s more convincing than Obi-Wan Kenobi telling us, ‘These are not the droids you’re looking for’. Indeed, he even knew Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, ‘Was not that passionate about football. He loves golf’’. And that he would be ‘key to the offense’. Even with a dodgy back, and in just three quarters of the game, he was indeed, just that. So the Cowboys brought my jam-packed long weekend of settee-hugging sport on the telly to an end with a victory over the Jaguars. Three days that were not so much a sprint, more a triathlon.","It had been billed as a 24-hour special of televised sport .

"An anti-wrinkle cream said to be so effective it has convinced women not to have cosmetic surgery is going on sale this week. During tests it was said to have reduced the signs of ageing in just seven days. That could explain why 60,000 are said to have signed up for it on waiting lists. 'Miracle' ingredient: Avon says A-F33 stops the slowdown in production of proteins that causes us to develop lines  and wrinkles . Avon, which is selling the cream for £30, says it contains an ingredient that boosts production of collagen and elastin, which give skin its youthful plumpness and elasticity. As we age, production of these proteins  rapidly slows, leaving us to develop lines  and wrinkles. Avon says A-F33, the cream’s ‘miracle’ ingredient, steps in to stop this slowdown. In tests, 69 women aged between 35 and 59 used the Anew Clinical Pro Line Corrector Treatment cream twice a day for 11 weeks. All claimed their wrinkles had been reduced, with some improvements noticeable in a week. Some even decided against cosmetic surgery after using it, the firm said. Dermatologists used a 3D imaging camera to look at the skin’s response and claimed the cream had thickened the epidermis – the outer layer of the skin. Another test on skin cells suggested they expressed more collagen and elastin after being treated with the cream. Samantha Bunting, a London cosmetic dermatologist who was not involved in the study, said: ‘It seems to deliver the kind of results I’m unaccustomed to seeing with other mass skincare brands. ‘It has great potential to work with other proven ingredients like vitamin-A derivatives and vitamin C, making this potentially one of the most exciting breakthroughs I’ve seen in recent years.’ Goodbye Botox? Some women involved in the product trial even decided against cosmetic procedures after using the cream . A-F33, which stands for Amino Fill 33, is a modified protein discovered by scientists in Princeton, US, and licensed to Avon. Dr Bunting said: ‘Loss of collagen occurs as we age, leading to a loss of firmness and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. ‘There are a number of ways to lose collagen – one important one is the failure of immature collagen strands to properly bond together into “ropes”. If this doesn’t happen properly the non-useful collagen piles up, doing nothing and then gets broken down. ‘This happens as we get older.  A-F33 seems to stimulate this process, unblocking this failure in the assembly line, so skin behaves more youthfully.’ Anthony Gonzalez from Avon’s research and development department said the ingredient had the power to change the way women look after their skin. ‘A-F33 is potentially as game changing in the fight against wrinkles as alpha hydroxyl acids (AHAs) and Retinol were in the 1990s,’ he said. The cream goes on sale on the Avon website on Friday or is available from the company’s famous Avon ladies. Fans include actress Anna Friel, 36, who said she noticed ‘an immediate difference to my skin which appeared smoother with a fabulous glow to it’.","Sixty thousand are said to have signed up for Avon's £30 anti-wrinkle cream which goes on sale this week .

"At half time on Sky Sports coverage of the Tyne & Wear derby from Newcastle, we were shown a small bronze bust of one of the City's favourite sons, Sir Bobby Robson. It appeared to capture almost perfectly the benign countenance that seemed to sum up his approach to football and his life. Although whether he would actually be looking quite so philosophical after losing at home to his deadly rivals, Sunderland, is likely another matter entirely. The reason we were being shown his statue was because that evening the channel premiered a new documentary that let us into the life and times of one our greatest managers, 'Once More For Bobby'. The statue of Sir Bobby Robson outside St James' Park captures perfectly his approach to life . It did this whilst also recounting the dogged two-wheeled journey undertaken by one of his former players, Robbie Elliott, to honour Sir Bobby's Foundation and raise money for other cancer charities. Along with his friend, triathlete Phil Gray, Robbie set out on a 3,500 mile bike ride that took in the clubs Sir Bobby managed across England and mainland Europe. And it was a journey that also worked perfectly as a metaphor for the years of endurance and triumph Sir Bobby put into both his work and also his very survival. Sir Bobby Robson is greeted by Alan Shearer, and applauded by the St James' faithful, soon before his death . Because for Robbie and Phil, across their 25 day vigil, there was plenty of flogging uphill, cruising down hill and lots of rocky roads along the way. In terms of the ride itself, it quickly became clear that this was never going to be a walk in the park, as it were. Perfectly illustrated one day in France when they encountered the freakish annual phenomenon of the 'black wind'. To wax lyrical once again, the boys may have been pulling up trees for their cause, but so was the mistral that swiped across the countryside through which they rode. As Elliot put it, 'we could have pushed the bikes faster'. Robson referred to his successful period as England manager as 'national service' Elliot, too, had his own personal issues and at one point had gone four days without being able to keep down food or water. He eventually found a doctor who was prepared to put down his pizza long enough to pump the former Newcastle defender with as many IVs as he could find lying around his surgery. In spite of rough conditions and ill health, the two still managed to complete their journey. And some of the most engaging images were seen during the final leg, on their return to home soil. All of which climaxed with an emotional appearance at St James Park, where earlier in the documentary we had also seen Sir Bobby being greeted by a packed house of Geordies and two teams of retired stars, just five days before he died. Narrated by actor and arch fan Tim Healy, 'Once More For Bobby' isn't just a road movie, though. It also contains interviews with men who had first hand knowledge of Sir Bobby. And all of them couldn't have been more grateful for that fact. The best moments from the show are insights into the manager's relationships, including with wife Elsie . Paul Gascoigne said 'he was like a second dad to us'. At Camp Nou, former Barcelona player Ramon Alfonseda spoke strongly of his 'values'. Andre Villas-Boas explained how as a seventeen year old, Sir Bobby invited him to meet him the following morning, after a chance encounter, so that he could go to training with him. Both Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker suggested they owed their playing careers to him. His surgeon Huw Davies observed 'short of chaining him to a bed' he couldn't have stopped Sir Bobby working during his horrible illnesses because he had 'so much drive'. Journalist and patron of the Foundation George Caulkin spoke of his incredible success as an English manager abroad: 'How many (achieved) at the level he did? Well, none'. Paul Gascoigne cries during a memorial service for the manager who had such an impact on those he met . But the most important words came from Robson himself, taken from his autobiography and spoken by actor Stephen Tompkinson. They provided lovely little insights into such things as his life with his beloved wife Elsie, his relationships with various players and clubs and colleagues ( '(Jose Mourinho) was under my wing for six years - he was exceptionally loyal and watched my back'), his 'eight seasons of national service' as England manager, and how, on being asked to manager Newcastle, 'the North East was calling me back. I was on my way home'. Not that the film always hits the target. Perhaps because of logistical or financial restraints, we didn't have the opportunity to see Robbie, in particular, interact with any of the contributors, or indeed fans at the various locations along the way, something that would have given the documentary a warmer, more personal touch and not make it feel quite so compartmentalized. Five years after his death, the new documentary is a fiiting tribute to one of football's greatest men . At times, too, there was just too much cycling to music, and not enough interaction between the friends. But really, their effort, coupled with both the cause and the story behind it is enough to make this a most engaging piece of television indeed. And five years on from his passing, it provides a timely reminder that this most affable and down-to-earth of football men really did know, and love, his business.","'Once More For Bobby' documents the life and times of Sir Bobby Robson .

"Stuart Lancaster’s quest to make light of England’s injury crisis received support from an unlikely source at Wednesday’s RBS 6 Nations launch. Lancaster was forced to repeatedly clarify the latest medical bulletins and confirm that four more leading men — Tom Wood, Brad Barritt, Geoff Parling and Kyle Eastmond — have been ruled out of the championship opener against Wales in Cardiff a week on Friday. In fact, it remains unclear whether any of that wounded quartet will be fit for the home encounter with Italy eight days later, while the prospects of Wood and Eastmond being ruled out of the entire tournament cannot be discounted. England are already without Owen Farrell, Manu Tuilagi, Ben Morgan, Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury, but there is no doom and gloom. Tom Wood has an ankle injury which will rule him out of England's clash with Wales . Injury victim Brad Barritt (left) and Billy Vunipola (right) spoke at Pennyhill Park as England trained on Tuesday . Kyle Eastmond (right) is still not fully fit as he recovers from a shoulder injury . Mark Cueto, scorer of the try that never was in England’s 2007 World Cup final defeat by South Africa in Paris, will retire at the end of this season. The Sale wing, 35, who toured with the Lions in 2005, is the Aviva Premiership’s most prolific try-scorer with 87. He said: ‘In my head, I could carry on playing forever, but the body is not doing what the mind tells it to.’ Cueto, who scored 20 tries in 55 games for England, crossed in the 2007 final only for TV referee Stuart Dickinson to say his foot had touched a line. Lancaster’s enduring optimism was endorsed by none other than his Wales counterpart, Warren Gatland, who isn’t convinced by talk of a crisis. Such is the depth of Test-class English talent that he believes they will pose a formidable threat at the Millennium Stadium, whoever they select. ‘England have a huge amount of depth in a lot of positions,’ he said. ‘It doesn’t matter what team England put out, they are going to be strong. We saw that last summer where they were able to put out a different team against the All Blacks and did exceptionally well. ‘The challenge for us is to make sure we don’t allow the (England) injuries to become a distraction and people talk us up too much. England have a few injuries but they have options and can play different types of games.’ Lancaster and his assistants have been assailed by bad news at an especially bad time, as they prepare for their last championship campaign before this year’s home World Cup. Being deprived of so many front-line players is far from ideal, but the head coach delivered a typically upbeat assessment — albeit ‘through gritted teeth’ — after a weekend of setbacks. Wales captain Sam Warburton (left) and England skipper Chris Robshaw (right) with the Six Nations trophy . Owen Farrell (left) and Brad Barritt (right) will miss England opening Six Nations owing to injury . ‘It was a tough weekend watching the games and you sit there with your fingers crossed,’ he said. ‘Unfortunately three or four big players got varying degrees of injury which is hugely disappointing. I had a look at the pack and there’s still a lot of strength in depth, more so than in the backs, where some decisions need to be made.’ Lancaster has a point about the pack — there are countless prime contenders. Wood is awaiting specialist advice regarding his ankle injury but the head coach said ‘we can safely assume he’ll struggle to be available for Wales’. Yet, there is a ready-made replacement blindside flanker in the imposing shape of James Haskell — arguably in the form of his life as Wasps captain and someone who the management would have been tempted to select in the starting XV anyway. Wasps' captain James Haskell (left) is in great form for his club and will comfortably slot in at blindside flanker . The second-row void is more problematic as the coaches are without three key men: Parling, Lawes and Launchbury. Dave Attwood is a shoo-in starter, with George Kruis of Saracens likely to partner him, straight after finishing a ban for a dangerous tackle. He made a strong impression during the autumn, but the Millennium Stadium will provide a fervent test of his credentials. Further forward, Leicester prop Dan Cole is on course to be fit for next week and it is understood he will be thrust straight back into action as a bench reserve, ahead of Kieran Brookes. The loss of Eastmond is a blow, but in truth he was unlikely to start at inside centre while his Bath colleague, George Ford, is wearing No 10. Barritt’s absence will be keenly felt and Lancaster is now likely to reunite Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell in midfield, despite their patchy form and the compelling case being made by Jonathan Joseph for a recall in the wider channel. Despite losing Kyle Eastmond through injury Bath No 10 George Ford was already a favourite to start . Gatland identified England’s heroic display with a weakened team against the All Blacks in Auckland last June as a reason to be wary of whatever line-up they muster on February 6. Lancaster added: ‘Injuries are not something we focus on within our camp. We are confident we are still going to have a pretty good team.’ Kiwi Gatland is fond of underdog status, but Wales will surely relinquish that to England next week. They will be at home and more or less at full strength, unlike their decimated rivals. But Gatland is right to exercise caution. The visitors will be a force to be reckoned with, whoever is wearing white on the night.","Warren Gatland will not get complacent following England's latest injuries .

"Mark Zuckerberg's sister has defended her decision to publish two children's books encouraging people to stay away from social media - even if it doesn't fit with her brother's business plan. Randi Zuckerberg, 31, worked at Facebook in its formative years, serving as marketing director for six years before leaving in 2011 to strike out on her own. She says her brother Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is 'supportive' of her latest enterprises, both of which are released today. Social media maven: Zuckerberg has written two books about navigating social media . Meet Dot: Randi Zuckerberg, older sister of Facebook founder Mark, has written a children's book about a girl named Dot who needs to learn how to live without technology . Working together: Ms Zuckerberg (left) worked at her little brother Mark's (right) company in it's early years, serving as the director of market development and spokesman for Facebook . Since . leaving Facebook in 2011 she has formed Zuckerberg Media, a media and . production company that so . far has a failed Silicon Valley reality show under its belt, had a . child and produced the two books based on her ruminations on lifestyle . and technology. Given Zuckerberg's familial relations and work . history, it has been noted that it seems disingenuous to take critical stance on a culture that she herself helped create. In . Dot, a picture book illustrated by Joe Berger, a small girl named Dot . who apparently spends all her time on social media - she 'knows how to . tap . . . to swipe . . . to share' - has her iPad taken away from her by . her mother. And in Dot Complicated, Zuckerberg covers how . technology relates to etiquette, privacy, family and career, with tips . and anecdotes interspersed. Among other social media gaffes, Zuckerberg advises against oversharing, which she says 'can rob your partner of intimacy, as well as annoy your friends.' In an interview with SF Gate she said she saw how easy it was to be consumed by silicon valley. 'It's easy, in Silicon Valley, to become absorbed in what we're building. It's important to raise your head and see the big picture. If I hadn't had a son, I'd probably still be there working 90 hours a week on projects, and be happy there.' And writing her books she reveals how she relished the chance to turn off the technology. 'Gradually, over the course of a month, I loved being unreachable,' she told the paper. 'I saw that the world didn't end if I waited to respond to an e-mail in six hours, rather than six minutes.' As . someone who has committed her fair share of social media faux pas, . Zuckerberg feels she's uniquely qualified to write about navigating . technology. New book: Randi Zuckerberg's guide to navigating our increasingly connected world . 'Personally, along with being part of the team that . built Facebook from early on, I also grew up on social media,' she told . CNET. 'If people can learn from my mistakes, or feel more of a . sense of connection with what I’m saying because I’ve shown some . vulnerability, then I think we’re at a better starting point.' Among other suggestions, Zuckerberg writes, in a sentiment many will agree with, 'Just because you can document your every waking moment doesn’t mean you should.'She . told the San Francisco Chronicle that she never intended to be a social . media doyenne, but found that the same questions kept arising . everywhere she went. 'I did a lot of public speaking last . year, and no matter where I went, people always asked the same . questions: how can I better understand what my children are doing . online? How can I ask my significant other not to immediately reach for . their tablet in bed? How can I make sure I don't lose my job to someone . who is younger and more tech-savvy?'She gathered their business cards and launched a newsletter, Dot Complicated, to address those topics. Many of those thoughts have been collected in the book, of which she says her family, including her brother Mark Zuckerberg, approves. My . goal with this book is to spark dialogue and inspire people of all ages . to embrace technology and the new sets of norms that come with sharing . content online - something my family has always been supportive of,' she . told CNET. Attached: Like many girl her age, Dot loves technology - especially her tablet . Time to play: When Dot's tablet is taken away, she's challenged to find other ways to have fun . Recharged: But Dot soon finds other activities - like painting and playing with her dog - that entertain her just as much . Zuckerberg says the idea for the . children's book came after talking with other parents who were worried . about the affect new technology is having on the quality of their . children's lives. 'Dot loves technology. A LOT,' explains Ms Zuckerberg on her blog.

"The story of how fugitive Edward Snowden leaked classified documents on state surveillance is to be made into a film by Oscar-winning director, Oliver Stone. Stone, 67, known for tackling controversial topics with movies including Platoon, Born On The Fourth Of July, and Nixon, will base his film on The Snowden Files, the book about the scandal by British journalist Luke Harding. It will tell the story of the American defence contractor who stole hundreds of thousands of documents exposing spying by the US National Security Agency (NSA) and other state spy agencies, including Britain's GCHQ. Film director Oliver Stone, 67, left, is to make a thriller about how Edward Snowden, 30, leaked state secrets . NSA executive Rick Ledgett, who assessed the damage done by Snowden's leaks, said the stolen files contained 'the keys to the kingdom', while MI5 director Andrew Parker called it 'a gift to terrorists'. Wanted by US authorities on spy charges punishable by 30 years in prison, Snowden went on the run, and has now sought temporary asylum in Russia. Stone, who will direct the film with Moritz Borman as producer, said: 'This is one of the greatest stories of our time.' The Snowden scandal began a year ago when the 30-year-old computer genius leaked details of attempts by government agencies to illegally view citizens’ private information, claiming that people's internet history, emails, text messages, calls and passwords had been harvested. The defence contractor, who had worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) also made the highly damaging revelation that the US had hacked Chinese computers, and the communications of allies such as Germany and France. The computer specialist, who worked at an intelligence centre in Hawaii, tricked colleagues into handing over passwords so he could copy up to 1.7million files in one of the biggest leaks in US history, on a par with WikiLeaks whistleblower Bradley Manning. The National Security Agency (NSA) headquarters in Maryland: Details of its spying programmes were leaked . The leak began this time last year when he met American journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, telling them he had 'sensitive documents' he would like to share. After handing over NSA documents, he revealed himself publicly as the source, before fleeing American justice to Russia.  Snowden is now living there on a one-year temporary asylum, granted last August. Some, including Stone, hailed Snowden as a hero for lifting the lid on government surveillance. Stone said: 'He revealed secrets that we should all know, that the United States has repeatedly violated the fourth amendment.' But many accused him of putting people's lives at risks with his betrayal. NSA executive Rick Ledgett, in charge of assessing the damage, said the stolen files contained ‘the keys to the kingdom’, while MI5 director general Andrew Parker called it a ‘gift to terrorists’. Journalists from British newspaper the Guardian, which reported the leaked documents, will be involved in the making of Stone's film, which they hope will not flop like The Fifth Estate did, the 2013 film starring Benedict Cumberbatch based on Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange. Editor Alan Rusbridger said: 'The story of Edward Snowden is truly extraordinary, and the unprecedented revelations he brought to light have for ever transformed our understanding of, and relationship with, government and technology.' The film will start shooting before the end of the year. While Stone will have a host of Hollywood stars to choose from when casting for an actor to play Snowden, he will have his work cut out for him choosing someone to portray Guardian editor, Alan Rusbridger. The privately educated 60-year-old was criticised after he published documents leaked to his newspaper by Snowden and then destroyed computer hard drives containing the information, rather than handing them over as requested by government authorities. Rusbridger, who earns £395,000 as editor of the Guardian, is said to be involved in the making of the film as a consultant, but is not expected to play himself in the movie. Hugh Grant, 53, who is not known for his love of a free press, would be the flattering choice, while other - likely and less likely - candidates could include tousle-haired Alan Davies, 48, or even (provided he shaved first), would-be journalist, Russell Brand, 38. If Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, left, features in Stone's film, would Hugh Grant be picked to play him? Tousle-haired Alan Davies, left, looks most like Rusbridger, but Russell Brand could be a left-field choice .","Snowden, 30, leaked documents from state spy agencies including GCHQ .

"Here's your guide to working out just how much you hate Manchester United: . If you think Wayne Rooney should have stayed on his feet and let a reckless 6ft 4in, 17-stone goalkeeper shatter his ankle with his wild two-footed lunge then you really do hate Manchester United. If you're re-writing the offside law claiming Ander Herrera's goal shouldn't have stood, you hate United. Wayne Rooney touched the ball past Preston goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckman during the FA Cup clash . Rooney went down a moment after and several of the Preston players were unhappy with his actions . Rooney lies down on the ground before the penalty is given by the referee late on at Deepdale . Rooney scored from the spot to put Manchester United 3-1 up against Preston . Manchester City are shovelling money into Stevan Jovetic's bank account for nothing . If Arsenal  were as good as their fans would have us believe, the Gunners would be top and favourites for the Champions League . Tim Sherwood requires a superhuman effort to restore past glories to Aston Villa . West Ham are on the verge  but Big Sam's lack of empathy for fans holds them back . If you think Marouane Fellaini has fouled his marker before he slams home the second then you hate United. If you were desperate for Preston to hold on to their lead and felt immense disappointment bordering on physical pain when Herrera, Fellaini and then Rooney scored their goals then you hate Manchester United. If you are focusing on United not playing fluent football, and completely ignoring the fact that they have lost one game in 19, almost as if you're trying to convince yourself that run isn't true, then you hate United. If your focus is on Radamel Falcao not playing well then you're borderline obsessed with him, and you hate Manchester United. Ander Herrera has his shot while Rooney (left) stands in an offside position but does not touch the ball . Herrera runs away in celebration as the referee lets the goal stand while Preston remain unhappy . Herrera scored to make it 1-1 as United went on to win the FA Cup tie and avoid an upset . If you're desperately trying to manufacture more statistics and evidence that show just how much better United were under David Moyes than they are now under Louis van Gaal, then you've got too much time on your hands, and you hate Manchester United. If the success of your season is based on them going out of the FA Cup and dropping out of the top four rather than anything your own club might do, then you have an irrational hatred of United. If you've suddenly adopted a philosophy this season that winning a cup tie isn't as important as playing brilliant football during that tie, then you hate United. If you are focusing on United's negatives after Van Gaal's side made it through yet another away tie then you must be wondering how on earth your team is below United in the Premier League table. And you hate United. Marouane Fellaini smashes home his goal to make it 2-1 to United en route to their victory . Fellaini scores to give United the lead as they turn the game on its head at Deepdale . Fellaini celebrates as United progressed through the FA Cup tie to the quarter-finals despite an earlier scare . Fellaini and Ashley Young celebrate as United take the lead in the FA Cup tie . If you keep saying United are terrible then you are trying to convince yourself they are terrible. Which is a bit weird. They're not great, but they're not terrible. This also means you hate United. If you've experienced untold voyeuristic joy since Sir Alex Ferguson left and United fell a third of the way down the table, then you hate Manchester United. If you are hammering home (to anyone who can't get away from you quick enough) a point about how much money United have spent, thinking that football is played on a computer screen and not on grass, then you hate United. When a club is as successful as Manchester United have been it's understandable that jealousy kicks in among supporters of lesser clubs, and that transforms itself into hatred. United manager Louis van Gaal pictured at Deepdale as his side beat Preston to make the quarter-finals . I don't know how United's season will finish, but my opinion is that if they end up outside the top four – even if they improve on last season's seventh place – then Van Gaal has failed. If they win the FA Cup it's a bonus, but United's season isn't about that. It's about getting back into the Champions League. United want to win the FA Cup of course, but the bigger clubs don't define true success around that competition. After the calamity of last season, Van Gaal was tasked with rebuilding. Helicoptering in a few expensive signings was only part of the rebuild for a club not used to dealing with failure on the scale they suffered last season. In simple terms, there is no fear factor with United anymore – that went last season with Moyes' side capitulating regularly. Look at Preston: they were woefully insipid in both legs of their Johnstone's Paint Trophy area final against Walsall recently, and missed the chance to get to Wembley. Van Gaal applauds at full-time after seeing off Preston as United continued their run in the FA Cup . United are in the FA Cup quarter-finals and are still on course to make the top four in the Premier League . But give them an FA Cup tie against Manchester United and all of a sudden they become a different side. And what about Cambridge United? They put so much effort into that 0-0 draw against Van Gaal's side they haven't won a game since. I get the tribalism of football, and I totally get that thousands and thousands of fans are absolutely desperate for United's misery to continue. But I also get that while Van Gaal's United are not going to be remembered as brilliant, he's got them back into the top four. Whether the Manchester United haters can accept it or not, if the Dutchman keeps United in the top four come the end of the season, he has hit the target most United fans would have set him at the start of the campaign. And if that happens, no amount of spin and nonsense about Rooney allegedly diving, United playing the long ball or Van Gaal being worse than Moyes will make the United-haters' summer any more bearable.","Manchester United beat Preston 3-1 at Deepdale in the FA Cup fifth round .

"Tim Sherwood is a man who likes a challenge. He must be some sort of Superhero. Skipper little Blackburn Rovers to the Premier League title? Captain Fantas-Tim did it. Get an 18-month deal out of Daniel Levy knowing there is no chance you’ll see more than one-third of it through? SuperTim sorted it. Tim Sherwood will need to have superhuman abilities to restore the glory years at Aston Villa . Sherwood faces a relegation struggle but Villa's FA Cup progress is something to cling on to . Get a decent game out of Emmanuel Adebayor? The Sher-manator managed it. Salute a footballer in front of thousands of people but somehow keep your reputation intact? Sher-Wolverine did it. Kind of. Instead of a cape, he wears a gilet. But succeeding at this latest challenge for Tim will be like achieving the impossible. Managing Aston Villa has now become the job nobody can do. He has an owner with a much-reduced level of interest to match the much-reduced budget. But at the same time he has a set of fans who understandably but unrealistically demand good football, success and a challenge towards the top end of the table. They expect to be in the top six, not the bottom three. Sherwood captained Blackburn Rovers to the Premier League title in 1995 . Sherwood also managed to get the best out of striker Emmanuel Adebayor during his time at Tottenham . Villa have slipped into the relegation zone and face a fight to retain their Premier League status . We’ll never know if Paul Lambert was destined to take Villa down, but he had lost his way. Bringing in Roy Keane, who subsequently upset some players, almost certainly changed the squad’s view of Lambert, and precipitated his departure. Sherwood needs to keep players onside – it will be interesting to see if he does that: remember his blast at Tottenham players after their defeat at Chelsea? He needs to get Villa playing a bit of football, scoring goals and in the short term, keep them up. If he’s confident of doing that then he should absolutely go all out to win the FA Cup. If he does that then that creates a bit of history nobody can ever take away from him. And Villa fans love a bit of history. A trip to Villa Park will leave you in no doubt this is a big club. Reminders of the title win in 1981 and the European Cup win the year after are everywhere – as they should be. Paul Lambert was sacked as Villa manager on February 11 after nearly three years in charge . Lambert's decision to bring in Roy Keane as his assistant caused more divisions in the squad . But times are tough right now, and the recent memory of their inferior city rivals Birmingham even managing to win a trophy at Wembley makes the taste of failure even worse. Aston Villa don’t get enough credit for that 1982 European glory. They’re the English success story from that era that fell down the back of the sofa while everyone was too busy listening to the great Brian Clough deliver endless soundbites at Forest or watching the glorious Liverpool side. Somehow they kept the goal machines of Bayern Munich – they’d scored seven in the semi-final – quiet. The tournament’s top three scorers – Dieter Hoeness, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Paul Breitner - all drew a blank that night in Rotterdam, against a rookie keeper in Nigel Spink, on for the injured Jimmy Rimmer after just nine minutes. Those glories are light years away of course. Jimmy Rimmer (left) and Nigel Spink show off the European Cup after Villa's triumph over Bayern in 1982 . Peter Withe (left), manager Tony Barton (middle) and Spink bring home the trophy from Rotterdam . But bear this in mind: title-winning manager Ron Saunders left in February 1982, and Tony Barton took over with the club already into the quarter-finals of the European Cup which they went on to win. Paul Lambert has just gone – it’s February. And Tim Sherwood takes over with the club already into the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. It’s not quite that great Villa side of 1982 with the leadership of Dennis Mortimer, the vision of Gordon Cowans, the goals of Gary Shaw and Peter Withe, and the wing wizardry of Tony Morley. But it might possibly be some sort of omen for Villa fans to cling on to. They’re so desperate right now they’ll cling on to any sort of hope they can find. Scott Sinclair (left) celebrates with Tom Cleverley and Alan Hutton after scoring in the Cup against Leicester . Leandro Bacuna (right) celebrates with Cleverley after scoring Villa's opener against Leicester on Sunday . Can Tim Sherwood boldly go on mission impossible once again? Or will his gilet self-destruct in five seconds? We salute you Tim for stepping up to the Villa plate and trying to become football’s own comic book hero – take Villa back to the big time and you’ll be better than SuperMan. In fact you’ll become SuperManager. Just don’t appoint Roy “Kryptonite” Keane as your assistant.","Tim Sherwood was announced as new Aston Villa boss this week .

"It's been a tough autumn for England but I am delighted and much encouraged that they saved their best for last and emerged as convincing winners in what, let’s face it, was a must-win game. If Stuart Lancaster’s men continue to play to their strengths and improve, they are going to be a massively difficult team to beat at Twickenham in the World Cup. With that pack at full tilt, nobody is going to relish playing them and they need to show that again when they next pull on the white shirt, against Wales in Cardiff in their next fixture on February 6. What an interesting Friday night that will be. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: England 26-17 Australia . England players celebrate Ben Morgan's second try at Twickenham against Australia on Saturday . Morgan gives out a scream of joy after barrelling over the line to score England's first try . The England scrum was dominant on Saturday and epitomised the formidable Red Rose pack . Captain Chris Robshaw (centre) celebrates victory with props David Wilson (left) and Kieran Brookes . Brad Barritt: I’ve always seen Brad Barritt as an inside centre but I thought he was magnificent at 13 on Saturday and his bloodied face summed up England’s effort. On days when they are playing a more limited game-plan, he can be very effective indeed at outside centre. Make no mistake, the pressure was on England on Saturday and pretty much across the board everybody stepped up to the plate. It wasn’t always pretty but wins against world-class rugby sides aren’t always things of beauty. It was, however, a very well thought out and crafted performance and England made sure they played to their strengths for as long as possible. The single biggest improvement from the New Zealand, South Africa and Samoa matches was in England’s kicking game, which was unrecognisable from earlier this month. England were intelligent. George Ford enjoyed another fine game and kicked well while Ben Youngs really came to the party, launching a number of high balls and box kicks landing just outside the 22 or deliberately keeping the ball in play to maintain pressure on Australia. England head coach Stuart Lancaster (second right), pictured with (from left) coaches Mike Catt, Graham Rowntree and Andy Farrell, has a formidable pack now and he can build from their with his side . George Ford kicks a penalty against Australia at Twickenham during the November international on Saturday . There was even at least one good old fashioned ‘up and under’. Execute them well and they always cause problems. This much improved kicking was backed up by a well organised kick-chase game with Jonny May and Anthony Watson using their pace to hound the Wallabies and challenge for the high ball. If you do those basics exceptionally well you are always going to give yourself a chance. England must not rest on their laurels here. Their kicking game earlier this month was very poor and they need to reproduce Saturday’s quality on a regular basis. They need to fully appreciate that a complete kicking game is an important attacking weapon, not a negative tactic. It was a pretty impressive defensive effort as well because Australia, who badly needed a win themselves, definitely turned up to play and there is no more dangerous back division in world rugby when they go hunting for tries. The official stats show that England made 158 tackles to Australia’s 48 and though I don’t remember them being under the pump to quite that extent, a stack of tackling had to be done at key times. Brad Barritt, pictured tackling Australia's Quade Cooper, put in one of his best performances for England . The centre is led off the field by physio Phil Park (left) as being bloodied and bruised during the match . We saw the true value of Brad Barritt in organising the defensive line behind the scrum and with the way he put his body on the line. The Saracen centre had one of his finest Test displays and though midfield is clearly an area where England have yet to find a settled combination he stated his case strongly. Elsewhere, it’s difficult to look beyond the England pack. They have been formidable over the past four weekends and it is worth emphasising they were unable to consider six Lions forwards from 2013 - Alex Corbisiero, Tom Youngs, Dan Cole, Mako Vunipola, Geoff Parling and Tom Croft. I also consider Joe Launchbury to be right up there in terms of quality. I am a great believer in not making injury excuses - go with your best available team and get judged from that. But what a strong position to be in come the Six Nations if four or five of those are fit again. This pack will only get stronger and should give England a rock solid foundations going forward. England's scrum was dominant and was the cornerstone of their victory over Australia . Northampton and England blindside Tom Wood feeds Ben Youngs after a clean take at lineout time . WINNERS . 1) JOE MARLER (PROP) Has come of age this November and stormed through four tough Tests with flying colours. Strong scrummager, good around the park. Still young but Quins captaincy has matured him. Joe Marler (centre) impressed for England this autumn and has really improved and matured . 2) GEORGE FORD (FLY HALF) Along with Danny Cipriani, the best attacking option England have at fly-half. Has made a very accomplished start. Needs to build on that - beginning against Wales in Cardiff. Ford (left) has established himself as one of the most exciting No 10s in England right now . 3) BEN MORGAN (NO 8) Missed out initially to Billy Vunipola but has taken his chances well. Morgan is a big and dangerous ball carrier who knows where the try-line is and now fit enough to make that count for 80 minutes. Morgan was extremely impressive and is a very dangerous ball carrier for England . LOSERS . 1) OWEN FARRELL (FLY HALF) I’m a big Farrell fan, I love his abrasiveness and big-match goal-kicking - but he is a 12 now for England. Didn’t look match-fit going into the autumn and maybe shouldn’t have been picked. Owen Farrell (right) has been out of form and low on fitness and is now a No 12 option for England . 2) DANNY CARE (SCRUM HALF) Still one of the best two scrum-halves in England but took a backward step this month. Must get back into the groove with Quins and ‘go again’. At his best, an important player for England. Danny Care is still one of the best two scrum halves in England but he needs to find his form again . 3) BILLY VUNIPOLA (NO 8) A considerable talent but not fit and fast enough yet to make an impact at elite level. England’s backrow lacks a little pace and they can not afford another slow unit. Must work on his conditioning. Billy Vunipola has lost his place in the England side and needs to improve his fitness to get it back .","England beat Australia 26-17 at Twickenham on Saturday .

"There were three main incidents at Anfield on Tuesday night - one given as a penalty, and the other two waved away. Liverpool came from behind to rescue a deserved draw against Chelsea in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg, leaving an important clash at Stamford Bridge to decide the tie. Here, Sportsmail's Graham Poll mulls over the three main refereeing calls from the match. Thibaut Courtois appeared to handle the ball outside his 18-yard area but was not penalised for it . Martin Atkinson was correct to give Courtois the benefit of the doubt as he could not get his hands away . The Kop screamed for handball as Thibaut Courtois slid out of his penalty area but referee Martin Atkinson, perhaps unsighted waved appeals away. When a keeper leaves his area you treat him as an outfield player and as his weight was on his arms again he couldn’t get his arm away and the ball hit him. Lazar Markovic (left), Can and Gerrard appeal loudly after Diego Costa appeared to handle the ball in his area . Costa - lying on the ground - seemed to drag the ball back, but Atkinson got it right again as it wasn't deliberate . Consistency again from Atkinson as he viewed Diego Costa the same way. Costa was on the floor inside his own penalty area when the ball hit his arm. With his weight on his arm he couldn’t move it and Atkinson was right not to give a penalty as it must be a deliberate offence. Jose Mourinho might want to reflect on refereeing consistency as Dowd saw a similar incident the same way when Chelsea lost at White Hart Lane. Atkinson was also perfectly placed with a clear view to point to the penalty mark when Emre Can tripped Eden Hazard. It was a clumsy, late challenge and a clear foul.

"A new book that paints an unprecedented picture of female sexuality and contains explosive theories regarding sexuality and desire may strike fear in the heart of every heterosexual male. Journalist Daniel Bergner's book 'What Women Want: Adventures in the Science of Female Desire' uses groundbreaking research to reveal that even in our enlightened and permissive culture, female sexuality and desire is completely misunderstood - by both men and women. The book explains that research into the area of female desire and sexuality has been . shaped by gender stereotypes and how cultural ideals of female . sexuality have repressed and even reshaped women's desires and their sex lives. Daniel Bergner, right, drew on research and interviews with behavioral scientists, psychologists, sexologists and everyday women to write an insightful new book that challenges ideas about female sexuality and desire . 'What Women Want', which began life as an article in the New York Times Magazine in 2009, claims that despite much evidence suggesting female sexuality is every bit as strong and desire-driven as male sexuality, if not more so, research into female sexuality in both the animal and human realms has been blind to evidence of female lust and and unreserved sexual behavior. In fact, Bergner found that female sexuality is everything we tell ourselves about male sexuality - that it's base, ravenous and animalistic - is true of female sexuality. Certain qualities society has traditionally attributed to women - that they are inherently and biologically better suited to monogamy, that women's desires are based in romantic love - are 'scarcely more than a fairy tale', writes Bergner. 'Women are supposed to be the standard’s more natural allies, caretakers, defenders,' Bergner writes, 'their sexual beings more suited, biologically, to faithfulness.' Revelation: Bergner says female sexuality is not the rational, civilized and balancing force we've long thought it to be . Bergner told Salon.com that he was struck by 'the distance between reality and the fable that we’ve been taught most recently by evolutionary psychology, that is, that men are driven to spread their seed and women, by comparison, are more driven to find one good provider, and that, therefore... women are much better suited to monogamy.' The idea of women being passive and men being the initiators of sexual contact is also a myth, both in the human and the animal worlds, says Bergner. He mentions the case of the rhesus monkey, Deirdrah, who upon observation could be seen relentlessly stalking the object of her desire. Deirdrah the rhesus monkey showed researcher Meredith Chivers that primate sexuality is not dominated by males . 'For decades,' Bergner told Salon.com, 'despite evidence to the contrary, scientists had painted . primate sex as male dominated. Males are the initiators; females the . sort of almost indifferent receivers,' when evidence showed this clearly wasn't the case. Women's sexual desires and fantasies are often submissive or passive, says Bergner, and he believes 'the force of culture has, to some degree, inverted things' in terms of how women think about themselves and sex. 'The force of culture puts some level of shame on women’s sexuality and a fantasy of sexual assault is a fantasy that allows for sex that is completely free of blame,' Bergner told Salon.com. Desire: Bergner says the idea that women are biologically better suited to monogamy than men is a 'fairytale' 'So that’s one reason. Another, which . [researcher, Marta] Meana brings up, and which I think is very . compelling, is this idea that the feeling of being desired is a very . powerful one, a very electrical one. And I think at least at the fantasy . level, that sense of being wanted, and being wanted beyond the man’s . self-control is also really powerful,' he said, addressing the idea of . submission fantasies. Researchers have also found intriguing disparities between women's minds and their bodies when it comes to sexuality. A . study by Meredith Chivers found that male and female subjects shown the . same series of videos had markedly different physical and mental . reactions. The videos . consisted of a heterosexual couple having sex, male and female . homosexual couples having sex, a woman masturbating, a man masturbating, . a naked chiseled man walking along the beach and a naked toned woman . doing calisthenics - and  a male and female bonobo monkey mating. Men who identified as straight were aroused mentally and physically by all the videos featuring women - bar the monkeys. 'Gay males were aroused in the opposite categorical pattern. Any expectation that the animal sex would speak to something primitive within the men seemed to be mistaken; neither straights nor gays were stirred by the bonobos,' Bergner wrote in the New York Times Magazine in 2009. But the female subjects of the study were not so straight forward. While they reported arousal at only traditional couplings . 'No matter what their self-proclaimed sexual orientation, [women] showed, on the whole, strong and swift genital arousal when the screen offered men with men, women with women and women with men. They responded objectively much more to the exercising woman than to the strolling man, and their blood flow rose quickly... though to a lesser degree than during all the human scenes except the footage of the ambling, strapping man — as they watched the apes.' Into film: Meredith Chiver has conducted groundbreaking research into female sexuality, but may be best known for creating 'bonono porn' Bergner said that when the women reported their mental arousal, 'mind and genitals seemed scarcely to belong to the same person.' All this goes to prove, believes Chivers, that when it comes to desire, women are as visually stimulated and more easily turned on than men. The idea that a woman needs to feel emotionally connected in order to feel attracted and aroused seems to be another story we tell ourselves about women. 'Being a human who is sexual, who is allowed to be sexual, is a freedom accorded by society much more readily to males than to females,' Terri Fisher, Professor of Psychology at Ohio State University tells Bergner in the book. Loved up: Research has show that female primates aren't backwards about coming forwards with their sexual desires for their fellow monkeys . Daniel Bergner's book is likely to shine light on the range and power of female sexuality for both men and women, which could prove confronting for some. Bergner says the idea that it's not only men who struggle with long-term monogamy may cause men to start worrying less about themselves and more about how their partners feel about monogamy. 'I just had two funny conversations,' Bergner told Salon.com. 'One with a male writer, a friend of mine, who said that reading the book had inspired deep concern, and another from an editor who said that it had scared the bejesus out of him. [Laughter] I laugh, but I think that maybe it should, and I hope that it at least lets us look past the blinders that we’ve had on.' 'What Women Want: Adventures in the Science of Female Desire' (Ecco) is out now and available in hardcover and digital editions.","New book draws on scientific research to prove that our ideas of female sexuality and desire are all wrong .

"You may be forgiven for thinking your car is secure, parked on your drive with the doors locked. But a security researcher has revealed how key fobs can be hacked wirelessly using an everyday laptop, transmitter and a bit of technical knowledge. Researcher Dr Silvio Cesare demonstrated the hack exclusively to Wired, ahead of presenting his findings at this week’s Black Hat conference in Las Vegas. Scroll down for video . The hack was demonstrated by security researcher Dr Silvio Cesare ahead of his talk at this week’s Black Hat conference in Las Vegas. Cesare used a software-defined radio to mimic the same frequency as a key fob. Using this frequency, he was able to guess the code that unlocked the car. Stock image pictured . Brute-force attacks are used to gain access to encrypted files, for example. Hackers know that there’s an encryption key that unlocks it, and to decrypt it, they can begin to try every possible password and see if that results in a decrypted file. This is done automatically, using calculations made by a computer program. It begins by trying one-digit passwords or codes before scrolling through longer combinations until it reaches the correct one. A ‘dictionary attack’ is similar, but uses words in a dictionary, or a list of commonly-used passwords, instead of all possible passwords. Dr Cesare’s hack involved mimicking the frequency used by key fobs, and wirelessly unlocking the car in  minutes. The equipment used in the hack included a software-defined radio, a transmitter, amplifier and antenna all connected to his laptop. His whole system cost $1,000 (£600) - but prices could be cheaper if different antennas and transmitters were used. The radio is designed to pick up frequencies across the FM, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range. In the video, Dr Cesare is shown using his laptop, with the antenna and amplifier, to transmit the same frequency used as the key fob. He then performed what’s known as a ‘brute force’ attack to correctly identify the code needed to force the fob to unlock the car. In theory, this could be performed with any key fob if the hacker was able to identify and attack the frequency it sits on. The car used in the attack has deliberately not been revealed, but Dr Cesare told Wired he has contacted the manufacturer, via the Australian Computer Emergency Response Team. Dr Cesare did caveat his discovery, however, by claiming it’s not as straightforward as it seems. Dr Cesare added that the hacker would need to pick up the car's unique unlock code by 'eavesdropping' on the frequency before being able to attack it . For example, the hacker would need to pick up the car's unique unlock code by 'eavesdropping' on the frequency. But, he noticed the code in his experiment could be used multiple times before it stopped working, so this eavesdropping could occur well in advance of the attack. This is the latest hack that exposes weaknesses in the technology being fitted to modern-day cars. In February, hackers demonstrated a homemade devices called the CAN Hacking Tool (CHT). The device can be fitted to any car's Controller Area Network 'within minutes' and run malicious code through the vehicle's system. Once hackers take hold of this network they can control lights, locks, steering and even brakes - and it costs just $20 (£12). Many cars come with built-in software that run on an operating system in a similar way to phones and computers. The CAN Hacking Tool (CHT) has four wires that are attached to the different outputs of a car's Controller Area Network. A 60p ($1) computer chip is used to bypass any encryption on the car before reading and writing data from the flash memory of the vehicle's engine control unit. In February, Spanish security researchers created the $20 (£12) CAN Hacking Tool (CHT) (pictured) - a device that can be fitted to any car's Controller Area Network 'within minutes' and run malicious code through the vehicle's system. Once hackers take hold of this network they control lights, locks, steering and brakes . Hacking tools can be attached to a car's Controller Area Network (CAN), pictured. This diagram shows the electronic layout of a typical car and the features controlled by the CAN are shown along the black lines including lights, climate, seats, heating and locks . The gadget is smaller than an iPhone, meaning it sits in the palm of the hacker's hand, and can be controlled remotely. Hackers can use any command they want to program an action via the CHT, and this includes disabling the brakes, deploying the airbag, locking the doors and enabling the alarm.","Hack was demonstrated to Wired by security researcher Dr Silvio Cesare .

"If Nigel Pearson survived telling a paying Leicester City fan to 'f*** off and die' from the touchline during a game at the King Power Stadium, it would be a surprise if he got the sack for grabbing an opposition player by the throat and refusing to let go of his shirt when he wanted to rejoin the game. It was a bizarre incident with James McArthur on Saturday as the Foxes lost to Crystal Palace, something Pearson could easily have avoided or laughed off. Instead he has added to his burgeoning reputation as something of a loose cannon. And that’s a shame. Nigel Pearson gets to grips with Crystal Palace's James McArthur during this by-now infamous incident . Pearson appeared in relaxed mood in front of the media on Monday after a bizarre turn of events at Leicester . Six years ago Pearson was in charge of Leicester City in the third tier of English football: they were losing at local rivals Peterborough United and couldn’t even win at Hartlepool, currently rooted to the bottom of the football league. The club has come a long way, and after a spell away from the East Midlands, Pearson returned to lead Leicester to the Premier League in some style. He did very well not just to guide the club to the top flight, but also to finally bury their reputation as chokers. Pearson needs to represent the club with much more class on the touchline, that’s for sure. But in my opinion he should be judged on the strikers he’s signed. Since sealing promotion Pearson has been given more money to spend than the other two promoted sides, yet Leicester are bottom. Pearson led Leicester to the Premier League promised land in his second stint in charge of the club . In the second full season of his second stint at  Leicester, Pearson led the Foxes to automatic promotion . Leonardo Ulloa came in from Brighton for a club record £8million last summer, and last month that record was broken again when Andrej Kramaric arrived for £9million. Ulloa started brightly but has scored just twice in his last 19 league appearances. Kramaric has yet to score, and after he was left out of the starting line-up on Saturday, Pearson explained that the Premier League is 'ridiculously quick', and his big signing 'needs time to adjust'. Leicester don’t have time, and with the strikers who took them up struggling – David Nugent has scored once since the win over Manchester United in September while Jamie Vardy has drawn a blank since that famous 5-3 victory – they need the record signings to deliver. Pearson has been given the money, and he has put his faith in these two strikers. If they deliver the goals to keep Leicester up he’s been a success, if they don’t score and the Foxes go down, Pearson will have failed. Tidying up his touchline act is the least of his concerns. After a promising start to life in the top flight, the goals have dried up for Roberto Ulloa (left) Andrej Kramaric (left) was bought for £9.5m in January to solve Leicester's lack of goalscoring prowess .","Pearson told a fan to 'f*** off and die' and grabbed Crystal Palace's James McArthur round the throat during Saturday's 1-0 defeat .

As with any other show we will be looking at the breaking news and issues of the day but there will be so much more. I’ve got about a million questions to ask him on all sorts of subjects including Manchester United, what went wrong in Brazil, and how long he can continue combining coaching with punditry. Neville is one of the English game's most decorated players following his long Manchester United career . You can listen to Neville from 4pm to 7pm and send in your questions using the hashtag #askgnev . But what I’m really looking forward to are the questions from the listeners: there were some sharp and intelligent ones posed to Hodgson when he came in, I’m expecting the same for Neville from the amazing talkSPORT faithful. So listen to the show and ask Neville that question you’ve always wanted to ask. A mutual friend of ours told me last week that Neville is nervous about working with me. No need to be Gary, although we may have one or two surprises planned for you.

"Controversy: Judge Nigel Peters has been criticised after describing a sex abuse victim as 'predatory' The paedophile spared jail after a judge said his 13-year-old victim was ‘predatory’ could still pose a risk to children, his own lawyer has revealed. It came as the Prime Minister condemned the description of the girl as a failure of the criminal justice system to 'stand up properly for victims'. Neil Wilson, 41, lured the teenager to his home where he watched her strip out of her school uniform before she performed a sex act on him. He was also found to have images of child abuse in his possession. But he received a suspended sentence on Monday by Judge Nigel Peters, who said the girl was ‘predatory' and 'egging you on’. The judge also said he took into account that the girl looked and behaved ‘a little bit older’. But as fury grew over the case, it emerged that during Wilson's sentencing, solicitor advocate Rebecca Blain said on his behalf: 'Police came to his house and he made lengthy admissions. 'He said he watches pornography and then told police he does watch hardcore porn but he had deleted them as they were not on his computer. 'He poses some risk but not an imminent risk and his treatment should be in the community and not in custody.' David Cameron said the description of the girl 'isn't . appropriate', adding: 'We need a criminal justice system that stands up properly . for victims. The victims of crime should always be at the centre of our . thinking.' Last night the Attorney General’s Office . confirmed that the sentence will be reviewed in response to a string of . complaints - a move which was welcomed by Mr Cameron today. Under fire: Judge Nigel Peters, originally from Hendon, north-west London, was pictured leaving Snaresbrook Crown Court today . That means a senior law officer will examine the punishment to see whether it was ‘unduly lenient’. If he considers it too soft, the sentence could be referred to the Court of Appeal to be increased. The Crown Prosecution Service described the language, also used by the prosecution counsel, as 'inappropriate', with a spokesman adding: 'The transgressor in this case was the defendant.' The CPS added today that is considering barrister Robert Colover's involvement  in sexual offence prosecutions and 'will not instruct him in any ongoing or future cases involving sexual offences in the meantime'. Mr Cameron added: 'The CPS themselves have said that . this isn’t appropriate, the Attorney General is going to look into the . case and we need a system that properly stands up for victims.' 'It . is appalling that after the scandals of Jimmy Savile and Rochdale these . awful Lolita prejudices are still being served up in court, and by the . prosecution of all people' Emily Thornberry MP, Labour's shadow Attorney General . The initial sentence sparked fury among children’s campaigners. Barnardo’s deputy director of strategy, Alison Worsley, condemned the sentence and the description of the victim in court. She said: ‘Children can never truly consent to their own abuse. It is plain wrong to imply in any . way that the experiences of sexually exploited children are something . they bring on themselves.’ And . Emily Thornberry MP, Labour's shadow Attorney General, said: 'It is . appalling that after the scandals of Jimmy Savile and Rochdale these . awful Lolita prejudices are still being served up in court, and by the . prosecution of all people.' Examination: The office of Attorney General Dominic Grieve has confirmed that the sentence will be reviewed in response to a string of complaints . Wilson met the schoolgirl when she asked him to buy cigarettes for her while she was playing truant. 'The girl was predatory and was egging you on' Judge Nigel Peters . Over two weeks, he bombarded her with phone calls and text messages, and she visited him at his home in Romford, Essex. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard that the abuse did not come to light until the girl – whose identity is protected – told a friend, who then called the police. Officers searched Wilson’s home and found a stash of images and videos depicting child abuse and bestiality. He pleaded guilty to two counts of downloading child pornography and one of sexual activity with a child. 'Inappropriate': Prime Minister David Cameron condemned the description of the girl as 'predatory' as a failure of the criminal justice system to 'stand up properly for victims' Sentencing Wilson - who now lives in York, North Yorkshire - on Monday, Judge Peters told him: ‘You have come as close to prison as is imaginable. 'The girl is predatory in all her actions and she is sexually experienced. She appeared to look around 14 or 15' Robert Colover, prosecuting . 'I have taken into account that even . though the girl was 13, the prosecution say she looked and behaved a . little bit older. 'You knew she was not nearly 16, as she said, and your . plea of guilty recognises that you knew. ‘Allowing her to visit your home is . something we have to clamp down on and in normal circumstances that . would mean a significant term in prison. Lenient: Paedophile Neil Wilson was spared a jail sentence at Snaresbrook Crown Court . ‘On these facts, the girl was predatory and was egging you on. That is no defence when dealing with children but I am prepared to impose a suspension.’ The eight-month term was suspended for two years – meaning Wilson will not go to jail as long as he commits no further crimes in that period. Judge Nigel Peters QC, 50, born in Hendon, north-west London, was called to the Bar in 1976 and took silk in 1997. He worked mainly as a criminal prosecutor at courts across London and became a recorder in 1998, regularly sitting at the Old Bailey. In his role as a part-time judge in 2011, he presided over the acquittal of perverted choirmaster Stephen Douglas-Hogg on child sex charges. Douglas-Hogg had already been jailed by a different judge for four-and-a-half years in 2009 after he admitted indecently assaulting five boys at St Paul’s Cathedral Choir School in the 1980s. Following his sentence, other former pupils came forward to say they had also suffered at his hands. They also claimed he involved his former colleague and partner Jane Violaris, 49, in creating an ‘atmosphere of intimidation and latent homosexuality’. She was cleared in 2010 on the direction of a judge at the Old Bailey and Hogg was due to face a retrial on charges of buggery and indecent assault. But following difficulties with witnesses, prosecutors decided to offer no evidence against Douglas-Hogg and Judge Peters ordered formal not guilty verdicts be recorded in February 2011. Shortly before his appointment to the circuit bench last year, he prosecuted former Essex cricketer Mervyn Westfield for match-fixing. Westfield was jailed for four months after he admitted accepting £6,000 from a gambling syndicate to bowl so that a specific number of runs would be chalked up in the first over of a match between Durham and Essex in September 2009. Judge Peters is a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord’s and serves as chairman of its membership committee. Before studying law at Leicester University, Judge Peters was educated at the Hasmonean Grammar School for Orthodox Jews in Barnet, north London. He will also face probation . supervision for three years, must allow police to examine his computer . and also attend a sex offenders’ programme. The prosecutor in the case will also . face scrutiny after he, too, appeared to suggest that it was at least . partly the girl’s fault. Mr Colover told the court that the sex act was ‘forced upon’ Wilson by the victim. He said: ‘The girl is predatory in all her actions and she is sexually experienced. She appeared to look around 14 or 15 and had the mental age of a 14- or 15-year-old despite being younger than that. ‘There was sexual activity but it was not of Mr Wilson’s doing. You might say it was forced upon him despite his being older and stronger than her.’ A spokesman for the Attorney General’s . Office said: ‘The case has been drawn to the attention of this office . as a possibly unduly lenient sentence. ‘This . means it’ll be considered  by a law officer (the Attorney or Solicitor . General) who will decide whether it should be referred to the Court of . Appeal under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme. ‘The . law officers have 28 days to make their considerations, this office . will ask the CPS for more information on the case and the decision will . be announced once all the information has been considered.’ A CPS spokesman added: 'The word predatory in this context should not have been used and is of real concern to the CPS. It is not consistent with the work that we have undertaken alongside the judiciary and others in the past year to improve attitudes towards victims of abuse. 'We expect all of our prosecutors, including self-employed barristers who act on our behalf, to follow our guidance in these very difficult cases. 'The director of public prosecutions (DPP) will be undertaking a review of this case to determine what happened and to decide what action needs to be taken. 'We are now considering the involvement of this barrister in sexual offence prosecutions and have advised his chambers that we will not instruct him in any on-going or future cases involving sexual offences in the meantime.' As well as receiving three complaints, the CPS has been confronted by a petition, with 15,000 signatures and counting, demanding the DPP Keir Starmer investigates the language used by Mr Colover. The petition was started by the founder of EveryDay Victim Blaming, who is known only as Jo. She said: ‘When I heard about this story it took me back to a very tough time in my life. I've moved on now - but I work with women and girls for whom the horror of sexual violence is still very real. ‘I started this Change.org petition because people in positions of power need to really understand how much harm they do by these kind of damaging, ill-informed and sexist comments.’","Judge Nigel Peters's comments condemned by campaigners and PM .

"A police force has been slammed for spending £5,000 on its latest weapon to fight crime - a flower garden. Officers from Avon and Somerset Police claim the initiative in St Andrew's Park, Bristol, has already had a 'remarkable effect' on reducing anti-social behaviour after it was unveiled last month. Nearly 15,000 seeds for 12 species, including poppies, cosmos and cornflowers, were paid for by police grant, and the force say it has helped 'sooth' would-be criminals. Flower power? Officers from Avon and Somerset Police claim the garden in St Andrew's Park, Bristol, has had a 'soothing' impact on would-be criminals . Criticisied: Nearly 15,000 seeds for 12 species were paid for by police grant . But yesterday pressure groups warned costs for schemes should not be allowed to spiral and instead should be spent on 'visible and available' policing. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'There’s nothing wrong with trying to improve an area’s image, but costs for schemes like this must be kept down. 'There could a temptation to spend even more taxpayers’ cash on it, but it’s crucial that as much money as possible is spent on visible and available policing in local areas.' It is set to be unveiled by Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens alongside local residents who claim the initiative has changed their life. Juliana Hounsfield, who lives nearby said: 'The effect has been absolutely extraordinary. 'It’s changed my life, everyone is taking pictures of the flowers, little children run through them, adults sit among them peacefully, no one can believe how beautiful it has become in short space of time. Trouble: The initiative was prompted by complaints of anti-social behaviour including drinking and vandalism . Change: The new garden was unveiled last month and residents say it has already had a 'remarkable impact' Transformation: Local residents and councillors had previously complained of loud music, vandalism, drunkenness and having their front gardens used as urinals . 'These flowers have had an extraordinary effect on everyone using the park.' Local residents and councillors had previously complained of loud music, vandalism, drunkenness and having their front gardens used as urinals. But since the seeding of the flowers earlier this year, they have reported a dramatic decrease in crime, claiming once the flowers bloomed the whole atmosphere changed. The scheme was devised by the Friends of St Andrew’s Park, Bishopston and Redland beat manager, PC Kevin Parsons, and the city council. It has been funded for three years with £5,000 from the Community Action Fund set up by Sue Mountstevens. Two-dimensional: An officer using a cardboard cutout . Last month it was revealed that police have spent more than £50,000 on cardboard cut-outs of themselves since 2008 - despite most forces admitting they do not know if they stop crime. The two-dimensional crime fighters are supposed to deter shoplifters and petrol thieves who think they are real PCs from a distance. But some have become victims of crime themselves after being stolen by pranksters or vandalised. Earlier this year, residents in Durham were left baffled after they noticed gnomes dressed in police uniforms lining the streets. The aim of the 10 ornaments was to act as the centrepiece of campaign to highlight the danger of theft, drink-driving and shoplifting. In 2010, police blew £1.5million on promotional gifts that were supposed to build links with the public. Critics pointed out the cost could have paid for an extra 29 beat officers and were condemned by campiagners as 'useless trinkets'. In 2009 police in Tiverton, Devon, were branded disgraces after they spray-painted their station in graffiti in a desperate attempt to engage with youngsters. In 2008, Hampshire Police and Portsmouth City Council launched their own version of police Top Trumps, because they wanted their officers to look 'cool'.","Officers say flowers in St Andrew's Park, Bristol, have 'soothed' criminals .

"Angela Merkel, who has publicly chastised the Greeks, will say she wants to keep their country in the euro when she visits Athens this week . German Chancellor Angela Merkel will tell Greeks she wants to keep their country in the euro when she visits Athens this week, but she faces a hostile reception from a people worn down by years of austerity and recession. Many Greeks blame Merkel, who has publicly chastised them for much of the past three years, for the nation's plight. Opponents, some of whom have caricatured her as a bullying Nazi, have promised protests on Tuesday during her first visit to Greece since the euro zone crisis erupted there in 2009. 'She does not come to support Greece, which her policies have brought to the brink. She comes to save the corrupt, disgraced and servile political system,"" said Alexis Tsipras, who leads the opposition Syriza alliance. ""We will give her the welcome she deserves.' About 6,000 policemen will be deployed in the capital for her 6-hour visit, turning the city centre into a no-go zone for protest marches planned by labour unions and opposition parties. 'We don't want her here,' said Yannis Georgiou, 72, who has seen his pension cut by one third. 'We . will take to the streets against austerity and against the government. Maybe Merkel will hear something and see what we're going through.' Scroll down for video . Opponents of Angela Merkel, some of whom have caricatured her as a bullying Nazi, have promised protests during her first visit to Greece since 2009 . Merkel's visit is a sign of Germany's support for the coalition government of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras as it struggles to agree new budget cuts with international lenders, overcome the objections of reluctant coalition partners and cope with rising public anger. After toying with the idea of a Greek exit from the euro zone in the first half of 2012, Merkel has come full circle and decided the risks of the country leaving are too high, especially with a German election looming next year. The trip is a sign of German solidarity, a message to the Greek leadership and people that Berlin does not want to cut them loose, and a signal to the members of Merkel's coalition who want Greece out that it's not going to happen soon. At the same time, the trip shows Merkel's trust in Samaras. Aides to the chancellor say they have been positively surprised by his commitment to reform. One reason for not visiting Greece before was frustration with progress under his predecessors, technocrat Lucas Papademos and Socialist George Papandreou. 'In our view Samaras is really trying to get things done,"" one German official said, requesting anonymity. 'Nobody should see this trip as a sign that all is perfect. But we recognise things are moving in the right direction.' The Greek government was ecstatic about the news, promising to treat Merkel with the honours befitting the leader of a great nation. Greek officials credited Samaras's charm offensive in Berlin in August for Germany's change of heart. 'Samaras showed a real will to change things,' a Greek government official said. 'He stressed what Greece had to do, not what others had to do for Greece.' Merkel is scheduled to meet Samaras, President Karolos Papoulias and representatives of Greek industry. In a measure of tension between Athens and Berlin earlier this year, Papoulias accused Merkel's Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble of insulting the country by likening Greece to a bottomless pit. Opposition parties, from the radical leftist Syriza to the right-wing Independent Greeks, have planned protests - and police officials said they were bracing for violence. For years, banner headlines and cartoons in the press have portrayed Germany as a bully and protesters burned Nazi effigies on the central Syntagma Square outside parliament. Demonstrators in Athens carry a banner featuring pictures of Angela Merkel and Greece's former Prime Minister George Papandreou during a day of strikes in May 2010 . The tone was more subdued in the newspapers on Sunday. To Proto Thema ran a 'HEIL' headline but most others called on Merkel to take a hard look at the suffering of Greek people during her visit. 'Tell Merkel the truth,' wrote Nikos Hatzinikolaou in Real News. 'With unemployment at 25 per cent and recession at 7 per cent, for a fifth year, can lenders expect the country to survive and pay back its debts?' The visit gives Merkel a chance to get a first-hand view of a country that could have a major influence on her own re-election hopes. Greece is stuck in tough negotiations with inspectors from the 'troika' of the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank over a fresh wave of 11.5 billion euros in cuts for the next two years, a condition for getting an installment of the 130 billion euro bailout which is keeping the country afloat. As difficult as these talks are, lenders are now realising Greece needs more time, money or both. The IMF wants official lenders such as Germany to take a 'haircut' under which the value of the Greek debt they hold would be radically reduced. Private bondholders have already swallowed such a hit but EU partners prefer other measures than to suffer more losses. In order to avoid going back to parliament to request a third rescue for Athens - a step Merkel allies acknowledge could be political suicide for her - Germany will probably have to agree to other concessions to plug a hole in Greece's finances. Angela Merkel meets Greece's prime minister Antonis Samaras in Berlin. Her visit on Tuesday will be her first to Greece since the euro zone crisis erupted . These could include giving Samaras an extra two years to make painful cuts and agreeing to a reduction in the interest rates Athens pays on its EU loans. Before making concessions that are sure to provoke a backlash at home, Merkel will want to look Samaras in the eye and make clear to him that she has done all she can - that it is now up to him.

"My son wants to know what will happen if aliens attack Earth. The seven-year-old is lying in bed asking me earnestly about a possible extra-terrestrial war, which he seems to think I'm in on. Despite my reassurances, he’s still worried about imaginary space invaders when I turn out the lamp and leave. 'Nothing will survive, you won't feel a thing,' I mutter on my way downstairs. Actually there is one thing that would be left if aliens invaded during the summer of 2014. There's only one thing strong enough to survive an intergalactic battle of epic proportions: loom bands. There will be no humans 'to experiment on' as he fears, just a bizarre legacy of billions of piles of multicoloured miniature elastic bands woven into ridiculous neon jewellery. Craze: Children aged three to 11 love making loom bands (posed by model) The captain's log of the invading ship will record that humans were a weird race of accessory-obsessed simpletons. And that the bigger ones put the smaller ones to work making all manner of multicoloured whatnots for their own sartorial pleasure. The opposite of which is true, of course. This week I risked ridicule at work wearing three fluorescent Rainbow Loom bracelets just to please my offspring (the purple one is grape-scented, they said, 'because we know you like wine'). Rainbow bracelets: The bands can be made in all sizes and colours . These tiny bands are everywhere. There was one in my cereal bowl this morning, the tumble dryer is full of them and the dog has taken to eating them. Which is nice. And when we went swimming this weekend I noticed them lying all over the bottom of the pool. This epidemic has caught us by surprise, spreading through my four children, aged three to 11, as fast a virulent tummy bug. They're all at it, even 'baby Mabel' who has taken to looping elastic bands over her toes until they turn red and get 'hurty'. It's worse than the addictive computer game Minecraft that absorbed them last year, worse than the obsessive collecting of the small plastic Moshi Monster moshlings I kept treading on. They start 'looming' first thing and are still at it when I get in from the office, comparing their different styles. Gracie, ten, has started to make her dad a loom bobble hat which I am really looking forward to him wearing. When not actually looming, they watch YouTube videos of other people doing it, marvelling at the nitwits who have made loom bikinis (further evidence of our inferior intelligence for alien invaders). They take pictures of their jewellery efforts to send to friends, who are also busy looming away. I don't remember the Rubik's cube or Cabbage Patch dolls ever being this popular. The sensible-mum side of me is thinking of staging an intervention. They've got to go out at some point during the school holidays, haven't they? Plus, where on earth will I store all this tat when they've outgrown it? But the 'little-bit-lazy-glad-it's-not-the-TV-occupying-them' side of me is secretly relieved and loving the loom. Besides, the ever-increasing school holidays are costly when you've got four children to occupy. An eBay buyer who bid £170,100 for a loom band dress made out of 20,000 elastic bands pulled out of the deal, confessing she couldn't afford it . After our annual family break in Cornwall we have four weeks to fill, which for urban kids  is a financial and creative conundrum (especially when there's an eight-year age  gap in play). I grew up in a Cornish village on the edge of Bodmin Moor and as a child my younger sister and I would just 'go outside' to play. This isn't an option for city youngsters, so the end of term heralds the start of my role as chief events organiser. This year I've been saved by the unexpected sunshine and the proliferation of London's 'city seasides'. 'To the beach,' I command over breakfast. They grip their bag of bands tightly and look at each other nervously for support. 'I suppose we can loom in the sand,' remarks Gracie as they head off for another trip to the fake coast.

"'We were your worst weekend'. So says John Fashanu in Adam Darke's latest documentary for BT Sport Films, The Crazy Gang, which debuts on the channel on Boxing Day. Well, for some of us with long memories who didn't mind seeing the mighty fall every now and then, one particular weekend in May 1988 was actually not too shabby at all. Mind you, neither was it particularly pretty, nor actually all that romantic, either. The story of The Crazy Gang in a nutshell, in fact. Eric Young (left), Lawrie Sanchez, Dave Beasant and Terry Phelan celebrate Wimbledon's FA Cup win . John Fashanu and Vinnie Jones emerge from the documentary as the Crazy Gang's undoubted leaders . What it was, was all about the means to an end in the game when Wimbledon pulled off their giant-killing act against the mighty Liverpool. What The Crazy Gang does is to tell the story of the 10 years that got them there. But unlike the legendary music hall act from which they adopted their name, it proves it wasn't just a bundle of laughs and knockabout japes, all the way. The Crazy Gang is a film that works very much as a three act play. It starts off by telling of how the division-jumping Wimbledon came to be. The one where, as then manager and catalyst Dave 'Harry' Bassett remembers it, they used to 'nick the cones off the A3' to use on the practise ground. And it ends with their Wembley triumph, and John Motson really hitting the nail on the head on commentary when he observed 'it's a one-off club this, I can tell you'. Jonew makes a typically robust challenge on Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown . Beasant's penalty save is often the best-remembered part of the story, but The Crazy Gang goes deeper . The Crazy Gang way may have been unorthodox, but it brought the group together as a formidable whole . But the middle part of the story takes it down a notch, becomes more considered, and lets us peer just a little uncomfortably into the dark side of what made Wimbledon tick. It is a fascinating shift in gear, and one that needed to be taken as starkly as it was, so as to help give us the complete picture. Nevertheless, in spite of the negative elements, when it got down to it, there was still only one conclusion that everybody concerned seemed to come to in the documentary - that it was their way, The Crazy Gang way, or the highway. Or probably more's the point, the aforementioned cone-free A3. Of course, the whole rationale behind what made The Crazy Gang tick was how that disparate bunch of individuals became the formidable whole. And it is those individual personalities that come shining through in this film. There may be less hair and more waistline with many of them. But that devilment is still very much twinkling away in the eyes. Bobby Gould (centre) celebrates after the FA Cup win with coach Don Howe (left) Plenty of the ex-players who contribute in the documentary have the openness and wit to articulate the thoughts and feelings of the team so well, you may feel you want to question their integrity, but you could never be critical of their honesty. Wally Downes, Andy Thorn, Terry Gibson, Dennis Wise, Dave Beasant, Laurie Sanchez et al... all of them are sharp, smart and insightful in their telling of the Wimbledon story. And clearly the kind of men that had more about them than the reputation that preceded them suggested. John Scales is another sharp tack. But it is he who resets the tone for the middle part of the story, which coincided with Harry Bassett leaving for Watford and Bobby Gould and Don Howe coming in and setting them on course for Wembley. Scales was one of those men drafted in to pep up the side, but spent a lot of his initial time there trying to exorcise the demons that this pressure cooker of a club created. Beasant lifts Gould as Wimbledon reached their pinnacle in the post Dave 'Harry' Bassett era . Terry Phelan, too, speaks well at this point about how he felt he had given up on his football dream. Central to creating the atmosphere that made this post-Bassett Wimbledon tick was Vinnie Jones and John Fashanu, although Jones, resplendent for his interview in his country squire attire, defers to the powerful ex-centre forward as being the actual top man. He was 'the self-acclaimed leader...you listen to Fash' was how Vinnie puts it. And Fashanu himself is clearly quite happy to accept that accolade. He is also very pleased to acknowledge the word 'fear' as being central to his control of the dressing room. And concur that with it came the associated violence. Lawrie Sanchez watches his cup-winning header sail past Bruce Grobbelaar in the Liverpool goal . This is not a pretty part of the film to watch, as he clearly revels in those former glories. But Fashanu is his own man, and again clearly smart and self-aware with it. When speaking of his nemesis at the club, Laurie Sanchez - 'any interesting character' is as far as Sanchez was prepared to go, after a long pause, in describing Fash - he says 'I thought I had some chips on my shoulder!'. Clearly John knows all about the well from which he draws. This psychodrama finally gives way to the Cinderella story, though. And to a man, even those who doubted themselves at the start of their time at Wimbledon, point out that they left with a sense of joy and achievement that only coming together as a team and overcoming apparently insurmountable odds can engender. The underlying sense of violence is never too far away in the film but the Cinderella story eventually emerges . Jones kisses the cup held by Phelan, who admits in the film that he had thought his football dream was over . If it wasn't certain at the time just how unique that Wembley win would prove to be ('can't happen again. Be impossible', says Wally Downes at the end of the film), Sam Haman quickly made sure it would be by offloading nearly the entire team. In doing so, of course, sparked off an array of impressive individual careers in the process, and brought to an end to that particular chapter of the Wimbledon story. A story that, as this beautifully pitched documentary points out, isn't quite as route one as their football used to be.

"It has already raised millions for ebola victims and is set to go to number one in the charts. But the latest Band Aid single was yesterday branded ‘patronising’ by African academics and a rapper revealed he pulled out of the recording in protest. Some said the revised lyrics of Do They Know It’s Christmas? perpetuate ‘negative stereotypes’ about Africa, and claimed it ignores the fact ebola has struck largely Muslim countries where most people do not celebrate December 25. Scroll down for video . Sir Bob Geldof appeared on Sky News and said the concerns of critics, who have described the Band Aid ebola fundraiser single as perpetuating 'negative stereotypes' about Africa, were a ‘complete load of b*******’ Others criticised organisers Sir Bob Geldof and Midge Ure for undermining African singers who have released similar charity songs. Meanwhile British-Ghanaian rapper Fuse ODG revealed he pulled out of the project last weekend because he disagreed with the lyrics, which have been revised since the first Band Aid track in 1984. Writing on Twitter, the 26-year-old said he felt the message of the song was ‘not in line’ with his own thoughts on how to help Africa. Sir Bob supported his decision, adding: ‘He said he just felt awkward’. But the Boomtown Rats star, 63, responded furiously to his other critics. Appearing on Sky News he said their concerns were a ‘complete load of b*******’. The song, recorded by singers including One Direction and Ed Sheeran, is favourite to become Christmas Number One, having topped the iTunes charts already and become the fastest selling record of the year with 206,000 sales since it was released on Monday. The song, recorded by singers including One Direction and Ed Sheeran, pictured, is a favourite to become Christmas Number One. It became the fastest selling record of the year with 206,000 sales since Monday . But Liberian academic Robtel Pailey, 32, who studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, said the lyrics are ‘incredibly patronising and problematic’. She told Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘It paints the continent as unchanging and frozen in time. If you look at the revised lyrics, there are references to ‘them’ versus ‘us’. ‘And the fact of the matter is, if you look at countries that have been most affected by Ebola, the vast majority of the population in Sierra Leone is Muslim, the vast majority of the population in Guinea is Muslim. Yes, we know it is Christmas, but not all of us celebrate Christmas.’ British-Ghanaian rapper Fuse ODG revealed he pulled out of the project last weekend because he disagreed with the lyrics of the Band Aid single . When it was first released in 1984, the Do They Know It’s Christmas? came under fire for perceived inaccuracies and offensive lyrics. At the time, the line ‘There won’t be snow in Africa’ was criticised by those who pointed out there is snow in some parts of the continent. U2 singer Bono – who also recorded the latest version – later admitted he ‘loathed’ another line which said: ‘Well tonight thank God it’s them instead of you.’ This year, it was replaced with the words ‘Well tonight we’re reaching out and touching you’, while the line ‘Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears’ was replaced with ‘Where a kiss of love can kill you and there’s death in every tear.’ However, Miss Pailey said it was wrong to suggest that every person infected with Ebola would die, adding: ‘Death, doom and destruction. It is insulting.’ Others were equally scathing. Speaking to Al Jazeera news, Chitra Nagarajan, 31, a human rights activist from Nigeria, said she objected to ‘celebrities swooping in to “save” the people of Africa.’ She added: ‘It perpetuates stereotypes of conflict, poverty and disease as the single story of the continent.’ Abdullahi Halakhe, 31, a policy analyst from Kenya, said he thought the lyrics were ‘grotesque’, adding: ‘It was awful 30 years ago, and it’s awful today.’ Dawit Gebreselassie, 26, a financial analyst from Ethiopia said: ‘I would ask does Geldof know when it’s Christmas time in Ethiopia? As perhaps the fact that we celebrate Christmas a few weeks later on the 7th of January could have misled him into thinking we don’t know when it is. ‘Reassure him from us that, after his last three reminders, we are well aware and don’t need any more prompting.’ Miss Pailey said Band Aid should have supported African artists, such as Liberian musicians D12 and Kuzzy, who have released similar tracks to raise money for Ebola. But producer Harvey Goldsmith, who helped create the original Band Aid and who produced the Live Aid concerts, said her concerns were ‘ridiculous’. He told Today: ‘I think it’s disingenuous for people to turn round and say we shouldn’t do anything or sit back and watch it all happen or wait for all those countries that pledged aid and refused to give it so far.’","Critics say Christmas song ignores fact ebola largely hit Muslim countries .

"A council member in Pomfret, New York has worn a colander on his head as he was sworn into office. Christopher Schaeffer opted for the unique head wear, which signals his allegiance to the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, at the ceremony on Thursday afternoon. His church, which was founded by an atheist in 2005 to protest against the teaching of creationism in school and to poke fun at religion, uses the spaghetti strainer as its symbol. 'It's just a statement about religious freedom,' Schaeffer told the Observer after he was sworn in. 'It's a religion without any dogma.' Bizarre: Pomfret, New York Town Council member Christopher Schaeffer wore a colander on his head as he was sworn in to office on Thursday, showing his allegiance to the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster . The organization's website insists Pastafarianism is a real religion. Adherents believe that pirates were the original Pastafarians and 'were peaceful explorers and it was due to Christian misinformation that they have an image of outcast criminals today', it explains. 'Some claim that the church is purely a thought experiment, satire, illustrating that Intelligent Design is not science, but rather a pseudoscience manufactured by Christians to push Creationism (the doctrine that God created the universe) into public schools,' it writes. 'These people are mistaken.' 'The Church of FSM is real, totally legit, and backed by hard science. Anything that comes across as humour or satire is purely coincidental.' The church opposes the teaching of creationism, and its website explains that followers are fond of beer and treat every Friday as a holiday. Bobby Henderson, the founder of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, blogged about the ceremony on Monday, calling Schaeffer 'the first openly Pastafarian sworn into office'. In office: Schaeffer said despite his prop last week, he is looking forward to taking the job seriously . Movement: Members of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, or Pastafarians, march through St. Petersburg in Russia. The group pokes fun at religion by worshiping a flying spaghetti monster . 'Some people will see it as obnoxious or a sign that he’s not taking the oath of office seriously,' Henderson said. 'But I am completely confident that Schaeffer will distinguish himself as a Council member of the highest caliber.' Schaeffer said that although his appearance may have looked bizarre to some, he is fully committed to working for Pomfret's residents. 'Mostly, I'm just looking forward to making sure that the town is run smoothly and we meet the needs of all of our citizens,' he said.","Christopher Schaeffer wore a spaghetti strainer while he was sworn in as council member in Promfret, New York last week .

"A council is attempting to trace a tenant who caused thousands of pounds of damage to a house after keeping a pig inside the property. Housing staff from Derby City Council found the Gloucester Old Spot roaming around the bottom floor of the property in Kingsley Street, Sinfin, Derbsyhire, when they went to evict the tenant following complaints from neighbours. The carpets were muddied and covered in droppings, and rooms were so full of boxes of junk that officials could not get into them. This little piggy stayed at home: This is the sight that greeted housing officials after they turned up to evict a tenant and found he had been using his council home as a pigsty . It is thought the pig had been kept at the house for a year. Officials also found a dog at the property. One resident living in the same road . said: 'I saw the man with the pig when it was tiny and he just had it in . his hands outside the front of his home. 'I thought it was one of those micro-pigs which wouldn’t grow.' Neighbours think the pig had been kept in the house for more than a year and it is estimated that repairs to the damage of the home will be in the region of £10,000 to £15,000 . Some residents reported smelling urine around the property when the weather was warm. Two Shetland ponies were known, by the RSPCA, to have previously been kept in the small back garden. Another resident said: 'He used to . chuck stuff outside in the middle of the night and once I saw laminate . flooring soaked in poo and urine piled up outside the home.' Derby Homes, which manages council . housing in the city, said the tenant was an 'excessive hoarder' and that . some rooms were so full of junk that they could not get in at all. Piles of junk was found in one of the bedrooms, left, while mud and muck covered the stairs, hallway and door . The front room with a dirty red leather sofa, faeces and piles of household junk stacked up on shelves . It said the cost of repairing the damage caused to the property would be between £10,000 to £15,000. When housing officials and the RSPCA . turned up to evict the tenant on March 15 after gaining an eviction . notice from court, the tenant took the pig away. Council officials are now trying to trace his whereabouts. Derby Homes had been trying to get . access to the property since September last year when the first . complaint was made of a pony being kept in the rear garden and a pig . being inside. Although RSPCA and housing staff went out, the tenant would not allow them access. The RSPCA visited again two months later and saw two ponies in the garden. The officers warned the tenant that . keeping the ponies at a domestic property was illegal. When they went . back, the ponies had gone. Fancy a bath? Derby Homes, which manages council housing in the city, said the tenant was an 'excessive hoarder' and that some rooms were so full of junk that they could not get in at all . Derby Homes began the legal process to . get access to the home. Despite the court issuing an order for the . tenant to allow access to housing staff, he failed to comply. The court, therefore, granted an eviction notice and staff swooped on March 15. A spokesman for Derby Homes said: 'We’ll try to trace the . current whereabouts of the tenants and will pursue recovery of the costs . of repair. The individual will not be eligible for housing with Derby . Homes in the future. Thankfully, such cases are rare.' The garden isn't much better full of old bits of wood, a barbecue. At one point there were two ponies in the garden . Maria Murphy, director of housing and . customer service at Derby Homes, said: 'This is a disgraceful waste of . money, caused by a tenant who failed to show respect for this property . or his tenancy agreement. 'On top of the repair costs there is the cost of the office time and legal proceedings in gaining possession of this property. 'The tenant removed the pig and therefore no action was taken by the RSPCA. 'We are trying to trace the whereabouts of the tenant and will pursue the costs of repairs required at the property. 'The individual will not be eligible for housing with Derby Homes in the future.'

"What a disastrous festive period it has been for referees. They have sunk to their worst performance level that I can remember. It does not seem to matter who is appointed to which game as the majority of them cause controversy and ill-feeling. Managers are not even bothering to speak to them after games as limp apologies or poor excuses do nothing to help them in a popular period for sackings. VIDEO Scroll down to see Garry Monk's view on punishments for match officials . Leicester players protest to referee Mike Jones after he awards a penalty to Liverpool at Anfield . Neil Warnock and Alan Irvine have lost their jobs — but the manager with the worst record of all appears safe in his position. Mike Riley heads up the Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO), who are responsible for the officiating of top-flight games and he is therefore the man who is in charge of the select group of referees. If any team manager oversaw a festive period including as many errors as these by his players he would be sacked: . The ball hits Wes Morgan (right) in the face but Mike Jones gave Liverpool a penalty for handball . Referee Anthony Taylor failed to send off QPR goalkeeper Robert Green for this handball outside of his area . Gareth Barry (right) sends Abel Hernandez flying during the match between Hull City and Everton .

Burney's George Boyd celebrates after scoring against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium . Hull City manager Steve Bruce reacts during his side's Boxing Day match against Sunderland . Referee Lee Mason (left) shows Stoke City's Jonathan Walters a yellow card at Goodison Park on Boxing Day . Alarmingly there are more errors than I have listed and in what is a very close and competitive Premier League, these mistakes are starting to affect the look of the table. I'm often asked why isn't there a No 1 referee who we turn to for the big games. Well, that is Riley's call. He was never the No 1 when he reffed and he doesn't like to put one man above another. There's no real hierachy for Premier League referees. Mark Clattenburg, the best referee in the country, was the fourth official at Aston Villa vs Crystal Palace on New Year's Day. Mike Riley (centre) referees the Premier League match between West Ham and Tottenham Hotspur in 2007 . He seems out of favour at the moment - probably because of off-the-field incidents, like breaking protocol by travelling in his own car to referee a match earlier this season because he wanted to watch an Ed Sheeran concert. When he’s on the pitch, he outperforms others . Howard Webb is wasted. He is the obvious successor to Riley, but is currently working as technical director at the PGMO. This is a guy who has taken charge of a World Cup final. Surely he has much more to offer than Riley? When raising the question of blatant errors with some officials, the response to me is worrying. I’m told there is no confidence in the camp as they feel unsupported and not motivated. They tell me to expect more errors. As ever, Riley remains silent and this cannot continue. I took great pride in doing my best to perform in every minute in every match and I am not enjoying highlighting so many errors. But at least I am doing my job.

"England showed real bottle and character to beat Australia. It was a high-pressure game after a patchy autumn and regaining momentum to mount a successful World Cup campaign would have been very tough if they had lost. But win they did and now England are in pretty good shape. They all need to have a look in the mirror, though, especially the England coaches as they all seemed a little too pleased after the game - as if this was all part of some grand master plan. There is a mountain of work awaiting them. Here are the lessons England (and the other main nations) should take on board. Ben Morgan gives out a scream of joy after scoring England's first try against Australia on Saturday . england have fought hard for victory but they, and the other home nations, have a lot still to learn . CLEAR THINKING NEEDED . Stuart Lancaster has the playing talent to build a truly successful side. England got it right at the death but for much of the autumn it was a very confused picture. George Ford or Danny Cipriani should always have started at No 10. It is clear now that Owen Farrell wasn’t match fit. Ben Morgan should have started at No 8 from the off. Meanwhile, how can Semesa Rokoduguni go from first-choice wing against New Zealand, when he hardly touched the ball, to being out of the squad? The same applies to Kyle Eastmond. How are they feeling? It is up to their clubs to pick up the pieces. Long-term coaching contracts hinder selection. It appears as though the pressure England were under against Australia brought clarity of thought for the first time. Danny Cipriani (left) or George Ford (right) should always start at 10 for England from now on . Semesa Rokoduguni (left) was dropped out of the blue and Ben Morgan should have been first-choice No 8 . FRONT FIVE SUPERSTARS . Joe Marler, Dylan Hartley, Davey Wilson, Dave Attwood and Courtney Lawes were the stand-outs, the bench forwards were strong and there are other top-class operators who will push hard for selection when they return from injury. England’s front five can make Twickenham a horrible place for any visiting team. Can a front five win a World Cup for you? Yes, but England must use them even more effectively. And one personal gripe. Can England stop referring to all the Lions they have to come back? It belittles the fantastic efforts of those currently wearing the England shirt. There is no guarantee those Lions will make the team and somehow suggests the Lions ranks above England. England's scrum was dominant and Australia simply did not know how to deal with it on Saturday . Stuart Lancaster has a front five that are simply incredible and they can dominate any side at Twickenham . GET THE BALANCE RIGHT . There is a need for lightning-quick ball from England’s back row at the breakdown. Chris Robshaw, Ben Morgan and Tom Wood went well but there is plenty they must work on. England need more ball carrying and hard yards from them. It was a good decision to drop Wood for Samoa, a little kick up the rear, and he responded. The combination between Wood and Morgan for the first try was nice to see, as was Morgan playing 80 minutes. Robshaw, up against Michael Hooper, produced some key turnovers. Chris Robshaw (right) did well at the breakdown and England must get the balance right in the back row . Tom Wood (right) responded well after being dropped and was excellent against Australia . GET YOUR KICKS . England need to think carefully about their goal-kicking because their power up front and ability to play in the opposition half will earn plenty of penalties. And kickers invariably win World Cups. George Ford looks reliable close-in but mid-range and long-range, he does not yet have Test match consistency. He will work on that. Making a decision to play Owen Farrell at 12 offers a very strong mid-range goal-kicking option which will tip the balance his way in selection. George Ford's kicking from short range is excellent but he struggles a bit from middle distances . Owen Farrell (right) should be considered as a No 12 for England due to his exemplary middle-range kicking . LOOK FOR DROP GOALS . A drop-goal game can be a real weapon, and not just going into the last 10 minutes of tight games. I’d like to see us dropping goals in the first minute, especially when momentum is lost in attack. There is nothing more dispiriting for a defending side, as you cannot defend against it. With a dominant front five, how many drop goals could England deliver in one game? I have always believed in building the score in order to get one and then two scores ahead. I believe 13 is a lucky number. If you gain a lead of 13 points, you should always win. Drop goals are a great short cut to reach that magic number. England must look for drop goals, like Jonny Wilkinson's in 2003 World Cup final, throughout entire matches . MUST GET FITTER . England are still not fit enough. There is plenty of time to put that right, but it will require strong co-operation between the clubs and England, and I worry whether that partnership will stand the test. There are key players who will require extra time to recover from injuries than the clubs are comfortable with and others might need a couple of weeks away from playing to do the conditioning they need. Who at the RFU has the clout to make that happen? I am not convinced the partnership between the RFU and the clubs is as healthy as some want you to believe. Are we going to suffer from not having central contracts? This team must be fitter, faster and stronger to have any chance at the World Cup. Lancaster must ensure his England side get fitter, which he has time to do, in order to compete next year . THE BIGGER PICTURE . There seems to be a lot going on off the field - a lot of media work and commercial stuff. This all makes the England camp appear very friendly and nice but it has little to do with playing great rugby and is just a general distraction. The pressure the team came under in the last fortnight will have reminded everyone it is the rugby that matters. Very few seem interested in the culture of the team when the performance has been as lacklustre as it has been this autumn. This is where the England players, led by Robshaw, need to stand up, take responsibility and just say a firm ‘no’. Seeing the players being asked ‘Who in the team thinks he looks like David Beckham?’ makes me cringe. I get the feeling the players hate doing this but are not strong enough to say no. The team’s interests must come first - not fulfilling commercial objectives or creating savvy social media content. England winning games is what everyone wants, so let’s allow the team to get on with it and reduce all this background noise. England must look at  bigger picture and not answer questions like 'who thinks he looks like David Beckham?' As captain, Robshaw must be strong and dictate terms, ensuring his side are not pressurised by social media . GET IN KNOCKOUT MODE . England should now approach the Six Nations as a five-game World Cup. Their first two games should be seen as the two Pool games against Wales and Australia, which they must win to come top of the pool and have a potentially easier route to the final. Their final three games will approximate to the quarter-final, semi-final and final. Let’s get into that mindset now. England must get into knockout mode and treat the Six Nations as a five-game World Cup, with the challenge offered by Wales and Leigh Halfpenny (left) in the first match as a pool game before the latter stages . BEATABLE ALL BLACKS . New Zealand are not streets ahead of the other main nations. In some matches this year they have looked vulnerable and the gap will continue to close. Their pack can be dominated by England and South Africa. New Zealand have never won a World Cup away from home. New Zealand's forward, pictured fighting against Wales, are able to be dominated by European sides . England showed against the All Blacks that they are capable of beating them up front . LESS WAILING IN WALES . Don’t pay too much attention to the occasional hysteria that takes over down in Wales! Warren Gatland has won Heineken Cups, Six Nations Grand Slams and led the Lions to a series win in Australia. He is a great coach and now Wales have a southern-hemisphere scalp, they are in very decent order. If they beat England in the Six Nations watch Wales fly. Wales will be boosted by their victory over South Africa - celebrated here by captain Sam Warburton . Head coach Warren Gatland is a fantastic coach and he will ensure Wales are ready for the Six Nations . NO ORDINARY JOE . In less than 18 months, Ireland under Joe Schmidt have become Six Nations champions and autumn conquerors of South Africa and Australia. Schmidt has achieved all that despite a raft of injuries and the retirement of Brian O’Driscoll. Ireland are World Cup contenders and that turnaround is down to one man. Johnny Sexton and Ireland are going from strength to strength and will be a force come the Six Nations . Joe Schmidt has been the solitary reason behind why Ireland have progressed so impressively . THE JOY OF SIX . It is going to be one of the best Six Nations in memory. As well as England, Wales and Ireland, the Scots have upped their game. France look menacing. European rugby is flexing its muscles and three or four of our teams will have outstanding World Cups. Scotland's Tommy Seymour scores against Australia - they are another European side on the up . 16 - Tackles made by a bloodied Brad Barritt against Australia - more than anyone else.

"Culture Secretary Maria Miller should be thrown out of the Cabinet and be forced to give up her Commons seat as punishment for making false expenses claims, according to a Mail on Sunday poll. Voters also want the embattled Minister to be stripped of her role in charge of introducing new press curbs following Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry into media ethics. The damning findings come from the first survey conducted since Mrs Miller was forced to pay back £5,800 over-claimed on her mortgage and apologise to the Commons on Thursday. Damning verdict: Maria Miller (pictured making her apology on Thursday) should be thrown out of the Cabinet and be forced to give up her Commons seat after making false expenses claims, says a Mail on Sunday poll . The results will pile pressure on David Cameron to do a U-turn over his refusal to sack her. A senior Tory MP said last night that Mrs Miller was ‘dead in the water, politically speaking’ – and certain to be ditched in a Cabinet reshuffle before the summer. ‘It is natural for the PM to stand by her for now, but she will be gone by the party conference,’ said the MP. A total of 78 per cent of those polled by Survation for The Mail on Sunday say Mrs Miller should lose her Cabinet seat. 'A ridiculous claim': The house in Basingstoke, Hampshire, that Mrs Miller listed as her primary residence . Ominously, the number of Tories who . think she should be fired as Culture Secretary is 82 per cent. Only one . in ten say she should stay in the Cabinet. The survey also emphasises that, five years after the MPs’ expenses scandal erupted, public fury over politicians thought to be ‘on the fiddle’ is as intense as ever. Humiliatingly, most people believe that kicking Mrs Miller out of the Cabinet is not sufficient retribution: nearly seven out of ten say she should be made to quit as the MP for Basingstoke. Pressurised: The results will pile pressure on David Cameron to do a U-turn over his refusal to sack her . Defiant Mr Cameron’s decision to stand by her gets the thumbs-down from three-quarters of voters. And two-thirds say Mrs Miller should relinquish her responsibility for introducing new press curbs following the phone hacking scandal triggered by Rupert Murdoch’s News International’s newspapers. Fewer than one in five say she should stay in control of the issue. Mrs Miller’s 32-second Commons apology left voters deeply unimpressed – nearly three-quarters say her statement was inadequate. The damning public verdict came as it emerged that Mrs Miller had tried to browbeat the independent Commons’ standards watchdog investigating complaints over her expenses claims on her second home in Wimbledon, South London, where her parents lived. Mrs Miller listed her primary residence as a rented home in her Hampshire constituency. As part of a series of emails to Standards Commissioner Kathryn Hudson, the Culture Secretary even threatened to report her to the Commons’ Standards Committee if she did not conclude the inquiry, and  branded one line of questioning from Mrs Hudson as ‘unwarranted and wrong’. The Culture Secretary’s adviser Jo Hindley was accused of trying to ‘flag up’ Mrs Miller’s key role in stricter press regulation in a bid to suppress coverage of the affair – a claim Ms Hindley rejects. No  10 has also denied trying to threaten a newspaper investigating the Minister’s expenses with tougher regulation of the press. Formal apology: Maria's 32-second apology to the Commons on Thursday was appalling, writes Mr Heath . Making a statement: It was written all over the Culture Secretary's face that she didn't want to do it, he adds . Mrs Miller was last week forced to apologise after a 16-month investigation. The Standards Committee was scathing about her attitude to the inquiry, accusing her of taking a ‘legalistic’ approach and providing a ‘totally inadequate response’ to one of Mrs Hudson’s inquiries. But controversially, it over-ruled Mrs Hudson’s insistence that Mrs Miller repay almost £45,000 of the £90,000 allowances she claimed over four years, claiming she had acted ‘reasonably’ in declaring the London property as her second home. It said she should only repay £5,800 overclaimed in mortgage interest in 2009. Political figures: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (right) declined to come to Mr Cameron's aid over the issue yesterday, but Conservative chairman Grant Shapps (left) said it was time to 'draw a line' under the controversy . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg declined to come to Mr Cameron’s aid over the issue yesterday, saying: ‘All the issues to do with her position and indeed to do with the behaviour of her office, alleged or not, is entirely a matter for the Prime Minister.’ But Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said it was time to ‘draw a line’ under the controversy. Survation questioned 1,001 voters on Friday. 'I can't see Maria changing': Phil Heath is Mrs Miller's former campaign organiser . Years before Maria Miller’s dodgy expenses were reported in the media, I tried to bring it to the public’s attention. I noticed it soon after I started working on her campaign that resulted in her being elected MP for Basingstoke in 2005. I came to realise that she is the sort who claims for everything. It’s part of what I call ‘Maria’s culture’. She would even claim for parking in her own constituency. As for her insistence that the house in Wimbledon was her second home – thus allowing her to claim expenses on it – I thought it was ridiculous because she seemed to spend as little time as possible in Basingstoke. From what I could see, her family were based in Wimbledon. I tried to raise my concerns with Conservative Party officials but they didn’t want to know. In my view, the Commons Standards Commissioner got it right but MPs let her off the hook. It was a stitch-up. Talking to people in cafes around Basingstoke yesterday, they were saying: ‘She’s got away with it.’ Maria’s 32-second apology to the Commons was appalling. It was written all over her face that she didn’t want to do it. And I know that arrogant look so well. It says: ‘I’m right and everyone else is wrong. How dare anybody question me. Don’t you know who I am?’ But the people of Basingstoke are saying: ‘Hang on a minute. Never mind apologising to MPs, what about apologising to us, and what about apologising for taking public money that you aren’t entitled to?’ 'Maria's culture': Mrs Miller claims for everything, even for parking in her own constituency, says Mr Heath . I can’t see Maria changing. She has no truck with criticism locally and heaven help anyone like me who has the temerity to question her word. Nobody complains about Maria  – not if they want to stay a Conservative, as I found out. It was like I dared to say the Madonna was not a virgin! Even though I helped her win a majority in 2005 of more than 4,500, on Election day itself she was ranting and raving and thought she was going to lose. 'Arrogant look': Mr Heath says he was 'so appalled' by Mrs Miller's behaviour that he voted for her Labour rival even though he was effectively her campaign manager at the time. Above, Mrs Miller outside Downing Street . I told her to get out of the room, saying that we would get her elected, and that she should leave everybody else alone. I was so appalled by her behaviour, I voted for her Labour rival even though I was effectively her campaign manager and I was a Tory councillor at the time.

"English cricket is deluding itself. In its desire to prove Alastair Cook is the right man to consign the Australian car crash to history, it has created a fresh sequence of accidents, each more wreckage-strewn than the last. Being bounced out by Mitchell Johnson was just about understandable, a potent mix of physics and fear. But Ishant Sharma, a bowler who has spent much of his career being mocked by Indian fans, who has a Test average in the late-30s, and who had to be persuaded by his captain to bang it in short? This was the kind of nadir that makes other nadirs looks like imposters. Yet when the third Test starts in Southampton on Sunday, the captain will still be Cook and the head coach will still be Peter Moores. Success, we will no doubt be assured, will be just around the corner – a corner which has somehow become a long road to nowhere. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Alastair Cook: Maybe I'm not the right man for the job . Time to walk away? Alastair Cook struggled again at Lord's and is not the right man to lead England . Troubled: Cook's batting has suffered and England have not won for 10 Test matches . Cook spoke on Monday afternoon of his determination to put things right and his desire to be in charge when fortunes change. These are noble sentiments. But such things don’t happen by themselves. His past record is no guarantee of success in the future. In fact his Test average of 45.34 is at its lowest ebb for nearly four years. Right now, the impression given by those who run the English game – from ECB chairman Giles Clarke via managing director Paul Downton to Moores and Cook – is that the desire for change will in itself be enough. The platitudes are ringing increasingly hollow. It was reasonable to give Cook a chance to prove that the Ashes whitewash was an outlier. That was his first Test series defeat as captain out of six, and credit remained in the bank after the win in India. But the second chance depended, naturally enough, on events this summer. That’s how sport works. It is, as Cook might put it, a simple deal. All sportsmen have an internal contract: to admit to fragility is to strike at the contract’s very essence, for half the trick is to convince yourself that you are still the man for the job. That’s why there is usually a time lag between the truth dawning on outside observers and reality hitting home with the man under pressure. With Cook, we are currently mid-lag. This column wrote after the Headingley defeat by Sri Lanka that he should no longer be captain. It seemed obvious then that he lacked the imagination and authority to impose himself on a game, let alone outwit the opposition. A few funky fields at Trent Bridge clouded the issue: it’s been said often enough that such tricks are not the point of captaincy. And on the first day at Lord’s, England flunked it a la Headingley. It’s certainly true that his senior bowlers let him down. But good captains spot the danger and change tack. They have the force of personality to tell their experienced new-ball attack to pitch the damn thing up on the greenest top seen at Lord’s for decades. If the new-ball attack fail to respond, or refuse to pitch it up because they’re petrified of being driven through extra cover and having their analyses damaged, then on come the change bowlers. The wrong men: Ian Bell cannot buy a run, while Joe Root (right) doesn't need the burden of captaincy . A safe pair of hands: Eoin Morgan could be an option to return to the England set-up as captain . For more cricket-related snippets, feel free to go to twitter.com/the_topspin . MS Dhoni has lapsed into all kind of strangeness during his time as Test captain, but he was miles ahead of Cook at Lord’s, bringing on Ravindra Jadeja as early as the seventh over of England’s second innings (he trapped Sam Robson first ball), and instructing a reluctant Sharma to bowl an over of bouncers just before lunch on day five (he had Moeen Ali caught at short leg off the last delivery). The best that can be said about Cook’s leadership is that he appears to have created an environment on which newcomers feel more welcome: Robson, Gary Ballance and Moeen have all prospered early in their careers. But such inclusivity can lapse into over-indulgence. Matt Prior didn’t look fit in the first Test at Trent Bridge, missing three catches low to his right of the kind he once had for breakfast. To compound the error by picking him at Lord’s, where he dropped Murali Vijay on the first morning, said little for England’s judgment. He steps down, possibly for good, with the gratitude of England fans, but also with the suspicion that his struggles have epitomised the dressing-room’s lack of honesty with itself. Moores not merrier: Peter Moores' second spell as England coach is proving a chastening experience . Then there was the general refusal to admit that England had fluffed their lines with the ball on the opening day, when India should have been skittled for 150. There can be no more complaints about the pitches. Cook, at least, has acknowledged that both his own lack of form and England’s winless streak cannot continue, while at the same time showing little capacity to remedy either malaise. Things could get worse – even worse – before they get better. And Moores? His reappointment as coach was dubious after an initial stint that included four Test series defeats out of seven, including the first at home by India in 21 years. Now, following the heist by Sri Lanka, he risks extending his record to six losses out of nine. People who know Moores well speak repeatedly of his enthusiasm and energy – and couldn’t we all do with more of those? But the evidence suggests that whatever it is he said he learned from his first spell in charge is yet to take effect. Earlier this summer, Sri Lanka won the lone Twenty20 international, the one-dayers and, for the first time in England, a Test series. Now India have won their first overseas Test for three years. England keep ticking off the wrong kind of history. The danger is they will keep on making the same mistakes until the lag is no more. But by then, another Test series will have come and gone. Who, in any case, would replace Cook? The absence of potential leaders is another poor reflection on the English game. Ian Bell can’t buy a run, while the last thing a rejuvenated Joe Root needs is to be weighed down by the captaincy. If there is a way of squeezing Eoin Morgan into the Test team, England should seriously consider it. There’s something likeable about this Indian team – the dash (and tache) of Shikhar Dhawan, the old-school application of Cheteshwar Pujara, the classy modesty of Ajinkya Rahane, the egoless line and length of Bhuvneshwar Kumar. Even MS Dhoni’s rambling answers at press conferences take on a certain charm when he’s in one of his mischievous moods. Just one request. Can Virat Kohli, the captain-in-waiting, concentrate on celebrating wickets with his team-mates rather than go out of his way to agitate the fallen batsman or even – as happened at Lord’s yesterday – the fallen batsman’s partner? It ain’t a good look. The agitator: Virat Kohli (left) should celebrate more wickets with his team-mates and not rile opponents . What is the truth about so-called chief executive pitches and the near-mythical status of the cash-bringing fifth day? The feeling at Trent Bridge was that groundsman Steve Birks’s deathly slow surface was part of Nottinghamshire’s grand plan to make money on walk-up ticket sales on the final day – though Birks was apologising as early as day one for a pitch subsequently rated ‘poor’ by ICC match referee David Boon. Yet a senior figure at the ECB assured the Top Spin during the Lord’s Test that this was little more than ill-informed hot air. Apparently, it actually costs a county money to host a fifth day, because grounds are rarely full, hospitality cannot be sold in advance and stewards still need to be paid. The perfect Test, we were told, finishes on day four. If this version is true, what happened at Trent Bridge was more cock-up than conspiracy. At a time when national boards are beefing up their online presence, the question arises about what their role on the internet should ideally be. Are they there simply to spread information, or should they be applying a cheeky spin? There was no doubt which angle Cricket Australia chose last week when they published a video detailing the lowlights of Matt Prior’s summer. They should be careful what they wish for: next in line as England wicketkeeper is Jos Buttler, a superstar in the making. And now he should get a decent crack at Test cricket before the 2015 Ashes… .

He’s very lucky that it didn’t cause any long-term damage. ‘When he was brought in, he was in a bad way – very thin, because he hadn’t eaten in quite a few days. 'We examined his mouth and found a wound and found the hole next to his eye and worked out that he had been shot. ‘We could feel there was a lump under . his chin, which is probably the pellet and inflammation, but decided . that he was too young to operate on and because it wasn’t causing him . any trouble at the moment, we could wait until he was a bit older. ‘We syringe-fed him and the next day he was a lot better, even quite playful.

"Valentine's Day saw Sam Allardyce show his undying love for his favourite Kevin Nolan, and the West Ham captain led his team to a 'shameful' (the word used by keeper Adrian) performance at West Brom in the FA Cup. Most West Ham fans will tell you the truth – Nolan was at his influential brilliant best leading the Hammers out of the darkness of the Championship. Since then he's been out of his depth, yet still Allardyce's love for Nolan burns strong. So after a 4-0 defeat and being dumped out of the FA Cup – yet another embarrassing exit after last season's disasters at Nottingham Forest and Manchester City – the West Ham manager blamed injuries, implying his squad isn't big enough (same excuse after last season's FA Cup defeat). This is just two weeks after the transfer window closed. Sam Allardyce's West Ham crashed out of the FA Cup at the hands of West Brom on Saturday .

In fact Wednesday's game at Southampton was West Ham's first midweek game for a month. Why did Sam's team look so tired and out of sorts? West Brom had also played on Wednesday night yet looked full of energy. Sounds like bad management to me. When asked after those two Cup shockers last season if he was prepared to apologise to fans, Sam Allardyce replied: 'For what?'

Sam is only interested in doing the job. And on Saturday he failed miserably at it. West Ham have improved this season, there have been good signings and some good football. But as I wrote in an article for MailOnline recently, West Ham United is a football club ready to burst on to the big time. That's the direction they want to head in. They need a manager who shares that ambition, and whose skills reflect the extraordinary salary he's receiving (at the last count Sam was the 13th highest-paid manager in the world, earning more than Joachim Low and Diego Simeone). What West Ham don't need is a manager who moans about the squad size. The Hammers are heading to a world-class stadium and they need to go there with a world-class manager. Time for West Ham to let Sam go.","West Ham were humiliated 4-0 by West Brom in the FA Cup on Saturday .

"Kissed and fondled: Camilla Long claimed she was shamefully molested by Dave Lee Travis in 2012 . Just five months before he was first arrested, the writing was on the wall for Dave Lee Travis. The Sunday Times published a graphic account by journalist Camilla Long of how he shamelessly molested her in front of his wife. The columnist asked for an interview because he was about to meet the Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. But she was left giggling ‘out of horror and fear’ during an unforgettable exchange in which the then 67-year-old entertainer took every opportunity to touch her. ‘I spent 90 minutes with the former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis and I don’t think there is a part of my body that he didn’t grope,’ the resulting article began. ‘He fondled my foot, inched his hands up my thighs, tried to make me sit on his lap and kissed me. ‘He copped a feel of my hips when I foolishly asked for a tour of his studio, stroked my chin and my back and gave me a full body hug as I left.’ When police went public on their investigation, they asked Miss Long if she would support a prosecution or give evidence but she declined. Speaking last night after he was convicted, she said: ‘He didn’t worry about getting consent too much, he just did it.’ That damning June 2012 interview took place more than four decades after Travis first rose to fame as a Radio 1 DJ and Top of the Pops presenter. But it lays bare exactly how a bearded pipe-smoking hippy believed he had the right to behave exactly as he pleased in the company of women. In court, Travis described himself as having a ‘cuddly nature’ and happily admitted to loving ‘wonderful’ women who have ‘fabulous shapes’. ‘If I like someone I will hug them and give them a kiss because the whole world needs that,’ he told the jury benignly. He declared that ‘half the country would be in jail’ if patting a woman’s bottom was a crime in the 1970s as he dismissed his accusers as ‘fantasists’. In reality, his sexually-charged advances were unwanted and investigators suspect there are many more victims who have not come forward. In fact, it was Travis’s own bravado which helped secure his place in the dock, for not one but two criminal trials. The day after his arrest, the DJ could not resist coming out of his prized Buckinghamshire bungalow to face the TV cameras and proclaim his innocence. He had only been accused of ‘squeezing the boobs of a couple of women’, he protested. But the sight of Travis, puffed up with self-righteousness and labelling himself an ‘easy target’, prompted another flurry of women to contact police. The then 67-year-old entertainer took every opportunity to touch Miss Long, including her feet and thighs . Dave Lee Travis on The Mrs Merton show in 1995: It was behind the scenes of this appearance that Travis was found by a jury to have groped the breasts of young researcher, who is now a broadcaster herself . The majority of those went to trial in February but he was cleared on 12 counts. The jury was unable to decide on two counts which were the subject of the most recent trial plus the case of a researcher for the Mrs Merton show. He was found guilty of assaulting the researcher but cleared on both the other cases. While playing Aladdin’s evil uncle in a pantomime, Travis was accused of ‘engulfing’ a stage hand in his costume cloak and forcing his hand down her tracksuit bottoms. The allegation resulted in The Chuckle Brothers – his co-stars in the 1990 panto at a theatre in Crawley, Sussex – coming to court in his defence. They were said to have unwittingly saved the young woman from his clutches by interrupting the assault in his dressing room. The stage hand claimed Travis pinned her to the door and groped her ‘from top to toe’ as he towered over her. She told jurors he then forced his hand down her tracksuit bottoms and into her knickers – only stopping when one of the slapstick comedians – aka Paul and Barry Elliott - was heard saying ‘All right Dave’. Assistant theatre manager Simon Gant told the court that Travis had such a ‘threatening presence’ that girls on the early 1990s production agreed that none would be left alone with him. Mr Gant added: ‘He would come up behind them and put the cloak around them.’ But the Chuckle Brothers, now in their 60s, came to court to defend DLT, saying he was a ‘jolly great chap to work with’ and that they could not remember any such incident. The DJ pictured left outside his home near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire after the claims emerged in 2012 and right, in his heyday as a presenter on BBC Radio One in the 1960s . The jurors rejected the woman’s claims and found Travis not guilty. The DJ was also accused of groping the breasts of a journalist who was interviewing him as his wife slept upstairs. The former BBC DJ invited the 24-year-old feature writer to his luxury home in 2008 to reminisce about a Radio 1 Christmas party with stars including Jimmy Savile and John Peel, for a nostalgia feature. He allegedly told the young interviewer she had a good figure and asked if she would like to pose for a semi-naked photograph for him. He is pictured leaving Southwark Crown Court with his wife Marianne after he was  found guilty of groping a female TV personality yesterday . She claimed he pawed at her cleavage before cocking his head to one side, as if he was judging the size of her breasts.

"IHS dismantled the iPad Air to work out how much each component cost to make. The cheapest 16GB iPad Air costs $274 to make, plus a $6 manufacturing cost, yet sells for $499 in the U.S . Apple launched its iPad Air last month, which is twice as . fast as previous models and 20 per cent thinner - yet a new report has now found it’s . also cheaper to make, meaning Apple's profit margins just increased. Colorado-based analytics firm IHS took the tablet to pieces . and worked out how much each individual component would cost to manufacture. It discovered the cheapest 16GB Wi-Fi-only iPad Air costs . $274 to make, based on preliminary results, yet sells for $499. This is despite the fact the iPad Air is $42 cheaper . to make than the third-generation model. IHS’ Teardown Analysis Service only looked at the price in . dollars. If the figures are converted to UK prices this works out at £170 . production costs compared to a retail price of £399. Elsewhere, the 16GB iPad Air with 3G connectivity costs £188 ($304) to make, according to preliminary results, and this represents a 6 per cent drop . in production price of the iPad 3, down from £201 ($325). When the £4 ($6) manufacturing cost of the iPad Air is added in, . the total cost to make the tablets increases to $280 (£174) for the smaller 16GB model and $310 (£192) for the 32GB device. ‘While the iPad Air slims down in size, the profit margins . are getting fatter,’ said Andrew Rassweiler, senior director, cost benchmarking . services for IHS. ‘Although the Air’s new, ultra-thin display and touch screen . are more expensive than for the third-generation iPad, Apple has held the line . on cost by taking advantage of price erosion in other areas. IHS' Teardown Analysis Service checked each of the iPad Air's components, pictured. The firm only looked at the price in dollars, but if the figures are converted to UK prices this works out at £170 production costs compared to a retail price of £399. This works out at a 135 per cent mark-up. ‘Furthermore, the iPad Air leverages the same components and . suppliers that are used in the iPhone 5s and 5c as much as possible.’ The profitability of the iPad Air rises dramatically as the . built-in storage capacity increases. For example, the 32GB model costs Apple only £5.20 ($8.40) more . to produce - but has a retail price that’s £80 more in the UK and $100 higher in the U.S. Apple was criticised for not dropping the prices of its . latest iPhones and iPads in a bid to appeal to emerging markets. This cost breakdown shows that Apple is sticking to its . traditional pricing strategy. This may also be, in part, due to the fact the firm’s . earnings recently fell 9 per cent. It was the third consecutive quarter its earnings dropped . compared with the previous year. US figures . Cost to make (plus $6 overall manufacturing cost): $280 . Sales price: $499 . In this instance $274 = 100 per cent. To find out the relative percentage for the sales price, $280 is divided by 100 (%) to make 2.8. This is essentially equivalent to one per cent. If the sales price of $499 is divided by 2.8, it works out at 178 per cent, meaning the mark-up is 78 per cent. UK figures . IHS’ Teardown Analysis Service only looked at the price in . dollars, so the figures were directly converted to UK prices for components - the sales price is the price available in the Apple store. Cost to make (plus £4 overall manufacturing cost): £174 . Sales price: £399 . In this instance £174 = 100 per cent, so £174 is divided by 100 (%) to make 1.74. If the sales price of £399 is divided by 1.74, it works out at 229 per cent, meaning the mark-up is 129 per cent.","Researchers dismantled the iPad Air to work out costs for each component .

"At least 40 women have successfully sued the NHS despite giving birth to healthy babies . Women have successfully sued the NHS for hundreds of thousands of pounds – despite giving birth to healthy babies. The mothers won the huge payouts after claiming that procedures to stop them having children – including abortions – went wrong. The women received the cash for reasons including the pain suffered in childbirth and the discomfort of pregnancy. Last night the former Bishop of Rochester, Michael Nazir-Ali, hit out at the move, saying: ‘A healthy child is an occasion for thanksgiving rather than for taking the NHS to the cleaners and using up precious funds which could otherwise be more usefully employed.’ And TV presenter and mother-of-two Kirstie Allsopp, who has urged women to have children while they are still young, said she understood that people who had suffered a serious medical malpractice or had a disabled child needed support, but added: ‘It seems to me that to be able to sue the NHS after the birth of a healthy baby is simply not something the majority of people would agree with. ‘The NHS hasn’t got an infinite amount of money. I think parents in that position should think twice.’ The successful legal claims have been made by at least 40 women over the past ten years. The figures, disclosed by Health Minister Daniel Poulter last month, show that, in the decade up to 2013, the NHS paid out more than £94 million in 164 cases of ‘wrongful births’, most of which involved parents who had disabled children after a doctor negligently failed to warn them of the risk. But the parliamentary written answer also showed that, in the 104 such cases that have been finally settled, 40 involved the birth of perfectly healthy children – six after ‘failed terminations’, 24 after ‘failed sterilisation’, eight after a ‘failed contraceptive implant/procedure’, one following a ‘failure to diagnose pregnancy’ and one as a result of ‘inaccurate fertility advice’. Lawyers who have dealt with cases say claimants can typically expect payouts of £15,000 to £40,000. First, they have to show the care they received fell below the expected standards. Then they can seek damages on the grounds of the ‘pain and suffering’ experienced with an unwanted pregnancy. Many will claim for loss of earnings if their careers have been disrupted, and some will demand money for physical or psychological damage. Stephanie Prior, head of medical negligence at Osbornes solicitors, said she had dealt with a number of cases where women had given birth to healthy babies. In some, she said, women thought they had received a contraceptive implant, but the procedure had failed and they were not protected. ‘Most are young and are just starting or finishing university or just starting jobs, so they have not been able to pursue their degrees or their chosen careers,’ Ms Prior said. Medical experts said the failure rate of medical abortions, using drugs, was just under one per cent, while for surgical abortions it was much lower. They added that neither female sterilisation, nor a vasectomy, was absolutely reliable. However, women are warned of these risks and can only sue successfully if they show the standard of care received fell below that which could reasonably be expected. They cannot claim for the maintenance of their child. Last night, a Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We understand that cases like this are distressing for the patient, but they remain extremely rare.’","Mothers won huge payouts saying procedures to stop children went wron .

"If I’m honest, I’m rather partial to the underdog. Come FA Cup Third Round time, I can’t help myself. I’m all for the painter, decorators and bin men who take on the full-time professionals. What’s more, who wasn’t cheering for Rocky when he took on the might of Apollo Creed and nearly won? And lest we forget, Bruce Willis seeing off Alan Rickman and his entire gang of thieves in Nakatomi Plaza without any shoes on! However, when it was announced that ITV were going to be in the frame when the Premier League highlights package comes up for grabs in 2016, I found myself rooting immediately for the top dog. Gary Lineker (from left to right), Alan Shearer and Robbie Savage pictured on Saturday's Match of the Day . Des Lynam (from left to right), Terry Venables and Ally McCoist during The Premiership on ITV years ago . Adrian Chiles (left) chats with Roy Keane and Gareth Southgate during ITV's coverage of an England game . Not that I have anything particularly against ITV and their Adrian Chiles-led football squad. After all, they were considered by many to have had a more than decent World Cup. The broadcasts playing as they did to the avuncular, ‘everyman’ personality of the host. More recently, they did a perfectly decent job of bringing England’s trip to Celtic Park to terrestrial telly. While of course they have been regularly delivering Champions League to our homes for no extra charge. The big deal here though is that their work is done best as live coverage. Slapped with gusto across your evening’s entertainment - 10.30pm on a Saturday night, though? Well that’s a different matter. That has become a nigh on religious experience for football fans looking to find their Saturday football in a nutshell. And that is what Match of the Day provides. And we know this, as much as anything else, because for a few uncomfortable seasons, it didn’t. I’m not a U2 fan at the best of times. But I managed to build up quite the dislike for them when their ‘It’s A Beautiful Day’ welcomed us to ITV’s version of MOTD. What’s more, the programme then went on to make Des Lynam look ordinary in the process, which should practically be against the law. Presenter Lynam pictured during his debut for football coverage for ITV Sport after his move from BBC . McCoist, Lynam and Venables pose with the Premier League trophy ahead of launching ITV's new show . U2's 'It's A Beautiful Day' used to precede ITV's version of Match of the Day... and grew on people's nerves . Des just didn’t look right in a show that felt like it spent as much time flogging us soap powder as it did showing us the highlights. I know it’s a commercial channel, and it does that job very well. But come late Saturday night, those frequent two minute pauses were like little daggers to the heart. This news has a particular piquancy in a season when Match of the Day has upped its game. Alan Hansen’s retirement rang out of the old, and the new has seen the show flourish. Helped, ironically, by the frequent neat reminders that it also happens to be the show’s 50th anniversary. Been there, done that. Still doing it. It doesn’t hurt to have an ex pro with an exceptional playing career at the helm, of course. Gary Lineker may look like he’s after a job in the Musketeers during Movember, but is actually now nailed on as the best telly host in football. And with Alan Shearer apparently freed up since Hansen’s departure and really getting his act going with his fellow striker, you surely can’t see why you’d want that chemistry to change? Lineker remains the host of Match of the Day on BBC, which airs most Saturday nights at 10.30pm . Shearer (left) and  Savage (right) were the experts on Match of the Day this week . Lineker, Shearer and Savage chew the fat over the day's Premier League football on Saturday night . Saturday provided some great examples of this. Lineker has perfected the art of knowing when to let his experts do the talking, and when to chip in. Such as when Al was in the process of telling us Manchester City were ‘a million miles off’, and Gary chipped in quickly ‘why?’. He wanted evidence of their lack of title credentials. And Shearer provided it, with analysis that has improved dramatically from him during the last year. He also let Shearer let rip on his fellow pundit on the night , Robbie Savage. He said he’d have been ‘disappointed’ if he’d got a red card for Claudio Yacob’s nigh on THREE footed challenge at Stamford Bridge. ‘You’re having a laugh,’ cried an incredulous Shearer as the two went at it. As the dust settled, Gary simply observed, ‘red card all day’ and moved along. Despite this mishap before Switzerland vs England, ITV Sport have gotten better at presenting live football . Andy Townsend (right) was mocked for his Townsend's Tactics Truck during ITV's Premiership show . Lineker also knows when to unlace his boots, put on his slippers and just be a fan. In response to Ross Barkley’s dive at Goodison Park, he told his fellow panellists ‘footballers do themselves no favours. It’s an embarrassment’. Few at home would disagree with him. As mentioned earlier, being a fan is where  Chiles comes in. But he is not so skilled at getting out of the way again. That simply would not wash in a highlights show at the business end of Saturday night. I think it needs to avoid too much faff, and steer a pretty straight furrow through the highlights and talking points. That has never proved to be the ITV way. In the end, money may talk. Which could potentially see yet another big money move for the Premier League highlights. But I personally think it’s clear where they have their natural home. Somewhere you wouldn’t be hearing too much Bono.

"Indian King of England: DNA tests show Prince William is of Indian descent . DNA testing has revealed that Prince William will become the first British monarch of Indian ancestry. A clear genetic line has been drawn between the Duke of Cambridge and a half-Indian woman, potentially marking him as the first King whose bloodline is descended from the country. Analysis of saliva samples on relatives of Prince William revealed the link between the second in line to the throne and a distant relative from his mother’s family. The revelation will prompt calls for the 30-year-old prince to make his maiden visit to India, following in the footsteps of his parents who travelled there in 1992. The genetic link with India is believed to originate from Williams’s great-great-great-great-great grandmother Eliza Kewark. Although often described as Armenian, DNA analysis has revealed that she was at least half-Indian and is known to have lived in the country’s western region. Scottish scientists established the link after discovering that Eliza’s descendants carried a rare strand of DNA - known as mitochondrial DNA - which can only be passed on by a mother. Only people from the Indian subcontinent have been found to carry the particular strand of DNA. It has been recorded in 14 other people - all Indian, apart from one Nepalese native. The DNA is thought to have been passed down to Prince William and his brother Harry, as the scientist behind the research described the genetic link as ‘unassailable’. The tests were carried out by genetics expert Jim Wilson, from the University of Edinburgh and a group called BritainsDNA, who said that the princes would be unable to pass the DNA to their children. A clear genetic line has been drawn between the Duke of Cambridge and Eliza Kewark, who was at least half-Indian and is known to have lived in the country's western region . From mother to son: The DNA has been passed down from Diana's side of the family from Prince William's great-great-great-great-great grandmother Eliza Kewark who was half-Indian . It has not been revealed which relations of William supplied the saliva samples to allow the DNA to be tested. Princess Diana’s maternal aunt Mary Roach . told The Times: ‘I always assumed that I was part-Armenian so I am . delighted that I also have an Indian background.’ Kewark was married to Scotsman Theodore Forbes, who left his wife and sent their daughter, Katherine, to live in Britain aged six. Letters sent from Kewark to her estranged husband were discovered by researchers in which she begged to be able to see her children again. Princess Diana pictured at the Taj Mahal (left) and wearing a garland (right) during her visit to India, in 1992 . First and last: The DNA will not be passed on to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's child as the mitochondrial DNA is linked to the mother's side . The communication suggests that Forbes . turned his back on his wife, potentially due to her race, referring to . her as his ‘housekeeper’ in his will after he died returning to Britain . on a ship in 1820. He also described her as the ‘purported mother’ of Katherine. Mitochondrial DNA, also known as the Eve Gene, is inherited solely from the mother in most species, including humans. Tracing the gene has become an important tool in anthropology and field biology as it allows scientists to study links between populations. It is believed to have evolved separately from nuclear DNA, deriving from the circular genomes of bacteria engulfed by the early ancestors of the modern-day eukaryotic cells. According to the Bradshaw Foundation, it is believed by some molecular biologists that at one stage the mitochondrion was a free-living organism with its own DNA. They say it also held the key for generating lots of energy. It then invaded single-celled nucleated organisms and has remained ever since. While males cannot pass the DNA on to their children, they do receive and use their mother's mitochondrial DNA. If the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge do decide to make a state visit to the country after the expected birth of the couple’s baby in July, the second in line to the throne will hope that their experience is more harmonious than his parents. Princess Diana was famously pictured sitting alone outside the Taj Mahal, an Indian landmark regarded as symbol of love, without her husband in sight. His direct genetic lineage could be seized upon by Buckingham Palace as a way of boosting the British monarchy’s popularity in the country. Alistair Moffat, the founder of BritainsDNA, said: ‘Knowing something about your DNA and its origins in prehistory definitely changes your sense of yourself, and one way that it does that is to make you feel part of a world community.’ Historian Alistair Moffat told . MailOnline how before India became a part of the British Empire in the . mid-19th century, it was governed by the East India Company, who . employed armies and generals and even fought wars, including Robert . Clive's famous campaign against the French which culminated in the . victory at Plassey. Mr Moffat said: 'When Henry Dundas . became Governor General of the East India Company, he began to appoint . more and more Scots to important positions. 'When Theodore Forbes came to Leith . to work, he probably came into contact with the tea merchants who . brought tea to Britain in the tea clippers, the wonderful sailing ships. Perhaps the Cutty Sark is the best known. Princess Diana was famously pictured sitting alone outside the Taj Mahal, an Indian landmark regarded as symbol of love, during the visit to the country . The Prince of Wales receives the traditional southern Indian greeting of a Tilak on the forehead from Mres Sayyavati, mother of the Governor of Andhra Pradesh, as they visit him at the start of the last full day of his and Diana's visit to the country . 'Scottish entrepreneurs had invested so heavily in the Indian tea industry that it outstripped production in China. 'As the third son of a Scottish . landowner, Forbes needed to make his fortune elsewhere and like many . ambitious young men, he went to India to do just that. 'When Forbes arrived in the Bombay . Presidency he employed a housekeeper, Eliza Kewark. They had three . children, one of whom, Catherine or Kitty, was the ancestress of . Princess Diana.' The wedding of Ruth Sylvia Gill and Edmund Burke Roche, 4th Baron Fermoy, at St Devenick's Church, Bieldside, Scotland . Prince William's Indian ancestry can be traced back through his family tree which reveals his genetic link with Eliza Kewark. Kewark had three children with Theodore Forbes after he arrived in India, working for the East India Company. One of their children, Katherine, became a well-respected member of society in Scotland and married James Crombie, a member of the family that manufactured the coats of the same name, in Aberdeen, in March 1837. The pair had eight children including Jane Crombie, who was born in November 8, 1843, and married David Littlejohn. Their daughter, Ruth Littlejohn, was born in 1879, who married Colonel William Smith Gill in 1898. Ruth Littlejophn then gave birth to Ruth Sylvia Gill eight years after the turn of the century, who lived until July 6, 1993. She became styled as Baroness Fermony after she married Edmund Burke Roche, 4th Baron Fermoy, in September 1931. She . held the office of Justice of the Peace between June 1956 and March . 1960, before she became the Woman of the Bedchamber to HM Queen Elizabeth . The Queen Mother, and was invested as a Dame Commander, Royal Victorian . Order, in 1966. Among her children was Princess Diana's mother, the Hon Frances Burke Roche, born on January 20, 1936, in Sandringham, Norfolk.

"Steffon Armitage's hopes of earning an England World Cup call-up appear to be in the balance as the flanker was being questioned at a police station in Toulon on Wednesday night over an alleged assault. The 29-year-old European Player of the Year was held in custody for several hours – along with team-mate Xavier Chiocci – in connection with an incident on December 13, after a Champions Cup match against Leicester. Several Toulon players were celebrating their victory at a Mourillon beach-side bar-restaurant and eye-witnesses have alleged that Armitage and Chiocci were involved in a fight with another customer. Steffon Armitage was being questioned at a police station on Wednesday night over an alleged assault . Armitage's Toulon team-mate Xavier Chiocci was also held in custody for several hours . Several Toulon players (pictured Delon Armitage and Mathieu Bastareaud) were celebrating their victory over Leicester on December 13 in a Mourillon beach-side bar-restaurant when a fight is alleged to have broke out . A 30-year-old man is understood to have sustained an injury to his eye after being knocked to the ground. However, initial reports in France have claimed that both Armitage and France prop Chiocci told officers that they have no recollection of the episode. Armitage voluntarily attended the police station to explain what happened and he was being held in a cell, but he has not been arrested or charged. Toulon released a statement on Thursday confirming that Chiocci had been released from custody on Wednesday night without charge, but that Armitage continued to be held over-night for further questioning. The club are expecting to discover on Thursday whether he will be charged and if so, they will consider sanctions of their own. He has been in sensational form for Toulon again this season, leading to another nomination for the European Player of the Year award and growing calls for him to be brought out of international exile by England head coach Stuart Lancaster. The prolific openside – who can also operate effectively at No 8 – won five caps for his country between 2009 and 2010, but he has been in France since 2011 and the RFU edict against picking players based overseas for Test duty has undermined his strong claims. Armitage has won five caps for England but hasn't played for his country since moving to France in 2011 . The flanker celebrates scoring a try during a Champions Cup match against Llanelli Scarlets last October . There is an ‘exceptional circumstances’ clause which can be triggered by Lancaster, but he has consistently indicated that he will not consider doing so until it comes to naming an expanded World Cup training squad in June. Earlier this season, it emerged that Armitage was weighing up a move to Bath, to enhance his prospects of being recalled by England, but the deal fell through when the RFU refused to make a financial contribution. The former London Irish player also considered acquiring a French passport and exploiting a new eligibility loophole to switch allegiance to France, but that plan was swiftly abandoned. Armitage celebrates with brother Delon during a London Irish Challenge Cup match in 2009 .

"A cat-loving couple from Australia are just days away from opening the country's first ever cafe where consumers can dine-in with fury felines. Anita and Myles Loughran have been given the final approval to open their Melbourne coffee house, aptly titled Cat Cafe, which will effectively combine people's affection for cats with a love of good coffee. The complex will include a purpose built area upstairs, above the cafe itself, which will permanently house 11 friendly-natured and well nurtured animals hand-picked from the owners themselves. The upstairs interior, where cafe-goers will be able to interact with animals, has been built to cat-friendly specifications and includes five rooms housing giant cat-climbing frames and carpeted shelves mounted to walls. Scroll down for video . The Cat cafe will open on July 30 complete with a cafe on one level and a fully interactive upstairs area where cats and cafe-goers can play . Patrons can watch and interact with 11 cats, hand-picked by the owners from Victorian rescue shelters . Visitors who want to interact with cats can pay $5 for half hour and $10 for an hour . Humans will be able to spend time with animals in four of the five rooms, with one reserved as a cat-only area. Visitors who want to interact with cats can pay $10 for the first hour and then $5 for every half an hour. There are rules around interacting, such as not feeding them or waking them if they're asleep, but there's no limit to the amount of time someone can spend with them. Mrs Loughran said while there had been a lot of 'back and forth' in getting the project up and running, she was always confident the 'Tokyo-inspired' business would get off the ground. She said the idea came to her and husband Myles after visiting a Japanese cafe similar to the one they are proposing.  After returning to Australia and becoming dissatisfied with their jobs, they decided to see if starting their own cat cafe was feasible. Mrs Loughran said she found a gap in the market, but was faced with the biggest hurdle of overcoming various 'unprecedented' health and safety requirements because no such business in Australia existed. Having successfully jumped through legal hoops, finding a suitable site and convincing a willing landlord, the pair will open the cafe on July 30. The idea of the cat cafe first came from a trip Mr and Mrs Loughran took on their honeymoon to Japan, where they visited a cat cafe similar to the one they are proposing . The aim of the cafe is to give people who can't own pets due to certain apartment or dwelling restrictions, the opportunity to interact with the animals . 'The permission for the animals depended on the landlord, and when we struck an agreement, the next challenge came from the city council,' she said. 'Because it was a first in Australia, they had to create strict regulations for us so there was a lot of back and forth. Among the terms of the deal was that cats where to be kept strictly kept on-site, and that they couldn't be 'adopted' out.","The Cat Cafe will open on July 30 at 375 Queen Street, Melbourne .

"Opulent to the extreme, the lavish estate of the Ukraine's ex-prosecutor-general Viktor Pshonka is another example of the extravagant homes the country's former leaders and top officials enjoyed living in. With Pshonka reportedly having fled the country, the photos show the exterior and interior of the home, in the village of Gorenichy outside the capital Kiev, taken on Monday. A Reuters photographer said that with Pshonka gone, journalists and people entered the house to inspect it. Zik reported that along with fugitive former president's Viktor Yanukovich's estate, the properties were having their value assessed by experts in the wake of them going on the run. This was only one of Pshonka's homes. He also had the use of a hunting lodge around 20 miles away on a compound with two other lodges, one of them for the use of the deposed president Viktor Yanukovych. The hunting estate has been entered by opposition activists, who found guns and removed files, reported www.kyivpost.com. But there was no sign of Pshonka, who is seen as one of the key allies of Yanukovych. Like Yanukovych, he is now on the run and his whereabouts are unclear. He may have left the country and is subject to an arrest warrant issued by the new authorities. The scale of the opulence of homes used by public officials is seen by opposition activists as proof of large-scale corruption among the country's elite, one of the key causes of public anger which led to the protests in Kiev and other cities.

His portrait, in uniform, is on the left, while the woman on the right is believed to be his wife. The cross on his desk and icons on the top of the bookscase reflect his Orthodox faith . At the weekend, hundreds of people poured through the doors of Yanukovich's sprawling winter residence in Mezhyhirya, an hour's drive from Kiev, to gawp at its gaudy wonders. Today it was the turn of Pshonka's house, a treasure trove filled with hundreds of jewelry pieces, arms collections, religious books, old icons and pictures. Former ex-prosecutor-general Viktor Pshonka held the position from November 4, 2010 until February 22, 2014, when he was ousted  by the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukraine parliament, in a no-confidence vote. On February 23 an arrest warrant was issued for Pshonka. Behind by a fort-like gate (pictured below), Pshonka's home awaits sprawling gardens and manicured grass. But the real extravaganza is in the house. It features an indoor swimming pool, plush dinning rooms, grand fire places and is littered with ornate valuables and artwork including many portraits of himself. The house's owner, former prosecutor-general Viktor Pshonka. Before he fled, Pshonka was a key member of the government.

"Last week this column ventured the view that English cricket was in denial. So we need to be careful how we tread after a 266-run win over India at the Ageas Bowl that was so complete it lacked only the sight of Ravindra Jadeja publicly forgiving Jimmy Anderson for whatever it was that happened in the Trent Bridge pavilion three weeks ago. The good news for England is the bleeding has been staunched, and several of the themes that contributed to the mood of self-denial have been remedied – not least the response of the senior players, the runs of Alastair Cook, his use of Moeen Ali’s off-breaks, and the wicketkeeper. The curmudgeonly news is that India appeared to have left their heads and hearts at Lord’s, a result that – if they are not careful – will leave them misty-eyed for longer than it takes to complete the series at Old Trafford and The Oval. What a relief: England, including captain Alastair Cook (second left) celebrate on the way to victory . India were not merely poor in Southampton. They were crushingly anonymous. From the moment MS Dhoni went on the defensive on the first afternoon, they conveyed to England an interest in damage limitation only. And, offered the chance to trample all over Dhoni’s hospitality – a trait well-known to Indian fans during their pre-Lord’s three-year drought away from home – England quietly thanked him. The upshot of both that, and Jadeja’s obliging drop at third slip when Cook had 15 – the kind of moment that can change a career – was that each of England’s seniors made the impact demanded of them in advance. Cook’s double of 95 and 70 not out recalled the salad days when he would tuck into buffet seam bowling for fun (Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami are skilful operators, but they look knackered). Somehow, India bowled England’s run machine back into form. Ian Bell, spared a first-innings duck by India’s continued refusal to countenance the DRS (of which more below), late-cut as if this was the 2013 Ashes all over again. Then there was Stuart Broad and Anderson, sharing eight wickets in the first innings, before Anderson took control once more on the final morning. Their confidence stemmed in part from the 569 for seven England racked up with the help of India’s fatalism in the field. Such things are all part of the jigsaw. With the four oldies all chipping in, the youngsters were able to go about their business, unencumbered by the concern that everything depended on them – like children trying to hold things together in a divorce. Gary Ballance could be removed only by umpiring error, Joe Root battered a second-innings 50 from 38 balls, Jos Buttler chanced his arm gloriously and assuaged fears about his ability with the gloves, and Moeen looked suspiciously frontline rather than part-time. Encouraging though this all is, the fact remains that England have won only one of their last 11 Tests, and could still lose a home series to a team that travels less well than camembert. Some of their dominance at the Ageas Bowl was down to the opposition. Jumping for joy: Man of the match James Anderson was one of the senior players who backed up the captain . For more cricket-related snippets, feel free to go to twitter.com/the_topspin . As for Cook’s captaincy, which – more than his batting – persuaded this column to suggest he was no longer up to the job, it drew on his runs like an old friend feeds off another after months of separation. Suddenly, we were marvelling at the fielding and bowling changes – the hunch on Root that produced the wicket of Shikhar Dhawan on Wednesday evening, and the gully brought in moments before Kumar was caught there on Thursday morning. Such can be the nature of leadership. Cook did not suddenly wake up a tactical genius – and his hopes of victory in this series could depend on how well the ECB’s lawyers manage to defend Anderson today. But he was spot on when he lauded England’s ‘perfect Test’. Before this series began, we feared a clash shot through with mid-table mediocrity, and so far the sides have traded blows accordingly. Both were neutered by Nottingham’s answer to the Nullarbor Plain, before England imploded at Lord’s and India surrendered in Southampton. Positive spin: Moeen Ali (right) salutes taking his fifth wicket of India's second innings - he finished with six . Since momentum is the most over-rated concept in international sport (a clue: it doesn’t actually exist), trying to predict what happens next is futile. Suffice to say that England are in less denial than they were this time last week, while India need to wake up quickly. On a pitch laden with runs, 10 of their batsmen passed 20 yet none made 55. Even Ajinkya Rahane, who alone stood firm on the final morning, deserved a quiet talking-to after hitting a Moeen long hop straight up in the air on the third evening. And if they continue to ignore Ravichandran Ashwin, England will be thrilled. It’s only one Test. But Cook’s England needed to start somewhere. THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS . Groan Pt XXVIII . The word for a while now has been that, some time soon, India will withdraw their opposition to DRS, thus minimising the chances of an international cricketer’s career being ruined by a duff decision. But when MS Dhoni was asked whether events at the Ageas Bowl – where both sides suffered howlers – had changed India’s stance on technology, he was unequivocal. ‘No.’ He enlarged on his view. ‘But there’s an interesting thing you know,’ he said. ‘There was a ball that clipped Pujara’s inner thigh but it showed that the ball hit the stumps. The ball went to wicketkeeper and it didn’t touch the bails at all. So that shows how accurate the DRS is.’ No review of their stance: MS Dhoni (centre) and India are still opponents of DRS . Was Hawk-Eye simply predicting what would have happened had the ball not been intercepted by Pujara’s inner thigh? That, after all, is the point of Hawk-Eye. But no matter: Dhoni had seen an incident that means matches involving India will continue to be blighted by human error. Sometimes, you really do despair. D-day for Anderson . Why did Jimmy Anderson feel the need to get involved in a brief slanging match with Ajinkya Rahane on the fourth evening in Southampton, less than 48 hours before he was due to face Justice Gordon Lewis and relive Trentbridgepushandshovegate? Perhaps England had done too good a job in taking his mind off the hearing. And yet it’s important that Anderson is tried solely on the basis of events in the Nottingham pavilion. Mystifyingly, the BCCI have been briefing that they are going after him partly because of his incessant sledging over the years – a stance that can only weaken their case. Anderson should have stopped abusing opponents years ago. But he must be convicted or acquitted because of what did or didn’t happen on Thursday July 10. No need: Anderson (right) got himself involved in a slanging match with Ajinkya Rahane at the Ageas Bowl . Save the players . Are cricketers such a bland lot that the world can’t contain its excitement when one of them gets a little political? Apparently so. One former England player suggested to me during the third Test that Moeen Ali’s ‘Save Gaza’ and ‘Free Palestine’ wristbands were unhelpful for the team because of the attention they commanded. He had a point – but only because corporate levels of banality are now the norm. Moeen didn’t save the world, but neither did it stop turning. Farewell, then… . A colossus of a player called it a day last week, a man who bestrode one of the sport’s theatre of dreams for years, racking up the runs and entertaining a nation. Had he bowled, David Sales truly would have been Northamptonshire’s answer to Jacques Kallis. We’ll miss you. The Sales are over: Northamptonshire's veteran batsman David Sales (right) has called it a day .","England beat India by 266 runs at the Ageas Bowl .

"Officiating was better this Saturday but there were still errors, as there will always be. Often errors are understandable and have to be accepted as part of the game, but some are inexplicable and when I was refereeing Premier league games we were told that 'you cannot defend the indefensible'. There were three clear errors on Saturday and one was understandable but two were not. Jose Fonte went unpunished for this clear handball despite referee Bobby Madley having a clear view . Newcastle's Emmanuel Riviere protested to referee Madley, who waves his appeals away . Despite Riviere's impassioned appeals to the official, Newcastle were not awarded the penalty . Referees hope any errors do not affect the outcome of the game but unfortunately it appeared that Bobby Madley failing to award Newcastle a clear penalty when Jose Fonte handled the ball towards the end of game against Southampton did just that. Newcastle were trailing 1-2 when a shot was clearly blocked by Fonte’s outstretched arm and an apparently well positioned Madley gave nothing. It was inexplicable as he had nobody blocking his view and he had no reason to look anywhere else – in other words an 'indefensible' error. Chris Foy had a different issue at White Hart Lane where he disallowed a perfectly good goal for offside when his assistant, Stuart Burt, signalled that Jan Vertonghen was offside. Replays clearly showed Jan Vertonghen to be inside his own half as he ran clear to score a disallowed goal . The Belgian's celebrations were cut short when assistant Stuart Burt inexplicably flagged for offside . Vertonghen couldn't believe his bad luck but Tottenham still went on to win the match . It was a really poor decision as Vertonghen was in his own half when the ball was played forward. Luckily it didn't affect the outcome as Tottenham were already 2-1 up and the game finished shortly after the incident but I expect the assistant to miss a game next weekend. The most interesting incident came in Crystal Palace’s win at Turf Moor and preceded Burnley’s second goal by Danny Ings. Burnley’s Scott Arfield was chasing a through ball which Joel Ward was trying to shepherd out of play. Arfield nicked the ball and both players ran off the field. To escape the attentions of Ward, Arfield clearly pushed him which if within the field of play it would have been as easy free kick to give. Referee Phil Dowd gave nothing, perhaps thrown by the location of the incident when he should have stopped play for the push and restarted with a drop ball. I could understand this error and again it didn’t affect the final result. Burnley's Scott Arfield (left) and Crystal Palace's Joel Ward were involved in an incident on Saturday . Mike Dean's decision to award Nacho Monreal a penalty after this Vincent Kompany tackle was correct . On Sunday, Mike Dean made an excellent decision in awarding Arsenal a penalty. Vincent Kompany made no attempt to play the ball and stood up to block Nacho Monreal as he attempted to run into the penalty area. Watching Kompany — and also watching where he was looking — confirmed the defender’s intentions and Dean will have seen that before pointing to the penalty spot. Although there was not a huge amount of contact, it was clearly a foul and an unnecessary one for the City skipper to make.","Saturday's Premier League action saw three clear refereeing errors .

"I’m really excited about the England squad Stuart Lancaster has selected and delighted to see Danny Cipriani and Nick Easter involved again. This is a momentous year for English rugby with a World Cup just around the corner and I’m pleased Lancaster has been bold enough to select two of the Premiership’s form players in a squad full of high-quality Test match animals. England may be missing a few players through injury but they have so much depth that there are no excuses for underperforming in this Six Nations. It’s time to deliver. Danny Cipriani was given a surprise call up to England's training squad ahead of the Six Nations . England head coach Stuart Lancaster named his training squad at Twickenham on Wednesday . M Brown; A Watson, J Joseph, K Eastmond, J May; D Cipriani, B Youngs; A Corbisiero, D Hartley, D Wilson; G Parling, G Kruis; C Robshaw (capt), B Vunipola, J Haskell . They have more talent available than any of the other home unions and I can’t wait to see a bold, attacking England team with a clear direction of how they want to play and a clear selection policy based on attack-minded players who want to take the game to the opposition. Cipriani definitely falls into that category and I’m delighted to see him included. I have watched so many high-class fly-halves down the years, with Jonny Wilkinson unquestionably being the best to have played for England. But Cipriani is the only English No 10 of the past 20 years who, if I’d been coach and he had been up for selection at the same time as Jonny, could have caused big selection headaches. Nick Easter was also recalled to the England set-up despite being in international exile since 2011 . Lancaster is flanked by forwards coach Graham Rowntree (left) and back coach Andy Farrell (right) The Sale man’s skill-set is so complete. He poses an attacking threat with ball in hand and has a superb kicking game and world-class distribution. I think Wilkinson would have got the nod over him in the end but the fact I even mention them in the same breath shows how highly I rate Cipriani. If England are to capitalise on their world-class pack they have to pick a fly-half who will instil fear in the opposition. George Ford has enormous potential, a great attitude and all the skills required to take the ball flat to the line and challenge opponents on the gainline. Cipriani provides England with an attacking threat as well as having world-class distribution . Jonny Wilkinson is widely regarded as the best fly-half to ever play for England . But if there’s one English fly-half opposition teams would not want to play against at the moment then it’s Cipriani. He’s also got the edge in experience. For me, he’s simply the best fly-half in the country right now and he’d be in my XV for the opener against Wales on February 6. It’s interesting that Lancaster has gone for four fly-halves instead of three and I wonder if there was some last-minute tinkering. But the real test will be when he picks his 23 for Cardiff in what is going to be one of the biggest Six Nations games in living memory. There’s so much riding on that contest, not just for the Six Nations but also with the World Cup pool game coming up in September. It cannot be overstated how important it is for England to win next month because if they lose, they will be behind the eight ball for the rest of the championship. That’s why I want to see them pick a side to really attack Wales. England need to play flat to the line and challenge the Welsh defence. The exciting aspect is that there are so many players in form at the moment with Northampton, Bath, Wasps and Saracens all flying in Europe. Joe Simpson in action for Wasps during a European Rugby Champions Cup match against Harlequins . George Ford kicks at goal during an autumn international clash with Australia at Twickenham in November . How will England choose to play? Bath proved in their fantastic win over Toulouse at the weekend that there are English-qualified players who are capable of shredding defences with their pace and skills — Jonathan Joseph was absolutely outstanding at outside centre. I’d pick Joseph against Wales alongside his Bath team-mate Kyle Eastmond. I’d then insist on the Millennium Stadium roof being shut to ensure perfect conditions. Then I’d order my team to go out and attack. It’s going to be fascinating to see if Lancaster can hold his nerve when it comes to whittling down his squad and I’ll be disappointed if he reverts to a conservative selection policy. Toulon forward Steffon Armitage was overlooked for the training squad by Lancaster . Owen Farrell is one of four fly-halves that have been included in the training squad for the Six Nations . This is not the year for ‘Steady Eddie’ selection — this is the year to risk everything in the quest for gold. I’d even add wing Christian Wade and scrum-half Joe Simpson to my squad and team. This is his time for Lancaster to show the country he is capable of coaching a team to the ultimate glory. I’ve no doubt he’ll be energised and excited about that prospect and the critical thing now is that he remains bold and clear in his selection. He needs to pick a tough , uncompromising team capable of scaring opponents and with Lions such as Alex Corbisiero back in the fold there’s no doubt he has a pack that will pose problems for anyone. Easter’s return is welcome. It’s a huge achievement for a player of 36 to force his way back into contention after a three-and-a-half-year absence. He looks fit and in good shape and while he may not be the quickest No 8 in the country, he does possess excellent footballing skills and bags of experience. Stephen Myler kicks a penalty for Northampton in their Champions Cup tie with Ospreys in Swansea . It’s testament to Easter’s mental strength that he’s never given up on playing for England again. I hope all that nonsense about what he may or may not have said after the World Cup quarter-final defeat in 2011 has been well and truly put to bed. I’d still have gone for Steffon Armitage — who is proving time after time at Toulon that he is a world-class operator — but Easter is a bold selection and the next best thing. So, all in all, I’m encouraged by this squad. This year is rugby’s equivalent of the 2012 Olympics. It’s rugby’s year. And the challenge for Lancaster and his coaching team is to pick a team of which the nation can be proud and which opponents will fear. The talent is there, no question. This squad is a great start. The next two weeks are going to be crucial ahead of what is a massive, massive game. The question is: Will they hold their nerve?","Danny Cipriani and Nick Easter were both given World Cup lifelines .

"The Premier League is bracing itself for what could be one of the most thrilling top four races ever seen. With Sam Allardyce seemingly ruling West Ham out, it leaves five clubs chasing two remaining Champions League spots, and even then the threat of Europa League or Champions League winners breaking hearts to add further confusion. So who will seal those top four spots? Let’s work on the basis that Chelsea and Manchester City will finish in the top two. Of course nothing is guaranteed at this stage, but it would take a brave person to bet against that happening. So let’s look at those below... It would take a brave man to bet against Chelsea and Manchester City occupying the top two slots come May . SOUTHAMPTON . They won’t go away will they? Even with key players injured recently they have sustained their challenge. They’ve been unlucky to lose Jay Rodriguez for so long and I’m hoping he comes back as fit and strong as he was before his injury, but two things could prove to be Southampton’s undoing: firstly, Graziano Pelle’s goals are drying up. He’s scored two in 15 Premier League appearances – it had been six in nine before that. The other concern is that Saints have to go to both Chelsea and Manchester City in the run-in. Graziano Pelle has found goals tough to come by of late, with his last Premier League strike in December . Ronald Koeman has worked wonders on the south coast, with the Dutchman's side currently lying third . MANCHESTER UNITED . When the long-ball king calls you a long-ball team, he must be listened to. But Allardyce was merely furthering his claims to be the next Real Madrid manager by trying to belittle Louis van Gaal. It won’t fool the intelligent football follower of course. Van Gaal can mix it up, and find a way of getting a result when defeat looks certain. Without ever really hitting the stride for the full 90 minutes in any game this season, Manchester United have somehow worked the way up from seventh place oblivion to the top four, albeit a precarious position there. They host Manchester City then go to Chelsea in back-to-back games in the middle of April before a run of five games to end the season where they face four sides currently in the bottom half of the table. The big clash in that final stretch is at home to Arsenal in the penultimate game, and that could almost be a play-off for a top four place. The big obstacle for United is that they’re struggling to play fluent football, they have a heavy reliance on their goalkeeper, and without Michael Carrick they look less likely to win games. The star trio of Robin van Persie, Radamel Falcao and Wayne Rooney have yet to hit the heights . The fitness of Michael Carrick (second left) is key to United's hopes of a top-four finish . SPURS . In the next five weeks Spurs go to Liverpool and Manchester United and those results could well determine whether they make it or not. They have match-winners in Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen who have proven already this season they can deliver in the big games and when under pressure. Their weaknesses are obvious – they’ve combined being the lowest scorers in the current top six with being the side which has conceded most. They give away some silly goals – Danny Rose and Kyle Walker were both at fault for the Arsenal goal on Saturday. There’s nothing stopping Spurs, apart from that unshakeable belief that they simply won’t do it, just like most seasons. Harry Kane has been a revelation this season, scoring 22 goals in all competitions for a resurgent Spurs . Christian Eriksen has also chimed in with eleven goals as the midfield maestro pulls the strings . ARSENAL . Weaknesses in this Arsenal side are numerous. Any side that relies on Per Mertesacker is asking for trouble, and when Laurent Koscielny defends like he did at White Hart Lane at the weekend, there is no hope. Hector Bellerin can score a worldy against Aston Villa, but struggles to convince when up against a side playing well. Francis Coquelin, Nacho Monreal, Tomas Rosicky and others are all over-praised by Arsenal fans in the rather embarrassing hope they will convince themselves these players are truly going to be regulars in a side that will push to win the Premier League title. The good news for Gooners is that they always make the top four. With the exception of a trip to Old Trafford in the middle of May all their tougher opponents have to come to the Emirates, and Theo Walcott is back and makes a huge difference to how they play. I expect them to win  fourth, and maybe even challenge for third as well. Theo Walcott has boosted Arsenal's hopes of making it 18 consecutive years of Champions League football . But World Cup-winner Per Mertesacker has not covered himself in glory with the Gunners leaking goals . LIVERPOOL . Have they left it too late? They’re not losing games – their last defeat was in the middle of December. Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho picked up knocks against Everton and if either of those two are out for any length of time that could kill off the Reds’ top four dreams. Can Daniel Sturridge handle the pressure of being this season's saviour? Before the round of midweek games Liverpool sit six points behind third-placed Southampton with a far inferior goal difference. Brendan Rodgers’ reliance on youth is admirable, with Jordon Ibe an exciting new addition to the side. But can that youth sustain the quality needed in the big pressure games in the run-in when they go to Southampton, Arsenal and Chelsea? And don’t forget their final game is at Stoke, where they have won only once since Stoke were promoted to the Premier League in 2008. Raheem Sterling, who has been offered a new Liverpool deal, is central to the club's hopes of a top four finish . Philippe Coutinho is also a key component of Brendan Rodgers' side as they chase the Champions League . It’s a tight contest, and it’s going to be very exciting, but I’m going to go for Arsenal and Manchester United to fill those top four spots.","Assuming Chelsea and Manchester City will finish in the top two, we appear set for one of the best battles for the Champions League places .
Five into two does not go, so who will miss out with Southampton, Manchester United, Spurs, Arsenal and Liverpool vying for the top four?

United are not playing fluently and will need Michael Carrick to stay fit .

"This is the story of two players. The first is a young striker who does well at a club which is established in the Premier League, but which doesn’t have a recent history of challenging for cups or the top four. His talents catch the eye of certain clubs who are challenging for such honours. Naturally the player wants to go and test himself at that higher level. He is open and honest about it, he pledges to do all he can to score goals and help his current team stay up, before making it clear he wants to move on when the season is over. This player is Saido Berahino; he is vilified, dropped and labelled a troublemaker and a problem player, who has ‘baggage’. Saido Berahino has been labelled as a troublemaker despite being honest about his desire to help West Brom . Berahino was dropped by West Brom boss Tony Pulis for the weekend's 2-2 draw against Burnley . Berahino has been a success at Under 21 level and has been courted by several Premier League clubs . The second player is also a young striker, he says absolutely nothing publicly, keeps on doing well and scoring goals for his club in a relegation battle, but knows he will be allowed to leave his club for nothing, earn a bumper wage and a big signing on fee when the season is over, whether they stay up or not. This player is Danny Ings; he is loved and admired by pretty much everybody, and he’s never criticised. I really like Ings, and admire his career path, as well as the way he plays. But is he worthy of more praise and respect just because he is not telling the fans anything about his future? There is a strong possibility that having given the player a great opportunity in the game, Burnley Football Club could be left with nothing this summer. Some might say that he will be allowed to leave on a free transfer with the blessing of the Burnley fans if he scores the goals to keep them up. Will the same warmth be offered to Berahino at West Bromwich Albion? It doesn’t look likely, so what’s the difference? Is it down to a couple of incidents off the field? There are plenty of Premier League players who have similar – worse - difficulties but those are virtually forgotten in an instant (West Ham’s James Tomkins is a recent example), so surely it can’t be that. Danny Ings' situation mirrors that of Berahino, yet the Burnley striker is not viewed as being difficult . Ings has netted eight times this season, compared to Berahino's nine, and both men are highly courted . Ings put Burnley 2-0 up at Turf Moor, only to see his side pegged back by a sterling West Brom fightback . Some have suggested Berahino has been badly advised. Really? Let’s get this straight – he’s gone on record and said he wants to do well for West Brom, keep them up, and then go on to bigger things. He’s been honest with the fans and everyone about his plans for the future. What’s wrong with being honest? Should he be advised to lie, or not be up front with the fans who pay his wages? And he’s been criticised for doing an interview without the club’s permission. One of the worst features of the modern game in this country is how far removed players are from fans in the Premier League. But worse than that, it seems players are gagged while it’s fine for a club to say what it wants about a player - Berahino has been in the naughty chair? Seriously, Tony Pulis, with comments like that is the player likely to change his mind and stay? Pulis also said Berahino lacks ‘mentors’, highlighting that he lost his father at an early age, and blaming this for his desire to play at a higher level and earn more money. I know from personal experience how growing up without a father stacks the odds against you. Rather than stare down from some sort of mythical moral high ground, maybe Pulis should applaud Berahino for coming so far with so little in his favour. We have recently heard stories about Berhaino allegedly being late for training. Why would a club with class like West Bromwich Albion leak information like that? It only serves to damage the player’s reputation. Spend any time at any club and you’ll know players are regularly late for training and meetings, they pay an internal fine and it never gets out. Why is Berahino being singled out here? Berahino appears to have been singled out by his club for a minor breach of discipline . Both Ings and Berahino are said to have caught the eye of the likes of rivals Liverpool and Spurs . This is a kid who has come through a difficult early life, he’s been given a great chance at West Brom, and he’s taken it. That football club are set to make a fortune from his sale, and assuming they stay up they will be grateful for the goals he scored to contribute to that survival bid. Meanwhile Danny Ings, also scoring goals to help Burnley stay up, says nothing to the fans, and will make his club no money if he leaves this summer. So who’s the bad guy? Neither player deserves criticism yet Berahino is being hounded. Sources close to Berahino have wondered if there could be racist undertones to the vilification of this young talent: he’s black and he wasn’t born in England. I refuse to believe that, and I sincerely hope it isn’t true.

He has been dropped and labelled a troublemaker because of his stance .

"China’s troubled Jade Rabbit rover has started its third, and potentially final, snooze on the moon. The crippled rover has been stuck in its place due to an mechanical problem that occurred at the end of January. A photo from the rover showing a portion of the Chang'e 3 lunar lander was circulated on Twitter over the weekend with the caption ‘zZZ’. This photo from the rover showing a portion of the Chang'e 3 lunar lander was circulated on Twitter over the weekend . The state-run Xinhua news service's Twitter account added that Yutu's mechanical problems remained unresolved. Two weeks ago, China restored communications with the Jade Rabbit moon rover, but engineers are still working to fix its mechanical problems, state media said. The official Xinhua News Agency cited Pei Zhaoyu, the lunar probe programme's spokesman, as saying the rover had survived the frigid cold of the moon's nights. The Jade Rabbit rover is designed to roam the lunar surface for three months while surveying for natural resources and sending back data. After five months stranded on the moon, China's Jade Rabbit lunar rover is still alive and functional. Chinese state media said on yesterday that technical problems and bitterly cold lunar nights have 'weakened considerably' the buggy's ability to operate . But it ran into problems in January it was shutting down in preparation for the lunar night, which lasts two weeks. The problems were a rare setback for China, which in recent years has conducted space walks and placed a space station in orbit. Last month, China's Jade Rabbit Moon rover was . declared dead on the Moon's surface in a major setback for the country's . ambitious space programme. The potential to extract the moon's resources has been touted as a key reason behind Beijing's space programme. The . moon is believed to hold uranium, titanium, and other mineral . resources, as well as offering the possibility of solar power . generation. 'China wants to . go to the moon for geostrategic reasons and domestic legitimacy,' said . China space expert Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor of national security . affairs at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. 'With . the U.S. exploration moribund at best, that opens a window for China to . be perceived as the global technology leader - though the U.S. still . has more, and more advanced, assets in space. 'The landing was a . key step forward in Beijing's ambitious military-run space programme, . which include plans for a permanent orbiting station by 2020 and . eventually sending a human to the moon. But Pei said the rover had 'come back to life' soon after despite space experts' earlier concerns that it might not survive the extremely low temperatures of the lunar night, when the temperature drops to -180ºC (-292°F). 'The rover stands a chance of being saved now that it is still alive,' Pei was quoted as saying. He said it was still unclear what caused the problem. The mission is proving a popular success for China's military-backed space programme. Updates about the rover's progress have been posted on an unofficial Chinese microblog account written with Jade Rabbit's 'voice', attracting tens of thousands of comments by Chinese Internet users. The Jade Rabbit, or Yutu in Chinese, was deployed on the moon on December 15 and was a huge source of pride in China, which is only the third country to complete a lunar rover mission after the United States and the former Soviet Union. The silver rover experienced a 'mechanical control abnormality' late January due to 'the complicated lunar surface environment', according to the official Xinhua news agency, and has been unable to function since then. Condolences poured in on Weibo, China's Twitter-like service, where Internet users mourned the demise of the rover, according to China News Service's report titled 'Loss of lunar rover'. The Jade Rabbit rover had previously sent back its first pictures from the moon and officials lauded the first lunar soft landing in nearly four decades as a step forward for 'mankind as a whole'. 'Exploration of outer space is an unremitting pursuit of mankind,' China's space agency, the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence (SASTIND) said after the rover was deployed on the moon. The mission reflects 'the new glory of China to scale the peaks in world science and technology areas,' it said, adding it was committed to exploring and using space 'for peaceful purposes'. The lunar mission, which comes a decade after China first sent an astronaut into space, is seen as a symbol of the country's rising global stature and technological advancement, as well as the Communist Party's success in reversing the fortunes of the once-impoverished nation. Beijing plans to establish a permanent space station by 2020 and eventually send a human to the moon. The sky over the moon appears inky black in this picture showing the Jade Rabbit rover trundling across the lunar surface taken from the Chang'e 3 lander . The potential to extract the moon's resources has been touted as a key reason behind Beijing's space programme, as the moon believed to hold uranium, titanium, and other mineral resources, as well as offering the possibility of solar power generation. The six-wheeled Yutu vehicle began operating last month after making the first soft landing on the moon by a space probe in 37 years. It is designed to roam the lunar surface for three months while surveying for natural resources and sending back data, along with its stationary lander, Chang'e 3. A digitally-combined panoramic photo shows the moonscape around the Yutu - Jade Rabbit - moon rover . Over 150,000 people follow the rover's progress on its microblog, which posted last month that repairs were underway and that all hope was not lost. ‘Sorry to make you all sad. The engineers and I haven't given up yet,’ the post said. News of the rover's troubles were splashed across Chinese newspapers and even featured at the Foreign Ministry's daily briefing. The problems appeared to be related to the solar-powered probe's process for shutting down for the lunar night, which lasts more than two weeks. The probe had survived its first shutdown, during which it was unable to generate energy from its solar panels and relies on a radioactive power source to keep its delicate sensors and other equipment intact. The rover was traversing a relatively flat part of the moon known as Sinus Iridum, or the Bay of Rainbows, at a speed of 200 yards per hour. The landing vehicle, which has already shut down for the lunar night, is designed to conduct scientific examinations for one year. Online speculation focused on the possibility of lunar dust having blocked one of the solar panels from folding inward, leaving equipment exposed to the dangerously low temperatures. It will not be known if the probe is able to function again until after the two-week break. Chinese scientists test the moon rover ahead of its launch.

"As many of you are no doubt aware, transfer deadline day actually started about two weeks ago over at Sky Sports. The studio has been given a makeover for the new season. Much like the new Doctor’s Tardis. And also like that rather unique Police Box, there is an irascible Scot at the the helm. But Sky Sports News’ very own timelord Jim White (‘the clock is TICKING!’) can’t be at the controls all the time. No worries, though, because his team of assistants have been fanning the flame for this particular Monday since the season began. Indeed, so much was the chain cranked over the approaching days, even come Monday morning, with over 11 hours to go, the studio felt like it was already at Def Con 1. One presenter even riffed on Jim’s repertoire and told us the ‘clock was ticking FAST’. Although on further inspection, it was actually ticking at the normal rate. Phew! No teething problems for the new studio there, then. VIDEO Scroll down to see the Premier League's 10 most expensive summer 2014 transfers . Here we go again: Jim White and Kate Abdo take the fans through deadline day on Sky Sports News . Bright: Natalie Sawyer took control of the iPad as Sky Sports News brought fans up to date with the news . The new big screen was also put through it's paces early in the day. It showed us a multi-split screen of their reporters on the ground. Which actually looked like an episode of Celebrity Squares in anoraks. Also out the traps early was deadline-day favourite Niall Quinn. His enthusiasm, first-hand knowledge and ready wit is custom built for this date in the calendar. And he put all of that to good use in a story about an agent who couldn’t work a fax machine and how all the girls in the office ‘used to wear flats’ so they could scamper about more easily. ‘I bet the girls here wished they could do that’, was the awkward, muttered reply. But this was all just breakfast fayre. The main feast would be served from tea time when Brucie, sorry Whitey, and his beautiful assistants Natalie Sawyer and Kate Abdo made their entrance. And I don’t mean to be frivolous or condescending about their A Team here. Because there is no doubt that Sky Sports happen-chanced across a piece of pure light entertainment with the transfer deadline. And when they saw it was becoming something of a spectacle, quite rightly, they went for it! Tricks of the trade: Gary Cotterill attempted to restore order by using the vanishing spray at Loftus Road . Crowd control:  Cotterill was copying Premier League referees with his spray . Not working: One fan managed to get in front of the camera and was pushed away by Cotterill . Keeping them entertained: A Stoke fan agreed to do the Ice Bucket Challenge on Sky Sports News . Out of hand: Supporters made a mockery of Sky Sports News' roving reporters at the grounds . Extreme viewing: A sex toy was shoved in presenter Alan Irwin's ear as he spoke outside Goodison Park . Trying: QPR offered Gary Cotterill safety indoors . The problem with that is, it’s a bit of a one-trick pony. Quite frankly, only the names of the players really change. The rest is the same old story. And as a result, as the windows roll by, their front of house faces have to try to continually up the anti. So what are the options? Well, use the set! They gave Jim a dentist’s reception couch on which to occasionally ruminate on matters. While he and Natalie also got to stand at the big video wall so he could show us his trousers were too long. There were even the occasional forays into their ‘nerve centre’, to show us the cutting edge sight of people staring at computer screens. Which is all fine. But the problem is, that’s not what brings home the bacon. That is the job of their men in the field. Them, but mainly, whichever member of the public decides this is their Britain’s Got Talent audition. Sky Sports' regional reporters may once have thought it was quite fun to have a bit of an audience when they work. Indeed, while the sun is still shining, it is something of a cakewalk for them. But then, after dark, they are basically static targets for all manner of custard pie attacks. Which in the case of this deadline, for example, manifested itself in a sex toy to the ear at Everton, and some choice language straight into the mic from an athletic chap outside the Boleyn Ground. While outside Loftus Road, Gary Cotterill’s gag with a vanishing spray failed as both a joke AND crowd control. Calm down: Fans have taken to gathering at grounds to get on Sky Sports News on deadline day . Lady in red: Kirsty Gallacher took the early evening shift as the transfer activity hotted up . Incoming: Reporters were getting the latest transfer news at it happened, right up until the 11pm deadline . Changeover: Viewers saw Gallacher and Julian Warren replaced by White, Abdo and Sawyer . Awkward: The changeover was far from smooth as the window entered its final three hours . Through to the end: Sawyer and White have been the final anchors for several deadline day shows . As a result of these incidents Natalie, not the first or the last time, was forced to apologise ‘for anything you saw or heard that was offensive’. Which strikes me as the most hollow of statements. Because quite frankly, anyone watching who doesn’t think they’re going to see and hear things that are, in those terms, offensive have clearly not engaged in the abstract social intercourse of Sky Sports on transfer deadline day before. Indeed, they are more likely to be offended if they couldn’t actually relive the moment time and time again on some social media outlet or other. Quite frankly, this wasn’t much of a transfer deadline window. Which is the way it goes. But I’m not sure Sky Sports News quite gets that now. Because once they started making the content light entertainment, and their presenters showbiz turns, they went down a road that was difficult to come back from. Don’t get me wrong. There’s a lot of good solid telly journalism happening on the band wagon they are rolling out. And there is certainly drama that goes along with that. However, all the banging of drums and firework displays the channel feel the need to use to maintain the hype serves not to enhance it, but obscure it in smoke and mirrors. It’s been a fun ride, Sky Sports News. But perhaps its time to get back to basics?","Sky Sports News have a new studio but their show was more of the same .

"A new US envoy has been sworn in to coordinate the country's massive humanitarian mission to the typhoon-shattered Philippines. Thousands of U.S. troops are currently on the ground helping to distribute tones of much-needed food, water and shelter to people in the worst affected parts of the country. Secretary of State John Kerry praised America's new ambassador Phil Goldberg's ability to marshal the huge aid effort as he appointed him to his post. Devastation: Children stand amongst debris in the Anibong area of the super typhoon devastated city of Tacloban, Leyte province, Philippines, as tones of aid begins to be distributed across the country . 'As we struggle to respond to this human disaster, we're proud that we're sending to the Philippines the right person for the job,' US Secretary of State John Kerry said as he swore in Goldberg. So far, the U.S. has delivered about 1,780 tons of food, with about 13,000 U.S. forces helping to deliver the goods to the stricken areas devastated by Super Typhoon Haiyan on November 8. 'We are going to continue to work to try to reach these devastated areas,' Kerry said, adding that Goldberg had accelerated his departure to leave for Manila on Monday. The top U.S. diplomat also thanked the Senate for rushing through Goldberg's confirmation, 'because we want to have our ambassador on the ground in the Philippines to deal with the challenges of emergency assistance.' Help: Much-needed supplies of food and water are finally reaching the most devastated areas of the Philippines which was hit by Typhoon Haiyan . Aid: U.S. and Sweden's Troops unload relief goods from a Sweden's C-130 Plane in a damaged airport in the super typhoon devastated city of Tacloban, Leyte island province, the Philippines, today . The official death toll stands at 3,976 with 1,602 people missing. The United Nations estimates up to four million people have been displaced, of whom only 350,000 have found shelter in evacuation centers. Goldberg said he was taking up his new diplomatic posting with 'mixed emotions.' While he was honored to be the next U.S. ambassador, 'it's hard to think of the suffering of so many people in the Philippines in recent weeks and all they've endured without a touch of sadness and without being moved,' Goldberg said. But he paid tribute to the Filipino spirit, saying the people are 'warm, but they're also tough and resilient. There should be no doubt that they will bounce back. I have no doubt.'","Huge aid mission launched after Super Typhoon Haiyan hit on November 8 .

"Sportsmail cricket writer Lawrence Booth's view of day four of the third Test between England and India at the Ageas Bowl, which saw James Anderson, Moeen Ali, Joe Root and Alastair Cook star. TWO STARS FOR COOK . Alastair Cook's unbeaten 70 set up England’s second declaration of the match. It also meant he had passed 50 twice in the same Test for the first time since he made 96 and 106 against Sri Lanka at Lord’s in 2011. What were we all worried about? Seeing double: England captain Alastair Cook scored a 50 in both innings of a Test for the first time since 2011 . PANKAJ PLUMBS THE DEPTHS . Poor old Pankaj Singh deserved better than match figures in his first Test of 0 for 179. But the harsh fact was that he had produced the worst match analysis by a debutant in Test cricket. The previous record was held by Pakistan seamer Sohail Khan, who took 0 for 164 against Sri Lanka at Karachi in 2009. Woes: India bowler Pankaj Singh has returned the worst figures ever for a debutant in international Tests . NOT SUCH A DARING DECLARATION . The timing of Alastair Cook’s second-innings declaration annoyed some on social media, though most observers felt he got it spot on. History, though, suggested he could have called a halt much earlier. India’s highest successful fourth-innings run chase in England is a modest 174 for six at The Oval in 1971. Cushion: Cook declared to leave India needing 445 to win but they have never chased more than 174 in England . UMPIRES' JUSTICE IS OUT OF BALLANCE . Gary Ballance confirmed he was more than a grinder by batting attractively for 38 from 48 balls before falling for the second time in the game to a duff umpiring decision. Rod Tucker had wrongly judged him caught behind off Rohit Sharma for 156. On Wednesday it was Marais Erasmus’s turn to err, giving Ballance out caught at short leg off Ravindra Jadeja. Double injustice: England batsman Gary Ballance (right) has been given out twice incorrectly by the umpires . JADEJA APPEALS FINE . The ICC have confirmed that the Indian board have appealed against the fine levelled at Ravindra Jadeja by match referee David Boon over his run-in with Jimmy Anderson in the Trent Bridge pavilion. Boon fined Jadeja 50 per cent of his match fee - around £3,500 - but India hope to get this overturned on Friday, when Anderson will learn his fate. Punishment: India's Ravindra Jadeja has appealed his fine for an alleged incident with James Anderson . KALLIS KNOWS HIS INTERNATIONAL RACE IS RUN . South Africa's colossal all-rounder Jacques Kallis announced his retirement from all international cricket on Wednesday. He decided enough was enough on a recent tour of Sri Lanka. ‘I just knew on that tour that I was done,’ said the 38-year-old, who will continue to play Twenty20 franchise cricket. He finished with 11,579 one-day international runs, 273 wickets and 131 catches.

'We're all excited for Sam, but we're taking it very, very calmly. 'There's plenty of time for him to develop. 'There's huge expectation obviously, but it's an opportunity to test the waters at this level, see where he is, then reassess and put another plan together. 'He's certainly capable of playing international rugby: we'll know a little more after Friday night. 'He won't be fazed by it, none of these guys are fazed by it.'

"It is one of the UK's most celebrated music venues, famed as the venue where David Bowie killed off his Ziggy Stardust alter-ego. But it recent years it had become known as something of a tired venue in drastic need of a refurb. Now the Hammersmith Apollo has been given a multi-million pound revamp and restored to the art deco glory of its early days. The venue, to be known as the Eventim Apollo, will re-open its doors to a sell out crowd tomorrow after a nine week closure which saw the venue gutted and fixtures and fittings restored to their original style. Curtain up: The newly refurbished Eventim Apollo is to reopen its doors after a £5million revamp tomorrow night . Return to glory days: The venue, which is steeped in musical history, has been fully restored to its former art deco glory . New life: The building, famed as the venue where David Bowie killed off alter-ego Ziggy Stardust, had become somewhat tired before its facelift . Stunning: Many of the building's original fixtures and fittings have been revived as part of the revamp . Ornate plasterwork has been restored to its original 1932 design, some original features which had gradually been concealed during various buyouts and refurbishments over the decade are once again part of the furniture and original mosaic floor panels will once again be walked over by hundreds of thousands of gig goers each year. Even the Apollo's original colour scheme has been revived, with a 'historically sensitive' redecoration breathing new life into the former cinema. Work to transform the venue will continue as seats are reupholstered over a nine month period that will see some of the biggest names in pop and comedy perform on stage. The building was originally commissioned in 1928 by Davis Company, who appointed Robert Cromie - the man behind the Prince of Wales Theatre in Central London - as its head architect. Historic: The Apollo, now co-owned by US live-music promotion giant AEG Live and German ticketing vendor CTS Eventim, opened in 1932 and is one of the UK's most celebrated music venues . Art deco: The foyer of the new look venue, which will see a host of top names grace the stage in the coming months, is pictured . Back in time: The venue has been decorated in the same colour scheme as when it originally opened its doors back in 1932 . As if to prophecise a future that would see the building change hands and name numerous times over the years, the site was bought out by Gaumont in 1930 before construction work had even begun. When it finally opened its doors in March 1932, it seated more than 3,500 people. Its fan-shaped auditorium and 35ft deep stage ensured a perfect viewfor all. The original auditorium also featured a Compton4manual/15 Ranks theatre organ. The building became the Hammersmith Odeon in 1962 and became popularly known as the 'Hammy O' among locals. Iconic: The venue has changed hands and name several times over the decades, but has continued to play host to some of the biggest names in music . Revamp: Work to improve the Apollo is ongoing, with seats to be reupholstered over the coming months . The future's bright: The Apollo's bar areas are much brighter thanks to the re-introuduction of natural light . New look: The building, which was granted Grade II listing in 1990 and was upgraded to Grade II* in 2005 became known as the Hammersmith Apollo in the mid 1990s . New light: Original art deco window designs that had been covered up have been revealed and a new multi-couloured LED lighting system has been installed . Popular: The venue has hosted some of the biggest names in music and comedy over the years . The venue begun hosting some of the . biggest names on the music scene shortly afterwards, with The Beatles . appearing there 38 times between 1964 and 1965 and other star names such . as the Rolling Stones and The Who playing to packed out crowds. 1928 - The building is comissioned by the Davis Group who appoint Robert Cromie as head architect . 1930 - The project is taken over by Gaumont . 1932 - The Gaumont Palace Cinema, a 3,500 seater venue, opens . 1962 - The venue is renamed the Hammersmith Odeon and becomes known as the Hammy O . 1990 - Made a Grade II listed building by English Heritage . 1992 - Another name change as the Hammy O becomes the Labatt Apollo . 2003 - Renamed as the Carling Apollo - removeable seats are introduced for the first time . 2005 - Given Grade II* status . 2006 - The venue's original organ is restored . 2009 - The venue becomes the HMV Hammersmith Apollo . 2013 - After a nine week refurbishment project, the Eventim Apollo is restored to its art deco former glory . It was known as the Odeon up until 1992 when the name was changed to the Labatt's Apollo. Stage star Michael Ball was the last person to play the Odeon and first to play the Labatt's Apollo both as part of the same sell-out tour. The Apollo also hosted a range of top shows including Riverdance and Joseph and the Technicolour Dreamcoat after it was renamed. The building, which was granted Grade II listing in 1990 and was upgraded to Grade II* in 2005 became known as the Hammersmith Apollo in the mid 1990s. A further name change was on the cards in 2003 when the venue became the Carling Apollo Hammersmith. The takeover saw removeable seats introduced for the first time which enabled the Apollo to be used as either an all seater or standing venue. The capacity changed to 5,039 standing and 3,632 seated. Thanks partly to the encouragement of Hammersmith and Fulham Council, the original theatre organ was restored in 2006 having been put in storage during the 1990s. The Apollo was bought out again in 2007, this time by entertainment company Mama Group, and renamed yet again two years later, becoming the HMV Hammersmith Apollo. In recent years, the likes of Oasis, Elton john, REM, Stereophonics and Peter Kay have performed there. But the new look Apollo will see songstress Selena Gomez, perhaps not quite as well known to the more discerning music fan, take to the stage. Billy Joel, Paul Weller, Jimmy Carr, the Pixies and Russell Brand are among those to perform there later this year. The overhaul of the venue, which has . also see two original marble staircases by the stage uncovered, has been . masterminded by Foster Wilson architects. Colin . Chapple, CEO of AEG Live which owns the Apollo, said: 'I am sure when . you have time to look around or indeed come back to enjoy a concert or . comedy night you will appreciate we have made real improvements in this . first phase to what is one of London’s premier venues.'

"The BBC commands less public affection than Maltesers, Tampax and the Oxo Cube after arguably the most humiliating year in its history, according to a survey of Britain’s top brands. The taxpayer-funded broadcaster has been almost permanently engulfed in controversy in the past year, including allegations of a cover-up over the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal. It also faced fury over its ‘inane’ coverage of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and bumper pay deals for top presenters and managers. The sign at the BBC's Broadcasting House: The state broadcaster commands less public affection than Maltesers, Tampax and the Oxo Cube according to a survey of Britain's top brands . And the reputational body blows have . taken their toll, according to a survey due to be released tomorrow by . brand consultancy Clear, part of advertising firm M&C Saatchi. Just 37 per cent of respondents said the BBC was a ‘desirable’ brand, putting it behind Tampax, Maltesers and the Oxo Cube. And . only 30 per cent said they would describe the BBC - funded by a £145.50 . licence fee from every household with a TV - as reliable. The . miserable rating means that the Britons feel they can depend just as . much on fast-food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken as they can on the public . service broadcaster. James . Osmond, chief executive of Clear, said that people was prepared to . forgive one mistake, but had grown tired of the BBC after an unrelenting . series of failures. ‘The challenge the Beeb has had is that it’s had more than one or two crises and scandals,’ he said. ‘That really begins to damage a brand over time.’ Scandal: Major controversy has blown up at the BBC over allegations of a cover-up of Jimmy Savile's crimes . 'Inane': The broadcaster also faced fury over its coverage of the Queen¿s Diamond Jubilee earlier this year . The survey took in responses from 20,000 consumers and analysed 678 brands in 25 categories. Britain’s least desirable brand was newsagent chain WH Smith, which was rooted to the bottom, below even pile cream Anusol. With concerns over the use of personal data reaching fever pitch, Facebook slipped down the ranks of the most reliable brand, with just 6 per cent of those surveyed saying they could depend on it. That placed the social network below state-owned bank Royal Bank of Scotland and even one rung beneath no-frills airline Ryanair. But the Irish airline came bottom of the pile when respondents were asked to name a ‘brand I respect’. Alongside Camel cigarettes, Ryanair scraped a measly 5 per cent. New parents may not see the glamour in changing nappies, but the survey revealed that Pampers was equally as ‘desired’ as French fashion house Chanel. Technology giant Apple dominated the list of the UK’s most desirable brands, occupying four of the top 20 spots, although it lost ground to fast-growing rival Samsung. Apple itself topped the table, with its iPhone in second, the iTunes music service in sixth place and the iPad tablet computer further back in eighth. And there were some surprises as Marmite defied its own marketing premise that you either love it or loathe it. The supposedly divisive toast spread was in fifth place, just behind upmarket jeweller Tiffany and well ahead of Disney in 18th. What everyone wants: Technology giant Apple . dominated the list of the UK's most desirable brands, occupying four of . the top 20 spots, although it lost ground to fast-growing rival Samsung . Anger against Google over its minute tax contribution in the UK saw it lose 38 points on the brand desirability scale. But Starbucks, which was also embroiled in the tax controversy, managed to climb 3 points after responding to fears of a public boycott by offering to pay more corporation tax. Despite Amazon being named among the companies siphoning profit out of the UK to avoid tax, it came in at seventh place. Mr Osmond said the tax controversy hit Google particularly hard because it coincided with fears about the amount of personal data that the web giant collects and anger over search results that allowed access to child pornography. ‘There’s less goodwill to fall back on,’ he said. The Olympics produced as many surprises for its top sponsors as it did on the athletics track. The constant sight of billboards for brands such as McDonalds and Coca-Cola, hardly known for their health credentials, seemed to turn Olympics fans off. McDonalds fell 1 per cent in terms of its impact on consumers, wihle Coca-Cola was the biggest loser, faling 21 per cent. ‘There are an awful lot of brands that had very little association with the values and personalities of the Olympics,’ said Mr Osmond. ‘It can buy you some short-term association, but if there’s no logic it doesn’t help the brand.’ Surprisngly, oil giant BP proved the summer sports event’s big winner, up 70 per cent. The rise saw BP rebound sharply from the biggest crisis in its history, when the devastating Gulf of Mexico oil spill of 2010 blackened both its reputation and the waters of the Gulf.","Taxpayer-funded broadcaster rocked by Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal .

"This is the start of what could be the biggest year in the history of rugby union in this country. It’s time for England to deliver and they have the opportunity of their lives. No what ifs, no buts, no maybes. No excuses. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that England possess good enough players to win the World Cup. England are blessed with talent at No 10 including Bath's George Ford (left) and Sale's Danny Cipriani . For the first time since 2003 I look at the squad and see players who would be a match for some of the greats from that World Cup winning side. The likes of Alex Corbisiero, Dylan Hartley, Dan Cole, Courtney Lawes, George Ford, Danny Cipriani, Anthony Watson and Christian Wade excite me for the months ahead. Our mantra in 2003 was ‘how do you want to be remembered?’ and this should guide this Six Nations campaign too. I want to see Stuart Lancaster really take hold of this squad now and stamp his authority on this England side. I want to see him leading from the front and not being afraid to be confrontational and edgy. Players will take their lead from him. Things have felt a little bit cosy around this England squad for too long — other nations think we are the nice guys of international rugby: talented and difficult to beat no doubt but nice all the same. This is not the history or DNA of English rugby and it needs to end with tonight’s match against Wales in Cardiff. Martin Johnson lifts the RBS Six Nations trophy following England's triumph against Ireland in 2003 . Yes, there are injuries. But England have more players available to them than any other rugby nation.The quality of the players Lancaster can call on despite the injury list is outstanding. The pack will provide the possession, the question is: can England turn that possession into points? The answer to that will be provided by England’s coaches who must deliver to the team a clear vision of how to break sides down. The honeymoon period has long been over for Stuart Lancaster and his coaching team but since leaving to tour New Zealand last summer we have seen little evidence of a fluid, clever attacking blueprint. Pressure rose in the autumn after winning just two of their four matches and Lancaster’s team will continue to be under the spotlight in this tournament because they’ve had enough time together now to articulate their attacking vision to the players. I hope Lancaster has been ramping up the pressure on his team, telling them that it is all about now. They must win these big matches. We saw last year when England lost to France just how hard it is to recover. If England are to stand a chance of winning the World Cup they have to treat these games as knockout games and go to places like Cardiff and Dublin and win with confidence. England have lacked a fluid, attacking game plan since the three-Test summer tour of New Zealand in 2014 . In 2003 we won the Grand Slam and we actively sought to ratchet up the pressure on the players because they needed to learn how to operate under that pressure. The result was a battle-hardended group who knew how to win away from home. There was no talk of next week or the next tournament. It was about the now. One shot, no excuses. We should not forget that England will face Wales at the World Cup in a crucial group game. There’s no doubt that you want to go into that match knowing you have the beating of your opposition. But, equally, no England player should be looking beyond the game tonight. Heading into the Six Nations in 2003 we didn’t talk about the World Cup. As a team we told ourselves that the Six Nations was everything and, after near-misses, we desperately wanted that Grand Slam. But even within this we remained focused that winning the next game was all that mattered. It sounds simplistic, but I just kept thinking ‘if we keep winning the next game, one day we’ll end up in the World Cup final.’ (From left to right) England's coaching team of Mike Catt, Graham Rowntree, Stuart Lancaster and Andy Farrell were all handed six-year contract extensions by the RFU last October . As a coaching team you need to consider the future and direction of the team, and to that point we began implementing a more controlling gameplan geared towards knockout rugby. In truth, with the exception of the final game against Ireland, we didn’t play spectacularly well in that tournament. But we left the Six Nations knowing we had control of our game. We beat Scotland 40-9 in our fourth match on a beautiful day at Twickenham — it was the first time Jason Robinson, Josh Lewsey and Ben Cohen played together in the back three. We played OK but not as well as the scoreline might suggest and the players’ response afterwards was understated. They were obviously delighted and the atmosphere in the room was great but it was treated just like a job well done, which it was. I remember the feeling of standing in the dressing room after the game with Phil Larder and Andy Robinson before the players came back in, almost chuckling. It is an amazing thing when you can feel things going right, the energy and momentum it gives you is priceless. The same can happen to this England side: by the end of the tournament they will either look like a team capable of winning a World Cup or a team with so many questions unanswered. Players like Jason Robinson (left) were central to England's Grand Slam success in 2003 . More importantly, they will feel it among themselves. I do not like to suggest that success will be five wins out of five or four wins out of five. The extent of success from the Six Nations, especially in a World Cup year, will be how they feel. Do they truly feel as though they have the game to beat anybody, or turn any situation they face into a victory? This current niceness in the England set-up goes right through the RFU, typified by Lancaster and his coaching team being given six-year contracts last year. It was an error to go public and indicated a complete lack of understanding of professional sport by the RFU’s chief executive Ian Ritchie. Winning is about putting coaches and players under pressure, not the opposite. You just don’t give those sort of contracts in professional sport so close to such an important tournament. Six-year contracts allow space for excuses and for the coach of the England side to start thinking about development rather than winning. It is a massive mistake. Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury will be missed but Dave Attwood (centre) is a superb replacement . This is Stuart Lancaster’s World Cup year. Not 2019. I would like to see him start rattling the other coaches in this tournament because as long as they’re saying he’s doing a good job it means they want him to stay. There is a high calibre of coaches in this Six Nations. Joe Schmidt of Ireland is the outstanding one, followed by Wales’ Warren Gatland and Vern Cotter of Scotland. All three have proven track records and have instilled a clear gameplan and style into their sides. Lancaster and France’s Philippe Saint-Andre are next in line. I look forward to revisiting this discussion after the Six Nations, with Lancaster having really gone toe-to-toe and left a significant mark on his rivals in Cardiff and Dublin. Jonathan Joseph gets in some kicking practice during an England training session at Pennyhill Park . Despite injuries, our pack will continue to set a platform and succeed at the set-piece. It’s a shame Lawes and Joe Launchbury aren’t available through injury but I’m a huge fan of Dave Attwood and I think he can bring that nasty, snarling edge that every great pack needs. Cole, Hartley and Joe Marler is a brilliant front row — just three of the world-class players in our pack that also includes James Haskell and Chris Robshaw. This is the most exciting England team of Lancaster’s tenure. Sometimes an injury list creates clarity and with Owen Farrell and Brad Barritt sidelined, some decisions have been taken out of Lancaster’s hands. He’s been forced into a more exciting back line. I can’t wait to see Ford link up with Jonathan Joseph and I’m delighted to see Cipriani involved. Lancaster and his staff, along with the clubs, deserve credit for the progression and form a number of players are enjoying. Let’s see if they can thrill us on Friday night.","England possess enough players to win the World Cup .

"Bashar al-Assad warned that any number of factions in the region could attack U.S. military bases if America strikes Syria in retaliation for 'alleged' chemical weapons use, likely referring to Hezbollah, al-Qaeda and Iran . Syrian president Bashar al-Assad has warned that the United States should expect retaliation if the Obama administration moved forward with military strikes in response to a chemical weapons attack on August 21. 'You should expect everything,' Assad told American journalist Charlie Rose in a wide-ranging interview, portions of which were broadcast Monday morning on CBS. Such attacks could come from any of a number of different sources, he said, while not ruling out that his own military could launch them. Assad described possible future retaliation against the U.S. as 'not necessarily through the government. It's not only – the government is not the only player in this region. We have different parties, you have different factions, you have different ideologies. You have everything in this region now. So you have to expect that. ... Expect every action.' When Rose asked if that included the possibility of chemical warfare, Assad replied, 'That depends.' 'If the rebels or the terrorists in this region, or any other group have it – It could happen. I don't know. It could happen. I'm not a fortune teller, to tell you what will happen.' Anti-government rebel groups in Syria include both pro-Democracy factions and Islamist groups, including the global terror group al-Qaeda. Scroll down for video . Charlie Rose interviewed the Syrian dictator in Damascus, in an interview previewed on CBS and slated for broadcast in its entirety on PBS Monday night . The Middle East is a powder keg that's ready to explode, Assad said, insisting that the U.S. will have to deal with the consequences of failing to understand the nature of terror groups in the region . President Obama tried during the G20 Summit in St. Petersburg, Russia to wrangle international support for striking Syria, but the White House hasn't persuaded any other nation to participate in a military attack . But Assad also leverages groups inside the Lebanese terror group Hezbollah to push rebel forces back on the streets of Damascus, and nearby Iran also backs his regime. Retaliation against the U.S., he acknowledged, 'could take different forms, both direct and indirect,' hinting that he could work in concert with Hezbollah and the Iranians. The Syrian leader, on the brink of seeing American Tomahawk missiles and Predator drones rain down on his own military installations, said that Obama's administration is 'going to pay the price if you're not wise in dealing with the terrorists.' 'So nobody expects – there are going to be repercussions ... Nobody expected the 11th of September, so you cannot expect – It would be difficult for anybody to tell you what is going to happen.' 'It's an area where everything is on the brink of explosion. You have to expect everything.' U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday in London that Assad could avoid a military strike by turning over all his chemical weapons within a week but immediately made clear he was sure that would never happen . Anti-war protesters held signs and banners outside the Foreign and Commonwealth office in central London on Monday as Kerry met with Britain's Foreign Minister William Hague . Polls show that t vanishing minority of Americans support striking Syria, and Obama will have to contend with a growing protest movement at home as he tries to convince Congress to endorse military action . Assad has denied that he was . responsible for the suspected August 21 sarin gas attack aimed at a . rebel-controlled area of Syria, and challenged the Obama administration . to publicly show the evidence it has and 'prove it now.' The . president 'didn't present' evidence publicly 'because he doesn't have . [it]. Kerry doesn't have [it], no one in the organization has. If they . had it they would have presented it to you as media.' This week is shaping up as a critical one in the Obama administration's second term: . Barack Obama will address the nation Tuesday night in a prepared prime-time address . The president has granted rare sit-down interviews with CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and PBS . National Security Advisor Susan Rice will address a luncheon at 12:30 at the New America Foundation, laying out the administration's case for attacking . The U.S. Senate will gavel in a session Monday afternoon that may culminate in a vote on whether to authorize the use of 'limited' military force in Syria . A House of Representatives committee is likely to debate the same measure this week, but may not hold a vote at all if a majority of the dominant Republicans decline to support the measure . Secretary of State John Kerry is selling the White House's plan in Great Britain, and the president is personally calling members of Congress to lobby them . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will reportedly offer her take on Syria Monday, and is expected to support Obama's call for military intervention . Obama . will sit down Monday afternoon for interviews with the three major TV . networks and with CNN, Fox News and PBS. He is also scheduled to address . the nation in a prime-time speech Tuesday night – on the eve of this . year's 9/11 anniversary. Rose . reminded Assad that Secretary of State John Kerry has disclosed that . the U.S. was able to track the flight of missiles originating from . government-controlled Syrian territory and landing in an area overrun by . rebels. 'We know that his regime gave orders to prepare for a chemical attack,' Kerry said during a press conference Monday at the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office.' We know that they deployed forces and put them in the places where this took place. We know, by tracing it, physically where the rockets came from and where they landed. And it is no accident that they all came from regime-controlled territory and all landed in opposition-controlled or contested territory. We know this.' But 'the Russians have completely opposite evidence,' Assad countered to Rose, 'that the missiles were thrown from an area where the rebels control.' He likened the current controversy to then-Secretary of State Colin Powell's public presentation before Congress of evidence, which later proved faulty, that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. That evidence was the basis for the approval of a U.S.-led invasion. 'He said ""this is our evidence,"" Assad recalled, but 'it was false evidence. Kerry didn't even present evidence. He [said] ""We have evidence"" and he didn't present anything. Not yet. Nothing so far. Not a single shred of evidence.' Ultimately, Assad insisted, his government forces 'were not in the area where the alleged chemical attack happened ... Our soldiers in another area were attacked chemically. Our soldiers. They went to the hospital as casualties because of chemical weapons.' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (R) and Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem (L) met Monday in Moscow. Russia's government remains one of Syria's only allies, with ties strengthened by arms sales and a Russian naval base on Syrian soil . Assad insists that the White House doesn't have ironclad evidence that his government used chemical weapons, and said Obama is leading a 'social media administration' 'But in the area where they say the government used chemical weapons, we only had video, and we only have pictures and allegations. ... how can you talk about what happened if you don't have evidence?' 'We're not like the American administration. We're not a social-media administration or government. We are a government that deals with reality.' Members of Congress should ask themselves, he said, 'What do wars give America? Seems there's is nothing now. Nothing. No political gain, no economic gain, no good reputation.' America's credibility around the world, Assad claimed, is an 'an all-time low.' He also insisted, as several high-profile politicians have in Washington, that starting a war in Syria would be 'against the interests of the United States.' 'Why? First of all because this is the war that's going to support al-Qaeda and the same people who killed Americans on the 11th of September.' In Moscow on Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem to discuss the increasingly tense situation. We are asking ourselves how Obama can ... support those who in their time blew up the World Trade Center in New York, Moualem said during a press conference following the meeting. Lavrov claimed there was clear evidence the anti-Assad rebels have chemical weapons, and hinted that there are still questions about who initiated the August 21 attack.","Syria's dictator told Charlie Rose that rebel groups or terrorists in his country may have chemical weapons that could strike American targets .

"Gennadji Raivich, whois facing jail for molesting a woman who used his insemination services . A ‘narcissistic’ academic who claims to have fathered 58 children as a  private sperm donor is facing jail for molesting a woman who used his services. Professor Gennadij Raivich, 51, set up a ‘one-stop shop’ on the internet to artificially inseminate women who were desperate to start a family. He visited them at home and pretended to be trying to help them, but instead he was ‘sexually motivated’ to embark upon a ‘breeding programme’, a court heard. The neuroscientist, an expert in maternal and foetal medicine,  was found guilty of sexually assaulting one woman who used his services and was cleared of abusing two others. Blackfriars Crown Court in South East London heard that Raivich advertised his services online under a false name and carried out home visits around the country. He carried a ‘donation kit’ with him containing a DVD player so he could watch pornography, rubber gloves and laboratory equipment. But he was arrested after three women complained that he had sexually assaulted them. Raivich, who worked at University College, London, once gave an interview in which he described being a sperm donor as ‘like a hobby or charitable act’ and said that he got ‘satisfaction by helping’. He also said that he offered his services as a donor and as a doctor because he ‘loved children’ and wanted others to enjoy parenthood. Tom Wilkins, prosecuting, told jurors: ‘You have to ask yourselves what kind of woman agrees to meet a complete stranger for artificial insemination: Someone who is desperate and is prepared to put up with the potential embarrassment and humiliation and who has kept the details from their friends and families. ‘A perfect victim for sexual assault, someone unlikely to complain. ‘Compare the women to this defendant, someone who has traded on the fact he is a doctor and paraded his scientific knowledge, impressing them with his apparent expertise. What kind of man embarks on a breeding  programme to have as many  children as possible? ‘You may feel there is a high degree of narcissism in what he  has done and that he is sexually motivated in some of these transactions.’ His victim told the court that Raivich had visited her at home after she contacted him. She said she went along with his request for her to perform a sex act on him on several occasions because she had been trying to conceive for a year and was desperate for success this time. Mr Wilkins said he sexually assaulted her, adding: ‘She told him three or four times not to touch her, but he went ahead regardless. Blackfriars Crown Court, pictured, in South East London heard that Raivich advertised his services online under a false name and carried out home visits around the country . ‘He was not the altruistic  donor, but someone who is sexually motivated.’ Raivich, of North London, was convicted of two counts of sexually assaulting the woman and was released on bail until September 30 for a pre-sentence report. Two other women, both 26-year-old lesbians, also told the court the defendant abused them – which he denied, but the jury were unable to reach verdicts on this. Raivich is a qualified doctor in Germany, but has never practised medicine and is not registered with the General Medical Council. Following his arrest, 15 women who had children by him came to his defence, including a police officer, a maths teacher and a lecturer. His conviction on June 27 could not be reported until now because the Crown Prosecution Service was considering a retrial over eight charges relating to alleged assaults on the lesbians, but it has now decided not to proceed.","Professor Gennadij Raivich found guilty of sexually assaulting one woman .

"Retrial: Shakil Afridi, the Pakistani doctor who helped teh CIA hunt down Osama bin Laden has had a 33 year prison sentence overturned . The Pakistani doctor who was hailed a hero after helping the CIA hunt down Osama bin Laden has had a 33 year prison sentence for treason overturned. Shakil Afridi was convicted in May 2012 on charges unrelated to the bin Laden incident of . 'conspiring against the state' by giving money and providing medical . treatment to Islamic militants in Pakistan's Khyber tribal area. The doctor's family and the . militants denied the allegations. Yesterday a senior Pakistani judicial . official overturned the sentence and ordered a re-trial, on the grounds . that person who had issued the sentence had not been authorised to hear . the case. Dr Afridi ran a vaccination program . for the CIA to collect DNA in an attempt to verify the al-Qaida leader's . presence at the compound in the town of Abbottabad. U.S. commandos . later killed bin Laden there in May 2011 in a unilateral raid. Pakistani officials were outraged by . the bin Laden operation, which led to international suspicion that they . had been harboring al-Qaida's founder. In their eyes, Afridi was a . traitor who had collaborated with a foreign spy agency in an illegal . operation on Pakistani soil. The case has caused friction between . Pakistan and the United States, complicating a relationship that . Washington views as vital for fighting the Taliban and al-Qaida, as well . as negotiating an end to the war in neighboring Afghanistan. In the U.S. and other Western nations, Afridi was viewed as a hero who had helped eliminate the world's most wanted man. Officials . in Washington have called for Afridi to be released. Yesterday, State . Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told journalists that Afridi's . continued detention 'sends exactly the wrong message.' Critical intelligence: Dr Afridi ran a vaccination program for the CIA to collect DNA in an attempt to verify the al-Qaida leader's presence at the compound in the town of Abbottabad (pictured) 'We hope this latest development leads to an outcome that reflects the fact that bringing Osama bin Laden to justice was clearly in Pakistan's interest - as well as ours,' Harf said. The doctor was tried under the Frontier Crimes Regulations, or FCR, the set of laws that govern Pakistan's semiautonomous tribal region. Human rights organizations have criticized the FCR for not providing suspects the right to legal representation, to present material evidence, or to cross-examine witnesses. Verdicts are handled by a government official in consultation with a council of elders. Anis, a commissioner tasked with enforcing the FCR, ruled that Afridi will be re-tried under the regulations by the top political official in Khyber, Shah said. Afridi was previously tried by the official's assistant. The doctor's lawyer, Samiullah Khan, welcomed the decision to order a re-trial, saying: 'I think it is a good achievement for us.' He called the original decision to sentence Afridi to 33 years in prison 'totally illegal.' Dr Afridi's brother Jamil Khan Afridi welcomed Thursday's ruling, but also demanded that the next trial should not be held behind closed doors . But Khan said he was concerned about the decision to once again hold the trial under the FCR. He would rather the case be heard by a judge under Pakistan's normal legal system. Khan said he had not been able to share the news with his client. The doctor has been held in prison with little contact with the outside world, and the lawyer said it had been months since he'd seen his client. Afridi's brother Jamil Khan Afridi welcomed Thursday's ruling, but also demanded that the next trial should not be held behind closed doors. 'He should be tried in an open court in the presence of media so that the world will know that my brother is innocent,' the brother said. He called the allegations against Afridi 'baseless.' The brother said the last time authorities allowed him to meet with Afridi was in August 2012, although the doctor's wife and children were allowed to see him on July 10. It's unclear whether a re-trial will result in Afridi being released or simply receiving a reduced sentence. Freeing the doctor would remove a sore point between Pakistan and the U.S. at a time when relations have warmed relative to the dark days following the bin Laden raid. But the operation still causes consternation in Pakistan, and it could be politically difficult for the government if Afridi is released.","Dr Shakil Afridi ran a vaccination program outside bin Laden's compound .

Even though the platoon was in a combat zone, military prosecutors say the men showed, ‘no indication of a hostile act, or hostile intent.’ Lorance claims he was only trying to protect his platoon. He told his mother he was on high alert, heading into enemy territory, and was getting radio warning from Army pilots patrolling the skies when it happened. First Lieutenant Clint Lorance has been removed from his position and faces two counts of second-degree murder . His family believe he is being unfairly treated and have launched a website to highlight his case. More than 3,000 people from around the world have signed a petition to drop the charges. 'There's no way my son could do anything besides give 100 percent of himself to be an officer,' said Anna Lorance. Lorance is also charged with attempted murder for ordering his men to unsuccessfully shoot at a third man. He's also accused of making false official statements, ordering illegal harassing fire into a village, obstructing justice and making threats against villagers.

"Nigel Clough says Premier League teams have struggled to deal with Sheffield United’s quick wing-play and he has a point. Since the start of last season they have beaten West Ham United and Southampton in the League Cup and Aston Villa, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers in the FA Cup. Tottenham Hotspur certainly need to be careful in Wednesday night’s Capital One Cup semi-final first leg at White Hart Lane. Nigel Clough, manager of Sheffield United, has already beaten Premier League outfit twice in the competition . Jose Baxter celebrates scoring for Sheffield United in last year's FA Cup semi-final against Hull City . United players celebrate dumping Premier League high-flyers Southampton out of the Capital One Cup .

Southampton players look distraught after conceding against Sheffield United in the quarter-final . There is no doubt young Nigel will have grown up watching the great sides assembled by his father - with the likes of John Robertson bombing forward for Nottingham Forest. The wingers for Brian’s sides were always the catalyst for success and it looks like Nigel is using a similar template. United have a variety of players capable of playing on the wing, but they all have one thing in common - they are happy to sling in crosses from every angle. Jamie Murphy likes to push upfield and cut inside to cross with his right foot and Ryan Flynn, who has played on the wing and at full back this season, is a bag of tricks down the right. Louis Reed became the youngest player to play for United in the league last year and, at 17, is a talented youngster, while Jamal Campbell-Ryce is another rapid wide man. Clough says top-flight teams struggle with United’s crosses but it’s more to do with the number of men who are prepared to fly forward and get on the end of them. In the Premier League, defenders are used to playing against lone strikers with maybe another runner off the front into the area. The reason the likes of Southampton and QPR have found it tough against United is because they pile people forward. Against Southampton there were times when the score was 0-0 but they still had five men in the box to aim for. They know they have midfielders who can play and Jose Baxter and Ben Davies in particular are excellent at joining the attack. Tottenham Hotspur boss Mauricio Pochettino knows his side must be wary of Sheffield United . Players celebrate after Michael Doyle scores the winning penalty in a shoot-out against West Ham United . West Ham players looked dejected after they conceded against Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup . For Tottenham, the best way to combat this is to cut out the crosses at the source. It will be up to Kyle Walker and Danny Rose to deal with the threat of these deliveries, but if United do get past the full backs Spurs have to be very well organised in the middle. It’s just as important for midfielders to tuck back in and help as it is for the centre halves to defend well. Michael Higdon of Sheffield United celebrates with his team-mate after scoring against Milton Keynes Dons . Clough has his side utilising quick wingers and allows his players to flood forward in attack . Striker Emmanuel Adebayor returned to the Tottenham first-team against Sunderland on Saturday . Southampton are a well-drilled side but even they couldn’t cope with United’s numbers in the area. Tottenham will want the tie done and dusted.

"A father who walked in on a man allegedly sexually assaulting his 11-year-old son beat the man to a pulp before calling police to say they could come collect him from a 'bloody puddle' on his floor. The 35-year-old man, who has not been identified, told a 911 dispatcher in the early hours of Friday: 'I just walked in on a grown man . molesting [name redacted]. And I got him in a . bloody puddle for you right now, officer.' Police arrived at the Daytona Beach home in Florida to find Raymond Frolander, 18, unconscious. Scroll down for 911 tape . Raymond Frolander, 18, (pictured in his mugshot) was beaten to a pulp by the father of the 11-year-old boy that he allegedly caught his sexually assaulting at a home in Daytona Beach, Florida . A subsequent mugshot showed that Frolander had been badly beaten around the face, leaving him with swollen lips and eyes, bruising and lacerations. When the 911 responder asked the father if any weapons were involved, he said: 'My foot and my fist'. 'He is nice and knocked out on the floor for you, I dragged him into the living room,' the father said. 'Send an ambulance. He is going to need one.' The dispatcher asked: 'Is he still unconscious?' to which the father responds: 'Yes... I hit hard, sir.' He said that Frolander was a 'damn lucky boy that I love my God'. The father added: 'He stood up and his pants were around his ankles and nothing else needed to be said. I did whatever I got a right to do except I didn’t kill him.' The father had left his home around 1am to pick up some food and when he returned, heard a strange noise coming from the bedroom, police said. He pushed open the door and allegedly found Frolander with his pants down performing a sex act on the child. Frolander, 18, admitted to the abuse on the 11-year-old, according to his arrest affidavit. He is being held without bail on charges of sexual battery . The boy told investigators he had been playing video games with friends but when they left, Frolander took him to a back room and pulled down his pants. He also said Frolander had been abusing him for three years. Daytona Beach police chief Michael . Chitwood told MailOnline today that Frolander had a close family . connection to the alleged victim. The chief said the young boy was intimidated and told by Frolander that terrible things would happen if he revealed the abuse. Chief Chitwood said: 'He's 11 years old, he should be running around outside and playing video games, not dealing with something like this.' He earlier told the Daytona Beach News-Journal that the father was 'just acting like a dad'. The father was not charged in the suspect’s beating, police spokesman Jimmie Flynt said. Frolander was taken to Halifax Heath Medical Center where he was treated for his injuries. The arrest affidavit said that Frolander admitted the abuse. The teen was charged with sexual battery on a child under 12 and is being held without bail. It was not known whether he's hired a lawyer.","The 35-year-old father told a Florida 911 dispatcher: 'Send an ambulance. He is going to need one'

"The findings of a potentially explosive investigation into a massive leak of highly confidential documents stolen from the heart of the Vatican are to remain top secret, it has emerged. Pope Benedict XVI launched a . probe into the so-called 'Vatileaks' scandal which erupted after his former butler . released private papers taken from the papal chambers. Italian newspapers have been rife with unsourced reports claiming the dossier produced by three cardinals  looking into the incident unearthed an underground network . of senior clergy who have organised gay homosexual parties and faced . blackmail. Scroll down for video . Top secret: Pope Benedict XVI decided that the contents of an investigation in to the scandal dubbed 'Vatileaks', in which private papers were stolen from the Vatican, will remain confidential . But the current Pontiff - who earlier this month shocked the world by announcing his retirement -  has now ruled that only the next Pope and the three cardinals will get to see the contents. According to the Vatican, the Pope today met with Spanish Cardinal, Julián Herranz; Cardinal Salvatore De Giorgi, a . former archbishop of Palermo; and the Slovak cardinal Jozef Tomko - nicknamed 'the 007 Cardinals' by the Italian media - in private. A statement from the Vatican said: 'The Holy Father has . decided that the acts of this investigation, known only to himself, . remain solely at the disposition of the new pope.' Thanking the cardinals for their investigation, the statement added: 'Their work made it possible to detect, given the limitations and . imperfections of the human factor of every institution, the generosity . and dedication of those who work with uprightness and generosity in the . Holy See.' No confirmation or denial: Vatican spokesman Father Lombardi . The Vatican had rubbished Italian media reports alleging the pope's resignation is linked to a secret dossier claiming there is a 'gay network' inside the clergy. It even accused the Italian media of spreading 'false and damaging' reports in an attempt to influence cardinals who will meet . in a secret conclave next month to elect a new pope. La Repubblica newspaper had carried lurid claims about the report into the . 'Vatileaks' scandal which was presented to the Pontiff on or . around December 17. The report came in two volumes, . 'hard-bound in red' with the title 'pontifical secret'. They launched the probe after the . Pope's butler, Paolo Gabriele, was arrested and charged with stealing . and leaking papal correspondence revealing how the Vatican was a centre . of intrigue and infighting. La Repubblica claimed Pope Benedict . XVI quit because could not face the repercussions of dealing with the . 300-page dossier - the first Pontiff to resign in 700 years. The paper says that the investigation . alleges a gay lobby exists within the Church, and has some sort of . control on the careers of those in the Vatican. The report is quoted as saying: 'The cardinals were said to have uncovered an underground gay network, whose members organise sexual meetings in several venues in Rome and Vatican City, leaving them prone to blackmail. 'They included a villa outside the Italian capital, a sauna in a Rome suburb, a beauty parlour in the centre, and a former university residence that was in use by a provincial Italian archbishop.' La Repubblica says that the cardinals described a number of 'factions' in their report, including one in which individuals were 'united by sexual orientation'. The newspaper also alleges the dossier states that members of this group were blackmailed by laymen with whom they entertain relationships of a 'worldly nature'. Sent to South America: Ettore Balestrero has been promoted, according to the Vatican spokesman . It quoted an unnamed source said to . be close to the report's authors: 'Everything revolves around the . non-observance of the sixth and seventh commandments.' The . seventh commandment forbids theft, while the sixth forbids adultery, . but is linked in Catholic doctrine to the proscribing of homosexual . acts, explained the Guardian. The dossier will stay in a secret papal safe and delivered to Benedict's successor when the Pope leaves office, claims La Repubblica. The pope himself has said merely that he doesn't have the 'strength of mind and body' to carry on and would resign Feb. 28. The Vatican claims the reports are an attempt to influence the election of the next pope. The . Vatican secretariat of state said the Catholic Church has for centuries . insisted on the independence of its cardinals to freely elect their . pope - a reference to episodes in the past when kings and emperors . vetoed papal contenders or prevented cardinals from voting outright. 'If . in the past, the so-called powers, i.e., States, exerted pressures on . the election of the pope, today there is an attempt to do this through . public opinion that is often based on judgments that do not typically . capture the spiritual aspect of the moment that the church is living,' the statement said. 'It is deplorable that as we draw . closer to the time of the beginning of the conclave ... that there be a . widespread distribution of often unverified, unverifiable or completely . false news stories that cause serious damage to persons and . institutions.' Tribute: Catholics gather to watch the Pope in one of this last public appearances . Some Vatican watchers have speculated . that because the Vatican bureaucracy is heavily Italian, cardinals . might be persuaded to elect a non-Italian, non-Vatican-based cardinal as . pope to try to impose some reform on the Curia. Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico . Lombardi said the reports 'do not correspond to reality' but the pope . and some of his closest collaborators have recently denounced the . dysfunction in the Apostolic Palace. Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, for . example, criticized the 'divisions, dissent, careerism, jealousies' that . afflict the Vatican bureaucracy. He made the comments on Friday - the . penultimate day of the Vatican's weeklong spiritual exercises that were . attended by the pope and other officials. Benedict . too has made reference to the divisions in recent days, deploring in . his final Mass as pope on Ash Wednesday how the church is often . 'defiled' by attacks and divisions from within. Last Sunday, he urged . its members to overcome 'pride and egoism'. On Saturday, in his final comments to . the Curia, Benedict lamented the 'evil, suffering and corruption' that . have defaced God's creation. But he also thanked the Vatican bureaucrats . for having helped him 'bear the burden' of his ministry with their . work, love and faith these past eight years. The Vatican's attack on the media . echoed its response to previous scandals, where it has tended not to . address the underlying content of accusations, but has diverted . attention away. During the 2010 explosion of sex . abuse scandals, the Vatican accused the media of trying to attack the . pope; during the 2012 leaks scandal, it accused the media of . sensationalism without addressing the content of the leaked documents.","Benedict XVI launched probe into massive leak of stolen private papers .

"A 'fatberg' the length of a Boeing 747 was discovered underneath the streets of west London - and workers were forced to spend four days tackling the vile mass. The congealed lump - formed from fat, wet wipes and other litter wrongly put down drains and toilets - was detected under a 260ft stretch of a road in Shepherd’s Bush. A team of sewer experts from Thames Water spent most of last week breaking it down. Scroll down for video . Revolting: The congealed lump - formed from fat, wet wipes and other litter wrongly put down drains and toilets - was detected under a 260ft stretch of a road in Shepherd’s Bush . The immense, solid blockage was removed using high-powered water jets and then taken from the sewer to prevent flooding to nearby homes and business. Dave Dennis, Thames Water sewer operations manager, said: 'We have 108,000km (67,108 miles) of sewers, and that’s a lot of pipe to keep clear. We spend £12million a year tackling blockages, most of them formed because people have tipped cooking fats down the drain and wet wipes down the loo. 'The sewers serve an important purpose - they are not an abyss for household rubbish. Fat goes down the drain easily enough, but when it hits the cold sewers, it hardens into disgusting fatbergs that block pipes.' The immense, solid blockage was removed using high-powered water jets and taken from the sewer to prevent flooding to nearby homes and business . People pouring cooking fat away and flushing wet wipes has sparked an increase in the number of 'fatbergs' He added: 'Wet wipes cling to the fat. Fat clings to the wipes. And pretty soon your fatberg is out of control and sewage is backing up into roads, gardens and in the worst cases flooding up through toilets and into homes. 'We’ve found all sorts in this sewer – from tennis balls to planks of wood . It goes without saying they shouldn’t be in those pipes. London – bin it, don’t block it.' Despite the scale of the fatberg, the residents of Shepherd’s Bush will have to go a long way to go to beat the town of Kingston, who had a 15-tonne fatberg removed from a sewer last year.

"John Terry's £16million home has been bought for the Sultan of Oman, it was claimed today. The £170,000-a-week Chelsea footballer made a £10million profit by selling the luxury nine-bedroom home in Surrey to General Sultan bin Mohammed al-Naamani, a senior minister for the Arab state. Mr al-Naamani is believed to have bought the home from father-of-two Terry for his wealthy boss - Sultan Qaboos bin Said, 72 - who has a fortune of £650million, according to reports. Sale: John Terry (left, on holiday with wife Toni) made a £10million profit by selling the nine-bedroom home to a senior minister for Oman, who is believed to have bought it for his boss Sultan Qaboos bin Said (right) Properties: Terry, 33, sold his original red-brick house (top) last year for £5.25million after three years on the market, but then received an out of the blue £16million offer for his new home (bottom) A source told The Sun: ‘The Sultan's most trusted aide just waltzed in and made an amazing offer. His advisors were brokering the deal. ‘But we're told the Omani royal family wanted the house at any cost. John Terry loved that place and really put his stamp on it. The Sultan made him an offer he couldn't refuse.’ Sultan Qaboos is known as a friend of the West. He used to serve in the British Army and trained at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in Camberley, Surrey. Terry - who is estimated to be worth £29million - received a total of £21.25million after selling his two neighbouring houses, including one which was to be his dream home. Big money: Terry - who is estimated to be worth £29million - received a total £21.25million after selling his two neighbouring houses, including one which was to be his dream home . Royals: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh meet Sultan Qaboos bin Said in Oman in November 2010 . He scores: It had taken father-of-two Terry (pictured playing for Chelsea) three years to sell his first house, which he had bought for £2.25million in 2003 and reportedly had to re-mortgage four times . The footballer, together with his wife Toni and twin children, had planned to live in the nine-bedroom white mansion, which was built next door to his old property. The Sultan (below) has been a particular fan of Britain since his stint at the Sandhurst military academy, to which he donated a sports pavilion as a sign of his happy time there. He served with the now-defunct Cameronian regiment and spent six months learning about local British government in Suffolk County Council before returning home to Oman. Sultan Qaboos seized power in a coup against his father, Said Bin Taimur, in 1970 and has ruled ever since. However, aged 72, he has still not named a successor. The Sultan's fortune derives from oil, though recently he has invested much of it building up Oman's tourism industry. He has spent money on his own 120-member symphony orchestra, eight grand palaces across Oman and a signature Diamond-encrusted Rolex from Asprey's in London. Also in his private collection are five super yachts, the latest of which has a helipad, an orchestral hall and a swimming pool. Terry, 33, sold his original red-brick house last year for £5.25million after three years on the market, but then received an out of the blue £16million offer for his new home. He had bought the luxury home for £1.8million in 2007 and spent a further £4million renovating it, even building a fishing lake in the back garden. The sale of the house has prompted further speculation that the footballer is planning to leave Chelsea in favour of a move abroad. His family are now believed to be renting another property. It had taken father-of-two Terry three years to sell his first house, which he had bought for £2.25million in 2003 and reportedly had to re-mortgage four times. In 2010 the former England captain was advised to drop the asking price by £750,000. However, helped by the burgeoning property market, he was finally able to sell it for more than the £5million asking price, helping him finance the second mansion - located just a short drive from Chelsea's training ground in Cobham. Terry was reported to have incurred a mortgage debt of £4.6million on the building of the new house. Construction work started in December 2011 and the finished mansion is believed to include a 33x40ft indoor swimming pool, complete with a jacuzzi, steam room and changing facilities. Staff are also reportedly accommodated in one wing and there is also a visitor annexe in the opposite wing. Wealth: Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser al Missned spent £120million on three homes near Regent's Park . Ex-prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Jasmin bin Jabr Al Thani, bought a £12million property at the exclusive One Hyde Park development in Knightsbridge. Other members of the small club of owners include oil baronesses and Kazakh singers. Qatar's royal family created a new London base last April by spending more than £120million on three palatial terraced houses near Regent’s Park. Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser al Missned, one of the Qatari ruler’s three wives, bought the three 1820s-built properties - intended for her children. Jordanian playboy Eyhab Jumean owns a former ambassadorial residence in Kensington and a Mayfair mansion which has an underground car park for his Maseratis and Lamborghinis. He has owned these two houses for the past ten years and last August he put both on the market for £100million.","Home sold to senior minister General Sultan bin Mohammed al-Naamani .

"To get in touch with Martin, leave your comments below or send your tweets to @MailSport using #TackleKeown . Sportsmail columnist MARTIN KEOWN answered YOUR questions after another interesting week of Champions League football, including Arsenal's disappointing 3-1 defeat at home to Monaco on Wednesday night. The former Gunners and England defender analysed the tie at the Emirates Stadium, with subjects ranging from Per Mertesacker's abject performance and Arsene Wenger's tactics to whether Olivier Giroud is lacking quality in the big games. Also on the agenda was the small matter of the Capital One Cup final this weekend as Chelsea play Tottenham at Wembley, as well as the quality of English football. Read on to find out... Host commentator . Host commentator . There’s no conspiracy, Charlie - no way! It’s all propaganda from Jose Mourinho. It was a big statement for him to go on Sky - a company he doesn’t have the best of relationships with - and say they, and referees, don’t give him a fair deal. I think it’s disrespectful to the Premier League and everything it stands for. Fair competition is the basis of every good competition – if you win the Premier League, you deserve to. But if you question it, like Mourinho is doing, you question the integrity of the game. And that is wrong. I’m not fooled by his charm and magnetism, but people seem scared to speak out against him. Perhaps they don’t want to get involved in a slanging match, but he needs to be pulled up about this. Look at Ronald Koeman after Southampton’s loss to Liverpool on Sunday. He could have completely gone off on one about the penalties they should have been awarded, or that Simon Mignolet should have been sent off. But he didn’t. There was no mention of campaigns or conspiracies by him. People know that players get tired over busy periods, but what about the referees? Players are supported after a match, people at the club will tell where they went wrong and help to prepare them for the next match. But a referee is his own entity and has to pick up pieces in isolation. It must affect their confidence after a bad game. They need help and support the same way players do. What else is difficult for a referee is that he has no idea of the feeling of being wronged like players do. It’s so frustrating when you try to plead with the referee, but it seeps into your performance. You feel like you’ve been sinned. It used to wind me up when we played Manchester United and referees would call the players by their first names. But the second I was in trouble it was, ‘Keown, get over here!’. It was a terrible tackle and I would expect Matic to be angry. As I'm sure you would. I think you have to allow someone the emotion to react, to a certain extent, but it has cost him a place in Sunday’s cup final. It seems unfair, as he could've had leg broken. But he has to know that you can’t do that. He should have just laid on the pitch. Players go down with far less these days, and it looked to me like he had the right to be rolling around on the floor for the next ten minutes. I don’t think I would've reacted the same as Matic, I would have stayed on the floor, pointing at my leg in exasperated fashion, hoping the officials would sort out the situation. One time when we played Chelsea, Nigel Spackman punched me on the back of the head so hard I felt his knuckles. My first thought was to clump him back, but I quickly changed my mind and went down and he was sent off. There’s an automatic process that kicks in to stop you punching someone on the pitch. Unfortunately for me, Dennis Wise was on hand to walk all over the top of me while I was on the floor, until Steve Bould dragged him off, that is. I think Chelsea will win it, JJ. Tottenham’s 5-3 win at White Hart Lane this season was astonishing, but when you get to a final it’s different. It’s where the inexperience of the likes of Kane, Ryan Mason and Eric Dier may be a problem. There’s know-how in Chelsea team. They know how to to dictate the pace of the game and play it at their own pace. Tottenham will be confident after their victory on New Year's Day, but this is not at home - it’s at Wembley. They’ll have to put the pressure and fanfare of the final to one side and concentrate on the game. Chelsea have done all this before. Cahill has only had one or two bad games this season, including the one you mention, Ken, but has found himself out of the team. Jose Mourinho often looks for blame and has clearly identified Cahill as culpable in certain matches. Zouma is developing nicely, but in the long term I would think he will partner Cahill, not John Terry. At the moment, Mourinho is showing that Terry will stay in the team regardless, but it might be different next year.  Maybe Mourinho is testing Cahill - seeing how he responds to falling down the pecking order. Zouma definitely looks like he has the potential to be top class. When he hones in on an opposition player he can make it very difficult for them. When Chelsea played Everton he dealt with Romelu Lukaku comfortably, and he’s one of the quickest and strongest strikers in the league. I've always been a keen admirer of Kompany, Daisy. But he needs to wait for the game to come to him and not go flying in. He went flying in too often against Barcelona on Tuesday when he would have been better off keeping the shape of the defence in tact. I think he might have come back from injury before he was ready to. He’s a big man who needs to be a 100 per cent fit to carry that huge frame around. He’s a very important player for them, but he’s often guilty of wanting to do everyone else’s job – it’s part of his nature. Playing centre half is about being in the right place at right time. If you rush out of position you can leave big spaces in behind for attackers to move into. He would have been embarrassed by what happened, Ashley. He carries the flag for France around Europe. Since he left, France have won the World Cup and the European Championship. The French are very proud of him. Last night could be a defining moment. They dominated possession but got thumped. I think he might rethink his tactics. He sees everything and is a quick learner. He has to decide whether it’s more important to win or play attractive football. Last night he didn’t underestimate Monaco but overestimated his own team. It looked like he was trying too hard. He was playing against a French team, and it felt like he  wanted to show how far he’d come. He’s got to get over what happened last night. When people say we we had lots of strong characters in our Arsenal team, that’s because we had all had nightmare games somewhere along the line. His goals have been vital to Arsenal, as you mention, but he has to believe he’s good enough. There’s the option of Danny Welbeck in the middle, but there’s lots of work to do there as well. I think he does too much work for the team tracking back. He needs to work on his runs, so he can occupy both centre halves when receiving the ball. Wenger must decide who’s in the middle sooner rather than later. I wouldn't write Arsenal off, James. When you look at number of chances they had last night, they're still in it. Though Monaco might just have too much for them. I was very impressed with their defenders – they all looked efficient, strong and good on the break. If Arsenal do win it’d be Wenger’s finest hour. He’ll be relishing that he’ll get another chance to face them, rubbing hands together. He’s a proud Frenchman returning home, but it’s not a trip for nostalgia -  there’s a job to do. He’s a very determined person, and two early goals would turn the tie on its head. Well, James, Wenger had a nightmare - he knew it would happen, which makes it worse. He understood them well enough, but they still got beaten. The midfield was packed with imagination and ability, but not enough defensive quality.  Francis Coquelin was charging about on his own, trying to do it all. Arsenal didn’t have balance. It was like there was a magnet down the centre of the pitch, and all their players were drawn towards it. Arsenal have to learn to play with their heads. They’re either too slow or too manic. I think he’s under pressure. Gabriel is there, ready to play, and it looks as if Calum Chambers will become a centre half, rather than a right back. If things don’t go well, it looks like Wenger has the necessary players to replace him, unlike in the past. You only get so long under Wenger to stake a claim. He always invests time on each player, but he may want to invest time in someone else now. Look what happened with Thomas Vermaelen – it’s debatable whether Mertesacker is better. I think Wenger still believes in him, he feels he gives organisation to the defence. But it’s a balancing act with his lack of mobility.","Martin Keown answers YOUR questions live on Thursday .

"This flow chart reveals the tortuous web of cash transactions made by DJ Chris Moyles in a bid to avoid paying £1million in tax. It shows how the Radio 1 Breakfast Show DJ moved his earnings around a string of banks and charitable trusts to claim that he had incurred huge losses as a second-hand car dealer. Many of the organisations involved in the scheme are based in low-tax and highly private jurisdictions such as Jersey, the Channel Islands and the British Virgin Islands. Head scratcher: This flow chart shows how tax advisers working on behalf of Chris Moyles advised him to make a complicated series of international transactions in a bid to avoid paying £1million in tax . But Moyles now faces a whopping bill . after a tax judge said he did not believe the former Radio 1 star had . been buying and selling used cars. He . had been using a scheme dubbed 'Working Wheels', promoted by a firm . called NT Advisers, which advised their high-earning clients to claim . they suffered business losses which could be claimed against their tax . bill. Variants of the . scheme, which was used by about 450 clients of the firm, included . claiming losses from dealing in other high-value items such as watches or cash . receivables. A spokesman . for HMRC told MailOnline: 'The scheme is highly artificial and relies on . complex rules concerning overseas dividends, which provide for relief . on payments which are representative of dividends paid on shares which . are loaned to other persons.' Chris Moyles is thought to have earned around £700,000 a year from his time presenting the BBC Radio 1 breakfast show, which he tried to offset using a tax avoidance scheme popular with high earners . A tax tribunal concluded: 'A realistic . view of the facts shows that the aim was that the appellants, ""as . though by magic"", should appear to have incurred vast fees in order to . borrow modest amounts of money they did not need in order to invest it . in a ""trade"" they had no desire to pursue.' Last night Moyles publicly admitted his ‘mistake’ and said he had ‘learnt a valuable lesson’. But he has fought hard to hush up his use of tax avoidance schemes. When . it emerged in 2012 he had used the same legal offshore scheme as . comedian Jimmy Carr, who was paying as little as 1 per cent, Moyles . claimed it would breach his human rights if he could not keep his . membership secret. Separately, . Moyles, 39, was one of 450 celebrities, fund managers and other top . earners to try to avoid tax by taking part in a scheme called ‘Working . Wheels’. It worked by . allowing members to say they had incurred huge fees while working in the . second-hand car trade, which they could claim back against their tax . bill. On the self-assessment . tax return he filed for the financial year ending in April 2008, when . he was presenting the BBC Radio 1 show, he claimed he ‘had engaged in . self-employment as a used-car trader’. He claimed he had made a loss of £1million, but the tax tribunal ruled this was just a ruse to save tax. The working wheels scheme is reportedly popular with the rich of Britain, as it allows people to claim a significant amount of money back off of large earnings . It found that, far from being a car dealer, Moyles had never supplied any vehicles and had ‘no interest’ in doing so. Nor did he have the faintest idea how . much the cars he was supposedly trading cost to buy and to sell. When HM . Revenue and Customs rejected the scheme, Moyles and two other members . appealed to a tax court. Yesterday, . tax judge Colin Bishopp rejected the appeal, saying it was clear he . ‘entered the scheme for no purpose other than to achieve a tax saving’. He said the ‘scale of Mr Moyles’ borrowing was driven solely by the . amount of the tax loss he wanted to achieve, in his case £1million. The . ruling said Moyles was ‘anxious to be reassured the scheme was lawful, . and that he would not have to undertake any trading himself’. Moyles . later took to Twitter to say: ‘Upon advice, I signed up to a scheme . which I was assured was legal. My knowledge of the dealings of the . scheme were naive. I’m not a tax expert and acted on advice. This was a . mistake and I accept the ruling without reservation.’ The . 'Working wheels' tax avoidance scheme, popular with Britain's high . earners who want to avoid paying their full tax, involves posing as a . used car salesman on you tax return form. The self-employed person then registers certain losses and costs in the process of running their second-hand car 'business'. These registered costs and losses can be stuck off as expenses necessary in the line of running the 'business'. In Moyles' case, he claimed he had totalled £1million of losses during the course of selling £3,731 worth of used cars. He tried to offset the claimed £1million loss in the 2007-08 financial year . against tax he owed on his other income, his estimated £700,000 . salary from the BBC, funded by the British public who pay the television license fee. Chris Moyles took to twitter to issue a reply to the news that he had partaken in a tax avoidance scheme . But . he was not so keen to speak about the case when he still hoped to win . it. During his year-long battle with the taxman, Moyles desperately . tried to keep his avoidance scheme secret. His legal team argued the . tribunal should be heard behind closed doors so as not to infringe his . ‘right to respect for his private and family life’. His . lawyer also said if his membership were exposed, ‘his career might be . damaged’. As Breakfast Show host, he earned £500,000 a year. Judge Bishopp rejected this on the grounds there was an obvious public interest in keeping tax  cases public. Jimmy Carr took significant flak from audiences after revelations of his use of tax avoidance schemes, especially since he had previously made jokes about it on the show Ten O'Clock Live . In 2012, comedian Jimmy Carr took flak for having taken part in a different tax avoidance scheme called K2. The . scheme, based in Jersey, involves people resigning from their company . and receiving all further payments or salary to an offshore trust. The . individual then receives a small part of those payments as a 'salary' and the rest as a 'loan' which does not accrue tax because technically, . it can be recalled. This means that by using the K2 scheme people can cut their tax bill from £127,000 to £3,500 if they have earnings of £280,000. Carr . took insults from audiences following the revelations of his tax . avoidance, and eventually apologised, but not before telling an audience . who attended one of his shows: 'I pay what I have to and not a penny . more.'

"Jimmy Carr is one of thousands of wealthy Britons using an offshore scheme to pay a little as 1 per cent income tax, it was claimed last night. The comedian is understood to be the largest beneficiary of a Jersey-based accountancy arrangement said to shelter £168million a year from the taxman. He puts away £3.3million a year via the K2 tax scheme which, according to the Times, is used by 1,100 tax avoiders. And Danny Alexander today attacked the . rich who use tax loopholes to reduce their rate of income tax, . describing them as the 'moral equivalent of benefit cheats'. Wealthy: Jimmy Carr (left) is reportedly using an offshore bank account to pay just 1 per cent income tax. Danny Alexander (right) today described those 'who dodge the tax system as the moral equivalent of benefit cheats' The K2 tax scheme, a Jersey-based accountancy arrangement, is used by 1,100 people. It works by transferring salaries into a Jersey-based . trust, which lends investors back the money. As the loan can technically . be recalled, it is not subject to income tax. Jersey is self-governing, with its own financial, legal and judicial systems. It has no VAT in place and sets its own income tax. And low taxation is the reason why the affluent flock to the tiny island. Income tax is a flat-rate of 20 per cent. Britain, in contrast, charges top earners 50 per cent, although this will fall to 45 per cent next April. Jersey's s Goods and Service Tax (GST) - equivalent to the UK’s 20 per cent VAT - is also far lower at 5 per cent. But beyond that, non-residents have also benefited. An accountancy industry has thrived in what critics say is a lax regulatory environment – finance makes up 41 per cent of its economy compared to, say, 4 per cent for hospitality. But ‘tax havens’ worldwide, from Bermuda to Liechtenstien, have come under pressure to clean up their act as the cash-strapped U.S. authorities and EU governments try to claw back tax lost to avoidance schemes. Jersey rejects the criticism saying it is a ‘transparent and cooperative jurisdiction’. It calls the perception of it as a tax haven an ‘ancient myth’. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury told Sky News: 'It is vitally important that everybody pays their fair share of tax. 'People who dodge the tax system are the moral equivalent of benefit cheats and we are coming to get them.' K2 works by transferring salaries into a Jersey-based . trust, which lends investors back the money. As the loan can technically . be recalled, it is not subject to income tax. George Osborne used his budget in March to attack what he called ‘morally repugnant’ tax abuses and announced a raft of measures designed to stop them. Together with a general anti-avoidance rule, he aimed to increase revenues by £1billion over the next five years. Individual tax avoidance costs the economy £4.5billion out of £7billion lost in total every year, according to Revenue & Customs. Last night, HMRC maintained it was . extremely effective at shutting down such schemes. But, according to the . investigation carried out by the Times, those behind K2 are confident . they can continue to avoid the taxman. Roy Lyness, of Peak Performance . Accountants, which runs the scheme, told an undercover reporter on the . newspaper it was ‘a game of cat and mouse’. Jimmy Carr puts away £3.3million a year via the K2 tax scheme which, is used by 1,100 tax avoiders and is one of a number of tax avoidance practices . 'BREAKING. Jimmy Carr has added a final date to his 2012/13 tour. He's doing a gig in Jersey. Well I say gig, but it's more of a drop off.'Ian Hyland, Mail On Sunday columnist'Just read that shocking secret about Jimmy Carr in the Times. Never knew he was a comedian! #boom'John Prescott, former deputy prime minister'Please have your Jimmy Carr ""tax"" joke in by the end of the day to avoid a £100 fine.'Michael Legge, comedian'Maybe he should hide his jokes offshore #taxavoider'Andrew Bloch, Twitter user . He added: ‘The Revenue closes one . scheme, we find another way round it. It’s like a satnav. I’m driving to . Manchester, get a message saying there’s a smash at Stoke, press this . button to re-route. ‘That’s all we do with tax avoidance. The Revenue . puts a block in, we just go . round the block.’ K2 works by transferring salaries into a Jersey-based . trust, which lends investors back the money. As the loan can technically . be recalled, it is not subject to income tax. Mr Carr’s lawyers have confirmed his . membership of K2 but denied any wrongdoing and said that the scheme had . been disclosed to the relevant bodies in accordance with legal . requirements. He recently performed a comedy sketch lampooning Barclays, which has been criticised for tax avoidance. Playing a female bank clerk, he joked: ‘Why don’t you apply for the Barclays 1 per cent tax scam. ‘You . will need the world’s biggest, most aggressive team of blood-hungry . amoral tax lawyers. If you meet the criteria, you’ll pay 1 per cent tax, . like Barclays do.’ Nice ride: Jimmy Carr fills his Bentley with petrol . 'Largest beneficiary': The 39-year-old, who performed for the Queen at her jubilee (pictured), puts away £3.3million a year via the K2 tax scheme . Tackling avoidance: George Osborne used his budget in March to attack what he called 'morally repugnant' tax abuses and announced a raft of measures designed to stop them . According to Peak Performance, Mr Carr pays himself a salary of £100,000 before sheltering his remaining income - £3.3million – through the scheme. The 39-year-old, who performed for the Queen at her jubilee, owns his own company and makes much of his money from DVD sales and television appearances. Analysis of Mr Carr’s publicly available accounts shows that four out of five companies that he controls were set up by Blue Cube, part of the Peak Performance network of accountants that sells K2. Blue Cube says it offers ‘remuneration planning for directors of limited companies resulting in between 0 and 25 per cent tax’. The day after Mr Osborne’s crackdown, Mr Lyness assured his clients tax-saving opportunities were unscathed.","Comedian Carr is 'largest beneficiary' of scheme which shelters £168m a year from taxman .

"Profits: The company, which is owned by German utility firm RWE, saw profits soar by £77million from £313million but chief executive Paul Massara said the company is no more profitable than a supermarket . Profits at energy giant Npower have surged by 25 per cent to £390million just months after it imposed punishing price rises on customers. The company, which is owned by German utility firm RWE, saw profits from its UK customers and power stations soar by £77million from £313million. In November, it increased gas tariffs by 8.8 per cent and electricity by 9.1 per cent, just as millions were turning on their heating to keep out the winter cold, pushing the average dual-fuel bill up by £108 to £1,352. Bosses justified the price rise by blaming Government policy, specifically demands to support green energy through wind farms, provide free insulation to vulnerable homes, discounts for the poor and the cost of rebuilding the national network of cables and pipes. It also argued that it had no choice but to pass on an increase in the cost of the wholesale gas it uses to run its power stations and provide central heating. But Labour MP John Robertson, who sits on the Commons energy select committee, described Npower’s profits as ‘despicable’. He said: ‘It is about time the energy companies stopped lying about their reasons for putting their prices up. 'They say price increases are due to Government policies and yet they proudly announce despicable profits. 'This has got to stop – they need to . start investing in their own business, like all other businesses have to . do, rather than ripping off struggling customers.’ Studies . suggest many poorer households, including pensioners, are rationing . their heating and going  cold because they are scared of  running up a . bill they cannot pay. Rises: In November, Npower increased gas tariffs by 8.8 per cent and electricity by 9.1 per cent . This has consequences for the health of the elderly and sick, with thousands of additional deaths each winter because it exacerbates existing health problems. Npower says its profit margin is around 5 per cent, suggesting it made an average profit of almost £60 from each of its 6.6million customer accounts. The price rise helped RWE, which operates across Europe, to a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, taking the total to £5.5billion. Yesterday, consumer campaigners urged Npower to give back some of its profit to customers by announcing an immediate price cut. Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch.com, said: ‘These profits will make customers wonder exactly why Npower had to hit them with a hefty price hike this winter. ‘Npower customers deserve a valid answer, especially those who were forced to go cold this winter for fear of the cost of heating their home.’ Last week, British Gas announced a 11 per cent rise in profits for 2012, taking its total up to £606million. Profits at parent company Centrica rose 14 per cent to £2.7billion. Britain’s six biggest power firms insist they must make strong profits to finance £150billion of spending on rebuilding Britain’s energy supply.","German-owned company saw profits soar by £77million from £313million .

"We all remember the moment Cristiano Ronaldo scored a 120th minute penalty in last year's Champions League final against Atletico Madrid - not for his precision placement to the left of Thibaut Courtois, but for the celebration that had women throughout the world looking over to their significant other and wondering 'if only'. Spring forward eight months and the Real Madrid superstar is putting us to shame again, but this time he's willing to give us a few pointers - albeit whilst being stripped down to his skivvies. Unveiling the spring/summer underwear range from his CR7 collection on Thursday, which he modelled himself, the muscular Madrilenian turned fitness guru on his 30th birthday. Cristiano Ronaldo showed off his physique after scoring an extra time penalty in the Champions League final . The Real Madrid star spoke about his exercise regime during the unveiling of his new underwear range . Ronaldo was a mere skinny teenager at Manchester United (left) compared to what he looks like now (right) Revealing just how he manages to keep himself in such fine fettle, the Portuguese also unveiled his 'top 15 health and fitness tips' for the average Joe to become ripped like Ronnie. Compared to the skinny teenager that arrived at Old Trafford in 2003, the 6ft 1in forward has converted himself into a football idol since his £80million move to the Santiago Bernabeu in 2009. 'Mental strength is just as important as physical strength,' he said. The former Manchester United star, who has netted 38 times for his club already this term, said goals are as key in exercise as they are in football as they 'keep you focused'. The Portugal captain picked up his second consecutive FIFA Ballon d'Or award in January this year . Despite his recent split with long-term girlfriend Irina Shayk, the 30-year-old said it is equally important to maintain a competitive streak by working out with a similarly fit partner - no doubt there will be a queue of volunteers for that recently vacated role. Paining the ears of many of his fans, who probably enjoy a Cruzcampo or two whilst watching him in action, the shredded striker added 'I also avoid alcohol.' And his insatiable hunger for success is also reflected in his diet, eating up to six times a day to make sure he has 'enough energy to perform each session at top level'. No wonder ex-United coach Mick Clegg sees no reason why he cannot play for another decade. 'Ronaldo could play until he's 40. It all depends on how many people are gunning for him and if he gets injured it would cut it down,' he said. 1. Learn to train your mind as well as your body. Mental strength is just as important as physical strength and will help you achieve your goals. 2. Be disciplined. Keeping yourself motivated and sticking to your routine is key. For me, there is no room for easing off so I have to be strict. 3. Set yourself goals. It will help to keep you focused and work towards something. 4. Working with a training partner is a good way to add a bit of competitiveness and help push yourself. If you train with someone who is a similar level to you then you will help push each other. 5. Proper sleep is really important for getting the most out of training. I go to bed early and get up early, especially before matches. Sleep helps muscles recover which is really important. 6. Warming up properly prevents injury. In training we do a few laps of the pitch, stretching and cardio warm up exercises. Make sure you do something similar in your training, even if it is jogging to the gym or a warm up on the treadmill or bicycle. 7. Mix it up. I recommend a combination of cardio (running and rowing) and weight training to ensure that workouts target all areas of the body and increase both strength and stamina. It also helps to keep it interesting. 8. High intensity is important to get your blood pumping and to increase stamina. We do a lot of sprinting drills in training and they can be incorporated into your workout whether you are in the gym or outdoors. Try and add it to every workout you do. 9. Cardio sessions are also key for building up endurance and stamina, and to stay trim. Try to do periods of around 30 minutes, increasing the number of sessions as you get stronger. 10. Fit in exercise wherever you can. You can do an abs workout in your bedroom when you wake up in the morning or before you go to bed. If you get into a routine then it makes it easier as it will become a habit. 11. A good workout must be combined with a good diet. I eat a high protein diet, with lots of wholegrain carbs, fruit and vegetables and avoid sugary foods. I love fish, especially the Portuguese dish bacalhau à braz, and at restaurants I’ll order a steak with salad. 12. Make sure you stay hydrated. Drinking water is so important. I also avoid alcohol. 13. Eat regularly. If you train regularly it’s important to keep energy levels high to fuel your body for better performance. I sometimes eat up to six smaller meals a day to make sure I have enough energy to perform each session at top level. 14. I always make sure I have good music to listen to. It helps you zone out, get motivated and do your best. I like to listen to hip hop and reggaeton. 15. Relax. Training and physical sessions are most important, but living a relaxed lifestyle helps you to be the best you can be, physically and mentally. I spend my free time with family and friends, which keeps me relaxed and in a positive mind-set.","Cristiano Ronaldo revealed his secret health and fitness formula .

"Long flight: British racing pigeons are being shipped to China . The  waning sport of pigeon  racing has received a welcome financial boost from China, where birds race for up to £1million in prizes. Fanciers from the Far East are prepared to pay thousands of pounds for British racing birds  as more than 300,000 affluent  Chinese take up the hobby. The growing interest is in stark contrast to the UK, where the hobby is in sharp decline. But with more than 300,000 fanciers in China demand for winning British birds is high. The record prize for a British bird was reached by Champion Treble Six, nicknamed the Banker because of its winning record, to a Chinese buyer for breeding for £16,000 in 2011. This year a bird named Bolt, after Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, was sold to a Chinese businessman for £260,000, by a Belgian fancier. While gambling is illegal pigeon races in China attract large bets and prizes totalling £3million. In some races the winning bird earns his owner £1million. Pigeon racing in China can be traced back to the Ming dynasty of the 14th century. The sport was banned as too capitalist during the Cultural Revolution but has rebounded since the ban was quietly lifted a few years ago. Now the country's emerging middle class has taken to the sport with huge interest, making fast birds important status symbols which attract higher prices than in Britain. The Royal Pigeon Racing Association (RPRA) has now commissioned a report to look into ways of exploit the market further. It hopes that increased opportunities for British fanciers will also lead to a resurgence in the sport in the UK too. High fliers: Pigeon racing a multi-million pound industry in China where a winning pigeon can award its owner with £1m in some races . Stewart Wardrop, RPRA general manager, said: 'We're just waking up to the potential and the fact it could be a big business for us. The Chinese, like in so many areas, are trying to acquire the best things available.' The RPRA has recruited a Mandarin speaker to build up contacts in the Far East, it appears on Chinese websites and social media. The association even has plans to launch a Mandarin version of its journal British Homing World. There are now some 42,000 pigeon racers in Britain, less than half the 100,000 of the figure in the sport's heyday in the late 1960's, with the figure falling by about five per cent a year. However the RPRA claims the sport generates £130million a year for the economy and hopes trade with China could help pigeons bring even more money home.","Pigeon racing is becoming a popular sport among China's middle class .

"A middle-aged woman and her son have been arrested after allegedly trying to take her husband to commit suicide in Switzerland, it emerged last night. The 65-year-old woman and her 25-year-old son are suspected of planning to admit the terminally ill man to the Dignitas clinic in Zurich to die. The female pensioner, who comes from the Chichester area of West Sussex, was held along with her son on suspicion of encouraging or assisting a suicide before being released on police bail. Assisted suicide: A 65-year-old wife and her son, 25, are alleged to have planned to fly her 71-year-old husband to this Dignitas clinic in Pfaeffikon, near Zurich, Switzerland, so he could end his own life . So far no members of the family have been named by police and the older man’s condition has not been revealed. But . officers have said they are having the mental capacity of the . ‘vulnerable’ 71-year-old assessed to determine if he is able to make . decisions for himself. Yesterday . a spokesman for Sussex Police said: ‘Police have been made aware of . suggestions that a man and a woman from West Sussex could be planning to . take a vulnerable pensioner to go to the . Dignitas clinic in Switzerland so that he can end his life. ‘It is an offence to encourage or assist suicide under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. ‘Our officers are investigating whether any crime has been committed or is likely to be committed if they do not take action.’ The . spokesman added: ‘We are currently having the mental capacity of the . vulnerable 71-year-old assessed in order to determine how able he is to . make decisions for himself. Ongoing investigation: Sussex Police, headquarters pictured, are now investigating whether the 71-year-old has the mental capacity to chose to end his life . Legal Battle: Paul Lamb, 58, who is paralysed from the neck down, lost is case arguing for the right to die  earlier this month but has vowed to take his battle to the Supreme Court . ‘The investigation is looking into what steps, if any, the suspects had made in taking the man out of the country. ‘If . it is confirmed the man had the mental capacity to make decisions for . himself then we would not be able to prevent him travelling.’ West . Sussex County Council, whose social workers know the family, are . working with police on the case but said it would be ‘inappropriate’ to . comment. However euthanasia campaigner Michael Irwin said: ‘It is ridiculous for them to arrest anyone under these circumstances. ‘Every year up to 30 people go to Switzerland with relatives and no action is ever taken against them.‘To my knowledge nobody has been arrested in this situation for the last three years.’ Although . legal in Switzerland, assisted suicide is a criminal offence in the UK . and carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. Despite . this, the Crown Prosecution Service has made it clear that a person . accompanying someone to a foreign country to commit suicide is unlikely . to face prosecution. The . guidelines clarifying the UK’s position on assisted suicide were issued . in February 2010 by the Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer, . QC. They indicate that . anyone acting with compassion to help end the life of someone who has . decided they cannot go on would be unlikely to face criminal charges. And . while assisted suicide remains a criminal offence in England and Wales, . individual decisions on prosecution are based on the circumstances in . each case. Anguish: . Tony Nicklinson, who had locked-in syndrome, is comforted by his wife . last year after he is told the High Court decided a doctor is not . allowed to help him end his life. He died shortly afterwards, but his . family have continued the fight to have the law on assisted suicide . clarified . Right-to-die fight: Mr Nicklinson, a father-of-two from Melksham, Wiltshire, was paralysed by a stroke while on a business trip to Athens in 2005 . Dignitas has . seen more than 1,100 deaths since it opened 14 years ago, including . more than 150 Britons who have made the decision to commit suicide at . its Zurich clinic. A . total of 200 people end their life there every year as assisted suicide . is legal in Switzerland provided that the helper does not personally . benefit from the death. And . despite complaints about so-called ‘suicide tourism’ – 85 per cent of .

"President Obama has refrained from picking favorites in the race to succeed him and paid Vice President Biden a strong compliment without issuing anything close to an endorsement. ‘I've got somebody who I think will go down as one of the finest vice presidents in history, and he has been, as I said earlier, a great partner in everything that I do,’ Obama said in an interview with CBS released Thursday. The President will continue to walk a proverbial tightrope for the near future as all eyes are cast on Hillary Clinton, waiting to see if the former Secretary of State decides to formally announce her second presidential bid. Looking for the handoff: Vice President Joe Biden has not decided whether or not he will run for President in 2016 but Obama has refused to take the normal move of endorsing his number two (pictured together on Wednesday) ‘I suspect that there may be other potential candidates for 2016 who have been great friends and allies. I know that we've got an extraordinary Secretary of State who did great service for us and worked with me and Joe to help make the country safer,’ Obama said. ‘Whoever the Democratic standard bearer is going to be continuing to focus on jobs, making sure that our kids our getting a great education, making sure that we're rebuilding prosperity from the middle class out in country, and I am very much interested in making sure that some of the stuff we've gotten started continues.’ Clinton is widely seen as the Democratic frontrunner in 2016 and has been trouncing Biden in both the early polls and early fundraising efforts. In spite of Clinton’s hefty lead- the latest Fox News poll completed Tuesday has Clinton beating Biden by 53 per cent in the race for the Democratic nomination- has not deterred Biden from keeping the door open for his third presidential run. He has repeatedly said that he has not decided on his 2016 prospects, rotating his answers between saying that he will decide after the midterms, he hasn’t been focusing on it, or leaving the final decision to his wife Jill. Close: Biden put up a selfie of himself and Obama from inside 'the Beast' on Wednesday . ‘There is nothing I would do differently if I absolutely knew I wasn't going to run or I absolutely knew I was,’ Biden said most recently. The President’s decision to hedge his bets in the CBS interview does not come as a massive surprise to political analysts, as this is just the latest in a string of signs that he is staying close with Clinton even after she left his administration. One of the most telling moments came shortly after he was sworn into office for a second term, when he chose to have Clinton by his side for the first televised interview of the term rather than his running mate, Biden. According to a lengthy Politico profile of 'Scranton Joe' that ran in February, trouble began brewing during the 2012 re-election campaign as there were rumors that the Obama team was considering replacing Biden with then-outgoing-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Eye on the prize: Hillary Clinton has a massive lead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination for 2016 and she has been doing little to tamper expectations that she is running (pictured at a Las Vegas event last week) When questioned about it by Biden, all involved parties denied any truth to said rumor and said so publicly, but not as forcefully as Biden wanted. Not only were they not being as strong in their denials as Biden wanted, they were also lying.

"Traditionally, buying products in bulk was a guarantee of getting more for less. But the truth in the modern supermarket could be very different with evidence that everything from cornflakes to coffee may be cheaper in smaller packs. A survey of big brands suggests that shoppers need to arm themselves with calculators if they really want to get value for money when touring the aisles. A survey of big brands suggests that shoppers need to arm themselves with calculators if they really want to get value for money when touring the aisles . For example, Asda was offering a double pack of two 350g blocks of popular Cathedral City cheddar cheese at £6.98. But it cost £4 to buy two 350g individual blocks. A similar pattern was seen with a large 500g jar of Nescafe coffee. Britain’s second biggest supermarket was charging £11.50, but it was possible to buy two 300g jars for £10 at the supermarket. A 1kg box of Kellogg’s cornflakes was selling for £3.38, but a 750g box was only £2. The mismatch tends to happen when supermarkets cut the price of small packs for a temporary promotion – or to match reductions at a rival. A survey of big brands suggests that shoppers need to arm themselves with calculators if they really want to get value for money when touring the aisles. One of the supermarkets assessed was Asda . But the result is that shoppers can no longer rely on the belief that bigger packs automatically mean they are getting more for less. A similar problem was found at Sainsbury’s where, for example, it was selling an 18 pack of Peroni beer for £23, which works out at £1.28 a bottle. A 12 pack was £13, which was £1.09 a bottle. Tesco, the biggest supermarket chain, was selling a 350g jar of Loyd Grossman’s tomato and basil sauce at £1, which means two jars adding up to 700g would cost £2. But one larger 660g jar was £2.79. A similar problem was found at Sainsburys where, for example, it was selling an 18 pack of Peroni beer for £23, which works out at £1.28 a bottle. A 12 pack was £13, which was £1.09 a bottle . Tesco, the biggest supermarket chain, was selling a 350g jar of Loyd Grossman¿s tomato and basil sauce at £1, which means two jars adding up to 700g would cost £2. But one larger 660g jar was £2.79 . At Waitrose a 700ml bottle of Absolut Vodka was £19.60, but a 350ml bottle cost £9. Kiti Souninen, retail expert at analysts Mintel, said: ‘It does make you question whether supermarkets take  advantage of the vast majority of consumers who assume bulk  buying is cheaper.’ Only last week Tesco was fined £300,000 and ordered to pay £65,000 costs at Birmingham Crown Court after admitting its promotion on punnets of ‘half-price’ strawberries costing £1.99 was bogus because the original price of £3.99 had only applied for a short period. But supermarkets are only at risk of breaking the law if they promote a product with a poster or sticker that boasts ‘Bigger Pack, Better Value’ when this is untrue. In the examples in the survey, there were no such claims, which means they were doing nothing illegal. Richard Lloyd, executive director at consumer group Which?, said: ‘When household budgets are squeezed, it’s unacceptable that shoppers are confused into thinking that they’re getting a good deal when that might not be the case.’","Survey found shoppers are at risk of losing out by trusting bulk buy deals .

"Good neighbours don't just make good friends - they may also reduce the risk of suffering a heart attack, according to a new study. Current evidence suggests that the characteristics of an area in which a person lives can have a negative impact on their cardiovascular health - such as the density of fast food outlets; levels of violence, noise, and pollution; drug use; and building disrepair. However, few studies have looked at the potential health-enhancing effects of positive local neighbourhood characteristics. A study into more than 5,000 American adults with no known heart problems found that those with a good support network in their community had a 22 per cent reduced risk of having a heart attack (file picture) The new research tracked the cardiovascular health of more than 5,000 American adults with no known heart problems over a period of four years, starting in 2006. Their average age was 70, and almost two-thirds were women and married. In 2006 they were asked to score on a validated seven point scale how much they felt part of their local neighbourhood; if they felt they had neighbours who would help them if they got into difficulty; whether they trusted most people in the area; and if they felt they were friendly. Potentially influential factors - such as age, race, gender, income, marital status, educational attainment, outlook and attitude, social integration, mental health, lifestyle, weight, and underlying health issues, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, were all taken into account. During the four year monitoring period, 148 of the 5,276 participants had a heart attack. The researchers said that a strong social support network of friends and family, including neighbours, has been linked to better health (file picture) Analysis of the figures showed that each standard deviation increase in perceived neighbourhood social cohesion was associated with a 22 per cent reduced risk of a heart attack. The researchers said the association held true even after adjusting for relevant socio-demographic, behavioural, biological, and psycho-social factors, as well as individual-level social support. They say their findings echo those of other studies which have found a link between well integrated local neighbourhoods and lower stroke and heart disease risk. The researchers admitted that some potentially important risk factors - such as family history of heart disease or stroke and genetic influences - were not known. However, they said a strong social support network of friends and family has been linked to better health, so friendly neighbourhoods might be an extension of that. Eric Kim, of the Department of Psychology at Michigan University, said: 'Perceived neighbourhood social cohesion could be a type of social support that is available in the neighbourhood social environment outside the realm of family and friends.' The researchers also suggested that tight-knit local communities may help to reinforce and 'incentivise' certain types of cohesive behaviours and so exclude anti-social behaviours.","Study of over 5,000 American adults found link between health and habitat .

"The secret to a happy marriage is kissing and saying 'I love you' 10 times a week and going on three dates a month, an American report has revealed. The detailed study of 1,000 married Americans also found three surprise romantic gestures and 10 deep and meaningful conversations each month are key to a harmonious relationship. Having three shared hobbies and interests and going on two vacations a year are also among the requirements for romantic bliss. Regular kissing and telling your partner 'I love you', is the secret to a happy marriage according to research from America . It also emerged many Americans believe the secret to a perfect marriage is accepting each other's faults, trust and, importantly, being able to say sorry. Plenty of quality time, being best friends through thick and thin, and being able to have fun together are also on the list. A spokesman for global market researchers . OnePoll.com, which commissioned the research, said: 'Anyone can get . married, but it takes a lot of commitment and effort to make your . marriage a perfect one. 'If you are not prepared to put the work in and take the rough with the smooth, you are going to struggle to find that ideal. 'Everyone wants to have a perfect marriage and it seems that the little things such as kissing and cuddling really are important. 'While they might seem insignificant, it's the little gestures which can help couples retain their closeness and intimacy. 'If you lose this, that's when your marriage can become stuck in a rut and lead to two unhappy or bored people.' The study, carried out between January 30th and February 9th, polled Americans from across the country. It . found the perfect marriage will also see couples have sex three times a . week, and enjoy around seven cuddles during that time. Six . nights spent cuddled up in front of the TV and two nights out with . their own friends each month, along with two mini-vacations a year also . make a successful marriage. Even having three arguments a month was among the list of secrets. It . also emerged that more than half were friends before they actually . became a couple, and waited an average of just over three years before . walking down the aisle. The study also found that Americans consider the biggest secret of a happy marriage to be simply accepting each other's faults. Trust, honesty, respect and just supporting each other also featured in the top five. Romance: Going on at least three dates a month will help create a harmonious relationship, the report reveals . Other 'secrets' to a perfect marriage include being kind to each other, compromising and also knowing when to give your partner some space. Regular sex and kisses, ending an argument before going to bed and sharing the household and parenting duties are also on the list. It also showed that 92 per cent of Americans consider themselves to be happily married. But of those who are not, almost a quarter put it down to simply growing apart from their partner, while another 17 per cent blame financial problems.

"Shamed: One of the photos Conservative MP Brooks Newmark sent to a young single mother . Tory MP Brooks Newmark bombarded a single mother with up to 40 naked pictures and told her 'I am desperate for sex with you' during a two year affair, it was claimed today. The former minister, 56, a father of five, yesterday issued a grovelling apology after being caught texting explicit photographs of himself for a second time. Mr Newmark left his post as minister for civil society last month after he was exposed as having exchanged lewd photographs with a male journalist posing as a glamorous 20-year-old Tory PR woman. Today it emerged that he 'seduced' an unnamed mother on Facebook behind his wife's back, sending her up to forty naked selfies in the past year, his lover said. According to The Sun one text read: 'I am desperate for sex with you — it's been too long. At least a pic would keep the demons at bay!' Another said: 'We are good lovers and we are good friends but probably not both together'. It is alleged he also invited her to his Westminster office and to his home having offered to pay the rail fare. His wife, innocently caught up in a humiliating sex scandal has moved out of their constituency  home in Essex, it has emerged. He announced he would quit the Commons at the next election, adding that he had ‘traumatised’ his family with ‘bizarre and abhorrent’ behaviour. He would be moving in to a psychiatric facility to battle his ‘demons’, he said. It has now emerged that he also sent a series of explicit ‘selfies’ to a single mother he met online. In one photograph he is seen posing naked while grinning in what appears to be a hotel bathroom. She claims she did not know he was married because 'he's an MP, he's not going to lie'. Messages: The woman who claims she had a two-year affair with the MP claims she received these texts with up to 40 naked photographs . Betrayal: Father-of-five Brooks Newmark with his wife Lucy, who it appears has moved out of their Essex home . The single mother ended the relationship two weeks ago when it was revealed he had sent naked pictures to someone else. She told The Sun's Paul Sims: 'He's told the world he was foolish and he engaged in late night flirtations online with other women because he was unwell. But that simply isn't true. We met in 2012 and he seduced me. 'We had a full-on relationship for over two years. I was in love with him.' Messages: His sexts to a reporter posing as a Tory activist forced him to resign his job . On the day he quit the Government he wrote: 'Something awful has happened. I can't talk now but have had to resign from Govt. I will catch up later. So sorry.' She replied she 'thought I was the only one for you'. The following day he said he was in 'pain' but when his lover asked him if she could ever trust him he  he responded: 'Please stop thinking about yourself'. Yesterday, Mr Newmark’s wife Lucy, 52, appeared to have moved from the family’s mansion near Braintree, Essex, to their £7million London home. Mrs Newmark, the daughter of the military historian Sir John Keegan, was seen alone at the four-bedroom Belgravia townhouse yesterday. As a result of his conduct, Mr Newmark wrote to the Prime Minister on Saturday evening announcing he is to quit in May at the General Election as he tries to rescue his family life. ‘I was the man who had everything. I made a fortune, married a beautiful wife, had five children, and then fulfilled my lifelong ambition to be a politician,’ he wrote in the Mail on Sunday. ‘Now my political career is in ruins. I have traumatised my family and let down my constituents and my colleagues. ‘Many will regard me as a failure. And it is true: behind the outward facade of success and achievement, I have been battling demons – and losing to them. I craved adrenaline and risk. Stress at work drove me to increasingly erratic behaviour. My friends warned me that I was cracking up. I ignored them.’ American-born Mr Newmark confessed to ‘a series of flirtations’ with women on social media and said he has ‘no one to blame but myself and take full responsibility for my own actions’. He added: ‘Deep inside, I knew I was playing with fire. Now it has consumed me and my family. I want to concentrate on slaying those demons – making me, I hope, a better husband and father.’ Mr Newmark was born in the United States and worked in finance before becoming MP for Braintree in 2005. A fortnight ago, it emerged he had been exchanging explicit pictures online with someone he believed to be a young blonde Tory named Sophie. In fact, the profile had been created by a male freelance reporter. The Sunday Mirror, which ran the original story, has been accused of entrapment – but it emerged that the pictures were among a number Mr Newmark had been sending. The MP, who led David Cameron’s drive for greater representation of women in politics, also sent explicit photographs to a young single mother weeks after being appointed as a minister in July. Country pile: Mrs Newmark appeared to have moved from the family’s mansion near Braintree, Essex, pictured . He allegedly sent more than a dozen pictures. A source told the Sun on Sunday: ‘He asked her to send an explicit picture back but she refused. The woman had no idea he was married and was horrified when she discovered the truth.’ Responding to the revelations, Mr Newmark said he has battled anorexia and depression. While his wife seems to have moved out of their home, he is having therapy to try to save his marriage. ‘I am seeking help now,’ he said. ‘I will be beginning residential psychiatric treatment for the next few weeks in the hope that professional help will enable me to salvage my life and my family.’ Mr Newmark, who will remain an MP for another seven months, will continue to claim his £67,060 parliamentary salary while in therapy. He said he was not seeking re-election despite advice from friends to ‘tough this out’. He made it clear he did not blame the media for exposing his behaviour, saying: ‘The fault is mine alone’. There was no answer yesterday at Mr Newmark’s five-bedroom mansion in the Essex countryside. At the couple’s second home in Belgravia, Mrs Newmark said: ‘I don’t want to talk to anyone, thank you very much.’","Single mother says MP sent her lewd messages during two-year affair .

"Recognition: The Pentagon for the first time has officially recognized transgender veterans including Autumn Sandeen, pictured . The Pentagon for the first time has officially recognized transgender service members in a significant step being hailed by the LGBT community. The acknowledgement came in the form of a letter to veteran and transgender activist Autumn Sandeen confirming that the Navy had updated its records to show she is a woman. While still a long way from open transgender service in the military, OutServe-SLDN, an organization for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender service members and their families labeled the move 'symbolic.' The letter from the Navy official, dated May 2, read: 'Per your request the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) has been updated to show your gender as female effective April 12, 2013.' Sandeen's military identification card now reflects the change. 'The fact that a process exists [to change the gender listed] indicates that there are people in the Department of Defense who are aware of the needs of transgender retirees and who are working to see those needs met,' OutServe-SLDN executive director Allyson Robinson told BuzzFeed. 'And, in that sense, the significance of this symbolic act for our broader work and for our goal of open service becomes I think a little bit more apparent.' Previous life: Sandeen, pictured here as a man in 1980, says here military identification card now reflects the change . Gay, lesbian and bisexual service . members have been able to serve openly in the military since September . 2011, however if transgender people try to do the same they continue to . be discharged, according to Buzzfeed. Sandeen . said she went to the Pentagon to change her gender status after . successfully changing to a woman in records in California, the Veterans . Administration, the state department and the social security office. 'I had heard that it could be done; I had never heard of anybody actually doing it,' Sandeen said. So she submitted all the documentation and in May was thrilled to hear the change had been made, marking a step, she believes, towards open service for transgender people. Symbolic: Sandeen, pictured holding a photo of herself, submitted all the documentation and in May was thrilled to hear the change had been made, marking a step, she believes, towards open service for transgender people . Unfair: Gay, lesbian and bisexual service members have been able to serve openly in the military since September 2011 but not transgender people like Sandeen, pictured left today and right in 1980 as a man . 'By showing you can actually change your gender marker with the Department of Defense... then it's another step toward figuring out a way to have open service for trans people,' she said. 'That's my end and I think this is going to be a step to get there.' Robinson said it was the first time in the organization's knowledge that the Department of Defense has recognized and changed the gender of anyone affiliated, in a uniformed capacity, to the military. 'That alone makes it very significant, not just for this veteran herself, but for likely thousands of others who can have these corrections made to their DEERS documents,' Robinson said. But she called for the Pentagon to agree to gender changes on historical documents including the DD-Form-214 - the Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty. 'I would say that it is a very early and very small step in a long process to achieve our goals here,' Robinson told Buzzfeed. 'But, it is significant, as the earliest steps always are, because it reflects a shift, even if it is a small one, in the way that transgender people are viewed within the institution of the United States military.'","The acknowledgement came in the form of a .

"Chelsea and Arsenal will still try and lure Sami Khedira from Real Madrid in January but both clubs face losing out to Bayern Munich. Luka Modric’s medium-term injury means Khedira may stay at Madrid for the remainder of the season before leaving next summer when his contract expires. Both the Blues and the Gunners were willing to pay a fee of around £7million to lure the German international before he became a free agent when the mid-term window opens. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Watch Joao Moutinho's best goals for Porto . Sami Khedira is in-demand and the World Cup-winner could move from Madrid in January . Both Arsenal and Chelsea could turn to Joao Moutinho (second right) if Khedira heads to Bayern Munich . But reports in Spain suggest both clubs could be outmanoeuvred by Bayern who are believed to be on the verge of agreeing a pre-contract with Khedira in January. If that happens then Arsenal will turned their attention to Monaco’s Joao Moutinho. But Arsene Wenger is unlikely to endorse spending the recently quoted £30m price tag for the Portugal midfielder. Liverpool could also challenge Arsenal for the services of goalkeeper Petr Cech. As revealed here weeks ago Cech wants to quit Chelsea now he is no longer first-choice keeper at the Blues. It is understood Chelsea will sell Cech in January for a fee in the region of £7m. Petr Cech (left) has been a virtual ever-present since moving to Chelsea from Rennes in 2004 . Arsenal centre half Per Mertesacker is trying to help broker a deal to bring German international Mats Hummels, his former national team defensive partner, to the Emirates. But the bottom line is matching the fee that Borussia Dortmund want - which could be as much as £47m. Mats Hummels (right) is available for a vast £47m from Borussia Dortmund with Arsenal and United interested . The Gunners are unlikely to pay that - but Manchester United may well do - as soon as the January transfer window opens. It also seems that United will pip Arsenal to the signature of Dutch midfielder Kevin Strootman from Roma. Liverpool will splash out to sign a new striker in the January transfer window. As revealed in this column THREE WEEKS ago their prime target is West Brom striker Saido Berahino. Saido Berahino is in sparkling form and is the latest striker touted to solve Liverpool's striker crisis . The Baggies have already rebuffed overtures from Tottenham with regard to a £15m offer for the England Under 21 striker. But an offer approaching the £30m region will force West Brom to sell. West Ham may move for Sampdoria midfielder Pedro Obiang in January if they fail to secure Alex Song, who is on a season-long loan from Barcelona, on a long-term deal. The Hammers are also trying to secure Winston Reid on a new contract otherwise they face him leaving on a Bosman at the end of the season. Former Manchester United chief executive Peter Kenyon is now working with Atletico Madrid in a bid to help the club’s 'commercial expansion'. The Manchester City hierarchy are working out the feasibility of signing Lionel Messi next summer. The £200m transfer fee to Barcelona and all inclusive personal terms approaching £500,000-a-week for the Argentine are not the main problem. Lionel Messi has been on Barcelona's books since the age of 11 when he moved to Catalonia from Argentina . I am told City’s commercial operation think the player is worth the investment and the football advantages with regard to a proper tilt at the Champions League next season are obvious. But fulfilling complex UEFA Financial Fair Play rules are an issue. Franco Baldini, football director at Tottenham Hotspur, faces being 'eased' out of the club following the 'signing' of Paul Mitchell from Southampton as head of recruitment. The announcement by Borussia Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp that if he manages outside of Germany he wants it to be in England has been registered on the radar of the Liverpool and Arsenal boardrooms. Jurgen Klopp has spoken of his desire to manage outside Germany, with Arsenal and Liverpool interested . Tim Sherwood has been taking Spanish lessons and may look to further his coaching career and horizons in La Liga. Frank Lampard has told pals that he is ready to stay with Manchester City until the end of the season before linking up with New York City mid-way through the MLS season which starts in March. Frank Lampard (left) is enjoying himself in Manchester and would like to postpone his move to New York . iSay . Paolo di Canio, who has been 'resting' since being sacked as Sunderland boss last year, will throw his hat into the ring if and when the Celtic job becomes available . Wigan chairman Dave Whelan may have been foolish to appoint Malky Mackay as the club's new manager given recent circumstances. The 77-year-old  may well also have made some ill-advised comments which have not sat well with the politically correct police or indeed indignant faux morality warriors. Although his comments have in certain arenas been twisted to suit agendas. But to accuse Whelan of being a 'racist' is wrong. Moreover such allegations cheapen the front line battle against racism. Dave Whelan claps during Malky Mackay's first game in charge of Wigan, a 1-1 draw with Middlesbrough . BTW . That IPRO, the new isotonic drink which is supplying more and more football clubs and who bought the stadium naming rights at Derby, has pulled out of a deal with Wigan in the wake the controversial fall out following the appointment of Malky Mackay. Sir Bobby Charlton recently questioned whether captaincy is a good thing for Wayne Rooney. Charlton reasoned that the burden of responsibility could weigh too heavily on Wayne and undermine his performance. That could be true with Manchester United and may be something Louis van Gaal will address. But with England it would seem Rooney has defied those, hands up like myself, who were sceptical about giving Rooney the armband not least on the basis given his poor displays at the World Cup in the summer whether he was worthy of the automatic selection that usually comes with being appointed captain of your country. Wayne Rooney has thrived since being named England captain and looks like a player reborn . Liverpool return to the scene of the last season’s crime where their title bid finally hit the buffers when they allowed Crystal Palace to hold them to a draw having eased into a three-nil lead in the penultimate game of the season. Bet Victor offer odds of 90-1 on another 3-3. Palace to win 1-0 is 12-1. A 3-1 Liverpool win is 16-1. For those Palace fans who fondly remember their 4-3 FA Cup semi final win over the Reds at Villa Park in 1990 Betway offer 249-1 for a repeat of that. Earlier that season Liverpool beat Palace 9-0 in the league at Anfield. Paddy Power offer 500-1 for a repeat of that. As it’s turned out, thus far at least, Rooney seems to have been inspired and matured in an England shirt since wearing the armband. It’s not just the six goals in six games this season which have moved him to within three of Charlton’s 49 goal record for England that prove the point. It’s been the manner in which he has performed and led what has become a young squad. Rooney was a proper leader in England’s impressive 3-1 win over Scotland. What caught the eye wasn’t so much the two goals he struck, but the way all the team, especially Jack Wilshere, seem to want to bust a gut around their new skipper, who, in turn is now performing like a talisman rather than a prima donna.","Khedira could be available for £7m but Bayern Munich look ready to swoop .

"A Connecticut mother and son are facing charges for stealing thousands of dollars worth of valuables from their neighbor's home on Thanksgiving night, police say. It was just hours after the Strain family had given Laurie Eddings, 50, and her son Christopher Warren, 31, a Thanksgiving dinner that the mother and son duo burglarized the home of their, once friendly, Milford neighbors, NBC reports. The two family's were close, so close in fact, Crystal Strain, the victims' daughter, spent the night at the criminal's home from time to time. Mother & Son: Laurie Eddings, 50, (left) and her son Christopher Warren, 31, (right) are facing charges for stealing $9,000 worth of valuables from their neighbors on Thanksgiving night . Key: The criminals stole a key to their neighbor's apartment from Crystal Strain (above), the victims' daughter . That all ended when Strain entered her neighbor's home only to find Eddings and Warren rifling through her family's safe they had stolen from her family's home. 'I just dropped off a plate. I was like, 'How could you?'' Strain told NBC. 'I couldn't believe it, as much as we've done for them and helped them out.' Court documents state that Strain said  Eddings tried to block her out of the apartment as the two went through the safe, when Strain realized what was happening, she ran across the street to her parents' home and called her mother. Celebrating: While the Strain family was out celebrating the holiday with family members, Eddings and Warren were burglarizing their home (above) Charges: Along with third-degree larceny, third-degree burglary, and conspiracy to commit both, Warren was additionally charged with third-degree criminal mischief because he was on probation at the time of the thefts . Strain said the burglars stole a house key from her and used it to unlock her family's door when they were out celebrating Thanksgiving with family. Strain told WFSB that she found the criminals even using her family's tools to crack open the safe. Police say Eddings and Warren cleared out the safe taking cash, jewelry, antique coins,  and electronics worth a total of $9,000. Responding officers responded to Strain's call and found that this wasn't the first time the mother and son had stolen from their generous neighbors. Police uncovered a second safe that was stolen at an earlier date, according to WFSB. 'It's unbelievable,' said Strain's father, Christopher. 'I mean, you know, you're helping them out, bringing them to the store, back and forth, doctor's visits and stuff, and then to turn around and, you know, find your stuff in their house.' Eddings and Warren were both arrested and charged with both third-degree burglary and larceny as well as conspiracy to commit both. Warren was additionally charged with third-degree criminal mischief because he was on probation at the time, NBC reports.","Crystal Strain opened the door of her once friendly neighbors to find Laurie Eddings, 50, and her 31-year-old son Christopher Warren cracking open her family's safe using her family's tools!

"Thrifty consumers with an eye for a bargain may be in for a shock when they see their favourite Soft Serve Cone has gone from 30 cents to 50 cents. The popular fast-food chain McDonalds has taken the beloved ice-cream off the 'Loose Change' menu since last Tuesday and nearly doubles the promotional price. The favourite dessert was not the only item that rose, the Small Fries has also been dropped from the menu, now costing consumers $1.95 instead of $1. The  menu is designed for the Australian market, and allowing consumers to take advantage of the idea that finding coins between cushions did have some value. Consumers will no longer be able to purchase their favourite treat - the Soft Serve Cone at 30 cents . But a McDonald’s spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that: ‘Our Soft Serve Cone was 30 cents whilst it was on the Loose Change Menu which was a promotional item for a limited time only. ‘We’re proud to offer our customers great food at great value every day. 'We recently added $1 Frozen Coke and $1 Choc Waffle cone to the Loose Change Menu.’ Some Australian customers have raised their concerns over the new prices . Apple Pies has also been taken off the Loose Change menu, jumping from $1.50 to $1.95 . The Small Fries and Soft Serve Cone have been taken off the Loose Change menu since last Tuesday . While a McDonald’s customer service representative told Daily Mail Australia that the apple pies has also been taken off the Loose Change menu, jumping from $1.50 to $1.95. In 2011, some apple pie fans started up a Facebook group called 'Australia Demands the Return of Macca's $1 Apple Pies' after it hiked to $1.95. Matt Jackson, from South Australia, opened the page and even started an online petition. After months of signing and writing letters to the board, the page posted in June 2012: 'SUCCESS! Apple pies are $1.50 at the moment!!' The small fries has also been taken off the Loose Change menu, jumping from $1 to $1.95 . A McDonald’s customer service representative said the apple pies has jumped from $1.50 to $1.95 . With some items hiking up in prices on the menu, McDonald's is still Australia's most popular fast food chain. According to a report released by Roy Morgan, the global burger business was visited by 29.5 percent of the population. It was also found to have the highest customer return rate, with Australians visiting the chain 2.7 times in an average four week period.

"The Federal Bureau of Investigation says it does not have enough staff to calculate the thousands of background checks required by law when buying a firearm, as gun sales are expected to hit a record amount from Black Friday. The busiest shopping day of the year is expected to yield more 144,000 checks and is on track to surpass last year's record 144,758, CNN reported. 'We are averaging three checks per second,' FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer told the network. 'The challenge is to have staff keep up with this volume.' Boom: There have been 120 background checks per minute for Black Friday gun sales this year . The FBI runs the checks from a call center, which has about 600 staff. An extra 100 employees are brought in for the Black Friday rush. Many employees have been asked to pick up extra shifts and are pulling 17-hour shifts in an attempt to get on top of the work. The agency has only three business days to complete the checks. Failing to do so means the person trying to buy the gun is allowed to purchase the weapon without being checked out at the discretion of the vendor. Most major retailers will not allow a purchase to go through without a completed check. Required by law: The FBI has brought in an additional 100 people to do background checks during Black Friday and they will be working extended hours to try and keep up with demands . Background check: The FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System said over 500 checks each day fail because of incomplete information . Last year, more than 186,000 background checks were not completed on time. That is out of the 21 million background checks that were completed on time. The agency typically processes about 58,000 checks a day. About 500 of that number fail due to incomplete information. According to CNN, about 3,000 - or 2 percent - of the more than 144,000 Black Friday background checks will not be completed because of insufficient information. More than 94,000 checks had been processed by 2pm Friday. When the FBI introduced their background check system in 1999, there were only about nine million checks a year. Busy time: Metro Shooting Supplies' employee Chris Cox (left) speaks to Steve Christy about the purchase of a 9mm handgun in Bridgeton, Missouri on November 13, 2014 . There are 10 factors that could cause a gun purchase to be denied, according to CNN. - Felony conviction . - Arrest warrant . - Documented drug problem . - Mental illness . - Undocumented immigration status . - Dishonorable military discharge . - Renunciation of U.S. citizenship . - Restraining order, . - History of domestic violence . - Indictment for any crime punishable by longer than one year of prison.

"Someone is targeting Atlanta's homeless community and killing them while they sleep, police say. Atlanta's homeless community is being urged to stay alert and take extra precautions after authorities say two homeless men were fatally shot while they slept in two separate -- but similar -- incidents, NBC News reports. On Monday, a man in his forties was found dead in downtown Atlanta in a park where he was known for sleeping at, WXIA reports. Homeless: Two homeless men, Tommy Mims, 64, (left) and an unnamed man (right)believed to be in his forties were found dead in similar killings as they slept on the street . Bridge: Mims was found dead on a sidewalk under a railroad bridge (above) on Northside Drive in atlanta . 'It appears that the victim had been sleeping,' Capt. Paul Guerrucci, Atlanta police homicide unit commander, said in a news conference, 'and that someone shot him multiple times while he slept.' Just two days later, the body of 64-year-old Tommy Mims was found under a bridge. Found about two miles apart, both men suffered gunshot wounds and appeared to have been killed while they slept. Guerrucci said that it is believed that both men were shot in the evening. 'Please be aware that it appears that we have somebody that is targeting people that are sleeping at night, and we're very concerned about that,' Guerrucci said. Police are struggling to find a motive behind the two killings, which occurred in the same week, and say they don't believe the killings were a result of a dispute or a robbery. Captain: Capt. Paul Guerrucci said the killer is believed to be targeting the homeless as they sleep . Motive: Police have not found a motive for the killings and are urging Atlanta's homeless community to take extra precautions and use a 'buddy system' on the streets . Anita Beaty, of the Metropolitan Atlanta Task Force for the Homeless, told NBC that the word is being spread through homeless shelters and on the streets that the homeless should be vigilant and use a 'buddy system.' 'It's bad enough that you're sleeping outside in the cold, but to be murdered?,' Beaty said. Beaty said that the task force will make a flier warning the homeless to be careful, come in doors when they can, and not to sleep alone outside.","Atlanta police found the bodies of two homeless men killed in their sleep just miles from each other in the same week .

"A woman in her fifties feared for her life after weight gain sent her blood pressure to dangerously high levels. Julie Betty, 51, from Somerset, was dependent on various medications due to her ill-health and feared her days were numbered. She told MailOnline: 'I was being monitored weekly for my . dangerously high blood pressure. I took five tablets a day and I was . very worried. I was afraid I was going to die.' Slimmed down: Julie Betty now weighs 11st 5lbs and is a dress size 10-12, left. Before, right, she was 17st 5lbs and a size 20 . Growing up, Julie had always been fit and active but in 2006 she had an accident where she damaged her shoulder and so was unable to exercise. Her weight crept up until by the time she was aged 50, she tipped the scales at 17st 5lbs. She said being a dress size 20 made her feel self-conscious and unhappy. She explained: 'I was morbidly obese and depressed - I was at my lowest point in my life. I sat at home with the blinds closed and wouldn't want to see or speak to anyone. 'My damaged shoulder gave me . constant pain so I couldn't exercise to lose the weight. But my . weight made me feel depressed and lacking in energy, I couldn't be . bothered to do anything anyway.' But when Julie heard how her raised blood pressure was endangering her life, she knew she had to do something to become healthier. Concern: Julie's weight sent her blood pressure to dangerously high levels . She decided to try the 'Body by Vi Challenge' after her daughter, Ami Pow, 29, lost 2st 4lb on the diet plan which involves substituting some meals with replacement shakes for 90 days. Julie said: 'I was sceptical about the challenge at first, but my daughter had great results so I had nothing to lose - apart . from the weight! I convinced my husband to follow the plan with me.' Just ten days into the diet, Julie began to notice a change in her well-being after she lost 10lbs. Her weekly blood pressure check-up with her GP revealed it had dropped for the first time in eight years. More confident: Julie said losing six stone has given her a new lease of life, left. She said before, right, she felt low on energy and depressed. She recalled: 'My GP took my blood pressure five times on one arm . and with two different machines. He wasn't saying anything and I was . starting to get worried about what he was going to say. 'Finally he . explained that my weight loss had a huge impact on reducing my blood . pressure - even my GP was shocked at how much it had reduced.' The improvement was the incentive Julie needed to stick with the plan and she went on to lose a total of six stone. She now weighs 11st 5lbs and is a dress size 10-12. Changed her life: As a result of her weightloss, Julie's blood pressure has come down and she feels happier and healthier . Julie said her new slim figure has made her feel young again and full of confidence. She said: 'Now I feel 21 not 51! As a result of losing the weight I am . now able to run around with my grandchildren. I'm out partying meeting . lots of people and helping them improve their lives.' Best of all, she said dieting has been 'like a miracle' as her blood pressure has reduced so much, she no longer needs to take medication.

"An Argentinian car mechanic has invented a potentially life-saving device that could be used to help deliver babies when complications occur during labour. Jorge Odón, 59, designed the instrument which could be safer than forceps, a ventouse, or a Caesarean section, in a non-hospital setting. The Odón Device uses a polyethylene sleeve, fixed around the baby's head, to pull the child down the birth canal. Jorge Odón, 59, designed an instrument, called the Odón Device (pictured), which could be safer than forceps, a ventouse, or a Caesarean section, in a non-hospital setting . It can be used to grip a baby stuck in the birth canal and pull it free . Here Odon demonstrates how a plastic bag filled with air can be used to extract a cork from a bottle, the trick that inspired him . Mr Odón, who has no medical background, says he came up with the idea after seeing a YouTube video of a person removing a cork from a wine bottle using just a plastic bag. He says that after seeing this trick, he realised the principle could also be applied to help women struggling during labour. He says the thought hit him in the middle of the night and he woke up his wife to tell her about it, but that she just told him to go back to sleep. Despite her dismissal, Mr Odón began work on the design and it is now the subject of a World Health Organisation approved study. The device is cheap to produce and can be used by midwives with minimal training. It is currently being tested in Argentina and rural South Africa by the World Health Organisation . The device has to be placed on the baby's head using an 'inserter' (pictured). It has a shaped end which ensures it is put in the right place . Once the device is in place, the birth attendant slips a polyethylene sleeve over the babies head and inflates it to secure it in place . It is being tested in Argentina and . in rural South Africa to establish whether it could act as a safe and . feasible birth aid for use by midwives with minimal training. If . it is brought into widespread use, Mr Odón says the gadget could be the . first innovation in operative vaginal delivery since the development of . forceps centuries ago. The Odón Device allows a birth attendant to place a plastic 'bell' on the baby’s head before sliding a polyethylene sleeve along the birth canal and around the baby's head. Once the sleeve is in place, the midwife can remove the plastic 'inserter' (pictured) The midwife can then use the sleeve to pull the baby down the birth canal. The sleeve is lubricated meaning the baby comes out as easily as possible . When it is in place, a small amount of air can be pumped into the sleeve to secure it around the baby's head. The plastic inserter is then removed and the midwife can use the sleeve to deliver the baby's head. The sleeve is lubricated to make the delivery easier. As the device reduces the amount of contact between the baby’s head and the birth canal it is thought it could also reduce the incidence of infections acquired during delivery.","Jorge Odón says the Odón Device could help deliver babies safely when complications arise during labour in areas with poor medical facilities .

"What started out as a lunchtime food fight in a Minneapolis high school ended in a massive brawl involving hundreds of students and police officers wielding canisters of Mace. Minneapolis South High School was placed on lockdown shortly before 1pm Thursday after violence broke out during third-period lunch inside the cafeteria between Muslim and black students. The fight involved 200-300 students and lasted about 15 minutes, leaving four people injured. Teaching continued as usual during the lockdown, but students had to remain in their classrooms. Scroll down for video . Melee: A food fight inside the cafeteria of Minneapolis South High School spiraled out of control, turning into a brawl involving up to 300 students . Out of control: Students reported seeing six several fights going on inside the lunchroom, boys hitting girls and kids lying on the floor . Students were let out at 3pm as usual, and parents were not asked to pick up their children. After-school activities proceeded as scheduled, CBS Minnesota reported. According to a message posted Thursday afternoon on the school's website, the incident began unfolding at around 12.45pm and quickly escalated into a large-scale physical confrontation. More than 20 staff members and two school resource officers responded immediately and attempted to break up the fight, but were unable to handle the situation and called the Minneapolis Police Department for help. Dozens of police officers who arrived on the scene tried to disperse the crowd of brawling teenagers, but to no avail. They then formed a human chain often used during crowd control situation and called on the brawlers to stand down, but when that failed, police sprayed Mace into the air above the crowd. 'Race riot': South High School students said the melee was the culmination of ongoing racial tensions between black and Muslim teens . Four people, including three students and one staff member who was hit in the head with a bottle, were sent to a hospital. Police said no weapons were used in the altercation, and the teens' unspecified injuries were not related to the fight. A dozen people also complained of suffering from side effects related to the chemical agent sprayed by police. They were treated on the scene for Mace inhalation. Student Abdi Sheik told CBS that the fight escalated into a 'big riot' over racial hostilities that have long been bubbling under the surface. According to witnesses, an initial fight happened during the first lunch period when one student threw a milk carton at another. By the time the third period came around, the situation spiraled out of control, with boys hitting girls and some students lying on the floor and covering their faces in surrender. Some members of the South High School community said that the violent incident was the culmination of ongoing tensions between the eight per cent of Muslim students of Somali decent and the 20 per cent who are African Americans. Innocent bystander: This high school staff member was taken to a hospital after being hit in the head with a bottle tossed by one of the brawlers . Aftermath: Three students suffered minor injuries, and a dozen others complained of side effects from Mace sprayed by police . 'I don't feel safe here,' senior Guled Omar told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. 'This is something that has been going on [for at least two years].' In a statement posted on the school's website, district spokesperson Stan Alleyne wrote: 'South is a very diverse high school. 'It is a microcosm of the city. Students function together at a high level every day. That is the strength of this school. Our students live diversity every day.' So far, no charges have been filed but police said students involved in the melee could potentially face assault, riot, and other counts.","Between 200-300 students at South High School took part in melee .

"An animal rights executive has been found dead in her Ohio garage, along with 31 dogs she had rescued, in an apparent suicide. A friend of Sandy Lertzman discovered her body inside the garage of her Moreland Hills home on Monday. The engine of the car was still running. Friends of the 62-year-old mother, who had dedicated her life to saving animals, believe she killed the dogs out of concern for their future.

Gina Lutes-Finley, a friend of Mrs Lertzman and the Director of Dogs Unlimited Rescue, told WKYC the animal rights campaigner may have been overwhelmed by caring for animals. 'She wanted to continue to rescue . and save these animals but, unfortunately, nobody can take care of 30 . animals, properly, by themselves,' Ms Lutes-Finley said. She added that Mrs Lertzman probably chose to kill the dogs out of concern that no one would be able to look after them. 'I can see why it would be so hard to walk away but you can't do it alone, and that's the bottom line,' Ms Lutes-Finley said.

"Uber Technologies has confirmed it has taken 'disciplinary action' against one of its general managers who was being investigating for violating the popular car-booking service's privacy policies by snooping on a reporter's ride. Josh Mohrer, general manager of Uber's New York office, was accused of using a company tracking tool called 'God View' to monitor the location of a BuzzFeed reporter earlier this month. In a statement, Uber said access to the personal data of anyone using its car service is limited to 'legitimate business purposes.' The San Francisco company said employees violating the rules may be disciplined or fired. God View is available to all employees at the car-sharing service and allows them to see customer activity, such as where a person wants to be picked up. Caught: Uber has finished its investigation into New York City general manager Josh Mohrer for spying on the ride history of a journalist and has 'taken disciplinary actions' against the executive . Mohrer was accused of twice accessing the personal account of BuzzFeed reporter Johana Bhuiyan. Buzzfeed is now reporting that Mohrer was disciplined. It is not known how he has been disciplined, but it’s clear the company found him in violation of its privacy policy. News of the investigation followed a separate BuzzFeed story, which reported that another Uber executive recently threatened to look into the personal lives of journalists that have criticized Uber. Emil Michael, Uber senior vice president for business, made his remarks in New York during a dinner that was also attended by Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and a list of prominent guests including actor Ed Norton, New York Daily News owner Mort Zuckerman and Huffington Post CEO Arianna Huffington, according to a USA Today column. The column was written by Michael Wolff, a prominent journalist, who said he invited BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith to the Uber dinner without informing his guest that all conversations were supposed to be off the record. Wolff said most other guests at the dinner didn't hear the conversation between Michael and Smith. Michael apologized for his remarks earlier this week. Shocking: Emil Michael (pictured), Uber's senior vice president, reportedly proposed looking into journalists' 'personal lives' and 'families' while in the presence of a BuzzFeed editor at a private dinner in New York . Uber Technologies Inc., the popular car service app, is close to raising between $35 billion and $40 billion in their latest round of funding, inside sources said this week . Under-fire: Ashton Kutcher entered the firestorm surrounding taxi-hiring app Uber . Ashton Kutcher entered the firestorm surrounding under-fire taxi-hiring app Uber and defended controversial comments made by the executive who suggested spending $1million to dig up dirt on journalists who criticise the company. Kutcher, an investor in the app, took to Twitter last Wednesday to show his support for beleaguered VP Emil Michael and described Sarah Lacy, a female journalist who has been highly critical of the company, as 'shady'. 'What is so wrong about digging up dirt on shady journalist?' tweeted the celebrity tech entrepreneur who has invested in tech firms including Skype, Foursquare, Airbnb and Spotify through his venture capital firm A-Grade. So as long as journalist are interested and willing to print half truths as facts... Yes we should question the source' he continued in a series of tweets before he sought to clarify that he was speaking for himself and not Uber. 'This should be fun... Here comes the part where journalist explain why they should be exempt from ridicule and judgement and probing...' he continued. In a series of messages on his Twitter account, Kalanick rebuked Michael. 'His remarks showed a lack of leadership, a lack of humanity, and a departure from our values and ideals,' Kalanick tweeted. Kalanick also tweeted that he and Michael would learn from their mistakes. The incidents have triggered a wave of tweets calling for a boycott of Uber, whose competition in the rapidly growing car-booking industry includes Sidecar and Lyft. Some of the investors backing Lyft also own stakes in BuzzFeed. It comes as a legal battle between Nevada's highly regulated taxi industry and Uber stumbled into complications as two state judges laid claim to hearing the same case.","Josh Mohrer, the New York manager, allegedly tracked Johana Bhuiyan .

"To the thinly disguised chagrin of a pitiful coven of hacks who regard boxing as so barbaric that they campaign for its abolition, The Greatest is still alive to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the most famous fight in ring history. Muhammad Ali launched a week of reminiscences about the Rumble in the Jungle by tweeting a happy snapshot of himself and some of his family and announcing that he feels just fine. Not for the first time, reports of his death have been exaggerated. Muhammad Ali looks on after knocking down George Foreman in the 1974 Rumble in the Jungle . Ali recently posted a picture on Twitter with the caption: 'Don't believe the hype. Feeling great earlier today' Ali's daughter Laila Ali tweeted an earlier message saying rumours of her father's health have been exaggerated . Not that this inconvenient truth has prevented some critics from using the occasion to dwell on how Parkinson’s disease has silenced the most voluble athlete of all time and diminished his physical powers. In the awkward realisation that they would be mocked for denigrating one of the most remarkable sporting achievements of all time, they pay grudging lip service to the scale of Ali’s accomplishment in Zaire on the sweltering night of October 30, 1974. Then they rain opprobrium on that parade, citing medical speculation as to how the many punches he took before his astonishing knock-out of Big Foreman might have damaged his brain. Such is the hypocrisy of those who rarely, if ever, deign to take a seat at ringside yet refuse to recognise the potential of boxing for strengthening the moral character of young men (and women), or their right to choose that path out of poverty. Ali was brought to Zaire for the fight after the infamous President of Zaire Mobutu Sese Seko put up $10m . Ali trains in front of a captive audience in Kinshasa before a cut to Foreman's eye delayed the fight . Ali had the locals in Zaire chanting 'Ali, bomaye', which translated means 'Ali, kill him!' Of course there can be harmful consequences of absorbing heavy blows to the head. But those who deem the risks not worth taking are not entitled to make currency of boxing’s most captivating moments. They simply can’t have it both ways. If they insist that a bright boy from the mean streets of Louisville should never have been permitted to lace up the gloves, they have no place riding the tail of the comet he blazed across our universe. Boxing was the making of Ali. It gave vivid expression to the most compelling voice of all our sporting generations and made his face the most recognisable on the planet. Would it really have been preferable for him to be dragged down into the criminal depths of the ghetto than to accumulate fame and fortune while becoming the champion of world heavyweight prize-fighting and the civil rights movement? The man himself does not think so. Boxing took Ali from the streets to make him the most recognisable face on the planet .

Ali poses with The Beatles after being crowned the heavyweight champion of the world . 60,000 roaring fans packed Kinshasa’s outdoor Stade du 20 Mai for the fight. 32 -year-old Ali was seven years older than his opponent and a fading former champ not expected to last more than three rounds. It is said that in the dressing room, Foreman and his ringside crew had knelt to pray that he did not kill Ali. 450 locations in the United States and Canada — and in some cinemas in the United Kingdom — screened the fight on closed-circuit television. 100 countries were estimated to have taken the fight, which was scheduled to start at 4.0am in Zaire to accommodate audiences in the US. 10 million dollars was split between the two — $5m each — paid for by President Mobutu. 45 Foreman first quit in 1977 and returned in the early Nineties — winning the world title again at 45, becoming the oldest heavyweight champion in history. The last time he was able to whisper in my hearing he recalled with eye-twinkling relish the dramatic turbulence of his prime years. But he also attested to contentment with the tranquillity of his current condition and the time that now gives him for profound reflection on his life and times. The Rumble in the Jungle is a pillar of his momentous life. As was his first winning of the world title. Those twin slayings of giants perceived as monsters came 10 years apart. In 1964, he ‘shook up the world,’ as he put it, by reducing a seemingly indestructible bear of a man called Sonny Liston to a demoralised wreck. In 1974 he returned to defy all predictions once more by making a Rope-a-Dope of the formidable, intimidating Foreman. If anything, the Rumbling of Foreman was more astonishing than the Crumbling of Liston. As Cassius Clay, in his first incarnation, he was a phenomenal athlete as well as a luminous mind. As Muhammad Ali, deep into his spiritual conversion, he was deemed a veteran pugilist surviving on those quick wits. Another genius, of sorts, helped Ali nag at Foreman’s psyche. Ali took a lot of punishment by methodically drawing Foreman in to waste the younger fighter's energy . Ali begins returning the reigning  heavyweight champion of the world's blows with interest . The promotional poster for the Rumble in the Jungle . By persuading Zaire’s President Mobuto to bestow $10million of his ill-gotten gains on the protagonists - $5m each - flamboyant promoter Don King provided an unusual stage better suited to Ali’s multi-faceted flair for the dramatic. The stadium would be a hot-house of more than 50,000 spectators, all entranced by the legend of The Greatest. The capital city of what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo became a captivated theatre for Ali the Entertainer. And his electrifying impact on the local population grew and intensified after Foreman suffered an eye-cut in training and King insisted they all stay in Zaire for the extra month needed for him to heal. While Big George growled and grumbled in his lair, Ali went out to engage with the people. The mood of apprehension for the former champ gradually shifted into an inkling that he just might shock the world again. When Ali came into that boiling arena he rekindled concern for his well-being by lolling on those ropes and allowing Foreman to belabour him with blows of tree-felling power. Occasionally Ali peppered Foreman with counter-combinations. Most demoralisingly of all, he kept asking his opponent: ‘Is that all you’ve got, George?’ By the eighth round he had the answer he wanted. Foreman had punched himself out, so Ali knocked him out with a right hook of devastating precision. After a split-second of stunned silence, the stadium and the wide world of closed circuit television went into raptures. Foreman puts up his guard as Ali surges forward in what has been described as 'The Match of the Century' Referee Zack Clayton counts out Foreman after Ali puts him on the canvass in the 8th round . Muhammad Ali was indeed The Greatest. Always would be. No matter what followed, be it epic victory over Smokin’ Joe Frazier in similarly exotic Manila or subsequent decline towards an inevitable and dreadful beating by Larry Holmes. There can be no certainty about which punch or punches may have triggered the shaking hands or trembling vocal chords. What we can be sure of is that the man himself apportions no blame to the sport which made him a king of every jungle, be it concrete, political or simply dense with foliage. Rather he would have us celebrate the anniversary of that Rumble in Africa. That, and the defiance of Parkinson’s for more than 30 years after diagnosis which appends another famous victory to his record. Ali staged three fights with the legendary Joe Frazier, which left both men physically and mentally exhausted . Ali was beaten by Larry Holmes in his last professional fight in Las Vegas, 1980 . Ali's brash style changed the way that sportsmen behaved, although few have ever emulated his genius . At 72, there is no knowing how long his final battle might last. No knowing what next week might bring. But for the moment, like all of us who love the hard old game and respect the valour of its participants, George Foreman is remembering Ali. Not with a frown. With a smile.","This week marks the 40th anniversary of the Rumble in the Jungle .

"HOW TO THINK LIKE EINSTEIN by Daniel Smith (Michael O’Mara £12.99) Here’s a little bit of wish-fulfilment to keep you warm through the long winter months. Anybody, says Daniel Smith, can think like Einstein —although I had always assumed that an enormous brain was an essential qualification. As it happens, Einstein had a slightly smaller brain than average, according to the men in lab coats who sliced it up. That’s what happens to great thinkers after they die. Even their skulls aren’t sacrosanct. Smith’s previous titles include How to Think Like Sherlock, How to Think like Steve Jobs and How to Think Like Mandela. He has thought more about thinking than most of us ever will. But he may have hit the jackpot this time. Einstein had a slightly smaller brain than average, according to the men in lab coats who sliced it up . For all the fun it might be to emulate the thought processes of a fictional character, a computer salesman or everyone’s favourite smiley peacemaker, Albert Einstein is the motherlode. Genius is a pathetically overused term but no one argues about it here. Einstein was no infant prodigy. One of his teachers, Dr Joseph Degenhart, said he ‘would never get anywhere in life’. (This is the only thing poor Dr Degenhart is remembered for.) Young Albert graduated fourth out of five from Zurich Polytechnic in 1900, failed to get an academic position and, after much frustration, was compelled to take the lowly position of Technical Expert (Class 3) at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. And yet, just four years later, he produced a series of papers that turned the world of science on its head. In one of them he posited the special theory of relativity. In another he calculated that E=mc². Even then, he didn’t receive his first junior professorship for another four years — or a Nobel Prize until 1922. ‘All of which goes to prove that even for an intellect as stellar as Einstein’s, slow and steady wins the race,’ writes Smith. ‘I have no special talents,’ Einstein himself said in 1952. ‘I am only passionately curious.’ ‘I have no special talents,’ Einstein himself said in 1952. ‘I am only passionately curious.’ To him, the development of science was driven by the need to satisfy the longing for pure knowledge. He also believed that the answers were out there somewhere, waiting to be discovered. ‘Without the belief in the inner harmony of our world, there could be no science,’ he wrote. So Einstein could combine a sense of wonder at the world with the belief that he would be able to work out what lay behind those wonders. It helped that he could ‘see’ what the vast majority of us simply cannot. Huge thickets of higher mathematics simply unravelled under his gaze. But once you have seen what only you can see, the next thing to do is look further. ‘I believe in intuitions and inspirations . . . I sometimes feel that I am right. I do not know that I am,’ he said. Not the thunderbolt of genius we might expect but a considered philosophical approach to the inner workings of the universe. These are not the ways of a dull conformist. Einstein disliked authority and being told what to do. He was careless with personal relations. It’s possible he loved women a little too much. But he not only saw the art in science, he made sure the rest of humanity knew about it too. ‘Imagination is more important than knowledge,’ he said in 1929. ‘Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.’ Call me an old softie if you like, but I love this.","Anybody, says Daniel Smith, can think like Einstein .

"For the survivors of a shooting rampage 13 years ago, news of a gunman in the quiet village of Newtown, it was like reliving a nightmare. News of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was all the more poignant for survivors of the 1999 shooting at the North Valley Jewish Community Center, who knew what terrors these children must have gone through. Survivor Ben Kadish, now 19, was only six years old when white supremacist Buford Furrow, Jr. walked into the community center and shot 70 bullets into the lobby. The barrage hit him in his leg and his abdomen. The JCC survivors were shocked when they . heard reports coming out of Newtown, Connecticut, in part because they . had heart it before. Scroll down for video . Ben Kadish, left, and Joshua Stepakoff, right, both 19, were shot at the North Valley Jewish Community Center on August 10, 1999; both were shaken by the news of Sandy Hook .

Kadish told KABC in Los Angeles that he has several strong memories of . the day. He was at the community center attending summer camp with . friends. After the shooting, he said that he remembered paramedics coming up to him, ‘(then) I remember just waking up in the hospital.’ ‘I was just appalled to find out that it was the exact same thing that happened to me,’ Joshua Stepakoff, 19, told the Los Angeles Daily News. ‘The pictures of the children being reunited with their families, all the parents waiting to hear about their children – all those images were identical to what I saw in 1999.’ Both of the teenagers offered advice to those dealing with the raw grief and anger following the Sandy Hook shootings. Kadish was shot in the leg and the abdomen, and said he spent many months recovering . Children were led by officers from the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills, Los Angeles . In an eerily similar situation, police are seen leading children from Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown last Friday . Buford Furrow, Jr. walked into the community center and shot 70 bullets into the lobby; he is serving a life sentence . ‘You need to talk out your emotions, and it’s okay to show your emotions and the true feelings that you have, instead of holding it in and keeping it from everyone,’ said Mr Kadish, who spent months recovering from his wounds. Since the shooting, both Mr Kadish and Mr Stepakoff have become adamant advocates for gun control. Mr Stepakoff said that gun control must not only be talked about, but acted upon. He also gave his own personal advice to the surviving children of the Sandy Hook shooting, who will forever remember the horrific day of December 14, 2012. ‘I had nightmares for a while,’ he told the Daily News, adding that his fear kept him from doing activities any child would not normally find frightening – including sleep-overs and going about day to day life. ‘It never fully goes away,’ Mr Steakoff said, 'but I'm not that bad anymore and I'm thankful for that.' Furrow, according to a 1999 report by the New York Times, was an ‘avid’ racist who said a year before the shooting that he dreamed of committing murder on a mass scale. At the time, the high-profile case sparked conversations on mental health in America. Experts said that the shooter did not slip through the cracks. SWAT team members were called to the North Valley Community center in 1999 . Thirteen years later, heavily armed state troopers would be called to Sandy Hook . In his case, the debate was whether it was legal and ethical to hold someone such as him in prison for being a violent and racist person. Furrow had gone to a mental hospital on October 28 to have himself committed, threatening to stab two women there. He also told police officers that he harbored fantasies of shooting random people at a mall. Still, he was allowed to go free. In 2001, he pleaded guilty to 16 felony counts, including the murder of the postal worker, and is serving a life prison sentence.

Over the past two days, heartbroken residents of Newtown have been burying their dead who were killed on the December 14 shooting. As more victims from the slaughter of 20 children and six adults were laid to rest, long funeral processions clogged the streets of Newtown, where Christmas trees were turned into memorials and a season that should be a time of joy was marked by heart-wrenching loss. At least nine funerals and wakes were held Wednesday for those who died when gunman Adam Lanza, armed with a military-style assault rifle, broke into the school Friday and opened fire on their classrooms. Lanza killed his mother at her home before the attack and committed suicide at the school as police closed in.","Shooting occurred on August 10, 1999 at Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles, California by mentally-ill white supremacist .
