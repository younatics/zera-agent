"The Bahrain Grand Prix was a tough battle. On one hand it was extremely exciting during the race – some of the best racing that I have been part of in a long, long time – but then afterwards, I was disappointed because I don't like coming second, especially not to my team-mate! However, there was a small part of me which remained proud because I started to understand what a great show we had put on, and that I had managed to contribute to that show, thus elevating my sport – the sport of Formula One into people's awareness, and boosting its popularity. That is important to me because I want F1 to be the most exciting sport in the world. The disappointment of coming second was the overriding factor, however. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Hamilton takes you round the Shanghai circuit in F1 simulator . In the thick of the action: Nico Rosberg (left) and Lewis Hamilton battle for the lead of the Bahrain Grand Prix . Paddock battle: Rosberg and Hamilton enjoy a playful ruck in the immediate aftermath of the memorable race . During the race you would have heard me communicate to my team about a battle with Lewis Hamilton, where I said his driving was 'not on', because I thought in one particular battle he was over the limit. But it wasn't a big issue, that´s racing and we have special emotions during a race. Sometimes you shout in your helmet. But the important thing is that it has since been discussed. We went through everything as a team on Thursday afternoon, here in Shanghai, and that's what we do always; it's not just because of what happened in Bahrain. We always discuss these sort of things as a team because it is important that we put it behind us and move forward as a team and that is exactly what we have done. So, the exciting Bahrain weekend is now behind us, and we move on full speed, keep racing and going flat out which is great, and it is fantastic and I am thankful to Mercedes that they let us race like that. It is great for the sport, great for us drivers, and great for everybody – even though Mercedes are taking a risk by doing that because it increases the chance that we have a collision. I think my rivalry with Lewis is great. If we can keep it up and have battles like we did in Bahrain then it is exciting for us and exciting for the sport, so it is something I see in a positive light as long as I come out on top next time! I was the quicker guy in Bahrain, so that was a real positive and I must keep the momentum going and the win will come, so it is all about making the most of the speed we have at the moment. Second best: Rosberg admits he was 'disappointed' to finish behind team-mate Hamilton at the Bahrain race . Coming to China, I have some great memories here, winning my first Formula One race two years ago, and the first for the Silver Arrows in the new era – 57 years after Mercedes' last victory as a works team. It was a special moment that day, and to win my first race was also great. I've had some good races at the Shanghai International Circuit – it is a track that I enjoy coming to. It is a unique track because where we normally destroy the rear tyres, here we destroy the front tyres instead, so you have to adapt completely with a different set-up and knowing what to expect, so it requires a lot of change which is unusual and provides us with a challenge. In saying that, I expect us to be the dominating force here because we are very quick at the moment and I don't expect anybody to close the gap from Bahrain to here. I see it as a straight fight between myself and Lewis for the win in Shanghai, but let's take it step-by-step. This year will be a development race. Red Bull is still the benchmark in the sport and they can develop . rapidly, but definitely at the moment we are dominating and I am . expecting another straight fight with my team-mate this weekend. I've done it: The German celebrates his first victory in Formula One at the 2012 Chinese Grand Prix . In demand: Rosberg signs autographs for enthusiastic fans at the Shanghai International Circuit on Thursday . All smiles: MailOnline's columnist poses for the cameras before being collared by yet more fans in the paddock . The long straights come to our advantage in Shanghai; the Mercedes power unit is the strongest in F1 at the moment and the most efficient – Mercedes have done an awesome job with that, and our car, too. It is looking good aerodynamically and weight wise, we have got the weight under control, so when all of that comes together we have got a great package. I am looking forward to the weekend and to keep on maximising what I have and trying to make the most of it because I am here to win and I have a chance to win. That really is a big boost, and provides us with great momentum within the team. I am proud to be a part of this momentum. I have been here since day one – from 2010 – day one of the Mercedes project of the new era – and I have been through the tough times and the struggles, but now we are finally reaping the benefits of all the hard work over the years, the restructuring, all the improvements that we have made as a team – so I have to make the most of it and really enjoy the moment.

"We have enjoyed an exciting few weeks, and are already getting ready for the third round of the championship at this Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix. We have had a long trip away from home, obviously, but it has been great and the momentum we have right now is awesome. As a team we have won the first two races in Australia and Malaysia, we have such a fast car and everything has worked out so well. I am leading the championship at the moment, and Mercedes are ahead in the constructors' championship too, which is definitely a good place to be. Welcome to Bahrain: MailOnline columnist Nico Rosberg in the paddock ahead of this weekend's race . 1. N. Rosberg . 43 . 2. L. Hamilton . 25 . 3. F. Alonso . 24 . 4. J. Button . 23 . 5. K. Magnussen . 20 . 6. N. Hulkenberg . 18 . The last race in Sepang was a special grand prix for us because of our relationship with Malaysian company Petronas. It worked out fantastically. It was a very, very historic event for us as a team, too. The last 1-2 by a Mercedes outfit was in 1955 when Juan Manuel Fangio led home Italian driver Piero Taruffi in Monza, so to achieve our own 1-2 finish was brilliant and to celebrate it with everybody was great. It was a special day for the Malaysian people, too. They have had such a tough time of it in recent weeks so to give them such a result in the world of racing where their own company Petronas did such a fantastic job was awesome. They have helped us become a real force in Formula One, so it was really nice to give something back to the Malaysian people. Sparring partner: Rosberg celebrates with Lewis Hamilton after Mercedes sealed a 1-2 finish in Sepang . Team game: Hamilton and Rosberg claimed Mercedes' first 1-2 in almost 60 years at last Sunday's grand prix . Champagne moment: Hamilton and Rosberg on the podium in Sepang . The feedback was great from them, too. Our 1-2 gave them a moment of relief and happiness after such a difficult period. On Sunday night we celebrated with Petronas right next to the iconic Twin Towers. It was a great evening with all the Petronas representatives, the team and Lewis and I. It was a really nice get-together. Of course in all this happiness, I . would have preferred to have come first myself because, like any driver, . I don't like coming second. Indeed there was a part of me which didn't . feel over the moon, but in the end I quickly got over that because it is . racing and I have to understand that I am not going to win every race. As . long as I keep racking up the points, when I don't have a fantastic . day, then that is what is important. I have to accept that and learn . from it. I have been . working with the team to discover what didn't go so well in Malaysia and . we have a very good understanding of that – part of it is just down to . me, I can do things differently as a driver, but I don't want to go into . specific detail - and part of it . is other things. We needed to go through it, but now I am raring to get . going in Bahrain and I am ready to turn it around on Sunday, and that . is what it is all about. We . don't need a reminder of how good Red Bull are because we know how good . they can be – they are the benchmark for us in the sport. It is to be expected that they are going to be strong, and they displayed that in Malaysia. That said, they have performed a very, very, impressive turnaround, and we must take our hats off to them. If you remember, four weeks ago when we were in Bahrain for pre-season testing, they were absolutely nowhere. Had there been a race, we would have lapped them twice! Road to recovery: Sebastian Vettel finished third in Malaysia to earn his first podium finish of the season . Thumbs up: Vettel and Red Bull have recovered after a tough pre-season in which they were short on pace . But in a fortnight they have turned . it around and they were running in a very strong third place at the . Malaysian Grand Prix with Sebastian Vettel, so it just proves that they . are the benchmark team and we need to keep on pushing. There is no room to slack off because . Red Bull are right there so it is important to keep on making the most . of it now whilst we still have a big advantage and keep pushing so we . maintain the advantage that we have. In action: Rosberg finished second ahead of Vettel in Malaysia - and warned there is 'no room to slack off' The racing itself has been pretty much the same this year despite the upheaval in regulations. The fuel saving has been over-hyped and there is actually not much of that to do than is different to previous seasons. The tyres are very much the same as last year – we did three stops in Malaysia like last season - so it is all quite similar. I lost four litres of water during the race in Malaysia so it was important to recover. After the race it is integral to drink a lot and relax. I also had a massage to get the circulation going so the body can recover quicker itself and then easy sports because it is all about recovery and getting the blood circulation going. Increased blood flow helps the body heal quicker as well as sleeping a lot and relaxing. I had time off between the last race and here in Bahrain so I didn't do too many demanding things.  Landing in Bahrain, I have had to adapt to the huge time zone difference. From Malaysia to here there is a difference of four hours, and on top of that we have the first night race in Bahrain's Formula One history so I don't have to be at the track until 2pm local time, but we will work right through until midnight. So, that makes the time difference feel even bigger and I am trying to get used to that. Bahrain feels like my second home because I have been here so often recently. Of course we had two pre-season tests, but I was also in Bahrain for the Pirelli tyre test in December. It is a track that suits our car so I expect us to be very strong here. It is an engine circuit and I believe our Mercedes power unit is leading the way, so I am really looking forward to it. Feeling right at home: Rosberg, who leads the drivers' standings, strolls the Bahrain paddock on Thursday . Inside my Mercedes cockpit, I have 38 different controls on my steering wheel which is like a spaceship control pad. It is really incredible. It has been difficult in the winter to get used to everything but that is why the simulator is so helpful because you can do laps and laps and understand the technology. Now it is subconscious and I know where everything is, and I know what I have to do. If you were to drive my car in the simulator you would think it is incredible because there are so many functions on the steering wheel and so much to do. It really is a quite complicated thing nowadays. It is not just about driving flat out. You have to use your head to get round all of the buttons and switches and figure out the best way to use them.

"Sportsmail brings you the second column from Formula One star Nico Rosberg. The Mercedes driver looks back at his victory in Australia and ahead to this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix. My victory at the Australian Grand Prix was a special moment for the team. For us all to be together – and I was with my fiancée Vivian, too – it was great. But we didn't really celebrate too much because it should only be the beginning. We swiftly turned our attention and focus to the next race here in Malaysia, which shows that maturity is a huge strength within the team. In fact 'mature' is probably the best word to describe us at the moment. We have grown as a team and our time will come very, very soon where we will be winning more races – already to have success is a huge thing for us. Cheer we go: Nico Rosberg celebrates his victory at the Australian Grand Prix, and right, with fiancée Vivian . All smiles: Rosberg and his Mercedes team pose for a celebratory picture following the Australian Grand Prix . After the race, I went to Bali on holiday with my fiancée and some friends, which was very nice, but throughout the trip, I remained in close contact with the team because there was so much that we learned from Melbourne, and subsequently there was so much information to go through – even while I was on holiday! Despite winning by almost 25 seconds, my victory in Australia was not as straightforward as it appeared. There were various issues that we had to deal with. The tyres, for example, were right on the edge of being too cold, so I had to keep the pace up all the time to ensure they stayed at the right temperature. Of course, pre-season testing had gone well so we expected to look good in Australia, but to have such an advantage was still a surprise. Understandably, I was very happy with that. Getting the job done: Rosberg leads the drivers' standings after romping to victory at the Australian Grand Prix . I'll drink to that: Rosberg toasts with Daniel Ricciardo - the Red Bull man was later disqualified from the race . In Melbourne, we had the fastest car, but we must be careful because Malaysia is a totally different story, so we must keep an open mind. However, it is possible that we can do really well here, too. Daniel Ricciardo was disqualified from . the Australian Grand Prix. I don't wish to comment on the details because I don't have all the information, but it was definitely a big pity . because he is Australian and to have an Aussie on the podium was a great . thing for the home crowd. There have been lots of comments about the new sound of Formula One. The thing with this sport is that we always tend to focus on the negatives, but there are so many more positives this year. The power units are much more contemporary and fuel efficient. The pack has also been shuffled around so there isn't always the same winner and that is very good for Formula One. I can understand people's views about the noise. It isn't the same as with the V8 engines, but let's focus on the positives. We are going to have some good racing for sure, and the cars are really exciting to drive and watch, from what I saw after the race. We shouldn’t rush into anything but take our time and see how things unfold over the next races. I have been in Kuala Lumpur since Sunday. Petronas are the team's biggest partner, so I have been representing them and doing a lot of PR. We have done a lot of interesting things, like diving with sharks for instance, and it is great to do different activities, but the main thing is the Malaysian people are backing us and they are really enthusiastic about our team which is excellent to see. Before and after: The Mercedes driver spent time at an aquarium in Malaysia where he dived with sharks . It has obviously been a very difficult week for Malaysia with the focus on the tragic events of flight MH370, and my thoughts and sympathies go to all the families and friends who have been affected. I only hope that, with the race this weekend, we can help to focus a more positive light on Malaysia and its wonderful people. The Malaysian Grand Prix is one of the toughest on the calendar because of the intense heat and humidity, so you have to be very fit. I try and acclimatise to the conditions by staying outside as much as possible and doing sport outdoors. It is vital to stay hydrated, too. In fact, I am drinking right now because during the race I can sweat up to four litres which is massive and probably double the amount of a regular race. The race will be very demanding. By the end of the grand prix, your concentration levels will not be as high as they were at the beginning nor my fitness which will have reduced, too. No hard feelings: Lewis Hamilton (left) and Rosberg shake hands after last year's Malaysian Grand Prix . At last year's Malaysian Grand Prix, I was asked to 'hold station' behind my team-mate Lewis Hamilton, but I don't want to go into that because it is history. What I can say is that this year we will give you some exciting racing because that is what Mercedes is here to do. We want to entertain and put on a good show. At the same time there will be circumstances where we as drivers have to put the team first, and they have already been discussed so everything is clear. Closed chapter: Rosberg says his incident with Hamilton at last year's race has been consigned to history . Bayern Munich won the Bundesliga title earlier this week which is an amazing achievement. I am very happy about it. They were rewarded with the Laureus Team of the Year award on Wednesday night which was great to see because they fully deserve it. I was at the ceremony because it was held here in Kuala Lumpur, and I am an ambassador, so it was nice to be there. We face Manchester United in the Champions League next week which could be very exciting. United aren't at the top of their game at the moment so hopefully we will beat them, and I am confident that we can.

"Sportsmail launches the first column from F1 star Nico Rosberg ahead of the new season. The Mercedes man will bring you his latest views ahead of each race during the campaign. Firstly, let me begin by saying, it is great to be a columnist for MailOnline and I look forward to you joining me on my trip around the Formula One world this season. I hope you enjoy my work, and please give me some feedback on Twitter. Ahead of the first race, and even before we got to pre-season testing, the main thing I had to do was lose weight over the winter because the cars are so much on the limit this year. I had to go through a strict diet programme. It is tough because it is easy to just diet, but if I need to diet and become really fit through physical training, it becomes quite difficult. I haven't had any sugar for months now, and at first it was tough. Raring to go: Nico Rosberg will start the Formula One season among the favourites to win the championship . On track: The Mercedes car is expected to set the pace this season following a promising winter of testing . The new weight regulation is just one in a huge overhaul of the sport's rules this season, and there are two sides to the new regulations. It is good the sport has gone to more efficient energy, for example, as it is important to follow the direction of the rest of the world. At the same time however, the cars are slower, which I don't like. As a driver you want to go faster and faster, but this year we are slower and that is a bit of a pity. To drive, they are quite similar to previous years but what is different is the new technology. There is so much that we have had to get used to and it is complicated. The whole steering wheel, for instance, is custom made. I now have a smart phone display on the steering wheel and I was also able to put the buttons wherever I wanted, so that was already a complicated process in itself. The team helped me a lot, but it has been time consuming to get it right. In the spotlight: Rosberg admits he had to lose weight over the winter, sticking to a strict diet programme . New challenge: The 28-year-old says this year's cars are slower and more complicated than previous seasons . I am hoping that we will be towards the front in Melbourne, but where we are going to be exactly, I don't know. We must remember that reliability is on the edge for every team at the moment. It is going to be so tough just to get to the end of the race. The team have worked incredibly hard. They have been pulling all-nighters since the last test in Bahrain trying to fix the final bits and pieces. I was in the factory last week, and on Thursday, at 9.30 in the evening, they were still flat out. That was in the engine department where they were still trying to produce some extra bits because the next morning the engines had to fly out to Australia. They spent the night building them so they could make the deadline, so it is really, really on the edge. A lot of cars won't make it to the end of the race and there are going to be a lot of reliability problems. If it is too much it won't be good for the sport but it shows that everyone is on the limit and that is part of Formula One - it always has been. Claim: Red Bull team principal Christian Horner (right) said that Mercedes could win Sunday's race by two laps . At the first pre-season test in Jerez you couldn't really determine anything but in Bahrain you got a better gauge of where everyone was, and it became clear that we had a good car and were in a decent position. It is early days, and we have to remember last year that we were in a strong position after testing but in the races we weren't as good as we hoped. We need to be cautious, but we are optimistic. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has said we will win the opening race by two laps, but I would will be very careful about Christian's assessment. Never underestimate Red Bull or the others. On Red Bull, it is always a surprise if they don't waltz away with the victory because we have become so used to that from previous years. It is too early to say that is not going to happen here because they have surprised everybody before so we have to be very careful. Red Bull is Red Bull, and they are the benchmark and the best team, so we assume that they are going to be the benchmark again, but if not, then great. However, we are focused on ourselves and making sure we get the best out of what we have. What others do is not really in our control. I know I start among the title favourites but do I feel extra pressure this season? No, not really. The opposite, in fact. The whole experience becomes even more enjoyable if the car is quick, and then the hope of having real success and sharing that with the team. Partners: Lewis Hamilton and team-mate Rosberg are expected to go toe-to-toe for this year's championship . Hot topic: David Coulthard allowed Mika Hakkinen past to claim victory at the season-opening race in Australia . Back at the 1998 Australian Grand Prix, McLaren drivers Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard had a deal in place in whichever driver got to the opening corner first would be allowed to win the race, but I wouldn't like that, and I don't think the team would either, so we are going to try and avoid such measures. Lewis Hamilton and I have always been competing, even for championships, as far back as our karting days, so it won't be an unusual situation if that happens this year, and I am confident we will be able to handle it. It will be tough at times - that is normal - but we just need to keep on working it out. We still get on well, so that is a good thing. On my former Mercedes team-mate Michael Schumacher, I wish him a strong recovery after his skiing accident in December. I am hoping for the best and also wishing his family strength. I am a big Bayern Munich fan. Unfortunately I missed their match against Arsenal on Tuesday, but I was very pleased they went through. They are an amazing team at the moment. It is so tough to win the Champions League because you also need a lot of luck. Skill wise they can do it, but they need the luck as well to win it for a second time.

"A last-ditch bid to get Marussia to the final grand prix of the season in Abu Dhabi this weekend has fallen at the final hurdle. Just under two weeks ago administrators working on behalf of the team confirmed the Banbury-based marque had ceased trading with the loss of 200 jobs. Behind the scenes since then talks have been ongoing with a number of potential investors in the hope Marussia could at least take their place on the grid at the Yas Marina circuit. A last-ditch bid to get Marussia to the final grand prix of the season in Abu Dhabi this weekend has failed . Negotiations with one particular buyer appeared hopeful, to such an extent a contingency plan was put in place that would have resulted in the team flying out on Wednesday night. In the paddock at the track, a handful of Ferrari engineers - given the team are powered by the famous Maranello marque - were spotted wearing Marussia kit. It is also understood Williams and another financially-troubled team in Caterham were asked to move items out of garage space reserved for Marussia believing it would be vacant. One insider told Press Association Sport: “The talks were serious enough, and a serious offer was made that led to the need to make preparations. Marussia driver Max Chilton has finally broken his silence on his F1 team's demise . “For the last 72 hours there has been very little sleep, with people talking all through the night. “This morning it was serious enough that some action plans were put in place, and we were hoping to get over the line. “Sadly, it hasn’t happened. By 5.30-6pm it was game over.” Even if, by some miracle, the bid is resurrected overnight, it is now too late for Marussia to take part in the event that commences Friday with the two 90-minute practice sessions. The Britsh driver took to his Twitter account to express his disappointment . The big question now is whether anything can be salvaged to aid the team’s cause for next season, albeit with a significant financial injection of at least £30million required. It is understood administrator FRP Advisory are to issue a statement on Thursday clarifying the situation. Breaking his silence for the first time since it was announced Marussia had gone out of business, via his Twitter feed driver Max Chilton said: 'Devastated for everyone involved at Marussia in the past 24 hours that the hard work trying to get to Abu Dhabi didn’t work out as we hoped.'","The Banbury-based marque had ceased trading with the loss of 200 jobs .

Bianchi was hurt when his Marussia collided with a recovery vehicle that was removing the Sauber of Adrian Sutil, who had spun off the track and into a tyre one lap previously. The crash occurred under double yellow waved flags, in poor weather and in fading light. Following an investigation into the cause of the crash, FIA race director Charlie Whiting concluded there was 'a perfect storm; of conditions. Although the FIA is due to bring in new safety measures following the incident, Whiting further stated with regard to the incident 'nothing could have been done better'. The Marussia team still displayed Bianchi's named above their garage at the Russian Grand Prix in October . 'The parents of Jules Bianchi, Philippe and Christine, would like to provide the following information regarding Jules' medical care, by way of an update to the media and his fans. 'Almost seven weeks after Jules' accident at Suzuka Circuit, and following a challenging period of neurological intensive care, we are able to announce that Jules has made an important step. 'Jules is no longer in the artificial coma in which he was placed shortly after the accident, however he is still unconscious. He is breathing unaided and his vital signs are stable, but his condition is still classified as 'critical'. His treatment now enters a new phase concerned with the improvement of his brain function. 'Jules' neurological condition remains stable. Although the situation continues to be serious, and may remain so, it was decided that Jules was sufficiently stable to be repatriated to his native France. We are relieved, therefore, to confirm that Jules was transferred aeromedically last night from the Mie Prefectural General Medical Center in Yokkaichi, Japan, to Le Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice (CHU), where he arrived just a short time ago. Jules is now in the intensive care unit of Professors Raucoules and Ichai, where his care will also be monitored by Professor Paquis, Head of Neurosurgery Service. 'We are thankful that the next phase of Jules' treatment can continue close to home, where he can be surrounded and supported by his wider family and friends. We have nothing but praise for the outstanding care provided by the Mie Prefectural General Medical Center since the accident. We owe the medical staff there an enormous debt of gratitude for everything they have done for Jules, and also for our family, during what is a very difficult time for us. In particular, we would like to extend our thanks to Doctors Kamei and Yamamichi, and also to Mr Ogura, all part of the team of personnel caring for Jules in Japan.'","Frenchman Jules Bianchi is out of his artificial coma in a Nice hospital .

"A revolutionary new concept developed by Lewis Hamilton's father is to be put through its paces  in Abu Dhabi. Dubbed 'Info Wing', the LED display system sits on top of the air intake above the driver's head and primarily provides race-position data. Using information supplied by race control, data can also be displayed as to who has set the fastest lap, tyre strategy and flag condition via multiple colours. The LED system, designed by F1 driver Lewis Hamilton's father, sits on top of the air intake section of the car . The wing can display a variety of messages as well as transmitting race positional data back to the pit lane . The FIA is to initially test the Info Wing on the safety car during its assessment runs of the Yas Marina circuit, either on Thursday or Friday. Force India will run a further test of the unit on top of their car next Tuesday on the first day of a two-day test that follows Sunday's season-ending grand prix. Anthony Hamilton said: 'The test is to decide whether the unit is practical for F1 and single seaters. 'Also, whether the LED display can be seen from the grandstands, and whether it works for the TV audience. 'The idea behind the system is to provide race-position data plus other race information to the viewing public. 'One of the major problems with watching race cars is knowing who is where and who is who without having to take your eyes off the action to find and locate the information on a hand-held device, or one of the circuit monitors. The new system is set to be tested by Force India following the season-ending Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi . Anthony Hamilton (left) with his son Lewis after his success in the Italian Grand Prix in Monza . 'By the time you have found the information the car has gone past and you're no better off, and having missed the action as well. 'It might not work. We might not be able to see the LEDs in the bright sunlight, but it is the concept I hope could be of interest. 'It might require further work on the intensity of the LEDs, but I believe this has the potential to make a huge impact on the viewing of races and tests, making it more informative and enjoyable. 'Hopefully it could bring new fans to the sport, and old fans back as well.' Patent pending, the MkII prototype will run in Abu Dhabi, with a MkIII version currently in development. That design incorporates a new-shaped camera mount and a double-LED display that incorporates not only race-position data, but also the first three letters of a driver's surname. Anthony Hamilton is also developing a version for DTM (German touring cars), Indy Cars, NASCAR, karting and motor bikes.","Anthony Hamilton has designed an 'info wing' for Formula One cars .

"Brendan Rodgers has described the collapse of Loic Remy’s move as “unfortunate” but insisted Liverpool will be sticking by their decision. Liverpool had agreed personal terms after triggering a move with £8.5million bid for the France international and had even allocated a squad number for him but, at the last minute, they were forced to pull up stumps on the deal. The club have not given a specific reason over why they have chosen such a course of action but Rodgers, speaking after Liverpool had beaten Olympiacos 1-0 at Soldier Field in Chicago, offered his opinion and insisted his sympathies were with Remy. Scroll down for video . No deal: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, seen here at the end of his team's 1-0 win over Olympiacos in Chicago on Sunday night, described the collapse of an £8.5m move for Loic Remy as 'unfortunate' It's off: Loic Remy was unable to complete his move to Anfield but the club have not yet explained why it fell through . VIDEO Remy deal collapses . He said: ‘It's very simple we have made a decision as a club not to go ahead with the deal. It's unfortunate for the player. We are disappointed for the player but there’s nothing more to be said and we will move on and look at other targets.’ If the news about Remy was difficult to take, Rodgers did have a boost on Sunday when Dejan Lovren’s £20million switch from Southampton was confirmed and the manager is hoping Lovren will fill the void in his back four that has been there since Jamie Carragher retired in May 2013. Rodgers said: ‘He's right footed so he can play on the right but he prefers to play on the left. It will depend what needs must. The Important thing is that we have got the player and we will use him where we feel he needs to be. He’s a player who can still improve. Match winner: Raheem Sterling settled Liverpool's International Champions Cup match with Olympiacos after five minutes . Confirmed: Rodgers was boosted by the completion of Dejan Lovren's £20m move from Southampton . ‘I think Dejan is a really commanding central defender. I said since we lost Jamie Carragher we needed that leadership and he's a player who will gives us that. He's strong and can play. I was impressed by him when he was at Lyon and he was a big driving force for Southampton.’ Lovren will join up on Liverpool’s United States tour either in New York or Charlotte after agreeing a five-year contract and Rodgers believes his squad is now taking shape – and he is no longer mourning the sale of Luis Suarez. ‘I’m really pleased with how it's all coming along,’ said Rodgers, who should see Divock Origi become a Liverpool player in the next 24 hours, having agreed a £10million deal with Lille. ‘Our World Cup players have just come back. Nearly done: Liverpool are close to finalising a £10m deal for Lille and Belgium striker Divock Origi . Meet and greet: Rodgers signs autographs for some of Liverpool's American-based fans as they played Olympiacos in Chicago . ‘We have only just been together as a squad over the last week or so. I know the group well and I know those coming in will fit what we're trying to do. When the Southampton game (at Anfield on August 17) comes up, we will be ready for that.' Of the performance against Olympiakos, Rodgers added: ‘I was delighted with the team. As pre-season goes well, we will be getting sharper in our movements and passing but, at this time, we are building up the resistance of players and getting minutes under the belt. ‘In the first half, our passing was crisp and precise. We looked real threat at top end of the field. I was also very pleased with how we defended. We are in good shape and I am delighted.’","QPR striker Remy had agreed personal terms at Anfield but the club pulled the plug on the deal .

"Niki Lauda has only one message for Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg before their world-championship decider in Abu Dhabi — race any way you like. The Mercedes team chairman drew on all his experience as a triple world champion to tell Sportsmail: ‘I will give them no orders whatsoever. Only the two guys can figure out how best to proceed. It is sensible to leave them to it.’ Hamilton and Rosberg clashed at Spa in August when the Briton refused to yield to his former karting partner’s gung-ho move early in the race. Lewis Hamilton (left) and Nico Rosberg face off in their world-championship decider in Abu Dhabi on Sunday . Debris flies in the air as Rosberg (right) clashes with Hamilton at the Belgian Grand Prix in August . Hamilton (left) currently leads Rosberg by 17 points in the F1 standings . Rosberg — harshly in the opinion of most observers — was publicly reprimanded by the team for his part in what the stewards deemed to be no more than a ‘racing incident’. ‘We told them after Spa not to crash into one another, and nothing bad has happened since,’ said Lauda. ‘But this is the final race. Lewis leads by 17 points. They both want the world championship so interference from me would make no sense. They both know the possible danger to their own car if they get involved with each other. That is all they need to know.’ One issue that is scheduled for discussion within 48 hours of Sunday’s finish is Hamilton’s contract. He is signed to Mercedes for next year but no further. Niki Lauda (right) celebrates another Mercedes victory with his dream pairing in October . ‘I have heard stories that Lewis wanted to sign for Ferrari, but that is absolutely wrong,’ said Lauda. ‘Toto (Wolff, who is in day-to-day charge of Mercedes) and I have a very good relationship with Lewis. ‘Lewis requested we leave the contract talk until the season was over. He wanted to concentrate on his racing. We had exactly the same opinion. He will stay regardless of whether he wins or loses on Sunday.’ But who will deal with the contract minutiae for Hamilton is unclear since his recent split from XIX, Simon Fuller’s management stable. Yet he remains on good terms with Fuller and has retained a few of the mogul’s staff — at least until he decides who he wants to represent him in future. Hamilton’s long-time lawyer Sue Thackeray, seen as a power behind the throne, will no doubt have an important role but his father, Anthony, remains another significant influence. How does Lauda evaluate his two drivers? ‘From a speed point of view they are the same. Only thousandths of seconds can separate them. Nico is hard-working. He looks at every detail and sorts everything out. Lewis is a very aggressive talent. He can overtake like nobody else. 'The reason they are so successful is that they develop the car in the same direction. To me they are both world champions, but after Abu Dhabi only one of them will be.’ McLaren announced last night they will not decide until ‘a date no earlier than December 1’ which driver to pair with Fernando Alonso next season. That means Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen are possibly in a shoot-out in Abu Dhabi, despite chairman Ron Dennis having promised a decision before the end of the season and sources categorically saying that Magnussen would get the seat.","Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg face off in their world-championship decider in Abu Dhabi on Sunday .

"Brendan Rodgers has defended his £23.6million investment in Adam Lallana and insisted Liverpool have not paid over the odds for the England midfielder. Lallana officially started his Liverpool career this week here in Boston and has made an immediate impression on the training pitches at Harvard University with his slick use of the ball and willingness to embrace hard work. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Liverpool signing Markovic scoring sublime goal for Benfica . Right choice: Rodgers has stood by his decision to splash the cash on Saints star Adam Lallana . All smiles: Brendan Rodgers says he is pleased with new signings Lazar Markovic and Adam Lallana . Rodgers is thrilled with how quickly . the 26-year-old has settled down and, having put such an emphasis on . signing Lallana from Southampton, is adamant he will make a difference . as Liverpool aim to build on last season’s promise and progress without . Luis Suarez. Yet, for all . that, the size of Lallana’s fee has been scrutinised, not least because . Real Madrid only paid £1m more to take World Cup winner Toni Kroos from . Bayern Munich; Rodgers, however, believes Lallana will prove he has . value, maintaining Liverpool were not held to ransom in negotiations. ‘For . British players across the board there is always that premium and the . value is always pushed up,’ said Rodgers, whose side played the first . game of their American tour against Roma in the early hours of this . morning. ‘We paid what we thought he was worth and would not go higher. ‘Listen, . I spoke to enough people about him and have seen enough of him, and . know enough people who had seen him and played with him to know he would . be a great signing for us. I have no qualms about it. He is a great . boy. Bright future: Rodgers (left) describes £20million signing Markovic (right) as an 'exciting talent' at Liverpool . ‘The types of players . we bring in will have the profile of what we want, so the transition . should be smooth.

Such . a major outlay invites pressure yet that does not unsettle Rodgers. He . argues his spending has been responsible and explains there is a plan to . what Liverpool have done; some fans on Merseyside have clamoured for . him to sign a ‘big’ name but he isn’t a manager who will spend for the . sake of it. ‘I have always . said at every club I’ve been at, the club’s money is my money,’ said .

"The next 30 minutes are going to be a challenge for Steven Gerrard. From the moment he walks into a meeting room at Liverpool’s plush hotel, he knows where the conversation will head. As soon as he puts his phone and wash bag on the floor and settles into a chair, he knows it will be  necessary to revisit the events of April 27. That, of course, was the day Liverpool’s exhilarating surge to win a first league title since 1990 came asunder; the day the fates conspired against him. Scroll down for videos . Perspective: Steven Gerrard admits he has suffered the 'worst three months of his life' after Liverpool's Premier League failure and England's miserable World Cup performances . Costly: Gerrard's untimely slip which allowed Chelsea striker Demba Ba through to score at Anfield was a deciding factor in Manchester City beating Liverpool to the Premier League title . Fine margins: Gerrard had been inspiration in lifting Liverpool to a position to challenge for the title, only to see their bid fall apart at the end . More misery: Gerrard breaks down in tears after England are eliminated from the World Cup at the group stage . He had set himself to control a ball from Mamadou Sakho when he slipped and Chelsea striker Demba Ba sped away. Thousands of dreams died as Chelsea won 2-0. With some players, reopening old wounds would be strictly off limits but Gerrard is different. He has never shied away from the difficult subjects and, even though this is particularly painful, he is not about to start now. So how was it after Chelsea? ‘You are a brave man asking this question,’ comes the reply, his eyes narrowing. ‘How do you think it was? You tell me.’ The worst day of your life? ‘There’s your answer.’ Body on the line: Gerrard moves to block a shot from Olympiacos player Ionnis Maniatis during Liverpool's International Champions' Cup match in Chicago . Still the main man: Gerrard salutes the crowd at Soldier Field after Liverpool's 1-0 win over Olympiacos on Sunday . VIDEO Liverpool everything to Gerrard - Rodgers . Once the issue is broached, Gerrard opens up. Few people in football speak with such searing honesty and, in some ways, this is cathartic. It has been a demanding, draining period in his professional life but speaking about it now can bring closure. ‘It was cruel,’ he says. ‘I haven’t lost my man at a set piece. I haven’t missed a penalty. I haven’t made a bad pass or a mistake. Every single person on the planet slips at some point in their life, whether it is on a set of stairs, on the floor or whatever. ‘For me, it happened on the pitch at a really bad moment. But, you know, over the course of 38 games, a lot happens for you and against you and that determines whether you win the league or not. But that happened at a really crucial time and I have to face that. ‘Football isn’t always going to be celebrations, highs and winning things and stuff like that. When you’re fighting for things at this level there are always going to be heartbreaks and disappointments and the last three months have been a massive disappointment, probably the worst of my life. ‘When you’re captain of this team, you can’t afford to feel sorry for yourself or mope around. Everyone in this group looks to me to see what sort of mood I’m in; to see how I am behaving round the place moving forward so I have to shake it off pretty quick. ‘And I will do. But I have to use it as a positive to drive me on. At 34 there is no possible way I am going to let the last three months be the things I remember moving forward. It’s important it finishes on a high.’ We go again: Liverpool's preparations for the forthcoming season are well underway, with Raheem Sterling (second left) congratulated after scoring the winner against Olympiacos . Close bond: Gerrard will be deployed as a 'quarterback' by manager Brendan Rodgers this season . As that moment was so dramatic, it has obscured how much Gerrard actually did to get Liverpool in a position to challenge Manchester City. His performances after he returned from a hamstring injury in January were exemplary, arguably as good as at any point during his stellar career. He contributed 13 of Liverpool’s 101 Premier League goals, created another 15 and thrived in the deep-lying role Brendan Rodgers created for him. Rodgers has been raving on this tour of America how Gerrard will be his ‘quarterback’ and advancing years are no barrier to his importance. There is, clearly, a bond between the captain and his manager and Rodgers was responsible for  providing the crucial advice when he came to make a decision about his England career. Though he still feels he could influence Roy Hodgson’s team, ending his 114-cap career after the World Cup felt right. He and Liverpool will now reap the benefits and it will also allow him to spend time with his girls — wife Alex and their three daughters: Lilly-Ella, Lexie and Lourdes. Patriot: Gerrard decided to retire from international football after winning 114 caps for England over the space of 14 years . Repeat performance? Liverpool will hope to once again challenge for the title as they did last season. Here, Philippe Coutinho is pictured celebrating his goal in the 3-2 win over Manchester City at Anfield . ‘You sort of feel like you are lying to them all the time,’ Gerrard explains. ‘It’s difficult to say to them you are going away for four to six weeks. So you kind of lie and say you will only be gone a couple of weeks, then they are on the phone and on Facetime saying they want you home. ‘It does become difficult being away. I’ve done it for 14 years. I had to be fair to my family but also to Liverpool as well. To be fair to Brendan, when I had the chat with him, he said that if you want to carry on for England I can tailor your Liverpool games. ‘When I had the chat with him I was close to already knowing what I was going to do. When he said that my Liverpool games could be tailored then it made me go to 100 per cent with my decision because I don’t want my Liverpool games to be tailored. ‘I still want to be available, I want to be fresh and play at a high level for Liverpool for certainly one more season. We will have to wait and see if there are any more after that. I don’t feel like a weight has been lifted because I never saw it as a burden. New recruits: Liverpool moved quickly to sign Southampton's Adam Lallana for £25m prior to the World Cup . Injury blow: Emre Can arrived from Bayer Leverkusen for a £10m fee but suffered an injury in the pre-season friendly at Preston North End . Reinforcements: Lazar Markovic has also been brought in from Benfica for £20m . Sign here please: Dejan Lovren became the third player to join from Southampton for £20m . ‘I used to love going down there, knowing I was going to be captain. Of course I’m going to feel fresher and benefit from not playing. ‘I don’t feel as if I could go to a tournament at 36 and be who I wanted to be. Everything was pointing towards calling it a day but I’m going to miss it.’ He will not, however, be dwelling on it as there are big challenges ahead and the words from another emotional moment in April will be in his mind. After Liverpool had beaten Manchester City, who they face tonight in a friendly here, Gerrard gathered his squad together. ‘We go again, exactly the same,’ he implored, demanding that focus be retained. He will say the same over the coming weeks as he starts to dream about finally getting his hands on the trophy he has coveted all his life. His faith in a squad that has lost Luis Suarez is unshakeable.

But I’ll keep going and I will go again. ‘We are a good team with a good manager, that is getting stronger.

"It took 36 minutes for the first email to arrive. As the shockwaves from Rio de Janeiro were still reverberating, bookmakers began pumping out their blunt messages. Assessing how much of an impact Luis Suarez's suspension would have on Liverpool's ambitions for the new Barclays Premier League campaign, the words in the subject box from odds compilers had no ambiguity. 'Reds pushed out for title glory,' they proclaimed. They were delivering a calculated summary of where Liverpool stand without Suarez: not credible contenders. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Suarez bite Chiellini and Bakkal while at Ajax in 2010 . Good times: Luis Suarez was the Premier League Player of the Year last season but Liverpool could now sell . Brendan Rodgers, Liverpool's ambitious manager, would rail against that view. When it has been put to him in the past that his side were over-reliant on Suarez, he could list statistics and highlights to show why it wasn't just about this maverick soul from Salto. He had a point, too. When Suarez served a 10-match ban for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic in April 2013, Liverpool won seven times in all competitions, drew two and lost one. They were not short of goals, either, particularly from Daniel Sturridge. The reality, however, is different. Suarez transforms Liverpool. His presence scrambles the minds of opponents, inspires those around him and last season he gave supporters that priceless belief that, no matter what, he would score and Liverpool would win. Do not underestimate his worth. Happy days: Suarez celebrates winning the golden boot with his daughter Delfina and wife Sofia . As it stands now, Suarez will miss the . first nine Premier League matches and in the corresponding fixtures last . year, his influence was enough to secure Rodgers 10 extra points - the . difference, effectively, between finishing second and fourth. Suarez brings out the best in Liverpool but what is best for Liverpool now should not include Suarez. That might sound contradictory, given what his 31 goals helped achieve in 2013-14, but if he remains on Merseyside while serving his ban, he will cast a heavy, uncomfortable cloud. Shame: The Uruguay forward has been banned for four months after biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup . Say he is still a Liverpool player in October. With some tricky assignments - such as trips to Manchester City and Spurs, as well as the Merseyside derby - Liverpool could find themselves outside the top four, particularly if their Champions League schedule is complicated. Questions to Rodgers then become about whether Liverpool can keep a player of his ability if they are not challenging for the honours he craves. Missing out: Suarez narrowly missed out on the title last season and could now be on his way to Barcelona . Put simply, Rodgers doesn't need it any more. The topic dominated last summer when Suarez was trying to engineer a move to Arsenal and Suarez's future was fast becoming an issue once more this month before his notoriety in Natal. Rodgers is trying to build Liverpool up into a position where they will not be one-season wonders; he wants the verve and the style and the winning sprees of last season's efforts to become normal. Having Suarez would obviously enhance their prospects but Suarez keeps letting Rodgers down. Tough times: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has been let down by Suarez . VIDEO Suarez hands Liverpool problem . Liverpool did everything they could to help Suarez last season, from letting him bring his newborn son, Benjamin, on to the pitch before a game last October to making him captain in Steven Gerrard's absence and ensuring Dr Steve Peters' counsel was available to him at all times. In the main, it worked, but these latest events show he  cannot be trusted. As Jamie Carragher said in Sportsmail on Thursday, controversy will be just around the corner, waiting to trip Liverpool up -  so now is the time for ruthlessness. If Rodgers is going to create a title-winning team, he needs reliability and stability as well as talent. He is not afraid to make big decisions - one of his first acts as Liverpool manager was to send £35million Andy Carroll out to West Ham on loan - but the biggest is looming. Challenge: Rodgers showed with Andy Carroll that he is willing to make big decisions . Privately Rodgers may feel Suarez has reached the point where he causes more harm than good. If that is the case, a deal with Barcelona - who have not been put off by events in Brazil - should be done and the money used to make Liverpool stronger. Should he be able to do that, life without Suarez need not be as bleak as the bookmakers forecast.","As it stands now, Suarez will miss the .

"Brendan Rodgers has signed a new long-term contract after Liverpool’s owners promised he will be given every help to make the club champions. Rodgers, who was named LMA Manager of the Year after he took Liverpool to within two points of the title last season, completed the formalities of signing a deal on Monday and the improved terms, which are believed to run to 2018, reflect his outstanding work. Personal gain, however, is not his motivation and the main crux of negotiations with Fenway Sports Group – who described Rodgers as a 'hugely talented individual' – stemmed around boosting a squad that will have the added demands next year of a Champions League campaign. Saint: Adam Lallana (centre) was one of the stand-out performers of the 2013-14 Premier League season . Positive: Despite missing out on the title last season was an excellent one for Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers . Liverpool have identified a number of targets, headed by Adam Lallana. Negotiations continue for the England midfielder, who has his heart set on a move to Anfield, but they are taking time because Southampton are looking to command £30milllion. Bayern Munich’s Xherdan Shaqiri is an alternative to Lallana, while Liverpool are working on a deal to sign Emre Can, the £12million-rated Germany Under 21 midfielder, who was at Bayer Leverkusen last season. Rodgers says FSG’s support heading into the transfer window is crucial. ‘I came . here because I felt that this is one of the biggest clubs in the world,’ he explained. ‘I want to be here as long as I can, hopefully . playing a part in building and restoring a club to its greatness. I . think we’ve really rediscovered the soul of Liverpool in particular this . season. Delighted: Rodgers said he was very happy to sign a new deal with Liverpool . International: Lallana (right) saw his good form rewarded with a place in England's World Cup squad . ‘So I’ve got absolutely no interest in being anywhere else. But I also needed to know it’s going to be right because I want to succeed. I want to win and I need to know that if I am going to be here I’m going to have the best possibility to win. ‘I need to know that this is an idea and a way of working that’s set up to win; it’s not just to look good. And I need to know that I can have players that can carry out the instructions that we want to work to win trophies. The owners have been great. They’re winners themselves. They want to win. ‘But we want to work it in a way that makes the club sustainable and I think we’ve clearly shown that it’s about the top quality but it’s also about being strategic in those signings as well, bringing in the right players. It’s key for me that I can speak to the owners like that.’ Available: Emre Can (centre) is important for Bayer Leverkusen but a release clause means he is available . Frustrated: Bayern Munich winger Xherdan Shaqiri (right) has found first team games hard to come by . Liverpool had difficulties attracting the players Rodgers had targeted 12 months ago – Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Diego Costa and Willian – because they were unable to offer Champions League football but he is convinced the forthcoming window will be different. ‘The best players want to play in the big competition,’ Rodgers said. ‘That’s the fight and I certainly found that last summer but we’ve put Liverpool back on the map now. Everyone sees that we’re going to be a threat; that we’re going to go into Europe next year and we’ll have no fear. ‘We need to pay attention in terms of the teams we’ll be playing against, but we’ll have no fear. That’s what top players want – they want to play in teams where they can show their talents.’ Crucial: Rodgers said it was vital that he had the support of the Liverpool board in the transfer market .","Rogers signed a new long-term deal with Liverpool on Monday .

"Brendan Rodgers will be a keen observer when the shootout between Liverpool’s guns starts in Sao Paolo. Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge have thrived under Rodgers’ guidance last season, scoring 51 goals in the Barclays Premier League, but there will be no love lost this evening when Uruguay and England attempt to save their World Cup dreams.

Suarez and Sturridge would not be classed as friends and they have regularly bickered on the pitch when one has taken on a shot rather than passing to the other. Rodgers has never described them as being a natural partnership, believing they are two forwards who have slotted into a system and he is intrigued to see which man will cope best with the high-pressure demands. ‘They’re both different,’ Rodgers explained. ‘They are two different players with two different sets of qualities. 'Luis has got a lot more experience (at international level). I’m just interested to see how Daniel copes. ‘I think the key with him is playing in the right position. He can play out of position in certain situations and certain games. The problem you have at that level is you don’t get a second chance. ‘He is best through the middle. Rooney is also best through the middle, maybe dropping in, so it’s looking at where his strengths are as a player. Suarez can play in a number of positions so it’ll be fascinating to see the two goalscorers.’ And is the rivalry between them healthy?

"Brendan Rogers insists Steven Gerrard will be in the perfect frame of mind to lead England at the World Cup after his season ended in crushing disappointment. Liverpool’s captain endured a draining few weeks as the race for the Barclays Premier League reached its climax, most notably when he slipped and gifted Chelsea a goal in the key game on April 27. Gerrard looked shattered after the final match against Newcastle, admitting he was “absolutely devastated” to miss out on the title and has been away this week, like the rest of Liverpool’s international players, to recharge. Dejected: Steven Gerrard was visibly upset after Liverpool's final game of the season last week . Resilient: Brendan Rodgers says his club captain will be in the right frame of mind to lead England . But Rodgers maintains no blame should be apportioned to Gerrard for Liverpool’s failure to fend off Manchester City and he is confident there will be no hangover in Gerrard’s performances when he starts playing in Brazil. ‘I’ve no concerns whatsoever about Steven,’ said Rodgers. 'I think Steven will go away and when he reflects on what has been personally a brilliant season of football, he has been very unfairly pointed out in terms of his slip. ‘It could have happened in the third game it could have happened in the fourth game but it certainly wasn’t anywhere near the defining moment of our season. That wasn’t what cost us the league. It was more games when we won the games. ‘When we won 5-3 at stoke when we conceded, when we won 6-3 at Cardiff, when we won 4-3 at home and conceded three. It was those games, not Steven’s slip or Kolo’s misplaced pass. ‘He is a very conscientious boy and he loves Liverpool. He is very hard on himself and he’s his own worst critic but he comes away recognising that he has been involved in a real title run in and next season he will be better for it. Slipping away: Gerrard let in Ba to give Chelsea the lead in a crucial game for Liverpool . Appreciation: His manager says that Gerrard will eventually come to reflect on a good season's work . Focus: The England man has had a week off to recharge and will be ready for the World Cup . Rodgers added: ‘He will take that confidence into a World Cup. I always say to players “when you go to England don’t think of Liverpool - think about your country and the team you are playing for.” ‘One of his qualities is that he can do that. He is a model professional at that, he is very proud to play for England and captain his country and i am sure he will go and do the country proud again.’ Meanwhile, Rodgers is determined to strengthen his Liverpool squad sooner rather than later this summer. He has targeted forward Xherdan Shaqiri from Bayern Munich and is looking at Southampton’s Dejan Lovren to bolster his defence. Shaqiri, who has started just 10 league matches for Bayern this season, would suit Liverpool's high-tempo style and is in need of more time on the pitch. Transfer target: Brendan Rodgers is interested in Bayern midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri, whose playing time has been limited . Lovren had impressed at Southampton this season and Rodgers, who is also keen on Cardiff's Steven Caulker, is considering him as a candidate to fill the centre of defence. The Liverpool boss is also keen on his former Chelsea youth team player Ryan Bertrand, while Sevilla’s £15m-rated Alberto Moreno could be another option to come in at left-back.","Too much has been made of Gerrard's slip .

"Ludogorets coach Georgi Dermendzhiev and playoff hero Cosmin Moti believe that their tiny club can upset 'the biggest team in the world' when they play holders Real Madrid on their home debut in the Champions League's group stage on Wednesday. 'Real Madrid are a galactic team. You know their budget and their players,' Dermendzhiev told a news conference at the Vasil Levski national stadium on Tuesday. 'It is an honour for us to play against the biggest team in the world. But despite the huge difference in class, our players are ready and well-prepared. Ludogorets coach Georgi Dermendzhiev says it is an honour to play against the world's best players . Luka Modric (left), Gareth Bale (centre) and Cristiano Ronaldo train on the pitch in Sofia . 'We've talked a lot with the players. I'm telling you honestly and responsibly, I'm not worried and we're not afraid. I want my players to be calm and give their best in this game.' Ludogorets, who are based in the small town of Razgrad, were tipped to struggle in their first appearance in the Champions League's group phase. The Bulgarian champions, however, have impressed with their tenacity and quality, losing 2-1 to Liverpool only after a penalty in added time in a pulsating match at Anfield two weeks ago. 'It seems Real are expected not only to win their matches but play entertaining football, too, and I think it's our chance,' said Dermendzhiev, who replaced Stoycho Stoev after Ludogorets's goalless draw at home to Partizan Belgrade in the first leg of their Champions League third qualifying-round tie. Dermendzhiev says his team are not scared of the likes of World player of the Year Ronaldo . Carlo Ancelotti puts his stars through their paces in Bulgaria ahead of the Champions League clash . The club's rise from obscurity began four years ago, when wealthy Bulgarian businessman Kiril Domuschiev took over the club and his investments started to pay dividends. The Eagles have since had the upper hand over the traditional powerhouses of Bulgarian football - CSKA Sofia and their bitter city rivals, Levski - winning three successive league titles and reaching the Europa League's last 16 last season. 'We'll play against the best players in the world, but we are confident that if we play as a team, we can stop them,' said crowd favourite Moti, who had to go in goal for the penalty shootout in the second leg of their playoff tie against Steaua Bucharest, saving two spot kicks to put his side through. Ludogorets thought they had sealed a crucial point with this late goal against Liverpool at Anfield . The Bulgarian minnows put up a good fight but just missed out on their first Champions League point . Moti became such a hero that the club have named a stand after him at their 8,000-capacity Ludogorets Arena in Razgrad. However the ground does not meet the required standards for the Champions League group match, so the Real Madrid visit has been switched to the national stadium. 'Every player dreams to play against the best,' added Moti. 'We'll try to play as well as we did against Liverpool. 'We know it'll be difficult, but we'll fight. We hope for a good result.'","Minnows came close to a shock against Liverpool on opening day .

"There are times when managers tighten up before a big match night and tension fills the air. Brendan Rodgers is no exception. Minutes before the Liverpool coach took training here before their Champions League tie against Basle, the names of Daniel Sturridge and Steven Gerrard were enough to get him going. It was passionate and protective, absorbing to listen to as he defended Gerrard’s honour and instructed England’s head coach Roy Hodgson to leave Sturridge out of his squad. Sturridge is not here, out of action since he injured his thigh on England duty last month. Gerrard celebrates his derby goal against Everton in front of his adoring Liverpool fans . Brendan Rodgers talks tactics with his team as the rain pours down and Steven Gerrard looks on . Rodgers laughs during the press conference before the game with Basle on Wednesday night . On Thursday, as the forward nears a return to action this weekend against West Bromwich Albion, Hodgson intends to select him for Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia. This, as everyone involved in these untidy club-versus-country spats is aware, is dangerous territory. Rodgers, though, is resolute. ‘I have not spoken to Roy since the injury,’ admitted Liverpool’s manager. ‘We have good dialogue and he knows that he can call and speak about any of the players. Liverpool have met Basle before, but will not have fond memories. It came in the 2002-03 Champions League group stages. They drew 1-1 at Anfield but in the final group game, Basle raced into a 3-0 lead inside half an hour. Basle's striker Julio Hernan Rossi scores against Liverpool's goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek . Liverpool stormed back with goals by Danny Murphy, Vladimir Smicer and Michael Owen’s late penalty rebound to level at 3-3 but it was not enough as Basle progressed by a point. Gerard Houllier’s team went into the UEFA Cup and were then knocked out by Celtic in the quarter-finals. ‘Hopefully he will have found everything I have ever said about the Liverpool players working with England to be helpful. I have only ever been honest.’ Then there is the delicate issue of Gerrard, with Rodgers responding to criticism of the captain’s form with a robust and forthright explanation of his role within this Liverpool team. Gerrard, who scored the last-minute winner against Ludogorets, went on to have his say in last Saturday’s Merseyside derby at Anfield. He scored a peach of a goal, a free-kick from the edge of the area and then claimed ‘people took it too far and say “he’s 34, he can’t run and he’s finished”.’ Spiky stuff, indeed. Liverpool needed a late penalty from Steven Gerrard to beat Ludogorets in their opening game . Steven Gerrard and Mario Balotelli (right) are put through their paces during training . Rodgers said: ‘Some of the criticism Steven is taking shows you the level he is playing that teams deem him to be man-marked. ‘As a footballer and a human being, as captain, every football person will know the qualities and influence he still has and he is a real catalyst for everything the team has done in the last 18 months. ‘It is something we are looking at as a club. He is still in a real good physical condition, 34 years old, never needs a day’s rest, and this is a genuine superstar, a world-class player consistently for so many years. ‘He will play and prepare himself right the way through to the very end. When he still strikes a ball there are not many like him, both his passing and his shooting. It is something to respect and behold.

VIDEO Basel used to winning - Rodgers . ‘The younger players look how calm Stevie is and they know he has been at the level before and gone right the way through and won the tournament. They can draw inspiration from that.’ These days Gerrard is stationed just in front of the back four and he will be expected to dictate the tempo against Paulo Sousa’s side on Wednesday evening. ‘He is right in the thick of it, he is right in the centre of it, that is the position I have put him in so that he can orchestrate the team. That is something he has done magnificently and the players respond to that,’ added Rodgers. Gerrard remains a valuable member of the Liverpool team, something Mamadou Sakho will do well to remember. He has been left behind with a diplomatic injury — code for axed — after he left Anfield on Saturday before a ball had been kicked in the Merseyside derby. Has he been disciplined? ‘It’s all in-house,’ added Rodgers, which translated as a hefty fine for the Liverpool defender. As for the rest of this squad, Rodgers made it clear he is right behind them.

We are hoping he can train with the team on Thursday. ‘We hope he’ll be available on Saturday. But if you are talking about a player’s availability for England they need to be fit to play and Daniel will not be fit to play. ‘It’s something we have stressed. My focus is on protecting Liverpool players and, at this moment, my focus is on getting him fit for Liverpool.’ England host San Marino next Thursday and travel to Estonia the following Sunday.","Liverpool fly out of John Lennon Airport without Sturridge .

"Maureen Lambert had a dream. Standing on the touchline at Liverpool’s academy in the 1990s, watching her determined son Rickie begin his career, she knew one day his rewards would come. ‘I always said he was going to the Premier League,’ Maureen recalled. ‘When we were at Liverpool and I was with the mums, I used to say, “I will be in my 50s before he becomes famous”. I just knew from when he was little. He was lovely growing up, always playing football.’ Rarely are dreams fulfilled as romantically as in this story. From the despair of suffering rejection when he was 15, to finding work in a beetroot factory called Red Velvet on £20 per day, Rickie Lambert’s life’s ambition to play for Liverpool will be officially realised in the next 48 hours. Coming back home! Rickie Lambert is on the verge of completing a £4m move to boyhood club Liverpool . Brazil bound: Rickie Lambert (C) applauds the crowd after England's 3-0 victory over Peru at Wembley . Great story: Match of the Day host Gary Linkeker tweeted his delight at Rickie's rise . This transfer, a closely-guarded secret as negotiations progressed this week, shows that old-fashioned  values and a refusal never to give up will ultimately be rewarded. Lambert could easily have gone the way of thousands of other young hopefuls when Liverpool released him in 1997, shuffling around the non-League circuit harbouring frustrations over what might have been, but it wasn’t only his mother who had faith that the picture would not be bleak. Hughie McAuley, one of the most influential coaches at Liverpool’s academy, remembers a talented  goalscorer who was always eager to please, and a resolute teenager who had been raised in working-class Kirkby with stout ethics. ‘Rickie was always a strong lad and had an eye for goal that has stayed with him,’ said McAuley, whose late father, Hugh, scouted Lambert when he was a schoolboy and urged Liverpool to take a look. ‘But he always worked very hard, he wanted to learn and he was determined. ‘It’s never easy to let kids leave, and it wasn’t easy to break the news to Rickie. But our job at the academy is to give those who don’t make it as much information and help as we can and he took it on board. He comes from good Liverpool stock. Early years: Rickie Lambert poses with trophies when playing for Liverpool Academy as an 11-year-old . ‘The desire to work hard and have dedication should be a pre- requisite — look at Steven Gerrard and Jamie  Carragher — but not every footballer has it. With Ricky, they were his biggest qualities and it’s why we had confidence he would go on to earn a living from the game. ‘Our paths crossed a few years later, when he was with Southampton (in 2009) and I was working at Stockport. He scored a poacher’s goal from six yards, they won 2-0. I gave him a hug afterwards and wished him all the best. Isn’t it great that it has gone full circle for him? He will be elated.’ When Lambert has his medical today, with a two-year contract at Liverpool agreed, it is inevitable his mind will flood with memories of the journey he has been on, the first stopping points being Blackpool, Macclesfield and Rochdale. Support act: Proud parents Ray and Maureen Lambert always knew their son would play at the highest level . Lonmg journey: The 32-year-old has worked his way up through the leagues at clubs including Stockport . ‘Rickie was a rough  diamond,’ recalls Steve Parkin, his manager at Rochdale. ‘He had an eye for goal. All we had to do was tidy his professionalism up a little bit. He was blessed with natural ability that not many players are given. That is what set him apart from the rest.’ Rochdale will get a small cut of the £4million fee Southampton receive after they negotiated a sell-on when he moved to Bristol Rovers, who will in turn benefit after inserting a clause when selling him to Southampton. It was on the south coast that Lambert blossomed, with 106 goals in 207 leagues games. The catalyst for this blistering run of form, which took him all the way to the England squad, was a prod from Alan Pardew, who questioned his professionalism. ‘That really stuck,’ he recalled before his England debut against Scotland last August. ‘I was overweight, basically. I wasn’t looking after my body.’ Take a bow: Rickie Lambert scored for England on his international debut against Scotland . His first cap brought a first goal, a towering header from a Leighton Baines cross, and left his mum and dad, Ray, in tears. Not long after that, a fax arrived at Southampton from Brendan Rodgers. ‘He is a terrific player and I sent the message on behalf of the club and all Kopites as he is a big Red,’ Rodgers explained last September. ‘He is a Kirkby boy and I was just wishing him well, saying we were all proud of him playing for England. I’ve been a big admirer of Rickie.’ And now, against the odds, Lambert’s dreams have come true.","Rickie Lambert is on the verge of completing a £4m transfer to Liverpool .

"Brendan Rodgers believes Liverpool's team spirit will remain one of their biggest strengths as he insisted Mamadou Sakho's show of petulance was an isolated incident. The France defender has not travelled to Basle for the Champions League game but Liverpool manager Rodgers has made it clear that the player remained on Merseyside because of thigh problem sustained in training, not for any disciplinary reasons. Sakho stormed out of Anfield on Saturday after being omitted from the 18-man squad for the Merseyside derby but Rodgers has moved to draw a line under the issue, explaining that he has spoken to the defender and received an apology.

There have been significant changes at Anfield in recent months but Rodgers does not feel Liverpool's unity has been damaged by all the comings and goings and he maintains togetherness will be key if they are to get a stuttering campaign up-and-running. 'It's not something that we expect from our players,' said Rodgers. 'We have spoken, he knows the situation and he has apologised. We move on. He has been injured in a training session. He has felt something in his thigh, he has had a scan and it will be two to three weeks. 'This is a group that has based its success on being a team and its behaviour within the group. Whatever we have achieved has been down to the team. We are working hard to consistently win games. 'It will take a wee bit of time but it (the reaction of one player) is never something that affects that team. We are working consistently hard to win games. We have not made as good a start as we would have wanted but there is a number of reasons why. 'We are integrating new players to a new culture and we have had injuries to key players. We have a big vision and an idea where we are going. It has been a difficult start but our performance against Everton at the weekend saw the intensity start to return.'

Liverpool, who beat FC Ludogorets 2-1 in their opening Group D game, could take a significant step towards reaching the knockout stages if they were secure victory here tomorrow evening but the task is easier said than done. Basle have an impressive record on home soil – they beat Chelsea here last season, for example – and in 2002, they knocked Liverpool out of the Champions League when drawing 3-3 in an extraordinary clash, having earlier held them to a 1-1 draw at Anfield. 'This is a football club that has won eight of the last 11 titles,' said Rodgers, who continues to be without Daniel Sturridge. 'They are the force of Swiss football. They produce very good players. They are used to winning. 'They play good football and when they come into this tournament, they come in with confidence. I watched them in the competition last season and they were very unfortunate not to qualify for the knockout phase. They have some very talented players. We know it is going to be a tough game.'

'We are very aware of what Basle can do,' said Lallana. 'I remember watching them play Chelsea last year. We are aware of them but we are focusing on ourselves. We had a good performance at the weekend and we are going in the right direction. 'I feel more or less there (in terms of fitness) now. I needed a few games to get going.

He does, though, feel the game in the Bernabeu was not as emphatic a loss as the result suggested. 'If we could achieve more or less the same statistics in the Bernabeu, with 50 per cent possession and 16 shots on goal, we have a great opportunity to win this game,' said Sousa. 'We need to be at our best to beat a historic club like Liverpool.

"Daniel Sturridge's injury frustration continues as he has not been included in Liverpool's squad for their Champions League game in Basle.

"Mario Balotelli is an overpaid penalty taker who no longer takes penalties. Brendan Rodgers thinks differently, and he will need more than a massive dose of good luck to come out of this one looking clever. The Liverpool boss survived the Luis Suarez controversies with his reputation not just intact but enhanced. However, his faith in Balotelli could soil that managerial CV. It seems all the Italy forward has to do at the moment is run around and make a few tackles and he gets nine out of 10 from most Liverpool fans. Mario Balotelli scores from the penalty spot during the shootout against Middlesbrough last week . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (right) talks with Balotelli during training at Melwood last Thursday . I’m sure they also love social media videos of him inhaling helium and singing Liverpool songs. At least he hasn’t bitten anyone. Those supporters seem grateful to have Balotelli at Anfield, when in truth, he should be thankful for another chance. AC Milan were so desperate to get rid of the striker they accepted only £16million for him. That desperation became obvious when they replaced him with Fernando Torres. Liverpool shouldn’t be dealing with bargain strikers nobody else wants. Balotelli’s record with managers isn’t great. Jose Mourinho didn’t want him, describing him as 'unmanageable'. Even Roberto Mancini, who admitted that he viewed Balotelli like 'one of his children', lost patience and sold him after the pair had a scrap on the training ground following another Balotelli transgression. You've got to respect Rodgers for taking on the challenge, but it’s another potential problem he faces in a season which already promised to be tough. Balotelli (centre) is pictured with Dejan Lovren (left) and Lazar Markovic on the plane to Basel on Tuesday . Balotelli (left) and Rodgers (right) arrive at Liverpool John Lennon Airport on Tuesday morning . Balotelli misses a chance on goal during the Merseyside derby between Liverpool and Everton on Saturday . Balotelli was replaced in the second half by Rickie Lambert at Anfield on Saturday . On Saturday in the derby, Balotelli didn’t impact the game significantly. In fact he missed a sitter that would have guaranteed Liverpool three points. Tim Howard made himself big and made the save, but the keeper should have been given no chance – that’s what a truly top level striker would have done. But that is airbrushed out of the Liverpool fans’ reports of the game, they prefer instead to focus on how hard he worked. Is that enough to keep them happy? This boy in a man’s body has had so many chances in football that mere hard work should be the bare minimum he owes Liverpool for their lifeline this summer. He’s a lucky fella. And what about this so-called hard work being done by Balotelli? He does a fraction of the work Suarez used to get through, and obviously his career goal record is vastly inferior. Mario Balotelli at the Neighbourhood Bar in Manchester at the weekend . Balotelli scores the only goal of his Liverpool spell so far against Ludogorets in the Champions League . Italian striker Balotelli celebrates his first goal for the Anfield club on September 16 . Let’s wait and see what it is that Balotelli brings to the Liverpool party. A couple of stuttering shootout spot kicks against Middlesbrough, and a goal against Champions League also-rans are a mediocre return so far. It’s early days, but points are being dropped. What is even more inexplicable is Rodgers’ decision to effectively end Rickie Lambert’s top flight career. Despite doing well for Southampton and England last year, Lambert has yet to start a Premier League game for his new club, with Balotelli preferred up front. Managers who have put their faith in the Italian in the past have been let down. Rodgers is setting himself up for a fall – he has put an extraordinary amount of faith in this player, and it would be a shame if Balotelli didn’t repay this faith in full. But will he? Lambert (left) and Balotelli (right) take part in a training session at Melwood last week . Maybe Balotelli would be wise to reflect on the words of a true Liverpool legend. Kenny Dalglish said this after Mario saw red at Anfield in 2011: 'Sometimes if you look in the mirror you get the answer.' Rodgers can only hope and pray Balotelli has looked in the mirror and asked the right questions. If the striker doesn’t get it right at Anfield, the manager will have to provide a few answers.

"I’ll never forget the day Roy Hodgson made me jump 10 feet off my couch. It was a midweek afternoon and I was at home, winding down after training, when Roy called to tell me he had important news: I was going to be his England captain. It was an unbelievable feeling, a real ‘punch the air’ moment, and I’m pretty sure Wayne Rooney will get to experience the same emotions this week when my successor is revealed. As far as I am concerned, there is no more worthy candidate to take over. Roy has tremendous faith in Wayne. When the Manchester United striker was under pressure in the summer, when there was increased speculation about his place in the England team, his manager stuck by him and played him in the games that mattered. It was a big show of respect. On target: England forward Wayne Rooney celebrates after scoring against Uruguay at the 2014 World Cup . Chilling out: Rooney (left) and Steven Gerrard relax during an England training session in the Algarve in May . Captain: Rooney (right) leads out Manchester United for the pre-season friendly against Valencia on August 12 . Red devil: Rooney celebrates scoring for Manchester United against Swansea in their Premier League opener . Perhaps other managers would have taken him out of the firing line and put him on the bench when the scrutiny increased, but Roy knows what Wayne brings to England’s team and, just as crucially, what he will continue to contribute in the next few years. So why do I think Wayne is the No 1 choice? For starters, he is a natural leader. Aside from being a top player, one who commands respect within the group, Wayne is passionate about representing his country and won’t be fazed by the responsibility. Before a game, he is one of the most vocal players in the dressing room. He wouldn’t be afraid of speaking up and talking to someone one-to-one, telling them what is expected. When he was my deputy, he gave me great support and during our 11 years with England I saw him blossom. There were times when, as a young lad, he didn’t always say the right things in the dressing room but he has matured and chooses his words carefully. Teammates: Gerrard (left) is congratulated by Rooney after scoring against Poland at Wembley last year . Called it a day: Gerrard retired from international football in July after winning 114 caps for England . He’s brave, too. Wayne won’t go missing in a game nor will he duck any issues with the media; whether he is in world-class form or going through a difficult patch, he doesn’t shy away from questions. Don’t think, though, he will expose players in public if things aren’t going well. That wasn’t my style, nor will it be his. He knows the best place to deliver such words is in closed quarters and those he will have to speak to will appreciate him doing it the right way. I also believe it is important for an England captain to lead his club. Everything that compelled Louis van Gaal to make Wayne United captain after working with him for six weeks are the qualities that Roy has seen at every get-together for the past two years. My England journey with Wayne started in March 2003. I’d known of him since he was playing for Everton’s Under-13 side with my cousin, Anthony. I was well aware of the hype surrounding him when he broke into Everton’s first team. Younger days: Gerrard (right) congratulates Rooney on scoring for England against Liechtenstein in 2003 . The heat is turned up, however, when you get selected for England and I remember thinking, when we joined up for that European Championship qualifier away to Liechtenstein, ‘let’s have a proper look at what you’ve got’ before training with him for the first time. I missed his debut against Australia the previous month as I was injured. It quickly became apparent this was his stage. During a training game he conjured a chip from nothing that sailed over David James; it was an audacious thing to attempt but Wayne — then only 17 — carried on as if it was the most natural thing to do. AS the ball nestled in the net, the session stopped so everyone could applaud. It wasn’t a bad way to settle yourself into the group. Taking the armband won’t be new for Wayne — he’s led England before, against Brazil in Qatar in 2009 and San Marino in October 2012 — but it is a different feeling from when you are just borrowing it. Wearing the armband: Rooney (right) is put under pressure by San Marino's Christian Brolli in October 2012 . United: Rooney (3rd left) captained England for the international friendly against Brazil in Doha in 2009 . I couldn’t wait to walk into the dressing room after Roy gave me the news, and it will be the same for Wayne. He will be desperate to get to Wembley for the Norway friendly and the added responsibility could be the catalyst to go on and break Sir Bobby Charlton’s record of 49 goals. Everything is there for him now. He is set to be captain and the next two tournaments, in France and Russia, are the most important he’ll play in — they can define his legacy. We played together 71 times for England and at his best, he is a world-class talent. After the disappointment of Brazil, this is a fresh start for everyone and Wayne can lead the team positively into the new campaign. Tearful goodbye: Gerrard (centre) was emotional after his last match for England at the World Cup in Brazil . If and when he leads the team out on September 3, I’ll be delighted for him. We are two lads from council estates in Liverpool who have loved playing for England, and I know what emotions Wayne will feel when he stands at the head of the line in the tunnel. And how will I feel? I know I’ve made the right decision and I’ll enjoy having a breather, but I’ll miss playing for England. I know that for a fact.","There is no more worthy candidate to take over as captain than Rooney .

"Chelsea's new signing arrives from Croatia after receiving rave reviews for his performances with Hajduk Split. With Liverpool and Tottenham also showing an interest Jose Mourinho's side managed to nip in and sign the midfield protegee for just £3million. Here, LAURIE WHITWELL explains what all the fuss is about. So who is this guy I'm hearing whispers about? Name: Mario Pasalic . Club: Chelsea . Age: 19 . Position: Central midfield . Arrival: Chelsea's new signing Mario Pasalic holds his blue shirt aloft at the club's training ground in Cobham . I’m going to need more than that... Pasalic has played for Hajduk Split since the age of 10 and progressed through the ranks, enjoying his most productive campaign last season by scoring 11 goals in the Croatian top tier. He has appeared for the Under-21 national side and was included in the 30-man senior squad for the World Cup in Brazil before the numbers were trimmed by manager Niko Kovac. So why all the fuss? Chelsea technical director Michael Emenalo watched when Pasalic scored the only goal for Hajduk, as they beat city rivals RNK 1-0 and Jose Mourinho has sanctioned the move. Last September he scored both goals as Hajduk beat rivals Dinamo Zagreb 2-0 and was a key figure in his side finishing third in the table. Talent: Pasalic has played for Croatia Under 21s and was named in the provisional 30-man World Cup squad . What’s his style? Pasalic is a box-to-box midfielder, starting deeper but able to roam and provide a real goal threat. Defensive duties are not neglected however. He is a good passer and likes shooting from range. So, a bit like? He has been compared to Luka Modric on occasions because of his nationality and vision but at 6ft 1in is taller, reminding some of former Chelsea player Michael Ballack . By his own words, a bona fide Blues legend is an inspiration. ‘My favourite player is Frank Lampard,’ he says. International quality: Pasalic (left) training with the Croatian national team ahead of the World Cup . How much is he worth and what happens next? Chelsea have paid £3million for his services amid interest from Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur. With more first-team football and international honours that figure could soon rise. How will he fit in? It is highly likely Pasalic will go on loan to a team on the continent to continue his development before returning to Stamford Bridge next summer. Ultimately, he would play in a midfield duo behind three more advanced players – such as Oscar, Eden Hazard, and Andre Shurrle – but possesses enough versatility to move upfield too. Everyone has a weakness... Not a weakness on the pitch as such, but in 2012 he missed half a season after being diagnosed with a Staphylococcus infection, which can result in boils or abscesses. He recuperated after treatement and a lengthy spell on the sidelines. Idol: Pasalic says his favourite player is Chelsea legend Frank Lampard, who left the club this summer . What happens next? Pasalic has joined in first-team training at Chelsea’s Cobham base but is likely to go on loan, possibly in the next fortnight to a team such as Lazio or Eintracht Frankfurt, who have registered prior interest. ‘Mario has grown at Hajduk,’ said Emanelo after his scouting trip. ‘In the summer he has to go to a club where he will continue to evolve in order to one day play at Stamford Bridge.’ In April his agent, Ivica Loncar, said there were, ‘several interested clubs from Italy, Germany and Spain, and it is possible that the first two weeks of preparation activity will be with Chelsea. But the decision is Jose Mourinho’s.’ Anything else I need to know? Despite playing for Croatia at numerous age groups, Pasalic was actually born in Mainz, Germany.","Chelsea snapped up the 19-year-old with Liverpool and Tottenham also keen .

"Brendan Rodgers believes Liverpool will be able to produce more of the kind of fluid football this season that made them such a force last term and has backed them to show their creativity in Monday's Barclays Premier League clash with Manchester City. The Reds' 2014-15 top-flight campaign got under way last Sunday with a 2-1 home win over Southampton, a result Rodgers felt his men had had to 'grind out'. Certainly, it was not a performance akin to those they were putting on for much of the conclusion to 2013-14, in which they fell just agonisingly short of claiming the Premier League title. VIDEO Scroll down to see Brendan Rodgers: We'll attack City with flair and pace . Pointers: Brendan Rodgers instructs new boys Javi Manquillo (left) and Alberto Moreno in training . Stern-faced: The Liverpool boss is preparing his side for the trip to Manchester City on Monday night . Follow the leader: Adam Lallana, Martin Skrtel and Fabio Borini in training . Smiles: Kolo Toure looking in high spirits alongside Steven Gerrard . Since then, Liverpool have lost the services of Luis Suarez - scorer of 31 goals last term - and brought in a raft of new players, with AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli looking set to add to that. But despite all the change and the fact that many of his squad came into pre-season off the back of playing at this summer's World Cup, Rodgers is sure the Merseyside outfit's old potency will return. Reflecting on the Southampton victory, the Northern Irishman said: 'We were certainly delighted to start with a win. 'I was very, very pleased and very happy we won the game. 'Of course, we will perform better and that fluidity will get better as the season goes on. You have to understand a lot of players are coming back late.' City scored 102 goals on their way to being crowned Premier League champions last term, while runners-up Liverpool notched 101. Their encounters during the season saw City win 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium - the venue for Monday's match - before Liverpool triumphed 3-2 at Anfield. And while expecting a close battle this time around, Rodgers also anticipates there being plenty of creative attacking play in the game, even given how early on it is in the campaign. Back in action: Adam Lallana is closing back in on full fitness as he takes the ball away from Philippe Coutinho . Rocks at the back: Toure and Mamadou Sakho looking serious during the session . Debutant? Lazar Markovic could play his first game for Liverpool against Manchester City . Asked if he thought Monday's contest would be a cagey one, Rodgers said: 'I don't think so. 'I think the nature of both teams is the offensive game, but of course they're normally tight games. 'If you look at both sets of players, there's lots of invention and creativity in the team. I think both will be creative and want to score goals. 'We know we need to be compact and solid when we haven't got the ball, and we need to be aggressive and press well. 'We know we have the freedom, movement and pace that can hurt teams. We understand it's early on, but it'll be a good game for sure.' One thing Rodgers was particularly pleased about with regard to the Southampton game was the character his players demonstrated to come through and emerge with the win. He feels it is down to the sense of team spirit at Liverpool, something he has been keen to emphasise that no incoming player - such as maverick Italy frontman Balotelli - will disrupt.

One on one: Suso eyes up Lallana with Rodgers watching on . Ping: Gerrard looks to hit one with his famous right foot .

When people look at the team, as well as the qualities, our team spirit is very strong, and it is something that got us through the game last weekend - that character, resilience and spirit. 'Maybe early on you didn't really see that, but I think you see that now in the team - that if we are not playing so well, we still want to fight and work. 'You do that when the team is close and the squad is close. Ultimately that will get you results.""

"The 20-year-old has been earning rave reviews for his outstanding performances in the Bayer Leverkusen midfield this season. In fact, his game has developed so quickly since leaving Bayern Munich that Liverpool are keen to put together a deal to bring the talented youngster to Anfield this summer. Here, German football writer KIT HOLDEN explains what all the fuss is about. So who is this guy I'm hearing whispers about? Name: Emre CanClub: Bayer LeverkusenAge: 20Position: Midfield/defence . Wanted man: Emre Can has been on such good form this season Liverpool are keen on signing the youngster . I’m going to need more than that... Can is one of the most versatile young players in the Bundesliga. Having spent most of his career so far in the youth set up at Bayern Munich, the Frankfurt-born player was one pipped for the top from an extremely early age. After only four first-team appearances at Bayern, though, Can's star faded during the 2012/13 season, and so in the summer of 2013 he chose to make the switch to Leverkusen. It has done him a world of good, and he has developed into an invaluable midfield force for his new club. He has also represented Germany at every level from Under 15 to Under 21. So why all the fuss? The German-Turkish star is not just on Liverpool's radar. When Bayern sold him for £4.5million last summer, they were quick to ensure there would be a buy-back option in the deal. The German giants have a proud history of developing their own players, and for a long time it seemed Can would become as much of a Bayern regular as Thomas Muller, Bastian Schweinsteiger or Phillipp Lahm. Should Liverpool manage to snap him up from Leverkusen just one year into his four-year contract, it would be quite a coup: much to both Bayer and Bayern's disappointment. Mature: Despite being only 20, the young German is credited with a calm head when the pressure mounts . What’s his style? Can prefers to play in central midfield - 'either attacking or defending, I don't care either way' - but has been employed as a centre-back and a left-back on various occasions. As captain of the German Under 17s team, he was the calming influence at the heart of play. His physical strength is of particular use going forward, though he is rarely overly reckless. It has been remarked on several occasions that Can seems to have a maturity beyond his years, and his technical ability as a playmaker, either from the back or the front, is now beyond doubt. So, a bit like? The most commonly drawn comparison is Schweinsteiger. And not only because the young Can puts as much effort into his hairstye as Schweinsteiger once did. His ability to switch effortlessly from defence to midfield, his dangerous shot, and his control over the pace of the game all do remind one of the established Bayern star. For those watching his marauding runs through the centre at Leverkusen this season though, Toni Kroos has always also sprung to mind. It is little surprise that these two Bayern stars have had an influence on Can's play. He has trained with them, or at least in close proximity to them, for several of his formative years. Rise to prominence: Can left Bayern Munich for Leverkusen after failing to establish himself in the first team . How much is he worth and what happens next? Leverkusen signed him on a four-year contract for £4.5million last summer, but his successful season has seen his value shoot up since then. Bild reported on Monday that Liverpool would have to shell out at least £12million for him, though even that would undoubtedly be a sensible investment. His effect would not only be limited to himself, moreover. Can was Liverpool academy striker Samed Yesil's captain in the German youth teams, and if the young striker were to return to fitness, Can's presence may see him break through at Liverpool. Everyone has a weakness... Some questioned Can's mentality after he failed to break into the Bayern first team as quickly as predicted, despite public support from Jupp Heynckes. That is a little unfair considering the wealth of talent Bayern have in that position. There would be a similar fight for places at Liverpool, however, and it would be interesting to see how he rises to that challenge now. On the field? There's little to criticise, though by his own admission, he is not the greatest header of a ball. Comparisons: Can has been likened to Bayern midfield stars Bastian Schweinsteiger and Toni Kroos . What happens next? The likelihood of Can joining Liverpool depends on which way you look at it. His agents at International Sports Management have a good relationship with Brendan Rodgers and were allegedly instrumental in clinching the deals for Yesil and Nuri Sahin in the past. Nonetheless, Leverkusen will kick up a fight. Squad manager Michael Reschke has stated that: 'We will do everything in our power to keep him. Another year of development here is important for him,' while director of sport Rudi Voller has denied any contact from Liverpool so far. Most experts in Germany see little hope that Leverkusen will hang onto him. The threat from former club Bayern Munich shouldn't be an issue this summer, as the buy-back clause can only be activated from 2015. Anything else I need to know? His surname is pronounced 'Chan', like Jackie. He also shares his full name with a Turkish Grand Master of Chess.","Liverpool are keen to bring the 20-year-old to Anfield this summer .

"There is still time for more to come but with knowing nods to Diego Costa (Chelsea), Rio Ferdinand, Mauricio Isla (both QPR), Fraser Forster (Southampton) and Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal), these are my top five signings made by Premier League clubs so far this summer. 5) Romelu Lukaku - Everton . Everything about this signing sings of a new era for Everton Football Club. Soon after paying the wages to keep Gareth Barry, Bill Kenwright has again answered his critics among the Goodison faithful by laying out some serious cash by way of £28million for Lukaku. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Fabregas and Bojan scoring for their new clubs . Linking up: Romelu Lukaku joins James McCarthy (left) and Steven Pienaar at Everton for this season . If Roberto Martinez is as good as his many fans believe he is then he can only deliver improvement for Everton this season. He is the first manager at the club in many years who can’t say the board didn’t fully back him. So it’s a massive statement from Kenwright, Martinez and all at Everton. But it will be meaningless unless they make the break into the top four and/or win a trophy. Just like when Lukaku gets in front of goal, there needs to be an end product for Everton after spending so much. You’ve got to admire Martinez for putting so much pressure on himself. Knows where the net is: The young Belgian impressed hugely while on loan at Goodison Park last year . 4) Enner Valencia - West Ham . Some might look at this signing and think it’s a knee-jerk reaction to a player having a good World Cup with Ecuador, but Valencia’s ability was talked about widely before the tournament got underway. If West Ham’s much talked about commitment to a new attacking style is for real, then the forward should flourish. I’ve seen him score with his left, his right and his head. He can bag a set-piece goal too, and he’s dynamic in the box. It’s a shame for the Hammers that he will miss the start of the season with injury, but one of the key issues to any potential success could be whether he adapts to the Premier League. 3) Cesc Fabregas - Chelsea . How do you replace Frank Lampard? It could have been a massive issue for Chelsea as they said goodbye to their record scorer - one of their best players in an incredible 10 years of success at the club – and, along with John Terry, a huge talisman at Stamford Bridge. But Jose Mourinho dealt with it superbly by bringing in Fabregas. If it’s true that Arsenal chose not to sign their former captain then that’s bizarre, especially as they have allowed potential rivals Chelsea take him. He’s a goalscorer and a creator, and he’s proven in the Premier League and in Europe. You can’t ask for much more. 2) Calum Chambers – Arsenal . Pound for pound over the long term this could be a brilliant signing. Arsenal could get 15 years or more out of Chambers – it could prove to be a bargain. But don’t be fooled into thinking Arsene Wenger is a genius who could see Chambers as a centre half when nobody else could. It was former England Under 19 coach Noel Blake who picked Chambers at the heart of the back four for a game against Turkey earlier this year and he was excellent. Sadly the FA have seen fit to dispense with that kind of coaching bravery and Blake is now helping Jose Riga achieve mission impossible at Blackpool. But England may benefit from Wenger’s bravery. Slotting the teenager in at centre half at Wembley for his debut is bold, but Chambers was excellent, and he could solve a problem for the national team in a position where Roy Hodgson needs help. Capture: West Ham pulled off something of a coup by signing Enner Valencia from Pachuca this season . Talent: The Ecuador forward was one of the standout performers at the World Cup in Brazil . Settling in nicely: Cesc Fabregas is congratulated by Branislav Ivanovic after scoring against Ferencvaros . That'll do nicely! Chelsea were aware that they needed someone to replace Manchester City's Frank Lampard . Not a bad start! Calum Chambers won the Community Shield during his first game in an Arsenal shirt on Sunday . Composed: The former Southampton man played at centre half at Wembley, here challenging Stevan Jovetic . 1) Bojan Krkic – Stoke City . It’s down to the player himself but this has the potential to be one of the best signings in Stoke’s history. When he burst on to the scene at Barcelona, Bojan was brilliant. Make no mistake, he had all it takes to be as good as Lionel Messi. But he didn’t continue the progress as many expected, and he’s now hoping to be the new Crouchy, rather than the new Messi. He was on the bench for the Champions League final three years ago, but when Ibrahim Afellay was rewarded with a late substitute appearance, Bojan felt he could not continue playing under Pep Guardiola - he felt he couldn’t even speak to the manager any longer, and so he moved on. Get used to this: New Stoke signing Bojan celebrates with Stephen Ireland after scoring against Real Betis . Power: The ex-Barcelona forward was lauded by Pep Guardiola but had to move on from the Nou Camp . At his best Guardiola had said Bojan was one of the few players who had a ‘magical touch’, and before that Pep’s predecessor with the Catalan giants, Frank Rijkaard, called him ‘a treasure.’ After picking up Marko Arnautovic last summer, and now signing Bojan, those who doubted Stoke’s commitment to a change of style under Mark Hughes need doubt no longer. The commitment is there, so let’s see what it brings on the pitch next season. Bojan is 24 this month – he’s still relatively young. If he can recapture the form he was showing at the Nou Camp as a teenager, then it could be brilliant for all at the Britannia Stadium. One thing is for certain, we are about to find out if he can do it when it’s wet and windy in Stoke.

"The race is on for the Premier League title and it appears Brendan Rodgers will be behind his players every step of the way - and not just on the pitch. The Liverpool boss appeared to be setting an example to his squad in training before his side's heavyweight battle at Manchester City on Monday, taking part in physical drills as the Reds look to start the season with successive victories.

We've got a learning environment for players.'","Brendan Rodgers joins Liverpool stars in training ahead of Man City clash .

"It was a performance that offered a tantalising glimpse of what Chelsea might achieve this season and proved why Jose Mourinho wanted to sign him. But as Cesc Fabregas walked off the pitch at Turf Moor on Monday night, having been involved in all three goals to cap a debut of which he could be proud, I couldn’t help think of one question — will he ever really be loved at Stamford Bridge? Do not underestimate the impact Fabregas could have in the coming months. He is a midfielder capable of producing moments of magic and his intricate passing and link play might be the difference in propelling Chelsea to their first Barclays Premier League title since 2010. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cesc Fabregas get a soaking in the Ice Bucket Challenge . Top form: Cesc Fabregas produced an impressive performance against Burnley at Turf Moor on Monday . Key role: Fabregas could be the difference in helping Chelsea to their first league title since 2010 . Get a grip: Fabregas (second right) clashes with Frank Lampard (centre right) during the 2007 League Cup final . Mourinho knew what he was getting when he asked Chelsea to pay Barcelona £30million for Fabregas’s services; a top-class operator with a proven pedigree on the biggest stage, the type who can make a difference in the games that Chelsea fell down in last year. But Chelsea supporters knew what they were getting too — a former Arsenal player, who irritated them when he clashed with Frank Lampard. They might well respect his quality but will they afford him the same devotion that they have for Didier Drogba or John Terry? I would say that will be difficult. And what do Arsenal fans now think of him? When I played against Fabregas, I viewed him as one of the few young players who had the mental strength and ability to run a game. It spoke volumes that Arsene Wenger was prepared to give him such an important role so early in his career. He enjoyed some good times, winning the FA Cup, playing in a Champions League final and captaining the side, but there won’t be any warm reception when Fabregas is reacquainted with Arsenal for the first time at Stamford Bridge on October 5. I can understand why some players make certain moves — to be fair to Cesc, he didn’t have many top options this summer and Arsenal didn’t want him back — but, equally, I can’t understand why some jeopardise something they have worked hard to build up for a couple of years with the enemy. Look at the example of Michael Owen. He should be idolised on The Kop after the goals he scored for Liverpool, but his subsequent spell with Manchester United means he will never be afforded the same affection as Robbie Fowler or Steven Gerrard. United fans are just as indifferent to him. Similarly, Paul Ince helped United win their first Double in 1993-94, but three years later he was being unveiled at Anfield. You can’t be loved by two sides who have a mutual dislike for each other and Ince, who was a tremendous midfielder, is now simply viewed with scepticism by both fan-bases. Sometimes players make decisions without considering the long-term impact. Gerrard, by contrast, took a different view. He would have lifted the title a few times had he joined Chelsea but he chose to stay at Liverpool because he knew any medals he would win would mean more. Aside from that, he guaranteed, in my eyes, that he had a relationship with the club that went beyond medals. That is something Wayne Rooney will find out for himself during the next few years at Manchester United, where he has won almost all there is to win. Rival move: Michael Owen leaves the Anfield pitch after playing against Liverpool for Manchester United . Unveiling: Former Manchester United player Paul Ince poses for the media after joining Liverpool in 1997 . Old club: Fabregas celebrates after helping Arsenal beat Chelsea 1-0 at the Emirates Stadium in 2007 . If United continue to experience difficulties, whether not winning trophies or not being in the Champions League, rather than looking to move on, Wayne would get more respect if he pulled them back to the top and lifted a trophy than if he won two or three elsewhere. We all wonder what it is like at different clubs but I wanted to be a one club man. I loved what Paolo Maldini and Franco Baresi accomplished with AC Milan, I have tremendous respect for Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes with Manchester United. I wanted to be seen in the same light. Lots of players, though, would prefer to be more successful, earn more money and have different life experiences. I totally accept that, but I think there are certain decisions you have to take that, while they don’t benefit you in the short-term, in the long run it proves to be the right choice. Commitment: Italian legend Paolo Maldini spent his entire career at AC Milan before retiring in 2009 . Farewell: Ryan Giggs salutes the Old Trafford crowd after playing his last game for Manchester United in May . That’s why I could never work out why Sol Campbell left Tottenham for Arsenal or the way Ashley Cole did the same to Arsenal when he joined Chelsea; they both came through the ranks at big clubs but went on to enjoy great success at their bitter rivals. But could they not have enjoyed similar success, at home or abroad, at a club that would not have caused such acrimony? Neither of those players can go back to where it started for them and, if I’m honest, I also find it strange that Lampard has joined Manchester City for six months, even though some Chelsea fans have said they don’t begrudge him the move. Controversial: Defender Sol Campbell left Tottenham Hotspur for North London rivals Arsenal in 2001 . Heading west: Left-back Ashley Cole (right) left Arsenal in 2006 to join London rivals Chelsea . It all boils down to what order you put medals, money or respect in. Everyone is different but, at the end of your career, it is nice to know you have the affection of the fans whose club you served the longest. By swapping red and white for blue, Cesc Fabregas may have given that up — and it remains to be seen if Chelsea followers will love him too. Hugs all round: Fabregas congratulates Branislav Ivanovic (left) on scoring Chelsea's third goal against Burnley . Goodison treat for defender like me... This week I’m looking forward to watching the two outstanding young English defenders go head-to-head. I will be at Goodison Park on Saturday evening and one aspect of the game I’m relishing is how Arsenal defender Calum Chambers and Everton’s John Stones perform in a fascinating encounter. Though the season is only two weeks old, Chambers has been Arsenal’s outstanding player. He built on the promise of his first two performances with a commanding display against Besiktas in the Champions League on Tuesday. Chambers might only be 19, but he wasn’t ruffled by the hostile atmosphere in Turkey and that experience will stand him in good stead for what awaits him on Merseyside. Everton play good football under Roberto Martinez and Goodison remains an intimidating ground. Future star: Calum Chambers produced a commanding display against Besiktas in the Champions League . When Arsenal lost 3-0 to Everton in April, Romelu Lukaku bullied Arsene Wenger’s defenders and with the Belgian forward fit for the match, Chambers can be certain that he will be in for a difficult 90 minutes. It will be interesting to see how he copes. As for Stones, I was impressed with his debut season in the Premier League. He had to play at right-back against Leicester last week, due to Seamus Coleman’s hamstring injury. Everton were shrewd to tie Stones, 20, down to a long-term contract this summer and if he and Chambers maintain their progression, then they could become England’s first-choice defensive pairing in the future. One to watch: Everton's John Stones has signed a long-term contract with the Merseyside club . Mario a bargain, if he doesn't harm team spirit . So Mario Balotelli is on the brink of joining Liverpool and completing the shock move of the summer. When I first saw the news breaking, my initial reaction was ‘This can’t be true’; I had serious misgivings. Since then, though, I have changed my stance because of the economics — £16million for a 24-year-old who is Italy’s No 1 striker looks a great deal. If you consider Ross McCormack moved from Leeds to Fulham for £11m, it is even better value. And if Balotelli fails to deliver, Liverpool could expect to recoup most of their outlay. I admit he still has to convince me as a player. People talk about his behaviour off the pitch — that doesn’t worry me too much and, in truth, I think some of it is quite funny. In town: Mario Balotelli arrives at Liverpool's Melwood training ground ahead of his medical on Friday . It is what happens when he crosses that white line that is important, and he has yet to show me he is as good as some people have claimed. We faced each other a few times when he was in England and I never saw a lot from him at Anfield. He was subbed in his three appearances there and sent off after 18 minutes as a substitute. There is, however, a player lurking in that frame. He has been outstanding on the two occasions he faced England at major tournaments, causing problems with his pace and power. If he’s like that, Liverpool will have done some smart business. Daniel Sturridge will find three games a week difficult, so there will be rotation issues and how they play as a pair will be intriguing. Above all, Liverpool have a fabulous spirit under Brendan Rodgers that has carried them far. Balotelli can’t be allowed to jeopardise that.

"With the new Premier League season less than a week away, Kevin Mirallas has been stepping up his efforts to be fit for Everton's opener against newly promoted Leicester. The 26-year-old only returned from holiday last week after helping Belgium reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup and manager Roberto Martinez has admitted that he may not be ready to play at the Walkers Stadium on Saturday. But Mirallas, who helped the Toffees finish fifth in the Spaniard's first season at the helm, appears determined to be involved after being filmed working out in the club's Finch Farm gym by his international team-mate Romelu Lukaku.

The ex-Chelsea forward can also be saying: 'Working on his fitness all day, every day, Mr Mirallas' before shouting some words of encouragement to his compatriot.

"Lizzie Armitstead and Emma Pooley combined for an English one-two in a gripping women’s road race on Sunday when Glasgow threw the worst of its weather at the men’s race, an event so drenched it became semi-aquatic — and utterly extraordinary. Just 12 of 140 men finished their 168km (105-mile) course. For more than two-thirds of it, the field was headed by the Isle of Man’s Peter Kennaugh. His gutsy (or borderline insane, delete as applicable) breakaway with 160km of the race remaining was always likely to be sunk. Indeed it was, drowned even, but Kennaugh was one of the dozen good men and true to cross the finish line. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lizzie Armitstead win gold with Emma Pooley claiming silver . Champion: Lizzie Armitstead won Commonwealth gold for England in the Women's Road Race . Golden smile: Armitstead celebrates winning her gold medal on the podium in Glasgow . Instead, seven days after riding down the Champs-Elysees in Paris bathed in  sunshine at the conclusion of the Tour de France, Wales’s Geraint Thomas triumphed. Not that he concluded simply. The 28-year-old suffered a puncture with just 6km left that brought him to a halt. For the first few moments of that delay it seemed feasible New Zealand’s Jack Bauer or England’s Scott Thwaites might catch him. That pair and Thomas had reeled in Kennaugh’s one-man breakaway with 49km left, then the Welshman made his own break from the other two on the final lap of 12 around the city. But Thomas had enough time to change his wheel before being caught and powered away in spray that characterised  the entirety of his 4hr 13min 5sec ride. Bauer and Thwaites summoned energy from somewhere to sprint against each other down the home straight, Bauer crossing millimetres ahead for silver in the same time of 4hr 14min 26sec as Thwaites, who took bronze. In a race as epically sodden as yesterday’s it is worth name-checking all those who finished. England’s Russell Downing was fourth, ahead of Mark Renshaw of Australia, a nation that had won this event for four straight Games and never missed the podium before Sunday. Thomas’s Welsh team-mate Luke Rowe was sixth, then Kiwi Gregory Henderson and Kennaugh, supported throughout by injured Manx team-mate Mark Cavendish, looking demented at times as he yelled encouragement from a car window. At long last: Armitstead finished silver in Delhi four years ago as well as in the 2012 London Olympics . Dan Craven (Namibia) and Scott Davies (Wales) were ninth and 10th ahead of Scotland’s David Millar in his swansong ride of a long, turbulent and ultimately inspirational career. Ewan Caleb of Australia was 12th and that was it. ‘That was such a grim day,’ said Thomas. ‘I felt terrible at the start. I was thinking of just stopping I felt that bad.  Everyone else seemed to come down to my level then. I was surprised how easily I went away (on the final lap). When I had the puncture I thought “What have I got to do?” But fortunately I had a decent enough gap to stay in front.’ Third-placed Thwaites said: ‘Geraint was just so strong. You could tell he had so much more energy left in the tank.’ This was the first Welsh male road cycling gold ever, and the second Welsh road gold after Nicole Cooke’s road-race win in Manchester in 2002. Tears of joy: Emma Pooley won silver for England in what was her final race in the sport . Swansong: Pooley finished 25 seconds behind Armitstead and is retiring to compete in endurance triathlons . The women’s race took in seven laps of the 14km course, and Pooley played a critical  support role as her England team leader Armitstead triumphed. Armitstead, 25, from Otley in Yorkshire, had spoken before the race about wanting to put a succession of big-race silvers behind her, including in the Commonwealth Games four years ago and at London 2012. ‘I feel like I deserve this,’ said Armitstead. ‘I’ve trained so hard. I’m always on the podium, I don’t win that many races. It’s just a confidence thing. ‘Once you’ve got a big title you can call yourself a champion finally. ‘I want to say a massive thank you to Emma. Cycling is a beautiful sport and a team sport, which often gets overlooked. So I’m pleased Emma got a silver medal as well.’ Survival of the fittest: Armistead came out on top of the 98-kilometres event in just over 2 hours and 38 minutes .

"Sophie Taylor became the third English teenager to win a gold medal in the Commonwealth Games pool here in Glasgow, pulling off an upset to take victory in the 100 metres breaststroke. The 18-year-old, born in Sheffield and based in Leeds, has been Leeds’s young sportswoman of the year for the past two years, but she put herself on the national map last night by storming home in a time of 1min 6.35sec ahead of Lorna Tonks of Australia and Jamaica’s Alia Atkinson. Atkinson looked in control of the race until the Briton next to her sensed a weakness on the home straight. Top trio: Gold medallist Sophie Taylor (centre) poses with runner-up Lorna Tonks (left) and bronze winner Alia Atkinson (right) Too strong: Taylor powers through the water on her way to winning gold for England . ‘I could see Alia next to me and could see that she was dying,’ Taylor said. ‘I just gave it my all.’ Earlier in this meeting, Taylor’s fellow English teens Ben Proud (in the 50m butterfly) and Adam Peaty (in the 100m breaststroke) took gold for England to inject some optimism into a British swimming revival at Olympic level. Peaty won another medal to add to this Games haul last night, taking silver in the 50m breaststroke behind Cameron van der Burgh of South Africa — the reigning Olympic 100m champion Peaty defeated a few days ago over that distance. Proud: Taylor takes in the atmosphere during an emotional medal ceremony . England’s Fran Halsall finished out of the medals in the 100m freestyle final, but compatriot Aimee Willmott won silver in the 200m fly and Adam Barrett won 100m fly bronze behind South African winner Chad le Clos. Taylor’s stated ambition is to compete at the Rio Olympics, where she would like to face one of her heroes, the Plymouth-based Lithuanian Olympic 100m champion Ruta Meilutyte, still only 17 herself. Among the things they have in common is a shared respect for Meilutyte’s coach Jon Rudd, who oversaw a pre-Commonwealth Games camp for the England team at the London Olympic pool.","Taylor came home in 1:06.35 to win gold .

"Teenagers Ben Proud and Siobhan O’Connor confirmed themselves as the rising stars of English swimming in the final session of this meet on Tuesday night, Proud taking his second gold of the Games and O’Connor winning a record-breaking sixth medal. England also took gold in the  4x100 metres medley relay, shocking the Australian favourites. Chris Walker-Hebborn, Adam Peaty, Adam Barrett and Adam Brown were the awesome foursome who did it in a Games record time. Peaty said: ‘These guys are like my brothers and we brought it home for England!’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Commonwealth Games: Day 6 review . Winner: Ben Proud celebrates winning the men's 50m freestyle on Tuesday night . Londoner Proud, 19, grew up in Malaysia and has hazy memories of the Kuala Lumpur Games of 1998, which ended on his fourth birthday. On Tuesday night he was a maker of memories for future generations, adding the 50m freestyle title to his 50m butterfly gold. He also leaves these Games with a bronze from the 100m freestyle relay. ‘It’s amazing to win two golds,’ he said. ‘To be honest I came here without expectations, just to gain experience and race against some great swimmers.’ O’Connor, 18, from Bilton, Oxfordshire, claimed a sixth medal of these Games by helping England to silver in the medley relay. Pace: The 19-year-old came home in 21.92 seconds - eight hundredths of a second in front of Cameron McEvoy . Talent: Jazz Carlin (left) won a silver medal in the women's 400m freestyle . No English woman in any sport has won more than six medals at a Games and only one woman before has won as many as six: swimmer Mel Marshall in 2006. O’Connor’s haul included a gold in the 200m individual medley  and therefore tops Marshall’s four silvers and two bronze. On an occasion that again stirred optimism for British swimming as a whole, Wales took a gold as Georgina Davies won the 50m backstroke in a Games record time, a silver as Jazz Carlin finished second in the 400m freestyle and a bronze as Daniel Jervis surged to a late third place in the 1500m marathon. Scotland got in on the act as Dan Wallace seized silver in the 200m individual medley behind Australia’s Dan Tranter but ahead of South African superstar Chad le Clos in third. This has been a redemptive experience for Wallace, 21, arrested in May in Florida, where he trains, for urinating on a police car. Making waves: Silver medalist Carlin of Wales competes in the Women's 400m freestyle final . He vowed to turn his life around and has done so in short order. He won gold in the 400m last week and said: ‘That silver was the cherry on top. When you’re on the BBC every night you definitely get a lot of attention from girls and boys. I just love the fans. ‘My dream is to be famous, so I guess this is where it all starts. Hopefully one day I’ll be a superstar in the sporting world.’ Proud produced a stunning burst in the ‘splash and dash’ 50m free on Tuesday night to finish in 21.91sec, ahead of the Australian duo of Cameron McEvoy and James Magnussen. A common thread to the English successes here has been Jon Rudd, coach of the Plymouth Leander club where Proud is based and also England coach for these Games. ‘He was just as happy as I was — it’s not just a gold for me, it’s a gold for him,’ Proud said. Good way to end: Daniel Wallace won a silver medal in the men's 200m individual medley . VIDEO Commonwealth Games: Day 6 review . ‘I managed . to keep my cool quite well,’ he added. ‘I’ve learnt from the past and . when I get too nervous I start blacking out and I can’t think what I’ve . got to do. For the finals it’s about getting every detail right.’ Carlin, . 23, took silver in the 400m free — won by Canada’s Lauren Boyle — to . add to the gold she won on Monday in the 800m. That and Davies’s gold . meant Wales won two swimming golds at a Games for the first time. Wallace . thrilled the home crowd by arriving poolside in a kilt. ‘The emotions . when I came out were amazing,’ he said. ‘Being the home nation we . thought we’d show our pride in our Scottish side and do a special thing . for the fans.’","Ben Proud wins gold medal in men's 50m freestyle .

"WIGGINS TO GET GB BACK ON TRACK . Bradley Wiggins can fill the leadership void in British track cycling, according to the man who now runs the sport. The home nations won just two gold track medals combined this Games, and British cycling technical director Shane Sutton admitted Team GB lacks leaders. On Wiggins’ decision to focus on Team GB, Sutton said: ‘It’s a massive boost. You need those big leaders and I think Sir Bradley coming back has given everyone a lift. Silver lining: Wiggins won his forth Commonwealth silver medal in the 4000m Men's Team Pursuit final . Northern Ireland’s Michael Conlan made the bantamweight quarter-finals by beating India’s Shiva Thapa. The 22-year-old was clearly punching above his weight when he took part in Ireland’s Celebrity Apprentice in 2013, though. He was fired in the third week after leading his team to a €10,000 loss. .......................................................................................................... England had to settle for silver in the men’s team table tennis, losing 3-1 to holders Singapore in a repeat of the Delhi 2010 final. Singapore took a 2-0 lead as Jian Zhan and Ning Gao beat Paul Drinkhall and Liam Pitchford respectively. Drinkhall and Andrew Baggaley halved the deficit by dispatching Ho Li and Ning Gao in the doubles, but the result was confirmed when Zhan beat Baggaley in the singles. AUSSIES STICK IT TO ENGLAND . England’s women were humbled 3-0 in the hockey by Australia, ending hopes of finishing top of their pool. Australia take their record to four wins from four - scoring 25 goals and conceding zero. Meanwhile, Scotland won 2-0 against Wales - a welcome result after their 9-0 thrashing by Australia. Not even Xenna Hughes, the daughter of Stoke boss Mark, could save Wales from a third defeat. Humbled: Australia cruised to a 3-0 victory over England's Women's hockey team for a forth straight win . It was a disastrous decathlon for Australia’s Jack Stein. The 20-year-old made two false starts in the first event - the 100m - meaning he was disqualified, therefore scoring no points and ending his medal hopes before the first starting gun had been fired. Two-time Games champion Denise Lewis had little sympathy for Stein: ‘Two false starts is unbelievable, you have nine events to go,’ she said. ‘I’m sorry for him, but you have to have discipline.’ MICK MISSES OUT WITH FINAL SHOT . Veteran shooter Mick Gault OBE stowed his air pistol for the last time on Monday, after failing to qualify for the final of the 50m pistol event. The  60-year-old from Norwich came out of retirement for these Games, and equalled the all-time medal tally on Saturday by winning bronze in the 10m air pistol - pulling level with Australian shooter Phillip Adams on 18 medals. Bowing out: Mick Gault OBE has retired for a second time following his exit from the 50m pistol event . A weightlifter from Papua New Guinea has been charged with allegedly sexually assaulting another man in the toilets of a Tesco near the athletes’ village on Sunday. Toua Udin, 22, spent the night in a cell following his arrest after finishing ninth in the 77kg category the same day. He has denied the charges. PRODIGY REBEKAH FALLS JUST SHORT . English weightlifter Rebekah Tiler came agonisingly close to a bronze medal in the 69kg weight category, twice narrowly failing to lift 123kg in the clean and jerk. Schoolgirl Tiler, 15, managed a highly respectable fourth place, with a combined total of 209kg. The event was won by Cameroon’s Marie Fegue - eight years Tiler’s senior - with a total lift of 234kg. Morgan Lake, 17, may not be appearing in Glasgow, but she won two golds at the World Junior Championships. After setting a new world youth record to win the heptathlon, she took gold in the high jump. It was clearly meant to be: there’s a lagoon in Oregon, where the event took place, called Morgan Lake.

"Arguably the performance of the night came from Jazz Carlin of Wales, who produced a brilliant swim to win the 800m freestyle and cement her place as the natural British heir to double Olympic gold-winner Becky Adlington over that distance. Carlin won in a time of 8min 18.11sec, which would have been good enough for a silver medal in the same event at London 2012, which she missed out on. The winner there was the American prodigy Katie Ledecky, 15 at the time, with Adlington in third. Carlin beat Lauren Boyle of New Zealand on to the silver step of the podium last night with Brittany MacLean of  Canada third. Most importantly, this was the first Games gold for a Welsh woman in 40 years — and only their second ever. Scroll down for video . All smiles: Gold medallist Jazz Carlin (centre) poses with runner-up Lauren Boyle (left) and third-placed Brittany Maclean (right) In full flow: Carlin broke her own Commonwealth Games record on her way to victory . In attendance to see her win it, and then collect her medal, were the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince Harry. The Duke was formerly known as William Wales when at university in Scotland and he sang every single word of the Welsh anthem, Land of My Fathers, here in Scotland last night. Carlin wept tears of joy on the podium at her third Commonwealth Games at the age of 23. Her struggles on the route to her triumph included missing London 2012, and then discovering in January her long-time American coach, Bud McAllister, was leaving Britain. Near-misses at big events, including fourth place in the 400m at the world championships in Barcelona last year due to an ill-timed finish, have also spurred her on. Relief: Carlin raises her arm in celebration after winning Wales' first swimming gold of the Games . VIDEO Commonwealth Games: Day 5 review . ‘I missed out on the London Olympics, I was really ill,’ she said. ‘I had glandular fever and it was a really tough time. ‘When you have failures and tough times, it makes the highs so much better. ‘Obviously I got pipped to fourth place at the world championships, got pipped in the last 50m, so this year, every race I’ve competed in I’ve made sure that I’ve got the strongest last 50m in the pool. ‘I knew in that race tonight that nobody was going to come back as hard and as fast as me.

"The Scots think of Irn-Bru as their national soft drink and for a long time it has been marketed under the slogan: ‘Made in Scotland from girders.’ Well, England’s Laura Trott, 5ft 4in and eight stone if she’s had a hearty breakfast, was made in Essex from tungsten. That’s certainly how it felt after the 22-year-old took an astonishing gold medal in the points race just days after being diagnosed with a kidney infection that left her feverish and barely capable of walking, let alone holding her own in the velodrome. ‘After the week I’ve had, this is right up there with the Olympics,’ she said moments after victory, sweat pouring off a diminutive frame that looked even smaller after her illness. Beaming, she added: ‘I am so over the moon right now, it’s so hard for me to describe.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Laura Trott win gold for England in Commonwealth Games . It's gold! Again!

Golden girl: Laura Trott celebrates with an England flag after her win in the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome . Emotional event: Trott poses on the track at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome after winning the points race . 1. Laura Trott (England) - 37 points . 2. Elinor Barker (Wales) - 37 points . 3. Katie Archibald (Scotland) - 33 points . Trott’s . medal on the last night of cycling here was the second and final track . gold for England at these Commonwealth Games, indeed the second and . final one for the home nations combined, the para-cycling events aside. England’s Sophie Thornhill and Scotland’s Neil Fachie won two each of . those. Trott’s . boyfriend and England team-mate Jason Kenny failed to make the keirin . final, while compatriot Jess Varnish had to settle for sprint bronze. As such, Trott’s gutsy glory went some way to saving face for the English (and British) as the  Australians turned the tables. At . London 2012, Team GB won seven of the 10 available golds on the track, . and Australia just one. Here, Australia won seven of 13 track golds and . England two. Glaswegians . appreciate a bit of grit and, my goodness, they  witnessed it as Trott, . a double Olympic champion from London 2012, drew on all her mental and . physical reserves to snatch victory in the final yards of a . 25-kilometre,  32-minute race. ‘The crowd were just unreal,’ Trott said. ‘When it came up on the screen that I’d won and they went mad, I was just so happy.’ This . was cat-and-mouse stuff, 80 laps of ebb and flow punctuated by 10 . frenetic sprints. By the time it was over, the crowd was almost as . feverish as Trott had been when she registered 38.9 degrees on her team . doctor’s thermometer in the early hours of Friday. Speedy: Trott amassed 37 points but had to rely on a photo finish to see off her Team GB teammate . Close run thing: Trott (left) and Elinor Barker (centre) approach the line ahead of the photo finish . Even . though the home hope, Katie Archibald, was beaten into third place, the . level of appreciation for Trott from a largely  Scottish crowd was . deafening. ‘I . can’t believe it,’ Trott said. ‘I felt so bad at times in that race. I . am just so glad I managed to get into that final sprint. I wouldn’t say I . am 100 per cent. I haven’t eaten properly for the last two days. I have . been living off porridge and I am not even a porridge fan!’ Points . are accrued from the 10 sprints spread across the race and, as Trott . crossed the line after 31 minutes and 48 seconds, she had amassed 37, . the same as Elinor Barker of Wales and four more than Archibald. The . only thing that separated Trott from Barker in the final  reckoning was . the order they had finished in the final surge. Archibald won that, and . Trott was just ahead of Barker. Trott . is shaping up to be one of Britain’s greatest female Olympians. No . other British woman has more than the two Olympic golds she won in . London and at her tender years she has multiple Games, and likely golds, . ahead of her. Here, . however, she flopped because of her illness in Friday’s individual . pursuit, not making it past the qualifiers, and was only 11th in . Saturday’s scratch race. ‘I was so devastated the night before the individual pursuit, because I knew something was wrong,’ she said. ‘I . couldn’t sleep that night. I went to the doctor and said something’s . wrong. He said there wasn’t. I said there definitely was! Proud parents: Trott embraces her dad Adrian and mum Glenda in the Glasgow crowd .

Girl with a golden touch: Trott holds her medal, with her nails painted in the red and white of England . ‘My back was really hurting.

I had a good feed on the way up, rested as . much as I could and  it paid off.’ The . race was intense, Trott taking the lead for the first time with just 20 . laps to go after winning the eighth sprint of 10. In that final frantic . dash, even as she crossed the line, she had no idea whether she had . succeeded. In fact, she believed Wales’s Barker had pipped her to glory. ‘I . cycled up alongside Elinor and said, “Well done, Commonwealth . champion”,’ she laughed. ‘Then it came up and I thought, “Oh c**p, she’s . going to think I said that on purpose”.’ Shane . Sutton, in charge of the English team here but also the supremo of . British Cycling, insisted last night that these Games were not a . disappointment for his riders —  and all would be well at the 2016 . Olympics. ‘I know we can be the best we can be in Rio,’ he said. ‘I know we’ll be ready. We’ve got a great team.’ But . he also admitted that the British riders did not undertake the full . taper preparation that the  Australians had done, and that he told Trott . before her race: ‘It’s all about Rio for you.

"Zoe Smith was famous as a teenager for being dubbed ‘Britain’s strongest schoolgirl’ and last night the weightlifter would give anyone a run for their money as the nation’s smiliest gold medal winner. The 20-year-old south London weightlifter, 5ft 2 and a half inches in her socks, spectacularly upgraded the Commonwealth bronze she won aged 16 in Delhi in her -58kg category four years ago to glittering gold here. In taking the title ahead of Nigeria’s Ndidi Winifred in second place and the veteran Wales lifter Michaela Breeze, 35, in third, Smith set a Games record for her total lift of 210kg and also a record of 118kg for her clean and jerk. Breeze’s snatch of 93kg was a Games record. Check: Zoe Smith bites her gold medal after triumphing in the 58kg weightlifting event in Glasgow .

After completing her last lift, Smith performed a backflip on the SECC stage and unleashed a megawatt smile that remained on her face until the medal presentation. It beamed through the anthem even as a few tears of joy fell. ‘Oh my God, I loved every second of that, I’m not on the planet at the moment,’ Smith said afterwards. ‘The Nigerian girl gave me a run for my money, but I got the gold. ‘I saw what the records were standing at only a few weeks ago, and thought to myself “I want that”. ‘I got really tired halfway through, but I just had to push through it. I knew Michaela was hot on my tail. She’s always the best in the snatch. ‘The support has been crazy. My  sister, mum and boyfriend are in the audience. Everyone has given up so much to support me and I’m so  grateful.’ Golden girl: Zoe Smith lifts 92kg in the snatch element of the women's 58kg weightlifting competition . Celebrate: Smith marks her winning lift with a backflip . On her Games record, she added: ‘I have done 118kg before and I knew I could do it, but doing it on the day, well, I just can’t believe it. I can go back to all the people and say: “Yeah, I got it.” Smith has not had always had the smoothest ride. She faced what she perceived as discrimination from those who thought weightlifting was macho, and had her funding put in jeopardy after Delhi. ‘But my team put a really good  campaign together and they made the right decision in giving me back my funding. I feel really lucky,’ she said. On her status as a role model as  a young woman in a sport where  sheer strength is key but not an  impediment to expressing her femininity, Smith said: ‘I love getting tweets from women and men saying I’m an inspiration. That drives  me on. ‘I am so touched when I get messages from support from other women and men too when they say I inspire them to go lifting.’ At London 2012, where she finished 12th in her class having endured taunts that female weightlifters looked like men, she said: ‘We don’t. I’m a girl, I wear make-up and lip gloss and things like that … What are you doing with your life?

"Alistair and Jonny Brownlee demonstrated their amazing powers of recovery on Saturday to lead a dominant England team to glory in the mixed team triathlon relay, just two days after winning gold and silver in the individual event. Olympic champion Alistair, 26, and London 2012 bronze winner Jonny, 24, along with team-mates Jodie Stimpson, 25, and Vicky  Holland, 28 — also displaying ‘bouncebackability’ after taking gold and bronze in the women’s individual event on Thursday — stamped their authority on the sport at Strathclyde Country Park. One incident threatened controversy — when Alistair was outside the changeover box as he began the fourth and final leg of England’s race, transitioning from Stimpson. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alistair and Jonny Brownlee reflect on Commonwealth gold . Victorious: Jonathan Brownlee, Jodie Stimpson, Vicky Holland and Alistair Brownlee celebrate . Crowded: South Africa, left, and Australia, right, flank the winning England team on the podium . Slow motion replays confirmed he was . clearly outside but, with the naked eye, race officials did not  spot . his error and England went unpunished. Even . if a sanction had been applied — and it would have been a 15sec penalty . during Alistair’s run — the result would not have changed. He was so . far clear of the field by the time he began his final leg he was able . to amble to the finish, literally. He . even stopped to collect a St George’s Cross flag from a supporter as he . breezed down the straight 48 seconds ahead of South Africa in second. England’s . total time was 1hr 13mins 24sec. South Africa won the silver in 1hr . 14min 13sec and  Australia took the bronze in 1hr 14min 14sec. As . if to emphasise what a breeze the race had been, Alistair attended the . medal ceremony, put on his backpack, hopped back on his  bike, and set . off on a ride back to his team hotel. ‘It’s . fantastic,’ he said of England’s win, stressing that he always planned . to give himself plenty of breathing room on the run  by destroying the . field during the ride. ‘It’s . a great way of testing our strengths and weaknesses. I knew I could run . all right so I was determined to win it on the bike.’ Leader: Alistair Brownlee celebrates as he reaches the finish line to win gold for England . Adulation: Brownlee high-fives the crowd as he crosses the line to win triathlon mixed team relay gold . After . winning the individual gold to complete a career medal set of every . conceivable honour in his sport, Alistair had joked he may now retire. But he clarified yesterday: ‘I’ve got no plans to retire, I have got a . few years in me left I think.’ With . the completion of all three Commonwealth Games triathlons — men’s, . women’s and mixed — England had taken five of a possible seven medals, . including all three golds. The . mixed event, in which each athlete completes a 400m swim, a 6km bike . and a 1.6km run, was  making its debut here at a major games. It . has been denied a spot at the Rio Olympics in 2016 but could feature in . the Olympic Games of 2020, and Britain would certainly welcome its . arrival. Asked if she . thought the International Olympic Committee (IOC) should consider . including it on the Olympic programme, Holland said: ‘I really hope so. Just look at the atmosphere it generates. ‘The lead changes so often. It’s  a great spectator event. Guys and girls in the same race — it’s unique.’ Alistair’s . only real competition yesterday was from his brother, with the pair . admitting before the race they would be comparing split times. Jonny . had got the better of Alistair  at the team championships in  Hamburg . two weeks ago, and his split was quicker than his older brother’s . yesterday, clocking 17min 29sec for his swim-cycle-run, with Alistair . clocking 17min 36sec. But if the latter had actually bothered to go full . pelt on his run, that gap would not have been there, or been reversed. Winners: England romped to victory in the triathlon mixed team relay final at Strathclyde Country Park . Handover: Vicky Holland tags Jonathan Brownlee during England's triathlon victory . However, Alistair remarked on how winning a joint medal with his brother was extra special. ‘It’s very different for us doing something as a team, although we race together all the time,’ he said. ‘To . be able to share an achievement is really good. We’ve raced so many . relays together over the years and we really enjoy doing it. It’s . fantastic to be able to do it on a major scale like we did today.’ Jonny, . meanwhile, admitted it was nice just to get on top of the podium: ‘It . feels a bit strange to win a gold medal finally but it’s nice. I want to . win but I normally get beaten by Alistair. To get a gold medal is . pretty special.’ England . trailed in fourth place after Holland’s leg, five seconds behind Canada . and with Northern Ireland and New Zealand ahead.

However, I’ve been in . these dream teams before and it’s not worked out, so I wasn’t hanging . the medal around our necks before the race. ‘The . Olympic distance hurts like hell but this hurts, too, probably because . you are racing for a team and putting everything on the line for them.’ Holland added: ‘We always  knew the relay was ours if we did everything we should do normally. ‘A . lot of the athletes were fresh as they had not raced on Thursday, so it . was important for for us to do  everything right and just get the job . done.’","Alistair Brownlee completed final leg of the sprint-triathlon stage .

"England’s Gemma Gibbons had to settle for a silver medal in her judo final last night but her household still took home one gold medal when husband Euan Barton triumphed for Scotland a few minutes later. Gibbons, 27, insisted she had failed: ‘I came here for one thing only and that was the gold so I’m disappointed with myself.’ But some consolation arrived within a few minutes, watching from the sidelines as Scotland’s opening ceremony flag-bearer Barton overpowered Shah Hussain Shah of Pakistan in the  -100kg division.

I know I can still be the best in the country and the best in the world . otherwise I wouldn’t be training every day. ‘This might have been a little bit soon for me but you can always say that. ‘Yes, I’ve had injuries and only been back a month or so after the shoulder op but I wasn’t good enough today.’ Barton . had effectively quit after London but changed his mind nine months ago . and decided to try and win gold on home soil. He confirmed last night he . would never fight again and was going out on a high. ‘It’s pretty amazing,’ he said of his win. ‘It probably hasn’t set in yet but it’s been a nervous day all round today.’ He . fought and beat three opponents in the morning to earn his final. ‘The . pressure is on right from the beginning of the day, my first-round . opponent I got rid of pretty quickly,’ he said. ‘Most people might think . that’s a good thing but actually it means you’ve not spent much time on . the mat so you’re still nervous for the second one. ‘My . second fight I wasn’t particularly good if I’m being honest, really . struggled. And it was three fights in quite quick succession this . morning because this weight category isn’t massively deep. Three matches . in 90 minutes was tough.’ His . overwhelming emotion, he insisted, was relief. ‘Later and tomorrow . it’ll start to become a bit a pride and excitement but it’s relief at . the moment,’ he said. ‘This . doesn’t make up for London.

"England’s Commonwealth Games diving team, led by Tom Daley, arrive in Glasgow on Thursday after a mid-air plane drama in which they felt certain they were about to die. The eight divers, who also comprise Great Britain’s ‘A team’ of talent at Olympic level, were left shaking and tearful after a flight from China to London had to make an emergency diversion which ended with a plunging, shuddering landing in Siberia. The incident happened on Monday, as the world remained in shock about the appalling loss of life in the Malaysian Airways tragedy last week over Ukraine. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Chris Mears discusses Commonwealth preparation . Fright: Tom Daley (left) and Chris Mears were on the plane when it had to make an emergency landing . With the divers’ Virgin Airways Airbus 340 dumping fuel as it descended and with some of the passengers believing they were about to be forced to make a dangerous landing on water, the British divers feared for their lives. ‘I thought we were going to die,’ said Chris Mears, a 21-year-old springboard specialist, who is one of the athletes Sportsmail is following on the Road to Rio. ‘It was scary beyond belief.’ Speaking exclusively to Sportsmail, Mears was the first of the divers to describe in detail how the  incident unfolded. He was travelling with seven other divers — Daley, Jack Laugher, Alicia Bragg, Becky Gallantree, Hannah Sterling, Sarah Burrow and Tonia Couch and eight GB  support staff on the way back from a World Cup event in Shanghai. The party also included Daley’s boyfriend Lance Black, aboard an aircraft carrying 301 people in total. The plane . took off on Monday morning, Chinese time and it became apparent after . around three hours into the trip that something was badly wrong. On board: Sarah Barrow (left) and Tonia Couch were also on the plane . VIDEO Glasgow ready for 2014 Commonwealths . ‘People around me were sleeping but I wanted to stay awake to try to get my body clock right for landing back in the UK,’ Mears said. ‘I was watching movies, and keeping an eye on the flight time to destination (clock). ‘And then suddenly it dropped from around eight hours remaining to an hour and 10 minutes, within a few seconds. ‘I knew something wasn’t right, and within a few moments an alarm went off, like a blaring klaxon, and then there was an announcement that there was a mechanical fault and we would need to land in Moscow.’ Mears was near the back of the plane, with his synchro partner Laugher on one side and Barrow on the other. Couch, distraught and panicking, was nearby. Daley, equally concerned, was seated a few rows back. The time . to destination clock then changed again, falling within a few minutes . from 50 minutes left to 30 minutes and then 14 minutes. In action: Tom Daley was competing in the World Cup before heading to the Commonwealth Games . ‘They’d seen that we weren’t going to reach Moscow,’ Mears said. ‘We were obviously going to come down wherever we could. ‘One of our team overheard a staff member on the plane suggesting that the pilot might have to land on water. There was no confirmation of this, no announcement, but there was a lake ahead.’ The pilot began dumping all the fuel stored in the wings. Some passengers mistook the hazy  dispersal to be smoke and began to fear the plane could be on fire. ‘Only a handful of us heard what we thought was a reference to landing on water,’ Mears said. ‘Tonia was so upset. Jack and I were trying to keep it together, almost laughing, although it was hysterical. What was going through my head was “The whole of Team GB is going to die here”.’The plane descended rapidly, although under control. Mears . assumed the pilot needed to get to the ground as quickly as possible to . reach the runway at the small  airport where they touched down, as . opposed to ditching on water. ‘When we hit the ground, the braking was about 10 times more sudden than usual, maybe because we didn’t have a lot of runway left,’ he said. More to come: Daley is looking to add to his Olympic bronze medal . The plane landed at a small  airport near Irkutsk in Siberia. There was a wait of around an hour as the craft was surrounded by fire engines before all the passengers disembarked, safe but shaken. ‘Tom was beside himself,’ Mears said. ‘It was so scary for everyone. We thought that was it.’ The  passengers spent Monday night  in a hotel in Siberia while Virgin sent another plane to bring them back to Britain. They arrived back on Tuesday and spent Thursday in London, preparing for their trip to Scotland by train. ‘What happened to us was insignificant compared to the awful events on flight MH17,’ Mears said. ‘Of course all our thoughts are with those victims and their families. ‘We also have nothing but thanks for Virgin, who got us safely on the ground, and then home. ‘Something like this definitely puts  things in perspective for all of us. ‘We’re just glad to be here, and grateful to be in a position to take part in a sports event.’","England's Commonwealth Games diving team feared for their lives after their flight from China to London was forced to make an emergency diversion .

"Two referees working at the World Cup have been identified as strong suspects in the fixing of international games, the Mail on Sunday can reveal. Sources say FIFA were informed during the current tournament that there is evidence of alleged past malpractice by at least two officials on duty. FIFA gather intelligence from associations and anti-corruption partners around the world on an ongoing basis. In recent times they have been swifter to act on intelligence than in the past. Questions: Two World Cup officials are under suspicion but there are no suggestions Ravshan Irmatov is one of them . But it is understood that by the time the latest information filtered up to FIFA’s security hierarchy in Brazil, the two referees in question had already officiated matches. The suspicions surrounding the officials are linked to historic games involving the ‘double whammy’ identifiers of unusual in-game incidents matched with highly unusual betting. FIFA responded to Mail on Sunday questions about the allegedly corrupt officials by saying: ‘It is important to note that we have no indications that the integrity of the FIFA World Cup has been compromised.’ There was no denial the information had been received or that it was considered serious. ‘Generally speaking, we are not in a position to comment or provide information on any match-manipulation investigations that are ongoing so as not to compromise investigations, nor do we provide any comments as to whether or not any investigations are underway,’ said a spokesman. Under fire: Cameroon's players were alleged to have taken bribes to fix their match against Croatia . Seeing red: Alex Song was sent off in Cameroon's 4-0 defeat to Croatia, leading to suspicions about the game . The tournament has already been rocked by allegations of fixing after German magazine Der Spiegel reported that convicted match-fixer Wilson Raj Perumal had told them before Cameroon’s group match with Croatia that Croatia would win 4-0 and Cameroon would have a man sent off. Perumal denies telling Der Spiegel this, saying he spoke to them after the match. FIFA have publicly requested that Der Spiegel supply evidence of their claims, with FIFA director of security, Ralf Mutschke, saying the allegations ‘put the integrity of FIFA World Cup matches in question, which is a serious allegation’ One source suggested to the Mail on Sunday that Der Spiegel may have been hoaxed by somebody on Facebook pretending to be Perumal. Der Spiegel has yet to hand any evidence to FIFA. Accused: Singaporean Wilson Raj Perumal  is alleged to have predicted Cameroon's 4-0 defeat . On the subject of the allegedly corrupt referees who have been working at Brazil 2014, a FIFA spokesman told the Mail on Sunday that any action taken against a corrupt party would become public only after such action had been sanctioned by various FIFA committees. ‘It would be only after a decision has been taken by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee or FIFA Ethics Committee and first notified to the parties concerned that FIFA would be in a position to communicate the contents of that decision publicly,’ said a spokesman. ‘FIFA continue to work closely with law enforcement agencies as well as the respective public authorities and other sports organisations on a national, regional and global level to tackle the issue of match manipulation. ‘And we encourage that anyone with information about any suspicious matches should contact relevant authorities such as through FIFA’s integrity hotline or email address and confidential reporting system.’","Suspicions relate to past games involving officials that had unusual in-game incidents and high betting .

"Benjamin Proud got England off to a flying start in the Commonwealth Games pool on Friday night. The 19-year-old Londoner landed gold for his country in the 50 metres butterfly, the first final of a pulsating evening session, leaving South African superstar Chad le Clos among those in his wake.

I just treated it like any other race, but now tears are almost in my eyes.’ Giant killer: Benjamin Proud is congratulated by Olympic superstar Chad le Clos (L) Proud only made his big breakthrough last year, being the top home sprinter at the British international meet in Leeds in March 2013, when he won 50m butterfly gold and 50m freestyle silver. Then, in a race that marked him out as one to watch, he broke Mark  Foster’s 10-year-old British 50m butterfly record in the semi-finals of the British Championships as he took the fly title.

"Chris and Gabby Adcock claimed Commonwealth Games gold for England with a convincing victory over Chris Langridge and Heather Olver in the mixed doubles final. The husband-and-wife duo, ranked five in the world, lived up to their top-seed billing as they powered to a 21-9 21-12 win over their international team-mates at the Emirates Arena. The Adcocks did not relinquish their grip after imposing themselves on the second seeds early in the first game and they went on to wrap up victory in 35 minutes.

Golden couple: Husband and wife Adcocks won in straight sets 21-9 21-12 at the Emirates Arena . The Adcocks' victory capped a superb tournament in which they were hardly troubled and did not drop a single game. The most points they conceded in any one game in their five matches was 17. For Gabby Adcock the gold added to the bronze she won in the women's doubles with Lauren Smith while both she and Chris were part of the silver-medalling England side in the team event. Langridge and Olver, although completely outplayed, could also reflect on a good Games. Both had a hand in the team success while Langridge will also go home with a bronze medal from the men's doubles. The future of Langridge and Olver as a partnership is uncertain as Badminton England consider a reshuffle ahead of the 2016 Olympics. Team to beat: The Adcocks didn't drop a single game in the whole tournament on their way to gold . The Adcocks are certain to spearhead the British drive for Rio in mixed doubles, with their success in Glasgow considerably enhancing their reputation even though it was a non-ranking event. Chris, 25, and Gabby, 23, who were married last year, have made strong progress since being restored as an on-court partnership after London 2012. Chris had played at the Olympics with Scotland's Imogen Bankier. Their dominance of the Commonwealth Games competition was underlined in a one-sided final in which Langridge and Olver never won more than two points in succession. Gabby Adcock said: 'We're over the moon with this gold. There was a lot of pressure coming into this tournament, being number one seeds, but we played so well this week. 'We kept our calm, tried to enjoy it. We are exhausted now but we couldn't be happier.' Second best: Chris Langridge (left) and Heather Olver (right) collected silver in an England one-two .

Murray has not dropped a set in four matches, winning in straight sets against David Goffin, Blaz Rola and Roberto Bautista Agut before Anderson.  This is the third time he has reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals without dropping a set, the two previous occasions being 2010 (when he made the semis) and 2013 (winner).

"England secured a dramatic Commonwealth Games bronze in the men's hockey with a penalty shootout victory over New Zealand on Sunday morning. Having led 2-1 and 3-2 at Glasgow Green, England were pegged back to 3-3 in regulation time by Simon Child's equaliser. But Bobby Crutchley's side held their nerve in the shoot-out to prevail 4-2 and clinch a second hockey medal in little over 12 hours. Jumping for joy: England players celebrate winning bronze in a penalty shootout against New Zealand . England's women had to settle for silver after losing on penalties to Australia following a thrilling final on Saturday night. England's men had been beaten to bronze on flicks in the third-place play-off in Delhi four years ago.Child opened the scoring for New Zealand but Alastair Brogdon soon equalised from close range and a penalty corner strike four minutes before half-time from Ashley Jackson put England in front. Another penalty corner from Jackson in the second half restored England's lead after Andy Hayward had levelled for New Zealand, but Child's late effort - through the legs of England goalkeeper George Pinner - took the game to a shoot-out. Match-winning moment: Ashley Jackson scored the decisive strike to England a 4-2 penalty shootout win . Pinner's save from Blair Hilton swung the advantage England's way and a miss from Child meant the outcome rested on Simon Mantell's shoulders. He was fouled by New Zealand goalkeeper Devon Manchester and, after a failed video referral, England were awarded a penalty stroke. Jackson emphatically scored, before being mobbed by his team-mates. Crutchley was happy to see his side come out on the right side of a shoot-out, and hailed their Glasgow 2014 experience. 'We lost to them (New Zealand) in a shoot-out last January, so we were as prepared as we could be for this,' he said. 'It was a very tough game for both teams. I'm happy the guys got rewarded with a bronze medal this time, because we have finished fourth too many times.' Hero: England goalkeeper Blair Hilton (left) saved New Zealand penalties during their bronze medal shootout . He added of the Games: 'It's been fantastic. I'm amazed with the amount of English people who made the trip to come see us play. We play in great stadiums, but here it was just amazing.' In the gold medal match, Australia cruised to a fifth straight Commonwealth title with a 4-0 triumph over India in what was a repeat of the 2010 Delhi final. Australia defender Chris Ciriello scored two drag flicks in the first half and completed his hat-trick early in the second half, with Eddie Ockenden sealing matters 20 minutes from time. 'They're a really good team, have the skills and are very fast,' Ciriello said of India. 'We were working hard in that game and I was lucky enough to bag a couple from the corners.'

"Chris Froome was such a disappointment to Team Sky less than three years ago that manager Dave Brailsford was ready to dump him — and told a rival team he was going to be available. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that on the eve of the Vuelta a España in August 2011, Brailsford told a senior official from RadioShack that Froome was among riders whose contracts were expiring and who were not in Sky’s plans for 2012. Turnaround: In 2013 Froome won the Tour de France for Team Sky but two years earlier they didn't want him . In the shadow: Before 2012 Froome (left) was firmly in the shadow of Bradley Wiggins (centre) Sources say both teams were staying at the same hotel in Benidorm, and the pair were discussing their rider requirements. RadioShack were interested in Sky’s Steve Cummings but Brailsford said he was already planning to go elsewhere. ‘Dave then suggested that RadioShack might be interested in Froome,’ said a source with knowledge of the meeting. ‘He made it clear things weren’t working out as envisaged and that Froome might be able to do a job elsewhere.’ RadioShack did not see Froome as the kind of rider they needed. Touted: Froome was offered to RadioShack but they too were not keen on the British rider . Abandoned: Froome was almost dropped by Sky until a strong perfomance in 2010 changed their minds . As it transpired, Froome rode the race of his life over the next few weeks, finishing second in a breakthrough event that changed the course of his entire career. Sky retained him and bumped up his £80,000-a-year wages. He went on to became an integral part of Bradley Wiggins’s Tour win in 2012 before winning it himself in 2013. Froome has credited his rise in part to diagnosis and treatment of bilharzia, a tropical disease he had been unwittingly carrying until late 2010, when he embarked on a three-year battle to get rid of it.","In 2010 Sky offered British rider to RadioShack .

Wiggins, a four-times Olympic gold medallist, 2012 Tour de France winner and Knight of the realm, said: ‘It takes four people to be on par and firing on all cylinders to succeed (in the pursuit) and (this team) all had different preparation this year. So there’s a lot of positives to take from it.’ He added: ‘I don’t want to sound like (England manager) Roy Hodgson, but we’ve definitely got some work to do.’ Wiggins said there was no doubt in his mind that he still  has the ability to be competitive on the track at world level. ‘I certainly have answered the questions on whether I can still do it or not, but I still think there’s room for improvement and it’s going to take a lot of dedication to the track,’ he said. ‘We were all just on different levels. And the strategy was that if I could go longer and ease the strain off, that’s what team pursuit is about, getting the four riders to the finish. It’s not going to be easy. The  Australians set the standard again. Dejected: Wiggins looks glum after losing out on gold to Australia in the men's team pursuit final .

VIDEO Commonwealth off to thrilling start & medal table . ‘We’ve been in that position before and it’s not a bad position to be in. We’ve done two world-class rides from four weeks together.’ Wiggins has been surprised by the warm welcome the England team have had north of the border. ‘The buzz around the city has been incredible. You get free coffees and everything,’ he said. ‘I think it’s surprised all of us especially being from England.’ This was his first and only event of these Games and he will not compete in another. ‘I rode [in my first Commonwealth Games] 16 years ago, so I won’t be riding in another,’ he said. ‘But the atmosphere of it. I really enjoyed it.’ He revealed further grand tours on the road will be ruled out because ‘heavier, more explosive’ road riding will not be compatible with the track regime he will need for Rio. ‘I don’t think the road will complement it,’ he said. Forward planning: Wiggins has ruled himself out of future road races as he prepares for the 2016 Olympic Games . Same again: English trio (from left to right) Kian Emadi, Jason Kenny and Philip Hindes also won silver in the team sprint . After Wiggins silver, England’s men’s sprint team — Jason Kenny, Philip Hindes and Kian Emadi — were also beaten to the gold, by New Zealand — who ended a  12-year Kiwi gold drought in track cycling in the process. But there was some good news for English cycling as teenager Sophie  Thornhill took the first para-cycling gold medal of the Games by  winning the tandem sprint for blind and visually-impaired athletes. The 18-year-old from Cheshire, riding with pilot Helen Scott, 24 today, has a form of albinism that gives her only nine per cent vision. The pair were thrilled to top the podium at the Chris Hoy velodrome by beating Scots Aileen McGlynn and Louise Haston in the final. ‘We’ve only been together three months this time, but we were together for four months before and it has just fallen into place,’ Thornhill said. Para-cycling is in the Commonwealth Games for the first time, and she added: ‘Now we’ve put on a good show perhaps it can feature in future Games.’ On winning in Scotland, she said: ‘I’m not gonna lie, it feels really good, it feels like a home Games.’","Australia emerged victorious with a winning margin in excess of five seconds at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome .

"Matthew Hudson-Smith produced a storming final leg to win Commonwealth Games gold for England's men in the 4x400 metres relay. The 19-year-old, competing at his first senior major championship, picked up the baton in second, but passed Trinidad and Tobago's Zwede Hewitt with 200m to go and, just when it seemed he had saved nothing for the finish, managed to hold off Chris Brown of the Bahamas to take the title.

"Manchester United’s final game of the season. It’s often an irrelevance. It’s usually because the title is sewn up, with the fans anticipating one final bow, trophy in tow. This year, obviously, things are a little different. It is an irrelevance in terms of results – a probably unwanted Europa League campaign aside – but for vastly different reasons. Louis van Gaal will be working from a clean slate as United slipped to an unprecedented seventh in the league, lurching from disaster to disaster under David Moyes. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal's hands-on approach during Holland training . Big job: Louis van Gaal has much work to do when he takes over at Manchester United . Season of woe: Last year's champions Manchester United have slumped to seventh position in the league . The dawning of this new era, while exciting and relieving for the Old Trafford faithful, may not be the best news for some of the players. Almost as hotly-anticipated as the new manager is the thought of a squad revamp, with a huge amount of deadwood being whittled down. With the departure of Inter-bound Nemanja Vidic already confirmed, a few more United stalwarts could follow the big Serb out of the exit door. Rio Ferdinand’s future is one of the most up in the air. Looking a dead certainty to move when Moyes was in charge, it seems he could possibly now stay at Old Trafford. However, the former England defender – and not many have been crying out for his return to the squad for next month’s World Cup – doesn’t stack up compared to others in his position. Left trailing: This graphic shows that Ferdinand does not stack up compared to his fellow defenders . Out of statistics including tackles, blocks, interceptions and duels won in the air and overall, Ferdinand isn’t anywhere near the top of the pile at United on any count – even taking into account his relative lack of game-time. On two crucial counts – aerial battles and tackles – he’s the weakest by a distance. Ferdinand has never been a John Terry (or, indeed, Vidic) style rough and ready defender, but a player of his experience and stature should not be lagging behind arguably similar style players like Chris Smalling. Should he stay or should he go? Rio Ferdinand's (right) future at Old Trafford is uncertain . It seems every player linked with a summer move to Old Trafford is a central midfielder. It doesn’t say a lot for United’s only signing of the summer, Marouane Fellaini. Becoming synonymous with the reign of Moyes is not something that’s going to stand anyone in good stead for a successful career at United. Bought to be the all-encompassing midfielder United have so desperately needed – many would say the gaping chasm in the side even Sir Alex Ferguson failed to remedy – the Belgian has come up short on every count. Little impact: This pitch map shows where Marouane Fellaini has created five chances from this season . He’s created just five chances for his team-mates this season, making just four other key passes. For a player meant to be the driving force in United’s midfield, this is ludicrously poor. One of these came post-Moyes against Hull on Tuesday – for James Wilson’s first goal – and just one all season came from that crucial area just inside the opposition half, the area he was bought to dominate. His current manager, Ryan Giggs – at 40 years old – creates more than Fellaini. Flop: Fellaini was United's only signing last summer and has come up short at Old Trafford . It may finally be time for the sun to set on Giggs’ glorious career, winning just over 29 per cent of his duels against opposition players in his 505 minutes of Premier League football this season, but he’s still managed to make more incisive passes than Fellaini. Giggs’ former role, that of the physics-defying flying winger, has been yet another problem for United this season. Antonio Valencia is surely entering his final weeks as a United player. Comparing him with out-and-out wingers at other top clubs shows him in a very poor light. On the wing: This graphic compares Antonio Valencia with out-and-out wingers at other top clubs . Manchester City’s Jesus Navas, Chelsea’s Andre Schurrle and Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling all beat him on almost every count. Valencia doesn’t create enough chances, provide enough threat on goal, or win enough one-on-one battles with his opposite man. The only counterpart he beats on any statistic is Schurrle on going past players. Chelsea’s German winger makes up for that by providing the most attacking threat of his own accord. Poor show: Antonio Valencia (left) is lacking on almost every count when compared to other top wingers . Players who pass to Rooney more than anyone in bold . Carrick 188 . Mata 103 . Evra 100 . Valencia 94 . Fellaini 84 . One of the few players to emerge with credit this season has been Wayne Rooney. The England striker never seemed to give up when the chips were seriously down under Moyes. However, United have built their game around him too heavily. A whole host of players have played more passes to Rooney than anyone else in the side. While Rooney has created an impressive 56 chances – by far United’s most – he hasn’t always been able to carve out the required ball. His go-to pass, for example, is back to Michael Carrick – who he has passed to more than double the amount of times he’s passed to Robin van Persie – 135 to 50. Up for the fight: Wayne Rooney is one of the few United players to emerge with credit this season . It’s true, that figure is dampened by Van Persie’s availability, but surely Van Gaal will keep faith with his compatriot. If Rooney’s face is going to fit at the new United, he may have to learn to play second fiddle to his supposed strike partner. The England star excels at dropping deep and feeding off another striker, yet with signings surely on the way – not to mention Juan Mata’s designs on the playmaker role – Rooney could find this season’s efforts in vain.","More United players could follow Nemanja Vidic out of the exit door when the new manager arrives at Old Trafford .

"Jose Mourinho has confirmed he wants Didier Drogba back at Stamford Bridge. The Chelsea manager has recruited Diego Costa as his new star striker, but he sees Drogba as a valuable member of his squad going into the new campaign. ‘We think about it,’ said  Mourinho of Drogba. ‘We want to win matches and win titles and Didier is one of the best strikers in Europe. VIDEO Scroll down for Mourinho wants Drogba return . Coming home? Jose Mourinho has revealed he would like Didier Drogba (above) to return to Chelsea . ‘He is still very adapted to the needs of the Premier League and we are thinking about it in a  non-emotional way. ‘If you bring him back it is not because he is Didier or scored the most important goal in the history of Chelsea, or because I read I need an assistant, no. ‘If I bring him back, and the decision has to be made soon, it is because as a player he has qualities to make the team stronger. The team is not about the eleven. It is about the different options and as an option I would not say no about the possibility.’ Leader: Mourinho (right) struck up a brilliant relationship with the Chelsea legend . VIDEO Mourinho wants Drogba return . Mourinho might insist any  decision to bring back Drogba will be non-emotional but he does recognise the 36-year-old ‘belongs’ to Chelsea. ‘With Didier’s profile, being a squad player I think could be important for any team,’ he said. ‘And because we know his heart is pushing him to where he feels he belongs, and because our boss  (owner Roman Abramovich) has this big feeling towards him, we are thinking about the possibility. Mr Abramovich is very intelligent and he feels that people belong to the club. We feel that Didier belongs to us. Is he coming back as a player one more year or a couple more years? Let’s see.’ Mourinho likens Drogba to Frank Lampard, who was unveiled at New York City on Thursday. He said: ‘The way Mr Abramovich approached the Frank Lampard situation is amazing: “You go if you want to go; you come back if you want to come back. And you come back the way you want — to be an assistant, to be an ambassador, to be a director, to be a coach, to be an assistant coach”. That is fantastic.’ Meanwhile, Mourinho faces a delicate balancing act as he tries to keep two world-class goalkeepers happy this season. Ian Rush: 168 goals in six seasons at Liverpool. Had a year in Italy and hit 182 upon his return. Mark Hughes: 47 Manchester United goals before moves to Barcelona and Munich. 115 goals in his second spell. Robbie Keane: Scored plenty in his first stint at Tottenham (107 goals) but fewer (just 15) during his second and was loaned to Celtic and West Ham. Teddy Sheringham: Returned to Spurs in 2001 after four seasons at Old Trafford and hit another 26 goals. Thierry Henry: Club legend went back to Arsenal on loan and scored on his debut. Hit 228 goals overall. Robbie Fowler: 171 goals in his first nine-year stay at Liverpool but only hit 12 on his return. Support: Chelsea fans may witness the 'Return of the King' this summer . Silverware: Drogba won 10 trophies during his time with the west London club . Petr Cech was understandably delighted here on Wednesday night after completing his first game since dislocating his shoulder in April. But it was not long before the talk turned to the imminent arrival of Thibaut Courtois, the 22-year-old who has starred for Atletico Madrid — and is 10 years his junior. ‘I don’t want to sit on the bench,’ said Cech. ‘I always give my best and obviously that is all I can do. I will do my best and do everything I can do to be as ready as possible for when the season starts. Jose Mourinho will make his choice and decide how his team is going to look for the first game,  second game, third game,  whatever game. Safe hands: Petr Cech was delighted to get his first 90 minutes of football after dislocating his shoulder last season . Competition: Thibaut Courtois will return to Chelsea and battle for the No 1 shirt . ‘It is up to us players to show we are ready to play and make him pick us. I am doing everything I can to make him pick me.’ Right now Cech is simply pleased to be back in shape. ‘It’s great to be back,’ he said.  He deserves credit given it was said he would not return from his injury until September. ‘I spent the days at Cobham working,’ he said. ‘I did as much as I could. If you keep working, you push the boundaries to the limit.’ It means he is ready to take on the challenge of Courtois. Or a challenge at a new club should Mourinho opt for the younger man before the transfer window closes.

"With star summer signings Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas still on a beach after the World Cup, it was left to Chelsea’s young charges to take care of their first pre-season friendly at Wycombe. Aided by stalwarts John Terry, Branislav Ivanovic and Nemanja Matic, the young Blues side stormed to a 5-0 win with many of the younger charges impressing. Here, Sportsmail looks at some of the starlets on display Jose Mourinho may be running the rule over to supplement his first-team set-up. VIDEO Scroll down to watch new signing Kurt Zouma's first Chelsea interview . Watchful eye: The performances of some of Chelsea's youngsters will have given Mourinho food for thought . PATRICK BAMFORD . Bamford lit up the lower leagues last season, at MK Dons in League One before spending the second half of the campaign notching up a good record at Championship side Nottingham Forest.Wearing Chelsea’s yellow No 9 shirt, Bamford started at Wycombe and broke the deadlock in the first half. His goal showed off his main asset – a well-taken, instinctive first-time finish from Ake’s cross from the byline – everything Chelsea’s goal-shy strikers were missing last season. Bamford’s display wasn’t limited to opening the scoring, however, as he was soon in his own penalty area saving a certain equaliser with a goal-line clearance. The Blues are famously light up front – new signing Diego Costa excepted – with Fernando Torres continuing to disappoint and Romelu Lukaku looking for opportunities elsewhere, so it is actually possible Bamford could have some role to play in the first team this season. However, to continue his steady development with more game-time, a Premier League loan could be the way forward. Impress there and the sky’s the limit. Potential: Patrick Bamford celebrates putting Chelsea ahead in their pre-season opener . KURT Zouma . Jose Mourinho splashed £12million on the French under-21 defender in January, but this was his first outing in Chelsea colours, having been loaned straight back to St. Etienne. Zouma came on mid-way through the first half for the injured Todd Kane at right-back, not his normal position. He made attempts to offer width by bombing up Wycombe’s unguarded flank, occasionally showing a rashness of touch that match fitness will no doubt sharpen. The 19-year-old looked far more assured once moved to centre-half next to John Terry. Showing awareness, calmness and the no-nonsense physical style that became his trademark in the French league, the defender will have impressed the travelling support. With David Luiz out of the picture and last season’s back-up Tomas Kalas famed out on loan, Zouma now has every chance of cementing a squad place as Chelsea’s third-choice centre-half. Dominant: Kurt Zouma looked comfortable at the back for Chelsea during their easy win . IZZY BROWN . Chelsea snapped up the 17-year-old from West Brom last year and the striker – a regular for England under-17s – impressed in the Blues youth academy last season. Brown entered the fray in the second half at Adams Park, and immediately made his mark by deftly turning diminutive left-back Jay da Silva’s cross into the top corner to double Chelsea’s lead. After John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic showed their experience by putting the game out of Wycombe’s reach, Brown completed the rout with the goal of the night – a first-time right-footed thunderbolt from outside the area. Brown’s impressive technique and physicality should see him a success in the English game, but at just 17 perhaps a loan move beckons for his development this campaign. Youthful quality: Izzy Brown is congratulated after scoring to double Chelsea's lead at Adams Park . JEREMIE BOGA . Chelsea took control of the game at Wycombe in the second half, with four of the five goals coming once the experienced Terry, Ivanovic and Matic came on. However, it wasn’t those Blues stalwarts that most caught the eye. Although Brown’s two goals grabbed the headlines, 17-year-old Boga became the team’s playmaking fulcrum, with Chelsea’s attacking movement going through him. Considered one of the brightest prospects in the Cobham academy and consistently playing above his age group, Boga won’t be troubling the first team this season but may look to cement his role as one of the key players for Chelsea’s trophy-laden under-21 side. Impressive: Jeremie Boga had a hand in a couple of goals at Adams Park as Chelsea won 5-0 . MARCO VAN GINKEL . The Dutch midfielder cruelly had a promising campaign last season cut short thanks to a cruciate ligament injury in the Capital One Cup at Swindon. This his first first-team appearance since then, Van Ginkel took control of midfield in his first half role, showing the wide array of passing that impressed fans on his arrival at the club last summer. On the fringe of the Holland national side, Van Ginkel has work to do if he is to muscle his way into the reckoning in an ever-more competitive Chelsea midfield. Van Ginkel is capable of sitting in a central ‘two’ in Mourinho’s 4-2-3-1 formation, a position possibly not suited to the more attacking Cesc Fabregas. If being able to be called upon to sit alongside Nemanja Matic can become a unique selling point then Van Ginkel can be a vital squad player for the Blues this season – if not a loan move beckons.

"Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent. World Cup Golden Boot winner James Rodriguez dominates the headlines in the Madrid dailies as European champions Real look to sign the Colombia star. Marca claim Monaco want another €10million for Rodriguez, which would push the fee up from €75m to €85m, but that the player is already looking for a house in the city. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rodriguez winning the Golden Boot and pranking teammtes . King James: Both Madrid dailies lead with the impending transfer for James Rodriguez to Real . AS are confident Rodriguez will be a hit, saying, James is ready. They insist the forward already has a place reserved for himself at Real's Valdebebas training ground. Both papers report that Rodriguez has to meet up with Monaco on Monday, but this will probably be to say his goodbyes. The formalities of the move will be sorted out when Angel Di Maria leaves the Bernabeu, claims AS. One player who has already left Real is Alvaro Morata, with the forward heading for Juventus. Marca say Madrid will carry on 'without a No 9', while their former striker Ronaldo has congratulated them on signing 'the best player from the World Cup,' Toni Kroos. Across the Spanish capital, AS report that champions Atletico are looking to add a big signing ahead of their pre-season tour. The names the paper have thrown into the mix are Italy forward Alessio Cerci, of Torino, and Benfica midfielder Nicolas Gaitan. Both papers have pictures of new Barcelona coach Luis Enrique and goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen at training. Sport leads with a battle between Bayern Munich and Barca for Colombia's attacking midfielder Juan Cuadrado, with Fiorentina wanting €42million. Star in stripes: The Italian dailies are full of the transfer of Roberto Pereyra from Udinese to Juventus . In Italy, the big news is Juventus's signing of Roberto Pereyra from Udinese. The midfielder will join on Monday but may not get to play with Arturo Vidal. The Manchester United target is open to a move away from Juve and admits he does not know if he will stay. However, if he does stick with the Italian champions, he says he will 'give it my all'.

"Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher may need surgery on a toe he broke in the last game of last season and is in danger of missing the start of pre-season under new manager Louis van Gaal. The Scotland captain will see a specialist this week and if he requires an operation to correct the injury he is likely to be out for at least a month. Any absence would be another blow for the 30-year-old who only returned to first team action at the turn of the year after a lengthy lay-off due to a bowel problem. Under the knife? Darren Fletcher could miss United's pre-season if he needs surgery for a broken toe . He is desperate to get a full close season of preparation under his belt after making a full recovery from ulcerative colitis which had threatened to end his career and troubled him for more than two years. Fletcher made 12 appearances after his return in December, including the 1-1 final day draw at Southampton. He started and finished the game and was only made aware of the broken toe after the game. Manchester United medical staff and doctors decided the injury did not need surgery initially but the toe has been slow to heal properly and the club and player want a fresh opinion to decide if an operation is now necessary.

Any extra money will be donated to a charity that has yet to be decided. ‘Thank you for your time, effort and donations. ‘RIP to John Alder and Liam Sweeney, who were both far too young.’ Following news of the loss, Newcastle manager Alan Pardew said: 'Myself and all the players are deeply shocked and saddened by this terrible news. We all knew how passionately John and Liam supported the team and the club.

"Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin wants to join Tottenham ahead of neighbours Arsenal. Arsene Wenger is a confirmed admirer of the 24-year-old France international and Arsenal have opened discussions over a proposed move to bring him to The Emirates - but Schneiderlin wants to re-join former boss Mauricio Pochettino instead.

We have to stop blaming players like Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard... there was talk about how they had lost heart, they hadn’t given enough for their country. I promise you, this is absolute rubbish. When a player pulls on an England shirt he will do anything to win for his country.

Roy Hodgson, England and the FA must do the same after 2014 World Cup .

We need to get our priorities straight - the game starts at grassroots .
Youth development needs looking at because the national team is suffering .
Do this, and we'll be in the World Cup final in the future like Germany are .
They introduced more and better coaching. Ten years on from that 2001 defeat, England had 2,769 UEFA (Pro, A or B) licensed coaches compared to 34,970 in Germany. England need more coaches and more highly-qualified coaches working at all levels of the game.
They made sure there was more game time for young players. Young players in German academies have roughly five times the game time that those in English academies have. The grass-roots game is where footballing greatness starts. We have to get our youth football right.
They made sure there was a clearly defined route between the grassroots and the national game, so that good players were fast-tracked into the senior set-up. We need to make sure this is happening in England, too. A proper structure means we keep talented players in the game.
They made sure they took responsibility for youth development and the future of the Germany team. It feels as if that task has been handed to club academies and centres of excellence in this country, which means there is not an England development programme but club development programmes. This is fine but it means the importance of winning games at a young age comes at the expense of developing technique and it means that if the clubs get it wrong, the England team suffer. The FA need to take more control.
In Germany they sorted out what their footballing philosophy was. They were clear about what they wanted from players and how to achieve it. There needs to be an FA philosophy on how to develop players. What is the FA’s philosophy on the game? Most people think that a more technical, possession-based game has been lacking in English football. Are the FA addressing this? What is being done? The FA need to instill a football intelligence in young players and this needs to be reflected in every side from the first team to the Under 16s, so the players understand the England way of playing."
"Former Republic of Ireland winger Damien Duff is poised to move to Australia and become the first major signing for the club bought by Manchester City’s owners. The 35-year-old, who announced his decision to quit relegated Fulham this week, will join the A-League after the World Cup Finals. He will become the first major signing for the newly-formed Melbourne City, who are hoping to change their name from Melbourne Heart in time for next season. City’s Abu Dhabi-based owners, who have also purchased sides in New York and Japan since acquiring Manchester City six years ago, are hoping to build a competitive side Down Under. Heart are currently bottom of the A-League. Heading Down Under: Damien Duff has signed for Australian A-League club Melbourne City on a one-year deal . Duff, capped 100 times by Ireland, had been linked with a return to his home country and a role with Bray Wanderers in the SSE Airtricity League. But he has turned his back on a potential return to the Premier League or any moves to clubs in Europe, or even a drop to the Championship with Fulham, to move Down Under. Duff will take a summer break with his family before moving to Melbourne for the second part of their season. He has had his pick of A-League sides, including Heart’s city rivals Melbourne Victory, Sydney FC and Perth Glory. City’s backers are prepared to match Duff’s wage demands. His decision to quit Europe for a lucrative move to Australia will still come as a surprise, even though he made just 11 league appearances last season. New chapter: The 35-year-old brought an end to his five-year spell at Fulham and will head to the A-League . Former Chelsea and Newcastle midfielder Duff left Craven Cottage after five years and nearly 200 games, following their relegation from the Premier League, and was looking for a new challenge.‘It was time for everyone, for me and the club to part ways,’ he said. ‘It’s sad but that’s the way it is.‘I’ve matured as a person and a player at Fulham. ‘Since I’ve been here I’ve got married, had two kids, so it has been a special time in my life and I stand by what I’ve said before that my most enjoyable time in football has been at Fulham.’ But Duff, who is signing an initial two-year deal, will be by far the biggest foreign star Melbourne has attracted since the A-League was founded 10 years ago. Former Liverpool midfielder Harry Kewell is currently playing for the club, who are managed by Dutch coach John van’t Schip.","Damien Duff will move to the A-League this summer .

"I don't think I will shock anyone when I predict Germany will win by two goals. They have been played with confidence and mastery - clinical and composed. Argentina have barely got over the line. They simply haven't been exhilarating at any point and with no team pattern of play, they're a bit like Brazil in that respect. When they come up against a well-drilled Germany team, it is going to be tough. Disappointing: Argentina haven't been exhilarating at any point and with no team pattern of play . What Argentina must do to win . 1 They need to play to win. So far they have played to not get beaten - that won't win you a World Cup. 2 They need to keep the ball. If Germany don't have it, they can't score, and if Argentina have the ball, they can. 3 Lionel Messi is the player who can win this for them but his team-mates need to give him the ball much higher up the pitch than they have been. He needs to be receiving the ball in the final third so he hasn't got a long way to get to the goal. Germany are going to be watching Messi like a hawk. Get the ball to him when he's as close to the German goal as possible, then let him do his magic … that's the best chance they've got. Plan: If Argentina have the ball, Germany need to crowd Lionel Messi out of the game like Holland did . What Germany must do to win. 1 . Germany need to keep possession. Basically, their task is to keep the . ball away from Messi, and the simplest way to do this is to keep hold of . the ball. If Argentina don't have the ball, they can't pass it to . Messi. 2 . If Argentina have the ball, Germany need to crowd Messi out of the game . like Holland did in their semi-final.

"Brazil played their best football of the tournament so far in beating Colombia on Friday but I fear the  semi-final on Tuesday in Belo Horizonte against Germany will be as far as they go. At this point, and based on all the evidence we’ve seen so far, Germany are now favourites to win this World Cup. The Germany-France match was, to put it bluntly, largely boring. France missed that l bit of spark that the absent Franck Ribery could have provided to tee up Karim Benzema or someone else. Step too far: Brazil may struggle to defeat Germany in their 2014 World Cup semi-final . Germany looked efficient, and I mean that in an admiring way, not a cliched reference to good organisation. Mats Hummels did very well to head the opener and he and Thomas Muller went on to give the two best performances in the team. Germany looked completely comfortable, totally in control after taking the lead, squeezing the life out of the game the longer it went on. They exude the kind of calm that comes with experience, and that will be vital from here. Brazil did better than in any previous match - but then that’s not saying much. Thiago Silva and David Luiz were both excellent but now Brazil will be without Silva and Neymar for the next match and that’s a big blow. Celebrate: Brazil defeated Colombia 2-0 to put themselves into the semi-finals . They need to play better, dramatically better, and yet will have to do so minus their two best players. I can’t see it. They also got lucky against Colombia because of a referee who let them get away with murder. How does James Rodriguez get booked for his first or second foul when Fernandinho went unpunished for five or six offences? James has been THE star of this World Cup: six goals, lots of assists, showing a desire for the ball and a will to make things happen that makes you purr as a fan. Strong: Based on the evidence we've seen so far, Germany must be favourites to win the World Cup . Power: Mats Hummels did brilliantly to head home the winner against France . He should be treasured and treated fairly. The referees’ leniency towards Brazil has got to stop. It’s embarrassing. I’ve written enough times about Brazil’s dodgy defence, which has attacking flair when it needs solidity. This is where they’ll get undone. I believe Germany will win with their runners — Muller, Mezut Ozil and Mario Goetze — finding the spaces behind the full-backs and between Brazil’s defence and midfield. They’ll cause problems, big problems. Tough: James Rodriguez was the star of the World Cup but was almost kicked out of the game by Brazil .

"I had my eyes opened to the more turbulent side of Rio life last week when I spent a day visiting the Morro da Providencia favela, which hasn’t yet been fully pacified. It taught me that some of my assumptions about the struggles of the poor were wrong and showed me their anger and frustration at an inequitable society is absolutely justified. I got a glimpse of favela life last month when I visited Santa Marta, now fully pacified and in some ways a ‘tourism’ favela. Eye opener: People in the Santa Marta favelas want police and government to stop kicking them out of their homes . On the Morro da Providancia - the Hill of Providence - the views are spectacular looking down on the city but the poverty and oppression are something else entirely. I spent time meeting a few different families, including that of a local graffiti artist, Diego, whose father died recently and whose mother is one of the local community figureheads. I came to Brazil believing that the essential issue of the poor and disenfranchised was that the government were spending billions on a World Cup when basic services were lacking for ordinary working-class people: transport, infrastructure, medical care, education. Community: Local Graffiti artist Diego (right) outside his house in the Morro Providencea favela . But it’s a much more complex issue. The poor of Brazil aren’t looking for a handout, they want the police, local municipality and government to stop disenfranchising them further and kicking them out of their homes. They want to be left alone. The story among those I met on Morro da Providencia is they’re having their homes taken off them while, as they see it, the government move in, smarten the place up and then cash in on real estate deals. Turning a poverty and crime-stricken area into a estate of small new apartments and houses on a hillside with wonderful views is all well and good, with a spanking new lift to take you from bottom to top. Care: The community vibe is very strong with lots of different races living alongside each other . One of the great privileges of being here is spending time with lots of football people such as Thierry Henry. I was especially impressed with the Everton manager Roberto Martinez. He talks with such passion and is an exceptional manager. Could he be England boss one day? But not if you’re being forced out for someone else to take advantage. And not if you can’t afford to use the lift, which is essentially for tourists. Imagine if that happened in Britain, the police arriving, banging down doors and telling you that you now have to live in a different area of town, one even grimmer than the area you live in with even poorer sewerage. No wonder they’re upset. Yet the community vibe is very strong and I’ve found it remarkable the variation of people, black, white, brown, mixed race, every shade, living alongside each other.

"Argentina and Germany are preparing to fight it out in the 2014 World Cup final at the Maracana, but who are the players set to make history? Here, Sportsmail's Rio Ferdinand delivers his verdict on each player with all the statistics you need. Manuel Neuer, goalkeeper . Age: 28 . Club: Bayern Munich . Caps/Goals: 51/0 . Distance: 19.6miles . Top speed: 16.34mph . RIO’S VERDICT: 9 . The best goalkeeper in the world. He is great with his feet, commanding in the air and is a very calming influence on the team. Very assured. Ready: Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer is preparing for the World Cup final 2014 on Sunday . Jerome Boateng, defender . Age: 25 . Club: Bayern Munich . Caps/Goals: 45/0 . Distance: 35.1miles . Top speed: 19.33mph . RIO’S VERDICT: 7.5 . Looked vulnerable earlier in the tournament but got better as it has gone on. Looks good alongside Hummels and has played the ball well out of defence. Target: Jerome Boateng (left) chases the ball during Germany's 7-1 hammering of Brazil . Mats Hummels, defender . Age: 25 . Club: Borussia Dortmund . Caps/Goals: 35/3 . Distance: 26.5miles . Top speed: 20.1mph . RIO’S VERDICT: 8 . One of the best centre-backs of the tournament and now on the 10-man shortlist for FIFA’s Golden Ball award for the tournament’s best player. Preparing: Mats Hummels is on FIFA's 10-man shortlist for the Golden Ball award (best player) Benedikt Howedes, defender . Age: 26 . Club: Schalke04 . Caps/Goals: 27/2 . Distance: 41.2miles . Top speed: 18.95mph . RIO’S VERDICT: 7 . I think he is the weakest of Germany’s back four, generally speaking, but in this tournament he’s done well and rarely gets exposed. Flying high: Benedikt Howedes is arguably Germany's weakest defender but has done well so far . Philipp Lahm, defender . Age: 30 . Club: Bayern Munich . Caps/Goals: 112/5 . Distance: 41.8miles . Top speed: 17.83mph . RIO’S VERDICT: 8 . He was brilliant in the semi-final against Brazil — he’s quick and a tricky customer. He is classy, consistent, an all-round huge footballer. Role: Philipp Lahm was brilliant in the semi-final against Brazil and is a tricky customer to handle . Bastian Schweinsteiger, midfielder . Age: 29 . Club: Bayern Munich . Caps/Goals: 107/23 . Distance: 29.7miles . Top speed: 18.14mph . RIO’S VERDICT: 8.5 . Has done simple things quite brilliantly and the defensive elements in his game have been great — I’ve never seen that side of his play before. Looking out: Bastian Schweinsteiger has done the simple things brilliantly throughout the tournament . Sami Khedira, midfielder . Age: 27 . Club: Real Madrid . Caps/Goals: 51/5 . Distance: 29.4miles . Top speed: 18.52mph . RIO’S VERDICT: 8.5 . Another player who was fantastic in the 7-1 win against Brazil. Box-to-box midfielder has been one of Germany’s stand-out players. Watch out: Sami Khedira (left) was fantastic in the 7-1 win over Brazil and can continue to keep his form . Toni Kroos, midfielder . Age: 24 . Club: Bayern Munich . Caps/Goals: 50/7 . Distance: 42.4miles . Top speed: 18.52mph . RIO’S VERDICT: 8.5 . A fantastic footballer — calm, calculated and assured. Has a real eye for goal and had more touches of the ball than any other player. Fantastic: Toni Kroos is calm, calculated and assured, and has a real natural eye for goal . Mesut Ozil, midfielder . Age: 25 . Club: Arsenal . Caps/Goals: 61/18 . Distance: 36.7miles . Top speed: 19.9mph . RIO’S VERDICT: 7.5 . He’s been playing his part without really reaching the standards we’ve come to expect from him. He hasn’t done badly but his game hasn’t exploded. Verdict: Mesut Ozil has been playing his part without really reaching the standards we expect of him . Thomas Muller, striker . Age: 24 . Club: Bayern Munich . Caps/Goals: 55/22 .

Roar: Marcos Rojo is eager to attack the opposition and is young, athletic and has plenty of potential . Angel Di Maria, midfielder . Age: 26 . Club: Real Madrid . Caps/Goals: 52/10 . Distance: 28.5miles . Top speed: 20.51mph . RIO’S VERDICT: 8 . He can carry the ball, score goals and beat a player in the middle of the pitch. A huge asset for any team and, if his injury holds out, will be a key man. Key: Angel Di Maria can carry the ball, score goals and beat a player in the centre of the pitch . Lucas Biglia, midfielder . Age: 28 . Club: Lazio . Caps/Goals: 25/0 . Top speed: 18.6miles . Top speed: 17.03mph . RIO’S VERDICT: 7 . He is athletic, works hard in the Argentinian midfield and has a real eye for a pass. Hard worker: Lucas Biglia knows how to keep his eyes open for a pass to cut open the opposition . Javier Mascherano, midfielder . Age: 30 . Club: Barcelona . Caps/Goals: 104/3 . Distance: 41.8miles . Top speed: 18.83mph . RIO’S VERDICT: 8.5 . Arguably the best player on the pitch for Argentina on Sunday. He’s disciplined, retains possession, offers great security for the centre-backs A solid player. Hug: Javier Mascherano is arguably the best player on the pitch for Argentina and gives his all . Ezequiel Lavezzi, midfielder . Age: 29 . Club: Paris St-Germain . Caps/Goals: 36/4 . Distance: 23.7miles . Top speed: 19.64mph . RIO’S VERDICT: 7 . I feel he’s got more to give in terms of goals and assists. He hasn’t replicated the skills he has shown at club level. There’s more to come from him. Verdict: Ezequiel Lavezzi can give more in terms of goals and assists for the Argentina team . Gonzalo Higuain, striker . Age: 26 . Club: Napoli . Caps/Goals: 42/21 . Distance: 34miles . Top speed: 20.57mph . RIO’S VERDICT: 7.5 . He’s an out and out goalscorer. You give him a chance and he’ll punish you.

"Steven Gerrard is a great professional for club and country but as a captain of a team who crashed out in the manner England did, he’ll have a nightmare summer. I say this from experience. The England squad arrived back in the UK in midweek to enjoy what’s left of the break. I suspect it will be a long, hard holiday season for Gerrard. He’ll be on the beach or around a pool somewhere, still trying to shake off the end-on-season headache of what happened to Liverpool. And now there’s the disappointment of Brazil to ponder too. Top pro: Steven Gerrard is one of the best professionals in the English game . Fun in the sun: Gerrard relaxes on holiday with his wife Alex . One moment the holiday is bliss. The sun’s shining, everyone’s enjoying themselves, you’re starting to unwind. Then - bang! - a nightmare recollection of a particular incident invades your brain and won’t go away. I've been there, trying to get away from the misery of losing a Champions League final, an FA Cup final, the Premier League title, whatever tournament England had just been knocked out of, and on and on. Losing is part and parcel of a footballers’ life but the moment it stops hurting you probably need to pack it in. Haunted: England's players will have flashbacks to their World Cup nightmare while they are on holiday . To celebrate the World Cup, I’ve added a special Unity Cap to my fashion range, incorporating all the flags of the participating nations and with a share of the proceeds going to charity. You can find them via www.5mag.co and you can follow me on Twitter for a chance to win exclusive prizes @rioferdy5 . But the hurting does mar your time ‘away’ from football. You’re never really away. One moment you’re sitting there thinking yes, I’m with my family, surrounded by the people I love, in paradise on a beach somewhere, then it hits. The flashbacks. The defining moments of the season where you lost whatever you lost. The poor decision you made in a particular game. The chance you missed. The goal you conceded. I could have done better. I could played smarter. Question after question. Then one the kids splashes you and says get in the pool and you snap out of it, for a while. The only way to make a positive from these negatives is use the depressing thoughts of failures past as fuel for future success. The new season won’t come soon enough for Gerrard. He’ll want to go again, put the bad stuff behind him. I’m sure that he, like me, is still wondering why so many England players can’t replicate their club form in an England shirt. And why can’t we handle the pressure? The answer to both questions lies partially in the brilliant foreign players across the Premier League. All of our best club teams in England have a significant number of brilliant foreigners. So the English players alongside them are assisted. It’s no coincidence that you play better as the quality of the players around you increases! But at club level it’s also the foreign players, mainly if not exclusively, who play the truly ‘under pressure’ roles. By that I mean footballers comfortable on the ball who can keep it, comfortably, and use it, meaningfully. I’m thinking of Oscar and Eden Hazard at Chelsea, Valencia and Nani at United, Cazorla and Arteta at Arsenal, Toure and Silva at Manchester City. Ball player: Eden Hazard has shown how good he is at keeping the ball for Chelsea . Keep ball: Ross Barkley plays well under pressure . Frank Lampard is a Chelsea great and he’ll often pop up with a goal, of course. Ross Barkley and Adam Lallana can keep the ball and use it, and all three are English, albeit two of them developing youngsters. But with so many of the best foreign players, holding and relieving pressure on your team-mates comes as standard. It’s the norm for them. They do week-in, week-out and they get used to it. By and large England don’t have those type of players, certainly not enough of them with enough experience. And when the pressure it as its greatest, on a World Cup stage, that's a problem.

"If I were the Liverpool manager there wouldn’t be a moment’s doubt about what to do next with Luis Suarez. I’d keep him. Leave aside, just for a moment, questions of morality or whether his ban is long enough and what is going on is his head to make him do these extraordinarily bad things. Purely and simply from a football perspective, what he does for you on the pitch — and I don’t mean biting people - makes him indispensable. And with the season Liverpool have ahead of them, that’s truer than ever. They had a brilliant 2013-14, pushing for the title when many people thought they might struggle to get into the top four. Although they didn’t win it, they were superb, with Suarez the single most significant reason for that. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Suarez greet fans from his balcony after returning to Uruguay . Bite man: Luis Suarez bites Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini and ended up with a nine game international ban and ban from all football activity for four months . The Premier League will be at least as tough next season, probably much tougher with Louis van Gaal at a new-look Manchester United, and Liverpool will have Champions League football, too, so any manager at Anfield would want Suarez in the team. So that’s the football decision. It’s an easy one to make. But if I were the chief executive or the money man at Liverpool, I’d have him up for sale already. The issue is one of risk and what might happen in the future given a pattern of behaviour. Keeping Suarez may potentially cost Liverpool tens of millions of pounds. Perhaps £70million or more. How so? If he went somewhere else this summer — Spain, I guess, with Barcelona and Real Madrid showing recent interest and having the money — Liverpool cash in on their biggest asset. Yes, it will be a tough ask to replace such quality, but if all the proceeds and more were re-invested in a proven striker, it might make sense. If Liverpool don’t sell him and he bites someone else after his ban ends, he could he thrown out for years. Madness: Suarez was charged with biting someone for the third time in his career . Tooth ache: Suarez goes down holding his front teeth . Suarez certainly made his mark on this World Cup, albeit in regrettable fashion. Unfortunately this tournament will now be remembered as the one where Suarez bit someone. Amid all his goals and game- winning performances, the statistic that  stands out in his career is being banned for dozens of games in total for biting people. Speaking to Uruguay fans here after the incident, the general feeling is of support and love for Suarez because he gives so much for the team on the pitch and is a great player. Family time: Suarez holds his children as he greets fans from their home's balcony on the outskirts of Montevideo in Uruguay . Support: Uruguay have backed Suarez and will appeal the decision . The solution to the Suarez situation could be that if Barca do want him, I’d demand Alexis Sanchez in a swap deal. I wasn’t watching the Uruguay-Italy match but saw a mention on social media as soon as the incident happened. For a few moments, I couldn’t believe he’d done it again. I thought it must be an old joke or a wind-up. Then the videos and photographs started flowing online. It’s just incredible behaviour, baffling. I was just about at the point where not only did I think of Suarez as a fantastic player but that he’d rid himself of the devil inside and left all the rubbish behind. But one chomp later it’s obvious he’s still Jekyll and Hyde. Playing for keeps: Ferdinand says Brendan Rodgers should try and keep hold of Luis Suarez . Star man: Suarez helped Liverpool almost win the title last season . Key man: Suarez was named player of the year by both the players and the football writers . Within a fortnight he’s gone from a hero who can barely run but still manages to mastermind the beating of England, to a pariah banned from all football for four months. The punishment, like the man himself, will polarise opinion. He had to be punished. He hasn’t got off lightly. Neither would I argue with those who sincerely feel he should have been banned for longer. What he did is just inexplicable. I have three young kids and they asked me about what happened. ‘Dad, why did he bite that other player?’ We don’t know, do we? He evidently has some demons to handle when he’s on the pitch, sometimes. By all accounts he is a good team-mate and decent bloke away from it. Tough battle: Rio Ferdinand says Suarez is one of the best players in the Premier League . ‘He did a really bad thing, he was naughty,’ is how I explained it to my children. ‘He’s going to be punished. He won’t be allowed to play football or even go to games for a while.’ But of course they already know it’s bad to bite people. Is his problem surmountable? Nobody can say. We all thought after last season that he was a changed man. He’s created a huge dilemma now for Liverpool and I don’t envy them the decisions ahead. Rio Ferdinand is an interviewer, programme-maker and football expert for BT Sport .","Luis Suarez is indispensable for what he does on the pitch .

"A defining phenomenon at this World Cup for me has been the impact of special managers who have moulded their players into more than the sum of their parts. They all have a clear vision of how they want the game played, they get their teams playing like that. And then - the truly magical part - they do this while maintaining group harmony. The stand-out individuals in question have been, in no particular order, Jorge Sampaoli of Chile, Jose Pekerman of Colombia, Jurgen Klinsmann of the USA, Jorge Luis Pinto of Costa Rica, Miguel Herrera of Mexico and Louis Van Gaal of Holland, who made that extraordinary substitution on Saturday night, bring on Tim Krul for penalties.. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Dwight Yorke: Van Gaal is the right man for the job . Master: Holland boss Louis van Gaal has made an impact with key decisions during the 2014 World Cup . But not Roy Hodgson, to whom we’ll return in a minute. Herrera steered a stuttering team to the finals but has restored order from chaos by imposing his will. He did not succumb to public demand and play my former Manchester United team-mate Javier Hernandez, aka Chicharito, despite him being a predator among predators. Instead he had a belief in a system that worked well and refused to accommodate his star man. He had the respect and belief from all his squad, Chicharito included, and they reached the knockout stages. Leaders: Jose Pekerman and Jorge Sampaoli were crucial to their team's impressive World Cup campaigns . Follow my lead: The Holland players seem to have total belief in their manager . Sampaoli is the Argentine in charge of a Chile side who were unlucky to lose to Brazil in the last 16. He got the job after  winning three titles with one of Chile’s biggest clubs, Universidad, and his side played the high-tempo, pressing game last seen under Marcelo Bielsa. Two other words sum up Sampaoli’s transformative powers: Gary Medel. It seemed he couldn’t even pass the ball at times last season as Cardiff City were relegated from the Premier League, but he was intrinsic and superb at these finals. Pekerman, Colombia’s Argentine coach, and Pinto, the Colombian in charge of Costa Rica, have each taken groups of players with few star names and instilled in them the confidence to express themselves in styles that play to the strengths of the collective, rather than to any  individual. Klinsmann was always clear that his squad - from Seattle and  Hertha, from Toronto, Rosenborg, Puebla and other unheralded places in between - would never be less than competitive. Collective: Pekerman led his team to the World Cup quarter-finals as James Rodriguez (left) starred . He was true to his word. He made a huge call even before getting to  Brazil by leaving Landon Donovan behind because he felt the team would benefit without a man who had earned 156 caps. And they gave it a really good shot, getting out of a group they had no right to escape — at least on paper. It was always likely England might struggle, as I wrote before the tournament. And there are all kinds of underlying issues to be addressed, as I outlined a fortnight ago. A visionary manager would help. In the mix: USA boss Jurgen Klinsmann (left) ensured his team worked hard for each other . Hodgson is a pleasant-enough man, extremely intelligent and has a CV with enough clubs and countries to show how widely he is respected. But if I’m brutally honest then, for me, he lacks that extra ingredient to set him apart. He’s certainly no maverick, he doesn’t change matches with inspirational substitutions and I see little evidence of a collective buying into a master plan for England, if there even is one. It’s not just Hodgson who has failed to shine as England boss, of course. Fabio Capello’s boot camp approach was badly flawed, Steve McClaren was scarred by his failure, Sven-Goran Eriksson hit quarter-final buffers, Kevin Keegan himself admitted the job was too big for him. Extra ingredient: Roy Hodgson (centre) failed to make  a positive impact with his substitutions in Brazil . So we’re left with Glenn Hoddle, the last England manager who had something really different about him — that vision. Certainly he was the best England manager in my personal experience. He didn’t have the best personality, and he wasn’t the most diplomatic at times. But he knew what he was trying to achieve tactically, and had a vision of how his unit should work. I could imagine myself as part of bigger whole under him. Before Hoddle, even though I wasn’t an England player at the time, it’s clear Terry Venables also had a vision and the charisma to transmit that to his players. What’s clear from some of the outstanding ‘lesser’ teams at this World Cup is that the team takes precedence over individuals and personalities in a way it didn’t for England. The big picture: Glenn Hoddle (above) has a clear vision of how a unit should work . Wing: Wayne Rooney (centre) was played out of position and England seemed to pay the price . Compromise takes you only so far. It was a compromise to play Wayne Rooney out of his favourite position. Build your side around your best player or drop him. But don’t fudge. The other managers above didn’t fudge and that’s what marks them out. Van Gaal doesn’t fudge either. I’m sure you’ve heard all the stories of how eccentric he can be but I’ve not heard a bad word about him from any player he’s worked with. He’s a hard man, strong, big on discipline within the football environment. But he also trusts his players. The other night I was in a bar with some of his Holland squad. They were mixing with the public, having a bite to eat. They knew their curfew and would respect it. He believes in his players. They believe in him. Having faith in the man in charge is a huge part of achieving success in our game. The best managers earn that faith. Relaxed: Holland seem to have found the perfect balance between discipline and downtime in Brazil .","Louis van Gaal has made a huge impact with Holland during the World Cup .

"Penalties are absolute agony at any time and I’ve been in teams for club and country where they were needed. The pressure is so extreme, the expectations massive, your legs are hollow. What a nightmare. Can you even begin to imagine then the pressure Brazil must have been under? Not just the entire home nation expecting you to win but fears about what could happen to the tournament and around the country if they lost. It was the most intense, frantic game of the tournament so far. We were in the studio in Rio, backing on to the beach and there was a two-hour frenzy behind us to a soundtrack of fireworks. Joy and despair: David Luiz celebrates Brazil's penalty shoot out win over Chile . Saved! Julio Cesar keeps Mauricio Pinilla spot kick out as Brazil progress . Thank goodness for the tournament that Brazil won. It keeps the party alive. But the way they only just managed to sneak past Chile into the quarter-finals highlighted again the defensive frailties we’ve been talking about for weeks. But Neymar was electric in the opening 45 minutes. Hulk had an eventful day, involved in everything. It was a shame his goal was ruled out because it came from a great ball, take and finish. But it was handball. Neymar has coped unbelievably with the pressure of a nation’s hopes on his shoulders. Even his spot-kick betrayed no nerves. For all Brazil’s flair though, their weaknesses have worried more from their opening game. Three of that back four are not natural . defenders: Dani Alves and Marcelo are attacking full-backs with the . emphasis strictly on the attack and David Luiz also has instincts to get . out. It’s dangerous that their first priority does not appear to be . defending. Leap of faith: David Luiz jumps for joy as Brazil beats Chile . Flat out: Chile's players look dejected as Brazil celebrate . End of the world: The Chile players look dejected as they walk off at the end of the game . I has similar instincts myself as a young player at West Ham but Frank Burrows, a defensive coach, drilled me hard on the training field, instilling in me the absolute importance of my specific trade. It was all about the heading, one versus ones, aggression, body position, movement of your feet. Brazil’s . defenders haven’t done it. The Cameroon goal in the group game was a . prime example. They were beaten too easily one against one, Thiago Silva . allowed the ball past him too easily at the front post, Luiz didn’t . know where the striker was. He didn’t even have a look or open his . shoulders so he could see both ball and man more easily. Golden boy: Neymar celebrates after scoring his penalty . On we go: Luiz Felipe Scolari celebrates Brazil beating Chile on penalties . Marching on: Brazil's goalkeeper Julio Cesar celebrates with his team after saving the decisive penalty . Defenders are taught this. And Marcelo was almost on the edge of the box, not even thinking to defend the far post to cover Luiz. Neymar carried Brazil through that group. But he alone cannot win the World Cup with that leaky defence.

"Arjen Robben has been the outstanding player of the tournament for me so far, and not for the first time I’ve being thinking ‘If only...’ about the missed opportunity Manchester United had to sign him when he was young. I was at the Dutch team’s hotel the other day after they’d beaten Australia 3-2, to have a coffee with Robben, Robin Van Persie and Nigel De Jong and it was so refreshing to see the enthusiasm — pure delight — flowing through that group. Robben has scored three goals in two games and RVP and De Jong were waxing lyrical about his stats, not least the fact that he’s hitting more than 30kph with the ball still under control — then smashing it home after running half the pitch.

Centre of attention: Arjen Robben is mobbed by fans as he leaves Holland's hotel on Saturday . Three and easy: Arjen Robben scores his third goal of the World Cup against Australia on Wednesday . I know there are fans out there who assume that top players take things for granted, including their wages, their status, their place at these big occasions, even success. In most cases I can tell you: rubbish. Footballers are just the same as any fan. We grow up daydreaming of one day playing, perhaps scoring, at a World Cup. I’m sure you’ve imagined it. And when it happens? ‘It’s still that dream come true,’ Robben told me the other day. Believe me, he’s living the dream. He should have been a United player. He would have fitted in. He had a brilliant breakthrough season with PSV in 2002-03, a campaign in which he turned 19, and Sir Alex Ferguson wanted to sign him.

"Even having written last week that I thought this could be a tournament too far for an ageing Spanish team to win, I wouldn’t have predicted in a month of Sundays the absolute thrashing they received at the hands of Holland. It was an absolute beating, revenge for the 2010 final, and an outcome that nobody in their mind would have forecast, even at half-time. Robin van Persie’s goal just before the break was absolutely critical to changing the nature of the match. VIDEO scroll down for Van Persie entertains players' children after Holland training . Vital: Rio Ferdinand says Robin van Persie equaliser for Holland changed the game in their 5-1 win vs Spain . That would have made a world of difference to the atmosphere in the Dutch dressing room, and laid the foundations for the second-half demolition. Most strikers are confidence players who like to know they’re loved, and function better when they’re assured of that. This is much more the case than with defenders or midfielders because it’s the forwards who tend to score most and bask in the adulation that brings. They get used to that. They need it. Flying Dutchman: Van Persie scored a diving header just before half-time to draw Holland level with Spain . Looking back to last season at Manchester United, I feel now that there were times when possibly RVP didn’t feel loved by David Moyes. It’s entirely feasible RVP felt Moyes had a closer bond with Wayne Rooney, and that he, RVP, wasn’t on a par. Management must be a minefield at times, but perhaps Moyes should have spread the love around a bit more evenly. Forwards can be egotistical, needing not just praise when they do well but an arm around the shoulder, a metaphorical back-rub, another pat on the back, the works. They’re a delicate breed than can require some pampering! And RVP is no different in that respect. You only had to watch his performance, in the second half at least, to see his confidence grow after that astonishing header for 1-1. Top dog: Under former boss David Moyes, Wayne Rooney was often seen as the main striker at the club . Unloved? Moyes' better relationship with Rooney may have damaged van Persie's confidence last season . That’s one of those goals that will look better and better as the years go by. I’ve watched it a dozen times already and it’s simply magnificent. Rene Meulensteen used to say that RVP’s left foot was like Roger Federer’s backhand; so extraordinarily brilliant that it looks effortless. He’s the complete technician. And believe me, there was technique, too, in the execution of that header, getting on it the right way, at the right time, controlling it. Revitalised: Van Persie (left) looked reborn in the second-half scoring another and hitting the bar (pictured) RVP had looked isolated before that; and then wonderfully on top of his game afterwards. It was agame-changer. Take away that goal and the half-time talk for Louis van Gaal would have been an exercise in attempting to reassure his players, telling them to have patience with the game-plan. The goal meant, instead, they were already assured, the place buzzing, the team ready to go out and capitalise. As Arjen Robben moved up through the gears and attacked through the middle, Spain’s central defenders, Sergio Ramos and Gerard Pique, faltered. Run ragged: Arjen Robben (left) gave Sergio Ramos (right) and Gerard Pique a torrid time in the second-half . It’s absolutely crucial as part of that partnership to play as a pair, know exactly where the other person is, and what you’re both doing.

"When Belgium face Russia on Sunday we’ll see a team yet to live up to great expectations (Belgium) against one trying to impress a manager with great expectations and little human touch (Russia). I can only speak for myself but I expected a lot more from Fabio Capello as an England boss. I’m sure that due to the injuries I had during his time, he’d probably say the same about me! But given his track record I expected more ideas and creativity. What we got was a prison camp mentality that stifled the life out of us. His attitude was, ‘I’m the boss and you’ll do what I say’, all day, every day. Other managers I’ve worked under, including the best ever, Sir Alex, know that’s the way to behave in training and on match-day, but there’s a time and place when you can be accessible and open. With Capello it seemed there would never be warmth. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail exclusive: Rio Ferdinand sends dispatch from Brazil .

Belgium, on the other hand, are brimming with excitement and have potential if they can gel at this level. They showed fight and determination to come from behind in their opener.

"Enough is enough. England’s embarrassing early exit from the World Cup needs to be a wake-up call that something is fundamentally wrong in our national game and it needs fixing or we’ll be also-rans for ever. To say that we are now a laughing stock is not right, but only because our major rivals didn’t start this World Cup genuinely fearing England. England crashing out is not a surprise to them, or to be honest with ourselves, to us. In my opening column I feared England may not get out of Group D. I desperately wanted to be wrong but we could not cope when we came up against true quality: Italy and Pirlo, Uruguay and Suarez. VIDEO Scroll down for Wayne Rooney: We prepared as well as we could for World Cup . Heading for victory: Mario Balotelli scores Italy's second goal in their 2-1 win over England on June 14 . Floored: Joe Hart (left) and Gary Cahill (centre) were helpless to stop Mario Balotelli scoring for Italy . Lethal Luis: Suarez scores Uruguay's second goal against England on Thursday evening . At the double: Luis Suarez celebrates scoring his second goal during Uruguay's 2-1 win over England . Out here in Rio I’m losing track of the number of fellow professionals from other places asking me: ‘What the hell is going on with your team’s defenders? It’s a joke, comical defending.’ Yes, it is. And there is no point in shying away from identifying several specific areas where England got it wrong or were simply not up to the job. At the back, England were below par, incapable of handling clinical finishers. There are problems in midfield. There’s a lack of confidence all around the pitch. On-pitch leaders are lacking. And Roy Hodgson fell between two stools in his approach to mixing youth and experience. He left behind the nous-heavy, tournament-hardened Michael Carrick and Ashley Cole, played his captain Steven Gerrard in a tough role, and gave youth its head only to an extent. Hindsight is a wonderful thing but there was a case for saying up front that this was going to be an event to gain experience, for the youngsters, across the whole XI. They’d learn how to prepare, play, rest, gain that high intensity experience. Head boy: Raheem Sterling has been one of England's best players at the World Cup . Impact player: Ross Barkley has come on for England twice as substitute during the World Cup . Learning curve: Luke Shaw is yet to feature for England at the World Cup but has gained vital experience . When I went to a World Cup as a kid in 1998, I soaked it up like a sponge but there’s nothing like getting stuck in, full immersion. Yet the real shame in our national game and the issue that has to be tackled urgently is that we just do not have enough good players. With respect to the 23 in the squad, including some seasoned veterans who have done it all at club level and some extremely talented youngsters, our talent pool is puddle deep. Much as we can all talk about the promise of Raheem Sterling, Danny Welbeck, Daniel Sturridge, Ross Barkley, Luke Shaw, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, that just’s half a dozen people aged 24 or under. We shouldn’t be talking in single digits, we should expect many dozens. Costa Rica have a population of five million. Croatia, Bosnia and Uruguay have even fewer. Is it not now blindingly obvious that something is very wrong when England, the home of football, the country that codified the game and took it to the world, a country with 53 million people, cannot field a decent team? Young gun: Rio Ferdinand jokes around as England train during the 1998 World Cup in France . Talking tactics: Rio Ferdinand chats with then England manager as England prepare for the 1998 World Cup . We lack facilities and coaches at all levels, and opportunities for top-level playing experience for the best young players. I was part of the FA Commission who considered these issues; one report has been published and another is on its way. Some suggestions for change are controversial but let’s be absolutely clear: there are very specific identifiable issues. I’ll give you just a tiny example. In the whole of England there are 639 3G all-weather pitches. Germany have more than 5,000. An FA survey of clubs at all levels found 84 per cent of respondents saying facilities are poor. It hasn’t changed. This directly impacts on how many teams and at what age-groups kids can play. We have too few coaches, and those we have are not as well qualified as they should be. Spain have 25,000 coaches with A, B and Pro Licences. Germany have 35,000. We have 6,000. Coaching is respected elsewhere, valued, literally. In Germany and the Netherlands a youth coach can earn £40,000 a year. It’s a profession. In England the equivalent pay is £16,000. That’s vocational, a hobby. Anyone who cannot see the link between all these factors and an under-performing England team is kidding themselves. Touch tight: Phil Jagielka closes down Luis Suarez during England's defeat to Uruguay on Thursday . Centre of attention: Gary Cahill rises above Luis Suarez to clear the ball for England . England have conceded goals via poor defending. It’s unacceptable and in tournament terms it’s been the killer. Why can’t we concentrate? As soon as England equalised against Uruguay on Thursday, I was whooping off-air every bit as much as Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer alongside me. Then I said I’d take the draw immediately because I feared what might happen next. We don’t have top-class centre halves. There is no intention here to demean the capabilities of Phil Jagielka and Gary Cahill, and I mean that sincerely. The worrying truth is, they are the best players available for England with enough game time under their belts. Jagielka is an eight out 10 man every game he plays for Everton. Cahill is the most improved English defender in the Premier League in recent years, indeed a Champions League winner since he moved to Chelsea. But we’re talking about international football at the highest level. And are they good enough? Left back: Ashley Cole was overlooked by Roy Hodgson for the World Cup despite all his experience . Missed a trick: Roy Hodgson should have included Michael Carrick (right) in his 23-man World Cup squad . What you need at a World Cup is to utilise the very best defensive unit as a whole that you DO have, with the most experience, and England left that at home in the shape of Cole at left back and Carrick in the key defensive midfielder role. I won’t even go into the situation with John Terry, because he was not available. But suffice to say that in an ideal world you would take and use all your best players at a World Cup. And for various reasons, England haven’t done that. Hogdson and Gerrard were both tasked with impossible jobs and that has led to us ending up with unsatisfactory compromises. Let’s look ahead now, everyone is saying, let’s look to Euro 2016, it’s not all doom and gloom.I hope it’s not. But unless we get the big picture right, I fear we’ll be back here in a couple of years saying all this again.

"Rio's favelas are a notorious part of the city’s history, a vibrant but often troubled part of modern Brazil. I was guided around one last week and even though this particular favela, Santa Marta, is known as a place where the people’s worst troubles are behind them, it was a humbling and shocking experience. At the heart of it there is a football pitch for kids, fenced like a cage, where young people can play in safety. But you can see bullet holes in the walls of the adjoining shanty homes. Doing it by the book: Rio Ferdinand with a weighty tome (left) and talks to children in the favela (right) Humbling and shocking experience: Ferdinand visited the Santa Marta favela in Rio . My guide, a local guy named Edu, said that at the depths of the drug feuds that infested this community, rival gangs would decapitate each other and kick the severed heads around. One bloke who follows me on social media joked that I’d be fine in a favela because I grew up in Peckham. I pointed out as nicely as possible that we have it cushy in Britain. The grinding poverty and social extremes in Rio’s poorest districts is something else. Around 1.4 million people live in about 750 favelas in Rio alone. With drugs and the attendant gun culture, murder is commonplace. Santa Marta was one of the earliest cases of a favela being ‘pacified’, with a concerted effort by the authorities and local community to tackle gang culture. Doing what he does best: Ferdinand coaches children in the favela and (right) poses with one young lad . The police and community work in harmony. You can play football in the alleys, and I did have a kickabout while there. I met extraordinary people, including a guy who cleans the streets for a living and begs in his ‘spare’ time to raise money that he donates to a local scheme that provides football facilities for kids. People like that are the glue that binds communities together.","Ferdinand visited the Santa Marta favela in Rio .

"Having tipped Brazil to win the World Cup I must say their opening performance against Croatia was an anti-climax that highlighted vulnerabilities, particularly in defence. The brightest thing about Thursday evening from the hosts’ point of view was the extraordinary home support, as I saw close up. To watch the match I made a three-hour journey through some of the worst traffic I’ve ever seen into the mountains above Rio de Janeiro, to share the occasion with two former Manchester United team-mates, Da Silva twins Rafa and Fabio. Rio in Rio: Rio Ferdinand (centre) with former team-mates Rafael and Fabio plus friends watching Brazil-Croatia . They had a big crowd of family and friends around to watch the game, 25 people in one room, including six kids. When the first note of the national anthem played, every single person stood up, held on to each other with something approaching fervour, and then absolutely belted out the anthem, every word of it as if their lives depended on it. Never mind the hairs on the back of my neck, I had a chill down the spine being part of that. It was the most extraordinary demonstration of what the World Cup means to these Brazilians. The game is in their DNA and not just those among them who are footballers. Then the game started and everyone watched in silence, nervous as it remained scoreless through the first 10 minutes and then shocked as Croatia took the lead. At that point Rafa said to me, quite dryly: ‘If it stays like this, you won’t be going back down to Rio tonight. It’ll be mayhem down there if we lose.’ A great leveller: Neymar celebrates after equalising for Brazil against Croatia . The room was quiet, despondent, but it didn’t stay like that as Neymar equalised and then Brazil went on to win. They were lucky, frankly. The penalty for 2-1 was an absolute joke. There was no way whatsoever that should have been a penalty. The most generous interpretation was that it was a dubious decision. The ref was conned, in my view. I hope for the sake of the  tournament that it wasn’t an early sign that poor officiating could spoil things. Croatia started well and deserved to be ahead. The Brazil back four were visibly  uncomfortable with the ball being crossed into the area. Against better teams and better strikers I fear they are going to have  problems. As attacking full backs, Dani Alves and Marcelo are right up there among the best in the world, but as pure defenders, let’s just say they’re not at the same level. As for the rest of Brazil’s team, I don’t get what Paulinho’s purpose is in there. What's his purpose? Paulinho (right) isn't a ball winner or a creator and it isn't clear what he brings to Brazil . He’s not a ball-winner who breaks up play. He isn’t a creator. I’d have Ramires in way ahead of him. Luiz Gustavo and Oscar were the best performers for me. Neymar was relatively quiet by his own standards, even if he scored twice. That’s the mark of a really great player, doing not much then contributing  something significant when it matters. After the final whistle we went outside to play foot-volleyball on the twins’ full-size beach  volleyball court. Rafa and I were beaten by Fabio and a mate of theirs, who plays for Vasco da Gama. A whole new ball game: Ferdinand (right) plays beach volleyball with the Da Silva twins and a friend . I got back to Rio late, and there were still umpteen impromptu matches being played all along the beach. There are people everywhere in football shirts — Brazil, Colombia and Chile especially. But those people aside, it’s odd. There’s no other sign a World Cup is unfolding around us. No billboards. No  posters. No VIP traffic lanes. Just people, in love with football.","Brazil's victory over Croatia was an anti-climax .

"Argentina were ready to implement a high-risk strategy and start with Angel Di Maria in the World Cup final - until the player pulled out of training with a suspected thigh injury. Di Maria had to go off in the quarter-final win against Belgium after injuring his muscle and Argentina were desperate to add to their attacking options for Sunday’s final with Germany.

"If Argentina do confound what would appear to be growing opinion and lift the World Cup for the third time on Sunday, do not expect to find coach Alejandro Sabella in the middle of the post-match party. Sabella, 59, is not the type to get too close to his players. He is a tactician, a coach, rather than a  gregarious man of the people. More pertinently, by the time the final whistle blows on this tournament, Sabella will no longer be Argentina’s boss, having announced his decision to resign on Saturday after a campaign he feels has been hampered by interference from his own FA. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Argentina players tease Alejandro Sabella for his Del boy fall . Should I stay or should I go? Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella is considering his future . Celebration: Sabella rejoices with his coaching staff after reaching the World Cup final . ‘He has just had enough,’ said a source in Argentina on Saturday. ‘He just wants to coach but with Argentina it’s not always that easy. There is too much meddling.’ Sabella — a quiet man known to suffer from self-doubt — has certainly cut one of the more peculiar figures of this World Cup. So far, his most memorable moments have been one which saw him squirted in the face with water by Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Ezequiel Lavezzi during a break in play against Nigeria and when he almost stumbled backward into his own dugout after seeing Gonzalo Higuain hit the bar against Belgium. Both incidents added apparent credence to a popular view that Sabella is a rather comical figure, a patsy at the head of a squad that is actually controlled and organised by star player Lionel Messi. Sunday’s final, however, affords ‘Alex’, the former Leeds and Sheffield United midfielder, the opportunity to prove his own credibility once and for all. Juan Sebastian Veron, the former Manchester United midfielder who played for Sabella at Estudiantes de la Plata, said: ‘If we win this then everybody will have no choice but to become Sabellistas. Never mind the score on Sunday, Sabella has done his bit and he will leave an important part of himself in this team.’ Star pairing: Sabella celebrates with Lionel Messi after his side reach the World Cup final . Ready: Sabella knows he must make a decision with friendlies looming as Argentina get back to normal . The fact that Veron found it necessary to speak up for his former coach on Saturday says much for Sabella’s image issues. The notion that Messi effectively runs the team is a popular one and the Sabella’s doormat image was certainly not helped by his failure to punish Lavezzi for embarrassing him on the touchline. However, sources close to the Argentina squad insist that the Messi theory does not stack up. Not only did Sabella cut one of Messi’s friends, midfielder Ever Banega, from his final 23 for Brazil, he dropped another, Fernando Gago, after the laboured last-16 win over Switzerland in Sao Paulo. The change of team shape and tactics that followed that unconvincing extra-time victory flew in the face of the attacking formation that Messi is supposed to have insisted on. But the changes bore the hallmarks of a thinking man’s coach simply doing his work. ‘He transmits quality to the team,’ Veron added. ‘He is very concerned with detail, preparing for each match by going over anything that could happen. He is really intelligent and has managed to get Messi operating to his potential levels after the highs and lows of before. ‘But, importantly, that has not come at the group’s expense.’ All smiles: The Argentina players seemed in high spirits as they trained in Belo Horizonte . Relaxed: Sabella's Argentina take on Germany in the 2014 World Cup final on Sunday night . Known as ‘The Slowcoach’ during his playing days — a reference to his lack of pace — Sabella did not become a coach in his own right until 2009, by which time he was already 54. Previously, he had served as assistant to former international team-mate Daniel Passarella with Argentina and then clubs in Italy, Uruguay, Mexico and Brazil. Taking over at Estudiantes five years ago, there were doubts over whether his dour public persona would lend itself to the role of  figurehead. He immediately won the Copa Libertadores (South America’s Champions League), following up with the Argentine Primera Division a year later. Estudiantes were also one minute away from winning the FIFA Club World Cup against Barcelona in 2009, only to concede an equaliser in the final minute and an extra-time winner to none other than Messi. In Rio on Sunday, Sabella can make the ultimate statement, to leave a mark that can never be erased. Cult figure Maradona, leader of a haphazard Argentina campaign in South Africa four years ago, said just 10 days ago that ‘things look bleak for Argentina’. That comment came just after the Switzerland match. Since then a coach’s coach has made his mark, whether people wish to believe it or not.

"The World Cup is just two days away and the excitement is reaching fever pitch. For the last time, our man in Brazil, Joe Callaghan, . brings us the latest news and views from South America - as well as . traveller tips for those heading out there - and provides a flavour of . exactly how the World Cup is shaping up. What have Gilberto Silva and Heurelho Gomes got in common? One helped Arsenal win some North London derbies while the other played for Arsenal in them? Cruel, accurate but not what we're looking for. Until Thursday rolls around, they remain the only players to ever be part of a Brazil World Cup squad while also plying their trade in the Premier League at the same time. That happened in 2s006 and 2010 respectively but it tells you just how changed and changed utterly the times are that on the eve of their tournament opener, the Brazilian manager's dilemma is very much a Premier League dilemma. Luiz Felipe Scolari on Tuesday delivered the kind of sharp-tongued rebuke that he may have been famed for in the past but has been a rare occurrence in recent times. So stint has his second stint in the job been to this point that he hasn't needed to deliver a put-down to the press. In charge: Brazil head coach Luiz Felipe Scolari looks towards the cameras during a training session on Monday . But three days from tournament kick-off, he'd had enough when he tackled the biggest talking point about his team head-on. 'External pressures will not influence my decision of starting Oscar ahead of Willian,' he bristled 'Oscar is the starter.' In one brief exchange he poured icy cold water on the hottest topic in the host nation. It was a debate that has raged even more wildly since Friday's final friendly against Serbia when, just four days after a scoring cameo off the bench against Panama, Willian again was a difference-maker. Replacing the fitful Oscar at half-time, he gave Brazil so much more impetus going forward. But then this is a six-month-old debate, one that is more familiar to Premier League observers. As Oscar struggled to hit his pre-Christmas heights after the turn of the year, Willian was making Stamford Bridge his own with increasing regularity, his transformation under Jose Mourinho one of the manager's finer achievements of last term. Eye on the ball: Brazil and Chelsea star Oscar takes part in training in Teresopolis on Monday . On form: Willian (right) caught the eye with his performance against Serbia in a friendly last Friday . He carried that through to national team duty and continued to knock on the door while Oscar struggled to look comfortable inside the room. But Scolari knocked all that back on Monday. It has always been thus with the man they call Felipão. His favourites are his favourites. And they just so happen to be the favourites. Scolari was never likely to go for something as wild as taking a blunt implement to the starting XI he has cast in stone over the past 12 months. For the exact same reason, Willian is also not going to knock Hulk out of the right side of the attacking midfield trio that operate behind Fred. It all means that, barring any more scares like Neymar's ankle roll that stopped a nation, the 11 who line up against Croatia in São Paulo in less than 48 hours will be the same that started Brazil's last competitive fixture - the Confederations Cup final romp over Spain. Panic: Neymar receives medical attention after rolling his ankle during training but quickly recovered . With David Luiz having jumped across the Channel to Paris, there will be two Premier League starters in Oscar and Spurs' Paulinho but there will be another three in reserve. The times have changed and so has Big Phil - but not too much. Willian probably did deserve his chance. But Scolari was never for turning. He had his favourites in 2002, look how that ended. And, no matter what, an out-of-sorts Oscar is still a damn sight easier on the pre-match nerves than Roque Junior was 12 years ago. Team orders: Scolari talks to his players as Brazil prepare for their World Cup opener against Croatia . Good week: The tat vendors . Sitting in a São Paulo taxi for three hours - the perfect storm of a metro strike and a huge 'March For Jesus' religious extravaganza - gave us plenty of time for looking around on Saturday. And what was finally visible was some World Cup fervour. It's been a long road to here for Brazil and a lot of the footpaths are unfinished. But here they are, now hours away from a World Cup on their doorstep and it seems that, in spite of the social ills that have and will continue to trouble the country, the nation is beginning to get in the spirit. The daredevils who sell Brazil flags, whistles and horns not just street corners, but on the dividers in the middle of an eight-lane motorway have begun to reap the rewards. Not before time. They should earn danger money too. Roll up: An array of Brazil memorabilia is available for sale in a souvenir shop in Sao Paulo ahead of the tournament . Bad week: Morumbi Stadium . No one wants to hear journalists complain about getting in to football matches for free but when your view is so bad that play is blocked by a corner-flag, maybe a slight whinge is justified. Had original plans come to fruition, Thursday's opening ceremony would have been held at Morumbi Stadium in São Paulo, the first choice for a World Cup venue for Brazil's biggest city. However authorities decided it was more practical to build the Arena Corinthians from scratch (shame they're still building though). The media men and commentators should be relieved however as Morumbi features undoubtedly the worst positioned press area we've seen. Lower than pitch level, stuck at the corner and cut off by a running track, we think we watched Brazil play Serbia on Friday but we're not quite sure. Far away: This is the view of the pitch from the press box at the Morumbi Stadium in Sao Paulo . Restricted view: A camera crane blocks the view of the action between Brazil and Serbia on Friday . Quote of the week: . 'Sadly, there’s a great deal of discrimination and racism, and this hurts me.' Never mind the Jabulani or those Brazucas, SEPP BLATTER proves once more that it is he who has the biggest balls in the game - brass ones, undoubtedly - by accusing the British media of a plot to tarnish the 2022 World Cup. Four more years? Really? Gesture: FIFA president Sepp Blatter stands next to the World Cup trophy in Sao Paulo last week . Travellers' tip: Enjoy the daylight! Walking through Copacabana on Monday evening we heard more than a few of the recently arrived 'gringos' asking slightly bemused if 'it always gets this dark this early'? It is worth remembering again that it is winter in Brazil so by 5.30pm it is pitch dark.

"The World Cup is just 16 days away and excitement is building. Each week our man in Brazil, Joe Callaghan, brings us the latest news and views from South America - as well as traveller tips for those heading out there - and provides a flavour of exactly how the World Cup in Brazil is shaping up. 'Yes, [money] is one of the reasons. I'm 59 and I don't want to work as a coach until I'm 70. I want to retire in four or five years.' Those words were uttered in June 2008, which, assuming our maths are right here, means Luis Felipe Scolari never got his wish. Four and five years have come and gone, a sixth is well upon him and the now 65-year-old is about as far removed from the peace and tranquility of retirement as he could ever have imagined. The lush green of Granja Comary in the hillside surrounds of Teresopolis, ironically, can be a very serene place when it wants to be. VIDEO Scroll down to watch J-Lo and Pitbull film video for World Cup song . Relaxed: Brazil boss Luiz Felipe Scolari was in relaxed mood when he greeted journalists at their training base . Warm greeting: Scolari give Dani Alves a warm welcome to the Brazil training centre ahead of the World Cup . Whether it wanted or not, yesterday was certainly not one of those days as Brazil's World Cup squad made the short trek up from Rio de Janeiro and picked their way through a pack of protesters, throngs of fans and an army of national and international media. In the middle of it all stood Scolari, the flame to which these myriad moths were drawn. Brazil's first day in World Cup camp is a pretty big deal every four years but this time round they take on the world on home turf with 200 million pairs of eyes staring down on them in heavy hope and enormous expectation. But Big Phil cut a comfortable figure, one who is exactly where he wants to be. Retirement? You've got to be kidding. To be fair, buying the winnebago and . seeing a bit more of the world with his wife Olga weren't the only . things that didn't go to the plan Scolari laid out back in June 2008. Those comments were made at a press conference that came in the middle . of Euro 2008 when the 2002 World Cup winner was confirmed as Avram . Grant's replacement as Chelsea manager. High hopes: Scolari greets Brazil's biggest talent Neymar to their World Cup training base this week . Objection: A handful of protestors also met the players, upset at the sums of money spent on the World Cup . He didn't take up the role and that lucrative three-year deal until a month later but it was all over within another seven months. It was a short spell marked with a long list of failings. Signings, Deco the prime example, never quite clicked, there were fallings out with senior players and tactical breakdowns aplenty. But more than anything, succeeding two men - Grant and Jose Mourinho - who had been unbeaten at home and going on to drop 16 of 39 points at Stamford Bridge did it for Scolari. It was an episode that scarred . Felipao, not just big in nickname but in character and confidence too. Being viewed as unable to cut it in the Premier League cut him deep. After all, this is a man who has been at the helm in three major . tournaments that also featured England. He . knocked them out of all three - the 2002 and 2006 World Cups and Euro . 2004 in between - before being denied the opportunity to continue the . streak when the Three Lions failed to qualify for Euro 2008. Never mind . Germany or Argentina, Scolari is the new Old Enemy. Hard times: Scolari is still hurt by the memories of failing to succeed during his time as Chelsea manager . So there is no little irony that here he is now, 12 months past the appointed retirement date eyeing history and relying heavily on sources of that painful experience. Bidding to become only the second man . in history - and the first since 1938 - to win two World Cups as . manager, Scolari is leaning on the league which burned him so badly, . taking six Premier League players home for action and summoning four of . his 23 from Chelsea. As . for Mourinho, the old foe whose shadow he couldn't escape at the Bridge . and who he fell out with more than once when he was Portugal coach and . the upstart was working his early magic at Porto, Scolari has a lot to . thank him for. Benefactor: Scolari has benefited from Jose Mourinho's (right) improving of Willian and Oscar at Chelsea . In deconstructing and casting afresh Willian into the relentless, all action talent he became this past season, while also tinkering and finessing the approach of Oscar, there is a mark of Mourinho in Big Phil's retooled Selecao, unlikely as Scolari is to ever acknowledge it. However, he has mellowed, he has changed. At Granja Comary he welcomed his squad almost like a father or at the very least close family. There was little of the past headmaster, more jolly uncle. New traits have blended easily though with the old reliables - most crucially, loyalty. Scolari will largely stick with his tried and trusted Confederations Cup winners in the bid for home glory. There has been some trademark luck too, not a single major injury in the build-up, while opening night opponents Croatia will have their leader of the line Mario Mandzukic suspended. They are the kind of early breaks that can shape a path to glory, that can at the very least help build confidence. 'In Brazil we only have one option,' said Scolari earlier this month. 'Winning.'Retirement can sure as hell wait. High hopes: Scolari says the Brazilian public only has one outcome in its mind for the World Cup: winning . David Luiz's huge-money swapping of London for Paris has kicked off a financial frenzy involving Brazilian defensive talent. Dani Alves looks certain to join the former Chelsea man at PSG with Marquinhos going in the opposite direction to Barcelona. Meanwhile, not be left out, Marcelo picked up a win and goal-scoring bonus in the Champions League final. We guess the drinks are on the defenders at Brazil camp. Winner: Brazil's Marcelo scores in the Champions League final victory for Real Madrid over Atletico Madrid . Brazil does music as well as it does football. Pretty damn good in other words. It's little surprise then that the host nation have proved harsh judges of the official song of the World Cup. Brazil's assessment of We Are One has been withering on a Cowell-esque scale. Rightly so, the ditty trundled out by Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez and native daughter Claudia Leitte is truly awful and about as Brazilian as a stadium finished on time. Its stock is so low that the locals would be happy enough to just rehash an old tune with #VoltaWakaWaka becoming a trending hashtag here in the hope that Shakira's anthem for South Africa 2010 can be brought back in place of J-Lo and Co. Brazil is 'One' alright, united in turning the volume down. Party time: Jennifer Lopez (left), Pitbull and Claudia Leitte perform the Official World Cup song on stage . Unison: J-Lo and Pitbull's World Cup song We Are One has been canned by the Brazilian public . Star performers: J-Lo and Claudia Leitte during recording of their World Cup song We Are One . Some Brazilian imports came and made the Premier League their own (Juninho, Gilberto Silva), some didn't quite (Mario Jardel and Afonso Alves at the head of that queue). Juliano Belletti falls somewhere between the two but that's not say there weren't spectacular moments during his three seasons at Stamford Bridge. The World Cup winning full-back scored some screamers in his time at Chelsea's and came to mind this week after Marcelo bundled in Real Madrid's third against Atlético in the Champions League final. The last Brazilian to score on European football's biggest night was none other than Belletti, who broke Arsenal hearts with the winner in the 2006 decider. Three years retired, he works as an analyst for SporTV in his homeland. Remember me? Former Chelsea defender Juliano Belletti is now working for Brazilian TV . 'We believe we are heading in the right direction. We have two more games in Brazil and all these games are designed for us to be ready for the first game against Chile.' Australia coach Ange Postecoglou after his side's sterile 1-1 draw with South Africa on Monday. The Socceroos will be the first team to arrive in Brazil when they get here on Wednesday, a full 11 days before England. Dropped into a group with Spain and Holland, as well as Chile, they probably should make the most of their pre-tournament time. They're unlikely to hang around too long after kick-off. FIFA released their stadium food and drink prices yesterday and while fans jetting in from Europe or Australia may be pleasantly surprised to find that, by home standards, they'll be far from fleeced once inside any of the 12 host arenas, the same can't be said for locals. Being asked to shell out R$6 (£1.60) for a small local beer (a large is £2.70, a large Budweiser £3.50) is hardly going to burst many budgets but being asked for R$6 for a 500ml water when any corner store in Brazil sells 1.5litre bottles for less than a quarter of the FIFA price smacks of good old-fashioned opportunism. Maybe just get plenty of H2O onboard before coming through the turnstiles. Big prices: The Brazilian public has reacted badly to FIFA's high prices for food and drink inside stadiums . June rolls around this weekend which means only one thing in the world's biggest rainforest - winter is here. But don't wheel out the gloves and snoods just yet because the relentless heat is not ready to give way in Manaus. Highs of 30C will persist all week with lows (English fans might feel 'slightly less highs' is a better term) of 23C. Consider this, stadium volunteers plucked from the local community complained of feeling ill after training runs in the heat in recent days. If that's the toll it is taking on the locals, blow-ins may be better off staying indoors.","Brazil boss Phil Scolari is set to walk away from management after the World Cup .

"World Cup organisers have closed the Fan Fest in Belo Horizonte on Friday out of respect for those killed and injured when a fly-over collapsed.

"The World Cup is just 23 days away and excitement is building. Each week our man in Brazil, Joe Callaghan, brings us the latest news and views from South America - as well as traveller tips for those heading out there - and provides a flavour of exactly how the World Cup in Brazil is shaping up. The first sign is the closed merchandise store in the hotel lobby. More subtle hints soon follow, the near-empty beaches, the complete lack of even a solitary flag or street decoration. But nothing could have summed it up better than the match fizzing out of the television at the beach hut bar across the road. There are eight sports channels available on even the most basic Brazilian satellite package, ensuring that the cradle of football is never left wanting, never at risk of running dry. And yet yesterday lunchtime, in this Rio de Janeiro suburb, across the road from the Royal Tulip Hotel that Roy Hodgson and England will call home in a couple of short weeks, it was Montpellier and Castres who were being beamed out on the widescreen...rugby...French Top 14 rugby at that. Peaceful: England's World Cup base while in Rio is the quiet Royal Tulip hotel in sleepy Sao Conrado . Calming influence: Roy Hodgson's England team will hope to keep their mind on the job in their quiet hotel . While the rest of the host nation begins to rapidly pick up the pace and catch World Cup fever (about time, given that there's just three weeks to kick-off now), Sao Conrado is the definition of seaside sleepiness. And it might just suit England fine. It might just be the coastal oasis they didn't know they needed. Okay, a Monday afternoon in winter is never likely to be the most hectic of time slots but the contrast between the slumbering surrounds of the Royal Tulip and the Caesar Park a mere six kilometres back up the coast couldn't be more stark. The latter hotel is smack bang in the middle of Ipanema Beach, the red-hot centre of Rio's tourist hub, a landing spot for a fair whack of the 600,000 expected to descend on Brazil pretty soon. It also happens to be the base chosen by Holland and Louis van Gaal. There's a bone dry joke to be made about the fact that it is England and not the Dutch who will call a place with a giant golden tulip on the edifice home during the World Cup. Given that the incoming Manchester United manager was once labelled a 'dictator, without the slightest sense of humour' by Zlatan Ibrahimovich, Van Gaal probably wouldn't appreciate the joke. But, with the already intense spotlight being ratcheted up a couple of hundred watts in the wake of yesterday's confirmation from Old Trafford, he'd arguably appreciate the peace and quiet that his English counterpart will enjoy here in Rio. Party time: England have avoided the hussle and bussle of Rio's Ipanema Beach, where the Dutch are staying . Sao Conrado is cut off from Ipanema, Copacabana and the heart of the city by a soaring rock outcrop called Dois Irmaos. It translates as Two Brothers and together they'll give the Three Lions a shield from the hype and the hoopla and the heat. Not that they are actively running away from it, they may just have found welcome shade by accident (the original hotel they picked was on the seafront in Copacabana but Hodgson and advisors quickly changed tack when FIFA unveiled plans for a massive fan fest and big screens across the road). It may not be an official FA diktat but across the board relaxation, a loosening of the leash, appears to be the theme of the planning behind this campaign. Unlike Rustenburg last time out and the circus of Baden Baden before that, England's team hotel will not be closed off to the public. If you'd been prompt enough last year you could have booked a room and a spot next to Steven Gerrard and the boys at the breakfast buffet or the balcony pool. Exposed: Sunbathers hit the beach at Ipanema wearing the typically minimal Brazilian bikini . Football crazy: The locals of the Ipanema Beach practice their moves ahead of this summer's World Cup . The Royal Tulip has undergone an expensive refurb with finishing touches still being made to the grounds yesterday, while inside all was deathly quiet. The bar was empty, the restaurants, including a well-equipped burger bar, equally short of punters. The lobby's World Cup shop - featuring only Brazilian merchandise, not a St George's Cross in sight - was shut but two luxury jewellery shops on site, including H Stern, were open for business, readying for the invasion of the WAGS perhaps. The Fashion Mall (not a whole pile of imagination used in coming up with that name) next door is equally looking forward to Colleen and Co pitching up. But Monday lunchtime was very much the calm before that storm. The always frantic Rocinha favela - with a population estimated somewhere north of 200,000 - may be a six-minute walk away from the hotel's door (in its previous guise as the Intercontinental, there was a hostage shoot-out here just four years ago) but it is passing buses that make the only racket outside the grounds. Getting ready: England's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left), Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge off to the training camp . There aren't a whole pile of other hotels about, instead Sao Conrado is primarily where some of Rio's affluent escape home to after a day in the chaos and gridlock of the city, which admittedly England will have to partly navigate on their daily trek to their training pitch at the military academy in Urca 15kms away. Wayne Rooney, Gerrard and the rest will move in on June 8 when their preparations in Miami are complete. Yesterday Sao Conrado looked like it couldn't care less. Wannabe surfers practiced in the whitewash, one in an Argentina shirt with Messi emblazoned on the back, a cyclist whizzed by on the prom in an AC Milan jersey but that's about all the football you got until four locals begin a languid game of foot-volley on the beach. Fittingly, by Brazilian standards, it's low-key. That might just suit England fine. Hectic: Holland boss Louis van Gaal and his players will be staying right in the heart of the action in Ipanema . Oh ye of little faith! With a whopping 24 days to spare (what was all the rushing about?), the venue for the opening game of the World Cup held its first proper football match on Sunday and passed the test with, not quite flying colours, but airborne shades of white and grey. Arena Corinthians, which will also play host to what shapes to be England's decisive clash with Uruguay in Sao Paulo, welcomed 36,000 through the turnstiles. There were issues with the unfinished roof and FIFA today confirmed another last-minute test match on May 29 just to be really sure but in what was a hit-or-miss moment, this was a hit, apart from the small matter of what happened on the field. Corinthians were humbled by bottom boys Figueirense, a timely reminder that after all the build-up there is the small matter of delivering on the pitch too. Unfinished: The Arena Corinthians - where England play Uruguay - hosted its first match on the weekend . Okay, if it seems like we feature Fred every other week, that's probably because we do. But there's just no escaping the big man down here. As the figurehead of Phil Scolari's 2014 incarnation, the targetman is, well, a target. Opposing defenders love nothing more than going toe-to-toe with the man the nation will depend upon in a few weeks. And they know how to wind him up. It all got too much for Fred this weekend when two yellow cards in 90 seconds - the second courtesy of a disgraceful dive from Gremio's Alan Ruiz - saw the Fluminense man sent off. Scolari might be glad to see his lynchpin get some rest. But if his No 9 can't keep his cool against a wiry antagonist in the domestic game, can he rely on him to take on the world next month? Remember me? Maradona (Argentina/Enfant Terrible) Think you've seen Maradona in every ridiculous environment imaginable? Unless you've seen him play a human chair, you might just have to think that one over again. Pele may the one truly cleaning up on the endorsement front with nearly £20million in sponsorship deals already secured. But that doesn't mean there's no room for Maradona aboard the gravy train. The Argentine is far from hated in these parts and seems as game for a laugh as ever if this ad for a Brazilian version of eBay is anything to go by. Part of the World Cup furniture? You bet. Flustered: Brazil boss Phil Scolari believes a public inquiry into his finances is 'malicious' Quote of the week: . 'If it is a confidential inquiry, why has it been made public? Because it’s something malicious.' Big Phil Scolari not all that enamoured with the Portuguese authorities for going public with their investigations into his alleged tax irregularities, the timing of which was a little too convenient for the host nation's liking. Travellers tip: Attack of the cloners . This one, unfortunately, comes from personal experience. But seeing as we're just 22 days away now, the first waves of the estimated 600,000 overseas visitors will be pitching up in Brazil's international airports from this week onwards. So a word of warning - don't use the airport ATMs. Entry points are absolute blackspots for credit and ATM card cloning with Rio de Janeiro's Galeao Airport the most notorious of the lot...even the major international banks who have machines at the terminal. Having fallen victim to the skimmers ourselves, and endured a six-week wait for new cards to arrive, just do yourselves a favour and have enough cash for the taxi or bus into the city. Amazon forecast: How’s the weather up in Manaus? Okay, we've fretted over the heat and humidity and tropical Amazonian deluges for a fair few months now. Things don't look like changing there any time soon but maybe we should be more worried about Sao Paulo if this weekend was anything to go by. A winter World Cup in Brazil should still have promised plenty of sun but we're not so sure fans signed up for hail storms last seen the other side of the Old Testament. These pictures of locals wading through feet-deep hail paint a not so pretty picture.

"It's not every day that you enter into battle with Lewis Hamilton on a race track, and it's not every day that you beat him either. So, with that in mind, my very intimate karting date with the Mercedes superstar earlier this month must be considered an enormous success. Move over, Hamilton; Britain has a new racing star in town. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Hamilton drive a Robin Reliant in a car football game! Plan: Sportsmail's Phil Duncan (far right) chats with Lewis Hamilton after the big race . Ready: Our man Duncan (second from left) with his fellow Fleet Street drivers . Ready: Sportsmail's Duncan sits in car No 3 and gets himself ready to race with Hamilton . It's the beginning of June, and I am on the outskirts of Hertfordshire at Rye House Karting track, a venue which is now synonymous with the motoring birth place of Hamilton. While there is moisture in the air, and the clouds are darkening, for now it is dry. The brief is simple; we would contest a 15-minute qualifying session to decide the order of the grid before participating in a race of the same duration. Hamilton, who started his career here at the tender age of just eight, would start from the back of the pack. This was the 2008 world champion's stomping ground when he was growing up. It is a track he knows well, and one that we didn't. Perhaps he felt he needed a challenge? After securing pole ahead of my Fleet Street rivals, I knew the start to this most surreal of races would be imperative. Sitting stationary on the grid and waiting for my competitors to take up their respective positions, my heart begins to pound through my overalls and my breathing intensifies. But suddenly, the green flag drops and . we're racing. I pull immediately to my left to secure the racing line . ahead of the opening, long, sweeping right hander. Go: The green flag drops as the racers get going with Hamilton taking up at the back . From the back: Hamilton, in his shiny white Mercedes overalls and golden helmet, prepares to go . It's a promising start, and with a quick glance over my shoulder, I see the field jostling for position behind me. While we're all dressed in black, Hamilton, in his shiny white Mercedes overalls and golden helmet, is already on the move. It's a scruffy start to the race. I miss both apexes at the ensuing two hairpins, but as we enter the pit straight for the first time, somehow I have managed to retain the lead of the race. I glance around once more, and the yellow flags are out. There has been an accident at the back of the pack, but Hamilton has emerged from the melee unscathed, and from what I can see, it appears as though he is already up to fourth. I knew it wouldn't be long before the 29-year-old would be breathing down my neck. Keeping him at bay: Hamilton jostles for position with Duncan . No fair: Hamilton knows the Rye House Karting track well as he levels with our man on a bend . We're midway through the second lap, and indeed here he comes. As we exit the hairpin, Hamilton gets the better drive and draws alongside me. We glide along the pit-straight and look directly at one other, before he gestures that I take the corner ahead of him by holding out his left hand. I'm sure that's the first, and probably only time, he's ever done that in his motor racing career. 'What a gent', I think, only to realise that his act of goodwill is for his own personal pleasure. Indeed, he would spend the course of the lap toying with me; much in the same vein as my pet cat does with her prey in the garden. In this case, I am the helpless mouse. Hamilton knows he will get me eventually, but he is going to make sure he has fun doing it. He relentlessly bumps the back of my kart along the back straight - a tactic he says he employed throughout his junior career - before diving underneath me at the right hander and securing the lead of the race. Joker: Hamilton toyed with the racers on track like a cat does with its prey in the garden . My resistance lasted the best part of 1600 metres, some 85 seconds, but in the blink of an eye it is over, and Hamilton sails off into the distance despite my best efforts to cling on to the back of his four-stroke engine. Fortunately, the Mercedes man's charitable side returns, and he slows down to let his flock of sheep catch up. His act of kindness ultimately allows me to clinch the win. A false victory perhaps, but I'll always be able to tell the story of the day I beat Lewis Hamilton. 'You're all pretty bad at karting,' Hamilton says afterwards as we catch our breath in the clubhouse. He turns to his left, before addressing my Daily Telegraph colleague and I: 'You two were OK.' It's not exactly a glowing endorsement, but it will do. Until next time, Lewis… . End: Hamilton didn't win, albeit because of his charitable side, and let our man catch up to pass first . Verdict: Hamilton said Duncan and one of his fellow racers 'were OK' after the race .","Lewis Hamilton races Sportsmail's Phil Duncan at Rye House Karting track .

"The World Cup is just nine days away and excitement is building. Each week our man in Brazil, Joe Callaghan, brings us the latest news and views from South America - as well as traveller tips for those heading out there - and provides a flavour of exactly how the World Cup in Brazil is shaping up. .................................................................................................................................................... Paris and the rest of the world will have to wait. The most expensive central defensive partnership ever assembled will not be on show in Goiania on Tuesday night. Brazil's penultimate World Cup warm-up against Panama will feature David Luiz, Paris Saint-Germain's latest record-breaker, but club and country captain Thiago Silva has been left at base to fully shake off a niggle before real battle commences next week. PSG's money men may have been able to put a price (£85million, give or take) on the Luiz-Silva tandem, even if some sceptics are convinced they have missed a decimal point on the former's world-record fee. But it's likely that Luis Felipe Scolari would be unable to do similar. For him, the duo who make up the beating heart of his defence are utterly priceless. Central role: Neymar is the poster boy for Brazil's hopes at the World Cup this summer . Foundations: But Luiz Felipe Scolari has built his side on a firm defensive structure . No way through: David Luiz and Thiago Silva have been a major factor in Brazil's recent success . The game against Panama will mark the 21st match of Scolari's second stint at the helm of the Selecao. It's been a pretty successful 18 months in charge for the former World Cup winner, last summer's Confederations Cup victory the undoubted highlight. Neymar is thrust forward as the poster boy of that victory and Big Phil's redesigned national team, but it is his defensive pairing who have been the true starting point, the bedrock for a construction job that the manager hopes will end on July 13 with a second crown. A need to blood the previously untested Dante coupled with an injury here and there for the captain meant Scolari hasn't been able to pair Luiz and Silva together as much as he'd like - namely every minute of every game. But when he has done so, the results are staggering. On Scolari's watch, Brazil have a winning percentage of 83.33 percent when Luiz and Silva start together. Without them, that number plummets to 50 percent. They have partnered up 12 times in his 20 games, with 10 wins (nine of which have come against teams who will feature at the World Cup) and two draws. Throw in their 50 percent rate of clean sheets and their momentous importance is clear. Fearsome combination: Silva and Luiz have won 10 of their 12 appearances together under Scolari for Brazil . Expectation: Scolari is under massive pressure to win the World Cup for Brazil on home soil . 'Thiago is a great friend, a great player and I get along very well with him,' said Luiz this week. The younger of the two by two years, he made his debut in 2010 against the USA inevitably alongside Silva. They are indeed friends, but Ant and Dec are friends, they're not going to win you a World Cup. The narrative that they make for an odd couple may seem like an easy one. But it's also true. Opposites off the field, they're very different defenders too. And that might just be why it's worked so well. Arguably the finest defender at this World Cup, Silva is a supreme reader of a game, his mental strengths, his concentration unparalleled. It is specifically in that part of the game that Luiz has suffered the brain fades that caused Jose Mourinho and others to lose a little trust in him as a last line. But he remains technically gifted and one hell of an athlete. If Luiz has one of those 'moments' (of which he has had a lot fewer than most critics imply), there's a good chance Silva will have seen it coming. If Silva is technically outfoxed, there's a good chance Luiz will be able to scramble and have his partner's back. Understanding: Silva and Luiz will become team-mates at Paris Saint-Germain next season . During that relentless run to the Confederations Cup crown, two Brazilian toddlers by the names of Lian and Murillo became viral sensations, being retweeted from coast to coast and sending social media into a frenzy. The problem was almost nobody who saw the image of the two Disney-movie adorable kids sitting on the bonnet of a car knew who Lian and Murillo were. Instead they were told it was a picture of Thiago Silva and David Silva as children, not their mini-mes. And they lapped it up. In that motivational poster font that jumped the shark around the same time as Big Brother, taglines like 'some things never change', 'childhood friends are the best friends' or 'started from the bottom, now we here' were added. The intervening 12 months have seen it pop up on twitter or blogs oh, about every five minutes, as people fall for it all over again. Apart from the incredible likeness - especially so from mini-Thiago - the reason it's fooled so many for so long now is because it kind of just fits. Watch Brazil's odd couple do their thing at the back and it's easy to believe, such is the incredible depth of understanding between them, that they've doing it since they were both fresh out of nappies and kicking worn-bald leather balls up dusty streets. They haven't. The scary thing is they've only been doing it for a couple of years. They've just made up for a lot of lost time. Stand-in: Bayern Munich defender Dante is likely to play alongside Luiz in Silva's absence . Those who lamented Paraguay's failure to qualify for Brazil can celebrate last-minute redemption. No Roque Santa Cruz and co aren't going to feature after all but the World Cup's most famous semi-clad fan is. Larissa Riquelme became a bit of a global sensation, being labelled the girlfriend of the World Cup, during the last tournament when she promised to run naked through Asuncion if Paraguay won it all. Of course they didn't, but in the end the supermodel and actress did it anyway. Fears that Paraguay's absence may mean her 15 minutes of fame were definitely up were alleviated yesterday though when she confirmed on Brazilian TV that she is on her way. 'As I always say, there will be a thousand 'Larissa Riquelmes' competing for the title, but they can never replace me. The others can be lovers, wives, muses, but I'm the only girlfriend of the Cup,' she said, sounding a bit on the over-possessive side. Unfortunately for her followers, she is also the girlfriend of an actual human being - Paraguayan international Jonathan Fabbro. Sensation: Paraguay fan Larissa Riquelme shot to global fame during the 2010 World Cup . Missing out: When Paraguay failed to qualify for the 2014 World Cup there were fears Riquelme wouldn't attend . No fear: But in an interview in Brazil, Riquelme has confirmed she will be in attendance this summer . Samba star: Riquelme's decision to grace the World Cup will undoubtedly please plenty of football fans . With organisers upgrading their projected figures for foreign visitors from 600,000 to over 800,000, Brazil's domestic clubs must be hoping some of the tourists hang around to take a game or two in after the tournament. The cradle for football the host nation may be, but you wouldn't know it from the desperate state of the domestic game. The Brasileirao championship takes a break for the duration of the tournament but in the nine rounds that have already taken place, the average attendance comes in just a sliver over 12,000. That's respectable for the upper half of England's third tier. Not so much when you're talking about Brazil's biggest and brightest. 'I had spoken with the coach...they had already got the paperwork ready. We had a conversation but nothing that enthused me. I never wanted to play for another country.' Bayern Munich defender Dante reveals he how he turned down Belgium's approach in 2009 and in the process gets a sharp dig in at Diego Costa, who was clearly 'enthused' enough by Spain's advances to jump ship. Denial: Brazil defender Dante was not interested in representing Belgium at international level . Jibe: Dante's comments could be perceived to be targeted at Diego Costa who chose Spain over Brazil . Brazil's stadiums are largely good to go - handy that, seeing as the thing kicks off next week - but they will not be mobile-friendly. 3G is a no-go zone even during Brazilian league games at the likes of the Maracana or the Corinthians Arena. So sack the selfies, turn off Twitter and watch the game. It's a World Cup after all. Eyes on the pitch: Selfies are popular, as shown by this picture of England footballers Daniel Sturridge, Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain but they may not be possible in Brazilian football stadiums due to a lack of 3G . A whole pile better than in Miami, that's for sure.","Luiz Felipe Scolari has built his team with a sound defensive structure .

"Lewis Hamilton will head into tomorrow's Chinese Grand Prix holding a giant psychological edge over Nico Rosberg after sending his team-mate, and biggest rival for the title, into a spin on Saturday - quite literally. Hamilton was in electric form throughout Saturday's qualifying session topping the timesheets in Q1, Q2, and crucially when it mattered, in Q3. And his dominance in the damp conditions seemingly got under the skin of Rosberg who was ragged throughout. In a spin: Nico Rosberg will start from the second row after a number of mistakes during qualifying in Shanghai . Difficult day at the office: Rosberg will start only on the second row after rival Lewis Hamilton secured pole . The German, who still leads Hamilton in the championship by 11 points, ran wide on his very first out-lap which set the tone for the remainder of qualifying. After seeing Hamilton go one second clear following their respective first runs in Q3, Rosberg made a complete hash of his next attempt at pole, running deep at turn 14 – he had been fastest in the first two sectors – before spinning on the exit of the final corner on the following lap. Rosberg later claimed he took a 'big risk' on his final timed lap after his steering wheel informed him he was two tenths down on his personal best when he was actually half-a-second quicker. As a result he will start from the second row and behind both Red Bulls tomorrow, and faces an uphill challenge to prevent Hamilton winning once more.  Advantage, Lewis. On track: Hamilton excelled in the tricky conditions to secure his third pole of the campaign so far . Hamilton can now lay claim to being the greatest qualifier ever to emerge from these shores. The 29-year-old surpassed Jim Clark's record with his 34th career pole in China, with now only Sebastian Vettel (45), Ayrton Senna (65) and Michael Schumacher (68) ahead of him on the all-time list. The impressive achievement was somewhat lost on the Briton afterwards, however.  When informed of his new record, Hamilton claimed: 'Oh, really? I didn't know that.' A dose of short-term memory loss from Hamilton perhaps, considering he talked in such glowing terms of matching Clark's record in Malaysia three weeks ago. 'When they mentioned it, I couldn't believe it,' said Hamilton after securing pole-position in Sepang. 'I'd never have dreamed I would have the amount of poles I have.' Centre of attention: Lewis Hamilton will start on pole ahead of Daniel Ricciardo (left) and Sebastian Vettel . Daniel Ricciardo maintained his impressive start to his Red Bull career after out-qualifying team-mate Sebastian Vettel for the third time in just four races. Incredibly, it means the young Australian has now got the better of Vettel more times this season than Mark Webber managed throughout the entirety of 2013. We perhaps shouldn't be surprised by Ricciardo's one-lap pace – he often impressed at Toro Rosso, too, only to flatter to deceive on race day – while we must acknowledge too that Vettel suffered with car issues in both Australia and in Bahrain. Nevertheless, this remains a strong season for the Aussie, Indeed he would have been third in the championship without his disqualification from the campaign opener in Melbourne. Life in the fast lane: Ricciardo has been hugely impressive in his debut season for Red Bull . The hugely anticipated Fernando Alonso vs Kimi Raikkonen duel at Ferrari has been somewhat of a damp squib so far. Raikkonen has only seven points to his name – compared to the 26 scored by Alonso – while the Finn failed to progress from Q3; he will start only 11th on Sunday with Alonso six places further up the grid. Alonso is now 3-1 up on his team-mate in qualifying, and has finished each of opening three races ahead of Raikkonen, too. Indeed, the surly Finn has spent just eight racing laps in front of Alonso this term. The Ferrari team is built around Alonso, and it's evident that Raikkonen is finding it difficult to muscle his way in.  It appeared an odd decision to re-hire Raikkonen after effectively sacking him in 2009, and while it is the early days of his second career at Maranello, foreseeing an equally disappointing end isn't such a far-fetched theory. Getting the job done: Fernando Alonso, who will start fifth, is winning the intra-team battle against Kimi Raikkonen . Spinning while taking his eyes off the road, crashing in the pit-lane, and failing to get out of the garage for qualifying; it's about as close to a nightmare weekend as you can get for Pastor Maldonado. The Venezuelan will start plum last in tomorrow's race after suffering an oil leak on his Lotus. There was some joy for Maldonado however, whose five-place grid penalty for sending Esteban Gutierrez into a jaw-dropping 360 degree flip in Bahrain effectively becoming irrelevant. Bad day at the office: Pastor Maldonado has endured a nightmare weekend - he crashed in the pits on Friday .","Nico Rosberg says he spun after wrong information from steering wheel .

"F1 star Jenson Button has revealed the special pink helmet he will wear at the British GP this weekend as a tribute to his late father. Sunday has been designated ‘Pink For Papa’ day as it marks the McLaren driver’s first trip to Silverstone without his dad John, who passed away in January this year. John Button played a key role in Jenson’s career, only missing one of his son’s races in 14 seasons prior to his death. Charity: Button will be racing in this special pink helmet at Silverstone in memory of his father John . Respect: On the back of the pink helmet there is a cartoon of Papa Smurf, with the message 'RIP PAPA' Pink for Papa: Jenson and his stunning fiancee Jessica pose in the special pink shirts which are on sale to raise money for charity . Close bond: Jenson Button with his late father John who used to wear a 'lucky' pink shirt on race-day . And the McLaren star has is asking fans to show their support by going pink – the colour of John’s traditional ‘lucky’ race-day shirt. McLaren have created a special T-shirt which supporters can buy, with proceeds going to the Henry Surtees Foundation - an organisation set up by former world champion John Surtees, in memory of his son Henry, which assists and supports people with injuries caused by accidents. Other stars including Jenson’s model fiancée Jessica Michibata, former World Champion Damon Hill and TV presenters Natalie Pinkman, Simon Lazenby and Lee McKenzie have already shown their support by posing in their pink t-shirts. Jenson said: ‘This year will be extra special for me, and probably a little more emotional than normal - it’s normally very emotional anyway because of the support, but it will be more so this year,’ said Button. British racing legend: Damon Hill shows his support for Jenson Button and his dad by wearing pink shirt . Outsider: Button admits he has 'no chance' of a podium finish at the British Grand Prix .

He is haunted by the fact that not once in 14 previous attempts in his home race as he managed to finish in the top three and soak up the acclaim of an often fervent support. ‘We won’t get on the podium at Silverstone. No chance!’ said a forlorn Button. ‘As it’s my home race I’ll get an extra lift, but it won’t make us go any quicker - I wish it would.’","McLaren driver asks fans to wear something pink on Sunday in tribute to his dad John who died in January .

"Queens Park Rangers owner Tony Fernandes is ready to put Caterham up for sale and is believed to be demanding £350million for the Formula One team. The Malaysian businessman saw QPR win promotion back to the Barclays Premier League on Saturday after Bobby Zamora scored a 90th-minute winner in their play-off final victory against Derby on Saturday. Fernandes has confirmed the club, which he bought in 2011, will fight the possibility of a £50million fine for breaching Football League Financial Play regulations. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tony Fernandes show off the play-off trophy... with beer in hand . Up for the ride: Tony Fernandes, seen here celebrating QPR's win with Joey Barton, wants to sell Caterham . Offer: Fernandes reportedly will put Caterham up for sale and is demanding £350m for the group . In March, the club posted a staggering . £65.4m loss for the year ending May 2013. Under the rules, clubs are . only entitled to make an £8m loss per season. And a report in Malaysia on Sunday has claimed he is now ready to end his association with F1 backmarkers Caterham. Fernandes entered the sport with Caterham - formerly known as Lotus Racing - in 2010, but his team have failed to score a single point. The 50-year-old warned this year that he would stop if Caterham fail to improve and after a best result of 13th with Kamui Kobayashi in Malaysia. he seems ready to pull the plug. 'If we’re at the back I don’t think I’m going to carry on,' Fernandes said. 'Nothing is set in stone but after five years with no points there is a limit to one’s patience, money, motivation, etc, so it’s an important year.'","Fernandes saw QPR win promotion back to the Premier League yesterday .

"The Chinese Grand Prix ended two laps earlier than scheduled after the chequered flag was mistakenly waved before the end of the race. Incredibly, the embarrassing blunder greeted the leader, and eventual winner, Lewis Hamilton, who reported the mistake over the team radio as he began his final lap. 'That was very strange. I was thinking ""am I seeing things?"",' Hamitlon said afterwards. 'I looked up, I was coming across the line expecting to do another lap and all of a sudden I looked for a split second and I saw the flag. 'I lifted for a second and I saw there was no one on the wall, so then I just kept going. 'I did lose a second or so. I asked the team, they said no, so I just kept going.' Over the line: Lewis Hamilton punches the air as he celebrates his victory at the Chinese Grand Prix . Man in the middle: Hamilton with his Mercedes mechanics after winning his third consecutive race . Under FIA rules, the race was subsequently classified after 54 laps, rather than the scheduled 56-lap race. While Hamilton's victory still stood, the error meant Caterham driver Kamui Kobayashi's last-lap move on the Marussia of Jules Bianchi for 17th did not count. The ruling states:  'Should for any reason the end-of-race signal be given before the leading car completes the scheduled number of laps, or the prescribed time has been completed, the race will be deemed to have finished when the leading car last crossed the line before the signal was given.' At this stage it remains unclear why the chequered flag was waved prematurely; although it is worth noting that there were several erroneous blue flags – which warns a driver that he is about to be lapped – throughout today's race. Sebastian Vettel was, rather painfully, ordered to move over for Red Bull team-mate Daniel Ricciardo for the second consecutive race. Unlike in the previous round at Bahrain however, the four-time world champion wasn't compliant, saying 'tough luck' upon discovering that the faster Ricciardo was on fresher tyres. The Australian passed Vettel two laps later, but there remains some doubt as to whether the 26-year-old had actually given the place. Move over: Vettel was deemed to be holding his younger team-mate up and was asked to let him through . Coming through: Daniel Ricciardo passes his Red Bull team-mate Sebastian Vettel at turn 1 . Indeed, it's not beyond the realms of possibility that Vettel went too deep on his brakes at Turn 1, rather than moving aside. 'I think there was no point holding him back further,' Vettel, who finished a whopping 25 seconds adrift of Ricciardo, said after the race, insistent that he played to the team instruction. The result comes after Vettel, who ended the race in fifth, was out-qualified by Ricciardo for the third time in four races this season on Saturday. And his difficult weekend further intensified when he was overtaken by the Caterham backmarker of Kobayashi in the closing stages. Red Bull team principal admitted that Vettel doesn't have 'the feel that he usually gets from the car which is so unusual'. Concerning times for the man who dominated the sport last season. On the run: The reigning world champion has endured a troubled start to the 2014 campaign . Hamilton's 25th career victory takes him to eighth on the all-time list alongside his boss, in Niki Lauda, and the legendary Jim Clark, whose pole record he surpassed yesterday. His flawless display also marked the first time he had won three consecutive races in his grand prix career, becoming the first Briton to achieve such a feat since Jenson Button claimed four on the spin in 2009. Following on from Nico Rosberg's dominant display in Australia, Hamilton's ominous performance also means that Mercedes have now led every lap of the first four races.  Williams were the last team to do that when Nigel Mansell stormed to victories in South Africa, Mexico, Brazil and Spain back in 1992. Champagne moment: The jubilant Mercedes team, seen here celebrating their 1-2, have led every lap so far this year . Felipe Massa's chances of finishing inside the top six were dealt a fatal blow after a rather embarrassing pit-stop which saw the Williams man re-join the race track in last place. Massa made an electric – and wild start – banging wheels with former Ferrari team-mate Fernando Alonso after being squeezed by the Red Bulls. He was running in sixth at the time of his stop, but ended the race down in 15th after a mix-up by the Williams mechanics who had mistakenly swapped the rear wheels around. On the move: Felipe Massa was in line for a promising result before his team's gaffe during his opening pit-stop . Upon realising their gaffe, the mechanics swapped sides, only for there then to be a problem getting the rear-left tyre on to Massa's Williams. 'There was a mistake at the first pit-stop and that effectively lost me the race as I came back out on track in last position,' said Massa. 'It is a frustrating situation and something we need to work on to make sure that it doesn't happen again.' Out of sorts: Kimi Raikkonen finished 50 seconds adrift of Ferrari team-mate Fernando Alonso . Kimi Raikkonen continues to be blown away by Fernando Alonso following his winter switch to Ferrari. The Finn, who qualified a miserable 12th yesterday, has managed just eight laps ahead of Alonso at the opening four races, and finished toady's grand prix a gargantuan 50 seconds adrift of his team-mate. Indeed, while Alonso celebrated his and Ferrari's first podium of the season, Raikkonen finished a lowly eighth, some 20 seconds down on Valterri Bottas, who was one place better off. The Finn has just 11 points to his name; he had 67 at the same stage last season.","Lewis Hamilton still classified as the winner despite the mistake .

"The number 10 has always inferred something mystical, implying an almost divine talent to elevate the sport into the heavens and produce the game’s defining moments. From Diego Maradona and Michel Platini, to Ronaldinho and Zinedine Zidane, these are the ‘game-changers’, the graceful technicians who glide effortlessly like ice-skaters and instinctively seek out space and angles among the gangs of opponents. They are the headline-makers, the ones who speak a language unintelligible to us mortals. This World Cup has been no different, the star performances produced by those whose jerseys are adorned by that famous number: Neymar for Brazil, Lionel Messi for Argentina, James Rodriguez for Colombia. Change: Traditional centre forwards have struggled in Brazil and number 10s like Neymar have flourished . Class: The World Cup has always featured great number 10s like France's Zinedine Zidane . Memorable: Argentina's Diego Maradona was also a number 10 and a legend of the game . Samba: Brazil's Ronaldinho is another great World Cup number 10 . Skilful: France's Michel Platini was a brilliant number 10 in the 1980s . Poor: Traditional centre forwards like Belgium's Romelu Lukaku have struggled at the World Cup . Others special showings have come from those players awarded the freedom to flit between the lines and commit opponents, such as Arjen Robben for Holland and Thomas Muller for Germany. These five players, without question the most influential in Brazil, have twenty goals between them and make up five of the top six scorers in the competition. There is nothing new in the phenomenon of the magical number 10, yet their overbearing influence on this World Cup, assuming all the striking responsibility, presents the question as to where the conventional forward has disappeared. The central striker have fallen into a black hole, the number 10’s deprived of a lethal partner, increasingly tasked as the solo artists that must bring the rest of the band to life. So what of the number 9, is he now consigned to the role of foil, offering merely perspiration to facilitate the inspiration of Mr 10? The evidence of this World Cup would presume so. Star: Argentina's Lionel Messi has lit up the World Cup in Brazil with four goals in four games . Clinical: James Rodriguez has netted five goals and number 10s make up five of the top six scorers . For Brazil, Fred has barely registered, a lamentable apology for the host nation’s whose heights have been scaled by Ronaldo and Romario in recent years. He has touched the ball just ninety times in four games, compared to the 264 times that Neymar’s golden boots have caressed the Brazuca. Others have fallen beneath their usual level, Sergio Aguero and Gonzalo Higuain the shade to Messi’s light for Argentina. Napoli forward Higuain has played four matches, failing to score or complete a dribble and offering just one assist as a contribution. This World Cup has exposed the traditional centre forward role as a dying art, deemed as a luxury as tactics evolve. Theories abound over the need to contribute to every phase of play, to take part in the defensive effort rather than merely apply the finishing flourish. Would a Gary Lineker or Gerd Muller be indulged by an international coach in this era? Possibly not. Goals are no longer the currency by which strikers are judged. Awful: Brazil centre forward Fred has struggled to show any sort of form during the World Cup . Unusual: Holland's Robin van Persie has bucked the trend of centre forwards and scored three goals . Romelu Lukaku toiled with little success for Belgium before being dropped. Germany have not started with a conventional centre-forward in any game, only hailing for the poacher Miroslav Klose when behind against Ghana. Javier Hernandez, the Manchester United forward with a better international striking ratio than Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, did not start a match in Brazil for Mexico. There have been some impressive showings, with Robin van Persie outstanding for Holland in his first two games, before rather tailing off in the knockout round against Mexico. Karim Benzema has scored three for France, netting two against Honduras and one against Switzerland, but must now produce in the knock-out rounds. Students of modern coaching, however, would argue that Van Persie and Benzema are ‘nine-and-a-halves’, to borrow a phrase from Brendan Rodgers. Speaking with Sportsmail this time last year, Robbie Fowler diagnosed the ‘number 9’ malaise as an issue for English football. ‘Everyone wants to play a 4-2-3-1 formation, with just the one striker,’ Fowler explained, ‘We had so many talented English strikers in the Nineties, with Alan Shearer, Teddy Sheringham, Andy Cole, Les Ferdinand, Ian Wright and Michael Owen but they were mostly playing in partnerships, too. Changing of the guard? Traditional centre forwards like Alan Shearer are disappearing from the game . Rarity: Out and out scorers like Michael Owen are becoming less common as time goes by . ‘Now, there is the No 9 and the No 10. The 10 plays behind the nine so they are never really playing as a genuine partnership. That might have hindered the number of forwards coming through. You can only play the one so youngsters may be thinking of playing somewhere else because there is just the one striking position up for grabs. That may have something to do with it. I have played in the lone striker role and my game was not really suited to that. If I were playing now, I would try to play in the No 10 position.’ In October, Arsene Wenger then went one step further, arguing that this is a continental-wide epidemic in Europe. The Arsenal manager, explaining why his pursuit of attacking reinforcements had proved so troublesome, said: ‘Europe still produces fantastic football players but if you look closely, we do not produce top strikers anymore. Very few. All the big strikers now come from South America. During the summer, Falcao went to Monaco, Cavani went to PSG, everybody wanted to sign Luis Suarez and Gonzalo Higuain went to Napoli for big money. Scarce: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger believes there are a dearth of centre forwards in Europe . ‘That’s an area where in Europe it is difficult to find great strikers. Even in Germany, where I can remember so many great strikers from years gone by, they are producing many exceptional players but not young strikers. Is that a consequence of the way we coach? Of modern life? I do not know.’ The feeling from this World Cup in Brazil suggests that Wenger was well-reasoned but perhaps he underestimated the debate, for this is an issue that will engulf youth coaches worldwide in the years to come.","Brazil has been dominated by number 10s Messi, Neymar and Rodriguez .

"On Friday, Susie Wolff will become the first driver to participate in a Formula One grand prix weekend in over two decades, and Claire Williams believes it as a 'massive step forward' for the sport. Wolff, the 31-year-old development driver at Williams, will take part in Friday's opening practice session for the British Grand Prix - the 50th edition at Silverstone -  replacing Valtteri Bottas. 'For Formula One as a whole it sends out a really powerful message,' Williams, the British team's deputy team principal, said. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Felipe Massa catches a lift with Susie Wolff in DTM car . Girlpower: Williams' Susie Wolff during the paddock day at Silverstone ahead of the British Grand Prix .

She has got here on merit and it will be fantastic to see what tomorrow brings for her, but also for the future of Formula One.' It is 22 years since a female driver took to the wheel during a race weekend, while you have to go back to 1976 when Italian driver Lella Lombardi last competed in a race. Wolff came through the junior ranks of karting before stints in Formula Renault and German Touring Car series DTM before being snapped up by Williams in 2012. But her failure to win a race during her professional career, coupled with her romantic association with Williams shareholder Toto Wolff have led some to argue she is fortunate to land a seat with the British team. 'When she was karting, she was the only girl.

'I really hope it encourages more girls to take up karting and to come up through the junior ranks because Susie has shown that you can do it, and she has also demonstrated that Formula One is a non-gender bias sport. We are a sport that welcomes men and women to take part in a race on a Sunday afternoon and not a lot of sports can actually say that.' Wolff will also get behind the wheel during practice for the German Grand Prix later this month, but Williams admitted there were no plans in place for the Scot to usurp regular drivers Felipe Massa and Bottas. 'At the moment, we have two race drivers who are contracted to the team; you never say never, but that is not part of the plan today,' she said. 'When you are a team principal, the only thing you care about when you are looking at a potential driver to put in your car is talent and that comes with speed, technical feedback, the whole package. Whether you are a boy or a girl it doesn't make a difference. No-one cares about that.' Male dominated: Only five women have taken part in a race weekend in Formula One history .

"Wimbledon will not be changing the way the grass is prepared for next week’s start, despite all the slips and falls that became such a  talking point 12 months ago. Few know the lawns of the All England Club as well as Tim Henman, who revealed yesterday that research by the club found no underlying cause for the amount of players who marked the first week by sprawling all over the courts. ‘It didn’t perturb myself or Neil Stubley (the head groundsman) because we  collect and study so much information about the courts,’ said Henman. ‘We scientifically measure things like their hardness, the length of the grass, the moisture, the bounce. These were found to be identical to the year before. Keep off the grass! Tim Henman claims there is no reason why players were losing their footing at SW19 . ‘I was watching Queen’s and seeing players sliding everywhere and nobody was commenting. There will always be some slips and falls on new grass courts early in a tournament and it’s understandable that there is more focus on Wimbledon. ‘I think it was emphasised a bit more last year because some high-profile players like Maria Sharapova and Caroline Wozniacki had falls. One of the benefits of having a three-week gap between the French and Wimbledon from next year is that players will have more time to adjust and they will be  moving better from the start.’ Henman sits on the tournament’s Committee of Management that also hands out wildcards and hopes the arrival of Australian Bob Brett as the LTA’s Director of Player Development will mean more British players put a strong case forward for receiving them. Legs akimbo: Novak Djokovic slips on the grass during his semi-final with Juan Martin del Porto . ‘I think he (Brett) will ensure very high standards are set. There are no grey areas about trying to be as successful a player as you can, you have to be properly committed. Dan Evans (GB No 2) is an example of someone who has a lot of natural ability but has a challenge in giving that consistent commitment.’ Henman believes that, regardless of what happened in 2013, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal are the favourites for Wimbledon. ‘I think you have to say they are, based on what has happened so far this year, but Andy Murray and Roger  Federer are only just behind. ‘Roger is . an interesting one, it’s getting harder for him at other Slams but he . should see this as a chance to add to his tally. I can see him being . very dangerous.’ Staying power: Tim Henman would like to see Andy Murray take on Amelie Mauresmo as his long-term coach . On the subject of Amelie Mauresmo, Henman believes it important that her arrival in Murray’s camp is seen as long-term and not as a trial. ‘I hope it lasts a long time because continuity is important and you don’t want an air of something being a trial. ‘I think the role of Dani (Vallverdu, Murray’s assistant coach) is going to be very important this fortnight. He doesn’t always gets the credit he deserves, he knows Andy better than anyone.’ Tim Henman is an ambassador for HSBC.

"Susie Wolff's full Formula One debut lasted just four laps and Felipe Massa suffered a huge shunt on a dreadful first morning for Williams at the British Grand Prix. Wolff, the first female racer to take to the wheel of a Formula One car at a grand prix weekend in more than two decades, suffered an oil pressure problem after just one flying lap and only 20 minutes into the hour-and-a-half session. Just moments later, Massa, in the sister Williams, lost control of his car on the exit of Stowe and crashed into the tyre barrier.

Massa climbed out of his cockpit, with fortunately only his pride dented, but his Williams team will now face a race against time to get the Brazilian's car ready for the next practice session later on Friday. It is the second big crash for Massa, who will start his 200th race this weekend, in less than a month after he was submitted to hospital following his 190mph shunt with Sergio Perez at June's Canadian Grand Prix. As for Wolff, all eyes had been on the 31-year-old Briton, who briefly topped the timesheets before she stopped on track. She ended the session over eight seconds down on championship leader Nico Rosberg, who was fastest ahead of team-mate Lewis Hamilton. Closing in: Rosberg's Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton was close behind in second place . Frustrating: The Williams of Susie Wolff is helped off the Silverstone Circuit after just four laps . Wolff will now turn her attentions to the German Grand Prix later this month where she will take part in the opening practice session at Hockenheim. 'It was a really tough day but that's Formula One sometimes,' said Wolff. 'We had an oil pressure problem which cut the engines - the guys are looking at getting it fixed for free practice two. 'I want to say a huge thank you for all the support - it means a lot and really helps. It was wonderful. 'Going out there was the best feeling and although there's been a lot of media around this run, once I had put the helmet on that was the best feeling, and as soon as I had left the pit lane, everything felt good. 'Unfortunately it was a short run but I'm going to look forward to Hockenheim.'

"A small but significant turn of the wheel will take Susie Wolff out of the Williams garage on Friday morning at Silverstone, but on a journey to where? The 31-year-old Scot will become the first woman to drive at a grand prix for 22 years, since Giovanna Amati failed to qualify for the Brazilian Grand Prix on April 4, 1992. Only five women have taken part in a race weekend in Formula One history compared to 822 men. Only two have started a race: Maria Teresa de Filippis and Lella Lombardi, in the Fifties and Seventies respectively. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Hamilton looks ahead to the British Grand Prix . Girlpower: Williams' Susie Wolff during the paddock day at Silverstone ahead of the British Grand Prix . Breaking the norm: Wolff is the first woman in 22 years to take part in F1 practice . So, in the eyes of many, Wolff  driving in practice for an hour and a half on Friday and at the German Grand Prix in a fortnight represents a welcome development. As Wolff said: ‘If there were just a handful of little girls who saw me driving and suddenly realised they could do the same, that would be the biggest positive to come out of it. It’s not a man’s world any more. It just needs to be shown that women can compete at this level and then you’ll get more and more entering.’ That sounds a noble sentiment, but her participation is controversial. Many paddocks observers view it as a stunt. They point to the fact that Wolff has not won a single race in a car, as opposed to a kart, and has not raced at all since the end of the 2012 German touring car series. Her best finish in seven years there was ninth. Her season positions were: 17th, 20th, 18th, 16th, 13th and two unclassified. Critics point to the fact she is the wife of Toto Wolff, the Mercedes boss who holds a 10 per cent share in Williams. His influence, combined with commercial  reasons, are alleged to be at the heart of the matter. John Watson, who won the 1980 British Grand Prix, is decidedly unimpressed by her replacing race driver Valtteri Bottas, saying: ‘I wish her well but I don’t see the purpose of her doing practice. ‘She took part in the test after Bahrain this year and did well. But there’s a difference doing this at Silverstone and Hockenheim on race weekends. Suddenly the people out there with her are contesting a world championship. ‘She is not the nominated third driver — Felipe Nasr is — so why do this? It might be nice to put on her c.v. but no F1 team is going to take on a driver in their 30s who hasn’t raced in two years. ‘There is a lack of testing availability and this seems a strange way to use precious time.’ Behind the wheel: Wolff takes part in the Formula One test days at Catalunya's racetrack in Montmelo . Spot of tennis: Wolff (middle) attends day seven of Wimbledon at the All England Club . Maria Teresa de Filippis: Drove for Maserati in 1958 Belgian GP and finished 10th. Two more F1 races. Lella Lombardi: Italian holds the women’s record with 12 starts between 1974 and 1976. First woman to score points in 1975 Spanish Grand Prix. Desire Wilson: South African was only woman to win an F1 race when triumphing at Brands Hatch in the British Aurora F1 series in 1980. Giovanna Amati: Last woman to enter F1, she signed for Brabham in 1992 but failed to qualify for the starting grid in three attempts. Watson speaks for those who feel the hype has run away with itself. That impression was reinforced by a film made about Wolff being entitled Driven: The Fastest Woman in the World. It was a  documentary made by David Stoddart, her brother. But Wolff said: ‘I am well aware there are always going to be those for you and against you. But my husband is not in the car changing gear for me. When I leave that pit lane, I’m on my own. ‘Nobody says Nico Rosberg is only in F1 because his dad was a famous racing driver who funded his karting career and helped him get into F1. It’s unfair just to focus on the fact my husband is in F1 and it’s the only reason I’m in an F1 car. ‘What many people don’t realise is the first F1 test I was offered by Frank Williams and the team was a one-off. It was never planned that I would become part of the team or it would lead to more. But each step, each test went well and it meant the next stage came. If I wasn’t doing a good enough job out on the track or in the  simulator, I wouldn’t be in the team any more.’ That is the belief of Claire Williams, deputy principal of the eponymous team and herself the second highest-ranking woman in the sport behind Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn. ‘When you are running a team the only thing you care about when you are looking at a potential driver to put in your race car is talent and that comes with speed, technical feedback, the whole package,’ said Williams. ‘Whether you are a boy or a  girl, it doesn’t make a difference.

"Jenson Button raised the possibility of moving from McLaren as the fall-out from his boss Ron Dennis’s ham-fisted criticism of him continued ahead of this weekend’s British Grand Prix. Dennis said earlier in the week that Button should ‘try harder’ — holding the driver partly culpable for a season in which the team have failed to make the podium once. The wording was typical of Dennis’s old-school style of management, and caused ructions within the team. Eric Boullier, the racing director, is believed to have found the intervention unhelpful. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jenson Button responding to Ron Dennis' claims . Arm in arm: Jenson Button of Britain walks with his fiancee Jessica Michibata as he arrives at Silverstone . In the spotlight: Button, of McLaren, talks to the media ahead of the British Grand Prix . Speaking at Silverstone on Thursday, Button said sarcastically: ‘I think Ron is practising to be a motivational speaker, maybe. When we are in the position we have been in for the past 18 months, it is not easy. We all need to work harder as a team and we shouldn’t be pointing a finger at any individual. I don’t do things in half-measures. Everything is 100 per cent.’ At 34 and in his 15th season in Formula One, Button’s future is a subject for debate for the first time. The team are keen to enlist a top-rank performer, believing that Button is ‘a tenth or two’ short of what is required. Fernando Alonso is the first name on their shortlist, while Lewis Hamilton has also been in tentative dialogue with his old McLaren team. Button, who wants to continue in the sport for a number of years, said: ‘I would like to stay. This team has a bright future and the partnership with Honda (from next season) will help the team a lot. But this isn’t the only team in Formula One…’ That seemed to suggest he was putting himself on the market, albeit as his fall-back option. A credible theory is that McLaren will stick with Button for another year, allowing Honda to bed in as partners. They could then save on Alonso’s salary and redirect that money towards research and development, before bringing him in a year later. In the fast lane: Button, Felipe Massa, and Lewis Hamilton laugh during a press conference . Fans: Button signs autographs at the Goodwood Festival of Speed at Goodwood House on June 28 . Tribute: A special pink helmet for Button, in memory of his late father . Button said: ‘Don’t feel sorry for me — I still drive an F1 car for a living. I am not getting as much enjoyment as the guy who is winning but I am enjoying my job. I just wish we were further up the grid. ‘The guys I work with in the team are doing an awesome job. Most won’t have an influence on the development of the car but the mechanics are working flat out. They are used to being in a team that wins points and suddenly they are not. It is tough for them because they are not just here to be mechanics; they want to succeed and are a massive part of the team. It is difficult when you can’t make a  difference.’ However clumsily expressed, Dennis’s remarks raise an interesting question: can a 34-year-old bring the same enthusiasm as a new driver? Does he lay everything on the line as he did? Does the grind of travel — same airports, hotels and restaurants — and the cushion of multiple millions dull a driver’s dedication? It takes an exceptional person to remain as keen at the later stages of his career. Button said: ‘When you have been in the sport a long time and if you believe in your ability, and feel you are at your peak, criticism shouldn’t worry you.’ Button will wear a special pink helmet for the race in honour of his late father John, who passed away in January.

"When faced with someone as spectacularly good as Rafael Nadal on clay you do not require idiots in the crowd calling out as you try and survive a match point in the fourth set. That was what Novak Djokovic had to contend with and, just as had happened in losing the 2012 final, he ended with a double fault that completed a 3-6 7-5 6-2 6-4 defeat to the man cementing his place as the all time great dirtballer. It did not take long for the Serb’s fury to turn to tears as the Roland Garros crowd chanted his name when he went to collect the runner’s up trophy, a duty that the 28 year-old Spaniard has never had to perform. The calling out was not why Djokovic lost – that was down to an opponent who currently exercises an unparallelled dominance over one major international sports event.

This . three and a half hour battle, probably not among the greatest they have . ever fought, represented his ninth Roland Garros title in the past ten . years, his 66th victory at the tournament where he has only ever lost . once (to Robin Soderling in 2009). Nadal . has now equalled Pete Sampras’s record of fourteen Grand Slam titles, . and is closing in on Roger Federer’s tally of seventeen. It may be that . his body is the biggest obstacle stopping him from scaling that . mountain. He was handed the trophy by Bjorn Borg, who he has now usurped . by winning Roland Garros five consecutive times. This . triumph was slightly different in what preceded it. He lost three times . on clay coming into Roland Garros this spring – to Nicolas Almagro, . David Ferrer and Djokovic himself – lulling everyone into thinking he . was fallible after all.

Very hard against him in these conditions over five . sets.” It all started so . well for Djokovic despite the fact that it was another steaming hot day . that his opponent would have ordered from the Gods for his last two . matches.

"Andy Murray can still remember the jeers and boos which rang out the only time he played his next French Open opponent, Philipp Kohlschreiber. It was at Monte Carlo in 2010 and Murray was in one of his prolonged post-Australian Open slumps — still trying to get over the fact that he could not clinch a Grand Slam title, having fallen short in the  Melbourne final. Murray was so poor that he managed only three games on that sunny Riviera afternoon. ‘At the beginning of the clay-court season I’ve had some tough matches over the years, it just wasn’t a pleasant memory for me,’ said Murray. Eyes on the task: Andy Murray will take on Philipp Kohlschreiber in the third round at Roland Garros . Fast forward four years and two of those craved-for major titles are in the bag plus an Olympic gold. So it is sure to be a different version of the 27-year-old Scot that Kohlschreiber encounters in this third-round meeting which is scheduled to be fourth on court in the early evening. What happened in Monaco has limited significance today, but the world No 24 should provide a good test and is dangerous for Murray. The German has yet to drop a set this week and the more looping style of ball he hits means there will be few mistakes for the British  No 1 to benefit from. Murray said: ‘He’s a quality player. He’s had big results here before, beating Novak Djokovic in 2009  and winning last week. It’s going to be a very tough match for me so I’ll need to play well because when I played him before when I didn’t play well, it was a pretty quick win for him.’ Tough day at the office: Murray looks dejected after a thrashing at the hands of Kohlschreiber in 2010 . Kohlschreiber, who won the pre-Roland Garros ATP event in Dusseldorf, once worked with Murray’s ex-coach Miles Maclagan, which is one of their few connections. On that eternal subject, Murray also offered further illuminating thoughts over why he believes a female coach such as Amelie Mauresmo might be right for him. ‘When you get a lot of men in a room, there’s often quite a lot of egos and communication can be difficult because not everyone listens,’ he said. ‘When there’s an argument it can get heated rather than everyone staying calm. In those situations, women can listen a bit better and take things on board easier than guys. Fired up: Kohlschreiber lets out a roar as he beat Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin in the second round . ‘From a . communication point of view, it would be pretty good. Whether it’s a man . or a woman, when they look at the game, it’s just important that they . see the differences in the two games — like in women’s tennis, the serve . isn’t as important as in the men’s game. ‘In women’s matches, you need to start incredibly quickly. And in a best-of-five-set match, you need to pace yourself more. ‘So . there are things but so long as the person understands that, they can . easily work with both: a man can work with a woman or a woman can work . with a man.’ Seat to be filled: Murray is still to appoint a permanent coach after he split with Ivan Lendl in March .","Murray takes on German Kohlschreiber in the last 32 on Saturday .

"Andy Murray this week heads into his first Grand Slam in two-and-a-half years without Ivan Lendl in his corner — but his former Czech mentor will still cast a considerable shadow. The Wimbledon champion, whose French Open first-round match against Kazakhstan’s Andrey Golubev will take place either Monday or Tuesday, has revealed he is seeking Lendl’s advice about how to approach the clay-court Grand Slam. Murray has stuttered this season, but was buoyed by his performance in Rome a week last Friday, when he almost beat the king of clay himself, Rafael Nadal, in the quarter-final. VIDEO Scroll down to hear what Sportsmail's Mike Dickson thinks of Murray's chances . Eyes on the prize: Andy Murray has revealed he has been seeking former coach Ivan Lendl's advice . Lendl’s decision to walk out on him in March blindsided the 27-year-old Scot, but it was done on amicable enough terms for the two of them to stay in contact. ‘I’ve messaged him a little bit and he actually called me the day after my match with Rafa in Rome,’ said Murray. ‘He spoke to Dani [Vallverdu, Murray’s assistant coach] and then fired some messages my way. I might call him today just to have a little chat.’ Training hard: Murray has spoken to Lendl ahead of the French Open which starts on Sunday . Lendl, who this weekend is playing a veterans’ event in Germany, was happy to give his appraisal of what happened against Nadal, who Murray led 4-2 in the deciding set before being reined in. ‘He messaged Dani before the match and then afterwards,’ said Murray. ‘He was saying the first set for me was obviously great tennis. That it was very close and I should be encouraged by that coming into this event. It is just the details I’ve not spoken to him about.’ Wise words: Under Lendl (right) Murray (left) won the US Open and Wimbledon in successive years . Murray says he is close to appointing a coach, although he has sent out so many contradictory signals about the matter that you suspect he might be enjoying the speculation. What he is clear about is that the candidate — or candidates, depending on which interview he has given — do not include the recommendations Lendl originally gave. ‘The people he suggested are people I respect and they are very good coaches as well, but I don’t think it will be one of them,’ said Murray. ‘I spoke to Ivan about it when we originally split up, just before Miami. I obviously listened but ultimately it needs to come from me.’ For now Murray is content working with the rest of his team and if he needs a sounding board he turns to Darren Cahill, who used to coach Andre Agassi. Cahill is available to help anyone sponsored by adidas, and he is trusted by the Scot. ‘When I haven’t had a coach he’s come to a load of my practices,’ said Murray. ‘Also, when Ivan was around he’d just come along and watch. I have a good relationship with him and I enjoyed working with him. Moving on: Murray (left) has been coached largely by Dani Vallverdu (right) since Lendl's departure . ‘In the times I’ve been in this situation before, the person I spent time talking to and being around was Darren, and I would rather stick with something I know. ‘But not coming with a main coach, maybe there is a little bit more pressure. But I feel like even when I’ve not been playing so well, when there has been pressure on me it’s helped me raise my game, it’s helped me get nervous and excited to get going. So I hope that’s the case here. 'When I go to the gym, and if I’m struggling in a session or anything, it’s always these events that make me want to keep going, to push through the hard training sessions and put in the hours. 'So each time I arrive at one of these events I feel very  motivated, especially this time after missing last year.’ Next up: Murray will play Kazakhstan's Andrey Golubev in the first round of the French Open . Murray has a history of lifting his game for Grand Slams regardless of previous form and he anticipates his main rivals will do the same after a clay-court season that has not been predictable due to the relative struggles of Nadal. Asked about his rivals’ prospects, Murray replied: ‘I don’t really care. I would expect Rafa and Novak [Djokovic] to play great tennis here, I’d also expect Roger [Federer] to play very well. 'There’s nothing to suggest all of a sudden they’re going to stop performing well in the Grand Slams. Who wins depends on who plays best at the end of the event.’ Familiar face: Murray (left) could face defending champion Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals at Roland Garros . There is a good chance for Murray to make the second week, but for the first time in eight years Nadal is not the favourite, with Djokovic  narrowly more fancied.

"Carl Froch’s dream of going to Las Vegas for a mega-fight farewell to the ring is now within touching distance of reality, with US promoter Bob Arum asserting serious interest in the Cobra facing Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Sin City. Such a fight would gross at least $50million, from pay-per-view TV on both sides of the Atlantic as well as live gate receipts at the MGM Grand Garden. That is likely to be the clinching incentive for Froch to fight again, which he has suggested he might only do if the next one is a big night in the fight capital of the world. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Froch: I don't know what I could be offered to top that . And still: Carl Froch celebrates after his stunning knockout victory over George Groves at Wembley . Game over: Froch stopped Groves in the eighth round of their rematch with a bludgeoning right hand . His spectacular knockout of George Groves has caught the imagination in America and Arum confirms: ‘Carl vs Julio would be big in Vegas and definitely a pay-per-view event on HBO television.’ Chavez is Froch’s preferred option, even over a re-match with Andre Ward, the only one of the world’s elite super-middleweights he has yet to beat. As the namesake son of Chavez the legendary Mexican, Julio Jnr would galvanise the Hispanic boxing market with Froch appealing across the board to the American majority. Arum, Hall of Fame promoter of Chavez as well as Manny Pacquiao, predicted victory for the Nottingham Cobra over Saint George and has already opened discussions with the HBO network about Froch-Chavez being pay-per-view over there, as well as on Sky Sports Box Office here. Chavez has recently scored a convincing win in a re-match with the highly-rated Brian Vera, having made the super-middleweight 12-stone limit comfortably for the first time of late to suggest that his recent struggle with drink and drug abuse is now behind him. And he has been quick to say: ‘A fight with Froch would be huge. I am already looking forward to it happening.’ The projected date is early to mid-November . Just in case it doesn’t happen, Mikkel Kessler has jostled nearer the front of what promoter Eddie Hearn calls ‘the orderly queue’ of current and former world champions eager to cash in on the box-off magic of Froch. The Viking Warrior remains behind Chavez Jnr in that line but as he flew home from Wembley to Denmark he improved his chances by offering to come back to England for a third battle with Froch. Kessler makes that move even though he lost to the Nottingham Cobra at the 02 Arena, having beaten Froch in his home town of Herning. Up next? Froch has targeted a fight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr (left) in Las Vegas later this year . Winning: Chavez Jnr celebrates his victory over Bryan Vera in San Antonio last March . Having watched Froch cement his legacy in the hardest game, Kessler said: ‘I would love to box Carl again and if it means I have to come back to London, I will do it. It would be fantastic to be part of something like the amazing show they put on at Wembley on Saturday night.’ Kessler knows his only hope of procuring the third fight in what would be a classic ring trilogy is to yield home advantage. That means either London - or possibly Las Vegas if it were to be thought that two European fighters could fill the MGM Grand Garden and sell at least half a million pay-per-view buys on HBO. Kessler, who is coming back unexpectedly after announcing his retirement following his defeat by Froch, says: ‘I’m only returning for the big fights. It is 1-1 between me and Carl and I would return to London. We could fight in front of 40,000 in Copenhagen and that would be easier for me. It is an advantage when you fight at home. But I know I would get a fair shake in England. First time: Mikkel Kessler beat Froch on points in their first brutal battle in Denmark four years ago . Revenge: Froch levelled the scores with an inspired victory at the O2 Arena in London last year . ‘A real champion travels overseas, unlike Andre Ward who hardly ever boxes outside California.’ Ward’s lack of box office appeal is against him, while it has to be uncertain if a world title unification match between Froch and Sakio Bika, who took his WBC belt to Wembley to show the Cobra, would be a draw in Vegas. As for Groves, the road back could begin with a tough return against James DeGale… if his fellow Londoner can forgive him for persistently rejecting a re-match after their close first fight. That punch which reverberated from Wembley Stadium around the world is finally getting Carl Froch the global recognition he so richly deserves. Ring magazine, the bible of boxing in the US, joins me in listing Froch in their top ten pound-for-pound fighters in the world, albeit a couple of places lower. Froch’s knockout of George Groves – as spectacular as the Wembley setting – is the most recent in a cluster of fights which demand a reshuffle of my rankings. Imperious: Floyd Mayweather (left) remains at the top of the pound-for-pound list . Still got it: Manny Pacquiao beat Timothy Bradley in April to avenge the defeat he suffered in 2012 . Manny Pacquiao’s brilliant avenging of that nonsensical defeat by Tim Bradley – revenge mostly over the blinkered judges - reaffirms my consistent placing of the PacMan as No 2 behind Floyd Mayweather. Bradley drops several positions. Andre Ward, down two, was third in my previous list and second to Mayweather in most other ratings. Ward is a brilliant technician but Froch is catching up with a man whose inactivity counts increasingly heavily against him, as well as his refusal to fight anywhere outside North America. The Son of God, as he characterises himself, remains the WBA super super-middleweight champion, with Froch holding the so-called ‘regular’ belt below that as well as the full IBF world title. Schooled: Andre Ward (right) beat Froch in 2011 but has struggled for exposure since then . 1)      Floyd Mayweather (unchanged)2)      Manny Pacquiao (unchanged)3)      Wladimir Klitschko (up 2)4)      Guillermo Rigondeaux (up 2)5)      Andre Ward (down 2)6)      Sergio Martinez (up 2)7)      Juan Manuel Marquez (up 2)8)      Carl Froch (up 2)9)      Timothy Bradley (down 5)10)    Adonis Stevenson (down 3) But he has only fought twice since outpointing Froch in the final of the Super Six tournament in December 2011. Once against Chad Dawson, a light-heavyweight obliged to drain himself down to 12 stone for the money, and most recently in November in what became a non-title fight because opponent Edwin Rodriguez failed to make the weight. In contrast, Froch has fought five times since his off-night against Ward in Atlantic City. He immediately regained world champion status by blitzing Lucian Bute, then easily won the only ‘gimme’ in his remarkable sequence of 12 consecutive world title fights which has gone on now to include famous victories over Mikkel Kessler and, twice, Groves. So in our pound-for-pound listing Froch climbs to eighth, Ward falls to fifth. Both Wladimir Klitschko, by virtue of his seemingly everlasting heavyweight domination, and Guillermo Rigondeaux, who gets the proper recognition here for his purist Cuban brilliance which he is denied by so many thrill-seekers in America, both rise above Ward. Tim Bradley, who ascended to fourth after cleverly out-pointing Juan Manuel Marquez, slips to ninth while that Mexican icon moves up. Top class: Guillermo Rigondeaux (left) and Wladimir Klitschko remain among the best boxers in the world . Adonis Stevenson eases to tenth, .

"David Haye has stepped up his training as he prepares to return to the ring. The former heavyweight world champion confirmed last weekend that he would fight this autumn, more than two years after he stopped Dereck Chisora at Upton Park. And the 33-year-old has also posted video clips of his training regime on Instagram. VIDEO: David Haye trains in the gym ahead of comeback . Haye can be seen performing pull-ups, dips and punching the speed bag in his Vauxhall gym. On Saturday he told iFL TV: 'I'll have nights in the future to talk about. If I was a betting man, I'd bet that I'll fight in September or October.' The Londoner was at Wembley on Saturday night to see his friend Carl Froch knock out his former training partner George Groves in front of 80,000 fans. Haye twice pulled out of a clash with fellow British heavyweight Tyson Fury last year, first with a cut suffered in sparring and then after rupturing tendons in his shoulder. A five-hour operation last November looked set to bring down the curtain on his illustrious career but Haye has gradually stepped up his training. Old friends: David Haye (right) speaks to Carl Froch after his victory over George Groves at Wembley . And last week, his trainer and manager Adam Booth confirmed a comeback was imminent. Speaking to the Daily Express, he said: 'It's true, 100 per cent true, David is coming back. 'We will not be making any big announcement but David has been given the all clear by his medical people and he wants to fight again. 'We plan to get back in the ring before the end of the year and preferably by October. 'David has started training and there is no need to keep this a secret any longer. He has been trying to recuperate for five and a half months and only now has he been given the all clear to fight again.' Haye will have one eye on the second of this year's British grudge rematches when Fury takes on Chisora at the Manchester Arena in July. Last time out: Haye has not fought since he knocked out Dereck Chisora at Upton Park two years ago . Down and out: Haye stopped Chisora in the fifth round of their grudge match at West Ham's ground . The pair first met in 2011 with Fury winning a unanimous decision over an overweight and unfit Chisora at Wembley Arena. The winner in Manchester will be installed as the mandatory challenger to world champion Wladimir Klitschko and it is unlikely that either man would risk that position for a fight with Haye. Another option for the former unified cruiserweight world champion is Bermane Stiverne who won the vacant WBC title after Vitali Klitschko's decision to retire. Stiverne beat Chris Arreola last month but has his own mandatory due against knockout sensation Deontay Wilder, a former sparring partner of Haye. The American has stopped each of his 31 opponents and is yet to go beyond the fourth round as a professional.

"George Groves is a force of nature. Carl Froch is a force which defies nature. The weather is set fair for London but the micro-climate about to be generated by 80,000 people inside Wembley Stadium is brewing up a storm. Froch’s thunderous punches and the lightning fists of Groves threaten to make this a Saturday night as electrifying as it is historic. But which of them will be struck down? The warrior with the huge heart and unbreakable jaw, or the high-tech strategist with the creative thought process? VIDEO Scroll down to watch Froch and Groves square up at an intense weigh-in . Storm brewing: George Groves and Carl Froch are heading into a titanic clash at Wembley . Weigh in: The two boxers salute the crowd after being weighed at Wembly Arena . Not that either of these fighting men is entirely devoid of the other’s prime qualities but it is the broad differences which are dividing opinion so sharply. The Nottingham Cobra and London’s Saint George each predict one-sided victories by knock-out which will leave no scope for the kind of controversy ignited by the abrupt conclusion to their first, dramatic encounter. You pay your money – either to be there, to watch on TV or place a bet – and you take your choice. The great British public are split down the middle. The bookmakers have Froch as the marginal favourite but Groves still close to even money. A majority of the fraternity of the ring appear to favour Froch – with Barry McGuigan, Amir Khan,  Lennox Lewis, Anthony Joshua and legendary American promoter Bob Arum among those telling me that experience will out – but there are plenty of dissenters. War: The two fought out a brutal encounter in Manchester in the first fight . Controversy: The fight was stopped by referee Howard Foster in the ninth round - perhaps prematurely . What everyone seems to agree upon is that Groves needs to win early or Froch gets him late. Everyone, that is, except the  combatants themselves. Groves says: ‘I expect to KO Carl with a left hook in the third round but if he survives I will dominate even more the longer it goes.’ Froch says: ‘I will box properly this time and take George out in the middle to late rounds. Unless he actually does come out looking for that third-round win, in which case I stop him early.’ Welcome to confused.com. What we know for sure is that the 26-year-old Groves gained the nation’s respect with his instant flooring of Froch six months ago and the lead he held on the scorecards before referee Howard Foster jumped hastily between them in the ninth round. More significantly, he also caught the attention of the world super-middleweight champion. Froch went into their first fight underestimating Groves to the point of under-preparing and was so irritated by the presumptuous attitude of an opponent 10 years his junior that he fought with  near-suicidal anger instead of a  calculating brain. ‘I’m not making that mistake again,’ he says. ‘I’ve trained back to the physical  condition I achieved in my 20s.’ Workout: Froch works out in Broadmarsh Shopping Centre in Nottingham earlier this week . Looking good: Groves hits the pads at Westfield Shopping Centre, west London . That has been done by a return to road running instead of cutting corners on the treadmill and with a tough strengthening regime which has included, most eye-catchingly, the repeated battering of a lorry tyre with a heavy metal bar. Froch has also addressed his  complacency issue by engaging a sports psychologist. He says: ‘I will be fighting with my mind not my emotions. I won’t be charging out again looking for a quick one-shot KO to teach him a lesson — and  getting caught myself. ‘Instead of the worst Carl Froch of my career, George is now facing the best Carl Froch there’s ever been.’ To which Groves says: ‘That’s just not true. He should have lost the first fight and he can’t win this fight. I’m a better boxer than him in every aspect and he just can’t change.’ Must see: Media and fans pack into Wembley arena to witness the weigh-in . Fighting talk: Froch and Groves once again went at it during the weigh-in . On the opposite page, McGuigan, who is grooming Carl Frampton as his own heir to greatness in Belfast, advises Froch to make some basic adjustments ‘not least by keeping his left hand up by the side of his head to block those big Groves rights.’ Whether he will pay heed is open to doubt. Froch knows the risk entailed in keeping that arm low but it has always been one he is prepared to take. Armed with that iron chin he is willing to absorb a big shot so he can keep jabbing and hooking with his left from unusual and unexpected angles, adhering to the ring maxim that it is the punches  opponents do not see coming which are most devastating. While the late Friday afternoon timing of the weigh-in could create a stamina issue for Groves if he has to toil down to the 12-stone limit — even though he denies he is not a 12-round fighter — the real key to this intriguing contest lies secreted deep in the contrasting personalities of these two men. Confident: Froch says he will be in better shape and a better frame of mind for the rematch . Both are proud and excited to  be the central characters in a passion play being staged before the  biggest boxing audience in Britain since the war. But while Groves says ‘80,000 or 8,000 is the same  to me,’ Froch declares himself  ‘honoured and humbled by the magnitude of the occasion.’  Groves reports knowledge and experience gained from the original clash, while Froch says: ‘You can’t beat a man like me with bravado.’ Groves, as he prepares to move on to German promoters Sauerland, is setting himself the target of ‘an impressive performance to make the world sit up and take notice. Froch says: ‘I have no real interest in becoming a celebrity. It’s the winning that comes first.’ The scale of interest has been driven by the public’s love affair with these Battles of Britain and such rematches make a lot of money for all concerned. Better? Groves said he 'expects' to beat Froch in the third round with a left hook . Promoter Eddie Hearn took a gamble booking Wembley for the night after an England match but he has successfully tapped into a popular mood of fascination. Projected Sky pay-per-view sales of a million may fall just short of Ricky Hatton’s record 1.2m for his Las Vegas fight with Floyd Mayweather but if it is achieved then Froch will bank anything up to £10m, Groves close to £2m. Being the defending champion has its purse privileges, which Froch has earned the hard way as he goes into his 12th straight world-title fight, all but one against the elite fighters in his division. Although, at coming up to 37, he has no plans for imminent retirement he was asked this week how he would like to be remembered whenever that day comes. Froch replied: ‘As a warrior who feared no man and ducked no-one.’ Time for action: The pair go face to face for real at Wembley stadium on Saturday night . As one who predicted he would stop Groves in the ninth round of the first fight, I expect Froch to be fractionally more patient before his world-class battle-hardening prevails again, in the 10th or 11th. But whatever the result, that  epitaph of his has already been assured.

"Carl Froch delivered his riposte to the unfortunate 'Death Row' taunt from George Groves, which is also likely to get the Londoner in a little trouble with the authorities. At the weigh-in in front of 4,000 boisterous fans, Froch said: 'I want to send him back into the hole he crawled out of and put this saga behind me'. Groves had likened Froch to a man on death row and his comment has not gone unnoticed by the Boxing Board of Control. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the pair showboat at the weigh-in and their intense square-up . Job done: Carl Froch and George Groves both made weight ahead of their rematch on Saturday . Face to face: Froch did the talking as both men came together for the final time before the first bell . General Secretary Robert Smith said: . 'It was a silly thing to say. We know that boxers sometimes say silly . things as a fight nears but this was unfortunate. 'It . is not appropriate to talk in terms of death in relation to this very . hard game of ours because unfortunately death sometimes happens. 'We . won't do anything about this until the fight is over but we will have a . think next week as to whether to have a word with George.' Froch was reprimanded by the Board after threatening to kill Mikkel Kessler before their rematch. The . Nottingham Cobra, who is defending his world super-middleweight titles . in front of a Wembley crowd of 80,000, was booed and jeered as he took . to the scales by a predominantly London crowd in the nearby Arena. Surprisingly, given that he is naturally the heavier man, Groves came in 1lb 4oz lighter than Froch. No worries: Groves looked confident as he weighed in well within the 12st limit at Wembley Arena . Inside: Froch weighed in just within the limit to ensure the rematch goes ahead on Saturday night . The . Cobra said to The Saint as they posed for the eyeball-to-eyeball . photographs: 'You look drawn and dehydrated. You've come in under . weight.' Later, Froch said: . 'He looks to me like he has put himself under pressure by saying he'll . knock me out in three rounds. Very nervous, if you ask me.'

"Beekeepers in France were confused after their bees produced honey in mysterious shades of blue and green. But now the mystery has been solved as its now believed residue from containers of M&M's candy processed at a nearby biogas plant n northeastern France is the cause. Since August, beekeepers around the town of Ribeauville in the region of Alsace have seen bees returning to their hives carrying unidentified colourful substances that have turned their honey unnatural shades. Confusion: Since August, beekeepers around French town Ribeauville in the Alsace region have seen bees returning to their hives carrying unidentified colourful substances that have turned their honey unnatural shades such as this honey which has turned green . Determined to solve the mystery the beekeepers embarked on an . investigation and discovered that a biogas plant 4 km (2.5 miles) away . has been processing waste from a Mars plant producing M&M's, . bite-sized candies in bright red, blue, green, yellow and brown shells. Asked about the issue, Mars had no immediate comment. M&M's mystery: Beekeepers, determined to solve the mystery discovered a biogas plant 2.5 miles away processing waste from a Mars factory producing M&M's, convincing them that residue from the M&M's containers is responsible . Honey headache: French apiarist Andre Frieh holds a beehive frame with coloured honeycomb which is creating unsellable honey, with dozens of beekeepers affected . The unsellable honey is a new headache . for around a dozen affected beekeepers already dealing with high bee . mortality rates and dwindling honey supplies following a harsh winter, . said Alain Frieh, president of the apiculturists' union. Agrivalor, the company operating the biogas plant, said it had tried to address the problem after being notified of it by the beekeepers. 'We discovered the problem at the same time they did. We quickly put in place a procedure to stop it,' Philippe Meinrad, co-manager of Agrivalor, told Reuters. Clean up: Agrivalor, the company operating the biogas plant, have cleaned its containers and incoming waste will be stored in a covered hall to address the problem which has turned honey (right) into strange colours (left) No comment: Asked about the issue, Mars has had no immediate comment . He said the company had cleaned its containers and incoming waste would now be stored in a covered hall. Mars operates a chocolate factory near Strasbourg, around 100 km (62 miles) away from the affected apiaries. Bee numbers have been rapidly declining around the world in the last few years and the French government has banned a widely used pesticide, Cruiser OSR, that one study has linked to high mortality rates. France is one of the largest producers of honey within the European Union, producing some 18,330 tonnes annually, according to a recent audit conducted for national farm agency FranceAgriMer. Ribeauville, situated on a scenic wine route southwest of Strasbourg, is best known for its vineyards. But . living aside winemakers are about 2,400 beekeepers in Alsace who tend . some 35,000 colonies and produce about 1,000 tonnes of honey per year, . according to the region's chamber of agriculture. As for the M&M's-infused honey, union head Frieh said it might taste like honey, but there the comparison stopped. 'For me, it's not honey. It's not sellable.'

"For part II of The Transfer Column, click here. Rio Ferdinand may be attracting offers from the likes of LA Galaxy to go to the MLS next season but he remains intent on taking his first steps into coaching. MLS franchises are continuing to look for star names to lift the game's profile and the possibility of taking the same steps as Ryan Nelsen also appeals to Ferdinand. The 35-year-old is ready to leave United at the end of the season but is considering retiring from playing and concentrate on getting his coaching badges. Hanging up his boots? Rio Ferdinand is intent on moving into coaching at the end of this season . In and out: Injury has disrupted Ferdinand's season at Old Trafford under new manager David Moyes . He began his courses more than three years ago but had to stop when a back injury needed his full attention. He has picked up where he left off this season and intends to gain the first stage of his qualifications by the summer when he is also likely to begin TV work helping with coverage of the World Cup. United are scouring the market for replacements for Ferdinand. They have studied the much-touted Eliaquim Mangala at Porto but have doubts he is really at the level they require, while have an admiration for Kurt Zouma but suspect he has already agreed to join Chelsea - either this week or in the summer. Not up to it: Eliaquim Mangala (left) of Porto is not considered of the required quality by Man United . Tied up: United like the look of St Etienne's Kurt Zouma (left), but feel a deal is already in place with Chelsea . Weak link: David Moyes has also ruled out a bid for Dante because he does not think he's good enough . Dante at Bayern Munich has been mentioned but David Moyes is well schooled on German football and knows Pep Guardiola sees the Brazilian as one of his weaker links, as underlined by Manchester City's attack in their Champions League tie in Munich. At 30 too, a deal does not represent great business for Moyes, who is building a new era. Southampton's Luke Shaw is a player Moyes is happy to bid £20m-plus for but United have been told the 18-year-old is not for sale at any price this window. Four way battle: United are ready to contest the signing of Southampton's Luke Shaw with Man City, Chelsea and Liverpool . Jose Mourinho is again favourite to sign the boyhood Chelsea fan, although Manchester City and Liverpool have asked to be kept informed. One Ferdinand we could yet be seeing more of on these shores, however, is Anton. The younger Ferdinand brother is keen on a return to England as his move to Turkish club Antalyaspor has turned sour with the 28-year-old making just a handful of appearances since joining from QPR. Combative: Stoke boss Mark Hughes is set to revive his interest in Sunderland's Lee Cattermole . Admirer: Hughes is also set to pursue a move for Sunderland striker Steven Fletcher . Stoke to return for Sunderland's combative Cattermole? Stoke City are ready to revive interest in Sunderland midfielder Lee Cattermole and may look to take Steven Fletcher too. The combative Cattermole spoke at the weekend about how much he was looking forward to appearing in the Capital One Cup final for Sunderland against Manchester City yet Gus Poyet has to take stock of how such a transfer can aid his team going forward and more pertinently survive in the Premier League. Cattermole, 25, has made 19 appearances this season in all competitions and 14 last year. His disciplinary record has improved massively but Poyet feels it is a deal he can afford to do if he can bring in Liam Bridcutt from Brighton and Ever Banega on loan from Valencia. In turn, should Cattermole go through to Stoke, Norwich may revisit a deal for Stoke's Glenn Whelan.Sunderland recalled Connor Wickham from his loan at Sheffield Wednesday today after interest from Stoke in Fletcher.    ........................................................................................................................................................ Done: Auxerre's Paul Georges-Ntep should finallise his move to Queens Park Rangers in the coming days . Nottingham Forest are keen on Wickham, too, and also want Sunderland's Danny Graham and David Vaughan. Poyet may yet decide to keep Wickham himself for the relegation run-in. Wednesday may turn to Hull City's Matty Fryatt. Georges-Ntep expected to complete QPR move shortly . Paul Georges-Ntep should finalise his move from Auxerre to QPR in the next few days. The France U21 forward has been in discussions over a £2million move for the past few weeks. Click here for Part II of The Transfer Column .

"UEFA says Greek referee Tasos Sidiropoulos did not show a yellow card to the wrong CSKA Moscow player in Wednesday's Champions League game against Manchester City. Reports of CSKA's 2-1 win suggested Sidiropoulos should have sent off Pontus Wernbloom by showing the Sweden defender a second yellow card for his 77th-minute foul on City forward Sergio Aguero. Instead, Sergei Ignashevich was booked in what was widely reported - including by Man City's official website - as a case of mistaken identity.

The Arsenal boss is a long term admirer of the 27-year-old star, who has scored three goals in 13 league appearances this season.

"A Serbian journalist has come under fire after providing a visual demonstration while reporting on how farmers in a remote mountain village keep their privates warm. Jovan Memedovic, 54, had been dispatched to a small shepherding community in Bosnia and Herzegovina's Vlasic mountains, where temperatures are known to drop in wintertime. In order to shield their genitals from the cold, the male villagers knit their own woolly penis warmers. Scroll down for video . Unusual tradition: Serbian broadcaster Jovan Memedovic  was visiting a mountain village in Bosnia and Herzegovina where the local men knit their own 'woolly manhood warmers' in wintertime . Visual presentation: Mr Memedovic decided to show viewers exactly what it would look like when the local farmers put on their hand-made woolly manhood warmers . Attempting to provide his viewers with an authentic account of village life, Mr Memedovic decided to try the 'woolly warmer' on camera. As the report was broadcast in a prime time slot, thousands of viewers' jaws dropped when Mr Memedovic suddenly unzipped his trousers to model the manhood cover. After watching the whole 'woolly warmer' process, from the shearing of the sheep's wool, to knitting the slipper-sized sheaths, Mr Memedovic unzipped his flies and told startled viewers: 'So, it looks something like this' Fortunately TV bosses managed to pixelate Mr Memedovic's member, but that did not stop viewers from flooding the station with calls and responses on social media. After watching the whole 'woolly warmer' process, from the shearing of the sheep's wool, to knitting the slipper-sized sheaths, Mr Memedovic wanted to give viewers 'the full experience' Mr Memedovic said the warmer 'was a bit itchy at the start, but actually very comfortable and above all warm' Not that type of sock: A few of the hand-knitted penis warmers made by the Bosnian farmers .

I've never been to that mountain but if that's the size of the average male then perhaps it's worth checking out.' A spokesman for the TV station said: 'Some viewers call to say the subject was inappropriate, others want to know where they can buy the items in the shops.'

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce will not be making any more new signings before the transfer window closes on Friday night. Allardyce, who boosted his squad with Italian pair Marco Borriello and Antonio Nocerino signing loan deals until the end of the season last week, was unsuccessful with a £3million-plus bid for Leeds and Scotland forward Ross McCormack. The Hammers boss was tipped to go back in with an improved offer but said: 'I don't expect to be too busy now. Those two signings (Borriello and Nocerino) reach our 25-man squad limit so I don't see us doing any more business. Any more for any more? West ham manager Sam Allardyce says he's satisfied with his two new signings . Raring to go: Fit-again West Ham striker Andy Carroll trains ahead of the Chelsea match . Loan star: Antonio Nocerino (right) was put through his paces in training after signing for the rest of the season . 'If one is flagged up that is an outstanding quality player that would make a difference immediately, then we would do something, but the likelihood of that is very slim.' Borriello has swapped Roma for a Premier League survival scrap, while Nocerino has traded AC Milan for the east end. Seven-cap Borriello, 31, is a striker with close to a hundred career goals to his name, accrued at the likes of Milan, Juventus, Genoa and Roma. He joined the capital club in the summer of 2010 amid rumours of interest from Manchester City, while he won the title with Juventus during a 2012 loan spell. Cool head: Nocerino scored a penalty against England during the Euro 2012 quarter-final shootout . Nocerino, 28, has also been drafted in to help the Hammers in their battle to earn Premier League survival, with Allardyce's men currently in the relegation zone. Capped 15 times by Italy, Nocerino is known to English fans for scoring a penalty against England at Euro 2012. The ex-Juventus and Palermo man has been a bit-part player this season having previously been a key man for the club he joined in the summer of 2011. Speaking ahead of Wednesday's trip across London to play Chelsea, Allardyce said: 'Antonio is very excited to play in the Premier League. He's very excited and wants to get into the Italy squad for the World Cup. 'Milan took Michael Essien from Chelsea which left the door open for Antonio to come in. Tough test: Sam Allardyce is preparing his West ham side to face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday . 'He is fine to be selected as soon as possible but Marco needs a bit of time as he hasn't played a game for six weeks. 'Antonio is your box-to-box midfield player and has the quality of finding space. Playing at the top level in Italy brings a great deal of experience to go with the talent he has got. He is an intelligent footballer. 'Marco, it is about getting him on the field and talking about nothing else other than scoring goals. We need somebody in that box to be productive and to start scoring, someone who only needs one or two chances. At the moment we are needing six or seven.' West Ham sit third-bottom in the Premier League while Chelsea are in third, just two points behind leaders Arsenal. Allardyce said: 'Jose (Mourinho) has made Chelsea very difficult to break down again and that frees up their quality players to make an impact. But West Brom should have beaten them earlier in the season, so if we play to our best we can get a good result.' On a roll: Chelsea warmed up for the West Ham clash by beating Stoke thanks to Oscar's superb free-kick .

"Kevin Pietersen has almost certainly played his last Test for England, with the rockiest marriage of convenience in sport now considered beyond repair. In the wake of their 5-0 Ashes defeat, coach Andy Flower and captain Alastair Cook are set to be backed by the incoming managing director of England Cricket, Paul Downton, as they begin the task of regaining the urn in 2015. Unless the positions of Flower, Cook and the team management change drastically, that will mean the end of the nine-year run of an extraordinary soap opera starring the South African-born maverick, whose career has been touched by batting of sheer brilliance but who has polarised opinion like few others in the history of the game. Over and out: Kevin Pietersen's career with England could be over with the batsman out of form and favour . Home soil: Pietersen was back in England on Sunday watching Chelsea's game with Manchester United . Interest: Pietersen was keen to take photos at Stamford Bridge, taking his mind off events in Australia . Irresponsible: Pietersen has been accused of batting without consideration for the team . Attempt at redemption: Alastair Cook and Andy Flower will lead England's future plans and they don't include KP . Immediately after the end of the grim whitewash in Sydney, Flower denied reports that he believed Pietersen’s batting for the majority of the tour had been so irresponsible and his behaviour behind the scenes so divisive that he had issued Downton with an ultimatum stating either the 33-year-old went or he would. May 2005: Overlooked for Test series against Bangladesh, but named in England’s 25-man development squad and one-day squad. July 2005: Scores 57 and 64 on Test debut but Australia crush England by 239 runs. March 2006: Fined 30 per cent of his match fee for dissent after his dismissal in the first Test against India. Jan 2007: England’s top scorer in Australia - but the Ashes are lost 5-0. May 2007: Posts his then highest score of 226 in the second Test against the West Indies at Headingley. Aug 2008: Replaces Michael Vaughan as Test captain and scores century in debut innings as skipper against South Africa. Jan 2009: Reports of a rift between Pietersen and coach Peter Moores surface and Pietersen resigns after just three Tests in charge. Moores is sacked. July 2009: With England leading the Ashes 1-0 after two Tests, Pietersen is ruled out of the rest of the series because of an Achilles injury. Dec 2010: New career-best 227 in Adelaide during England’s triumphant Ashes campaign. July 2011: Passes 6,000 Test runs with third Test double hundred against India at Lord’s. Aug 2012: Allegations made that he sent derogatory text messages about Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower to the South African dressing room. Dropped for third Test. In truth, no such threat was necessary. For the powers that be had already determined that they should support Flower and the methods he has employed while helping them reach No 1 in the world and achieve three Ashes series wins on the trot, based largely on a team ethic that Pietersen has never felt able to buy into with genuine commitment. Cook, himself under increasing pressure following England’s dismal start to the one-day series against Australia amid his own poor batting form, is also understood to be fully supportive of Flower’s reported position. The captain was chiefly responsible for re-integrating Pietersen after the summer Test series against South Africa in 2012 ended with England’s South African-born batsman being dropped after the emergence of texts he had sent to ‘close friends’ in the opposing dressing room, thought to be critical of then captain Andrew Strauss as well as Flower. While the Zimbabwean coach was less enthusiastic, he felt it necessary to back Cook as he took over after Strauss quit at the end of the affair. The uneasy peace between the pair survived on the back of England’s series win in India, in which Pietersen’s masterful century in the second Test in Mumbai was crucial, and their 3-0 Ashes victory last summer. But it has finally ended in the breakdown of a relationship characterised by barely disguised mutual distrust and a lack of personal respect, dating back to when Pietersen took over as England captain in 2008. Emboldened by a perception that, by persuading his players to return to India following the terrorist atrocity in Mumbai he had earned a blank cheque to manage the team his way, Pietersen called for the sacking not only of coach Peter Moores but his then assistant, Flower. Some were certain he wanted his long-term mentor and fellow South African, Graham Ford, installed instead. Pietersen quit and Moores was sacked, after which Pietersen was said to be considering his future and seemed reluctant to accept the new regime Flower forged with new captain Strauss. He spent much of the 2009 Test series in West Indies under a cloud of indifference and missed the last three Tests of that summer’s victory over Australia with injury. Glory days: In August last year Pietersen and his teammates were celebrating their third Ashes win in a row . Eye to eye: England captain Cook and Pietersen (left) trudge off the MCG after their four-day loss in December . Not so bad: Pietersen had the second highest average of England's batsmen after the five Ashes Tests Down Under, but that's a dubious honour considering it's 29.4 which put him just ahead of Aussie bowler Johnson . But, while Pietersen played his full . part in England’s rise under Strauss and the historic Ashes win in . 2010-11, more issues arose concerning his injured achilles tendon and . recurring knee problems, including a feeling that they were badly . managed by England. TESTS: 104Runs: 8,181Hundreds: 23Fifties: 35Average: 47.28Fours: 985Sixes: 81H.S: 227 v Australia (Dec 2010)Catches: 62 . Frustration . that opportunities to play in the lucrative Indian Premier League have . been curtailed by England’s insistence on retaining their players for . the early summer home Test series has grown steadily and it boiled over . in his brief retirement from one-day international cricket in 2012, . apparently accepted by Flower and England with something less than . reluctance. At the same . time it has become increasingly evident that Pietersen no longer has . any time for the technical advice of Flower or batting coach Graham . Gooch. Pietersen’s one-to-one net practice has comprised throw-downs . supplied by former Pakistan leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed. Some insiders go so far as to suggest . some of Pietersen’s behaviour on the current tour - during which his . supporters, Michael Vaughan and Shane Warne, were vocal in their . criticism of Cook and Flower - may have been fuelled by his desire to be . given a second chance at the captaincy. Even before the Ashes began, Warne, a . firm friend and ally, argued in print that the England team could make . progress only with Pietersen in charge. Vaughan has subsequently called . for him to be appointed vice-captain. Backers: Aussie spin legend Shane Warne, also a friend of the controversial batsman, is highly critical of Cook's captaincy, while former England captain Michael Vaughan believes Pietersen should be vice-captain . Bunny: Fired-up Aussie quick Peter Siddle marked his 10th dismissal of KP at the recent Ashes Test in Perth . Inner sanctum: Pietersen's net sessions now amount to little more than throw downs from Mushtaq Ahmed . Pietersen has been included in England’s preliminary 30-man squad for the upcoming World T20 in Bangladesh and they may feel he can offer them an option in the shorter form of the game for some time to come, or at least until the 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. But, with Flower insisting all players play for their county clubs at the start of the summer in order to show their willingness to fight to retain their places, many eyes will be on next month’s IPL draft. If Pietersen, who has not been retained by Delhi Daredevils, makes himself available to other franchises for the full six weeks of the tournament rather than just the first three weeks, that would go against  Flower’s stipulation on playing for his county. Some within the management are also mindful that the first series of the home summer is against Sri Lanka, now coached by Ford, with whom Pietersen remains in regular touch. Both Flower and Gooch have said that life in England’s new era may get worse before it gets better, which some have taken as a clear indication of the pain they may have to suffer without Pietersen’s runs in the short term. Ramp it up: KP shows his innovation for the Delhi Daredevils, the IPL side which has dropped all of it's players . Protocol: Flower wants England Test players to appear for their counties at the start of the summer - in Pietersen's case, Surrey - however the batsman's yet to decide if he'll make himself for the new IPL season . In the frame: Pietersen has been named in the squad for this year's Twenty20 World Cup in Bangladesh . He could be given the option to retire from Test cricket, with long-held and deep-seated concerns over how long his knee would allow him to play all formats of international and IPL cricket anyway. He has restated his desire to carry on playing for England at Test level and to achieve his goal of scoring 10,000 Test runs. But former skipper David Gower, highly critical of what he described as Pietersen putting his ego before the needs of the team in Australia, spoke for many when he told The Mail On Sunday last week: ‘A lot of Kevin’s public pronouncements have tended to have the air of  something constructed to please those who are listening rather than necessarily all coming from the heart or all being true. ‘If these latest stories of Kevin being divisive and disruptive in the dressing room are true, England face an agonising choice because potentially they will be losing a very fine player.’ For better or worse, richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, it seems the choice has already been made.","Kevin Pietersen has in all likelihood played his last Tests for England .

It had been rumoured that Kate was due to attend as the newlyweds are part of the couple’s ‘inner sanctum’.

"Police say images from Google Earth helped them track down a marijuana farm. Officers in Grants Pass, Oregon, heard 50-year-old Curtis W. Croft was bragging about drugs he was growing on his property. Investigators then used satellite pictures from the website to analyse the area and saw dozen of  plants lined up in neat rows. Satellite: Police in Grants Pass, Oregon, used the website to zoom in on the area belonging to Curtis W. Croft and saw what looked to be row upon row of plants, pictured . Farm: Police were first told about the farm when the man was heard 'bragging' about the drugs he was growing on his farm (library image) Once an aircraft had inspected the area, the department's Rogue Area Drug Enforcement Team  checked state records to see if Croft was allowed to cultivate the drugs. Officers discovered he was permitted to grow for five people, which allows him to have 30 mature plants, but police say they seized 94 during the operation. Croft was then arrested on drug charges but was released last week. This is not the first time Google Earth has been used to investigate alleged pot growers. Police started using the programme years ago to look for illegal crops. Caught: Once investigators had pinpointed the farm using satellite images, they were able to send in officers to raid the property . In 2006, Wisconsin authorities were able to catch a man allegedly growing several fields of marijuana while the Department of Fish and Game used the images to spot unpermitted fields which could only be seen from above in California. Police in Switzerland also use the 'view from Earth' website on a regular basis to locate suspicious drug fields. Possession of small amounts of marijuana is not a crime in Oregon and can be grown in small amounts for medicinal purposes.","Officers heard a man was bragging about growing drugs on his property .

"George Osborne was always facing a difficult balancing act between sticking with the austerity drive and giving the economy a boost . Humiliating? Certainly. Having made so much of Britain’s AAA credit rating as a magnificent statement of confidence in his economic policies, Chancellor George Osborne has been given a political bloody nose by Moody’s downgrade. Polls . indicate the Tories leading in the run-up to the Eastleigh  by-election . but the new rating can serve to be only a setback  as voters reconsider . Osborne’s attempts to cut the deficit. The . loss of our AAA credit rating had been widely expected and we would do . better not to place much emphasis on minor tweaks by agencies – after . all, they are still somewhat tarnished by their failings during the . financial crash. Osborne . was always facing a balancing act in next month’s Budget between . sticking to his austerity drive to retain our rating and giving the . economy a boost to generate the growth that is needed if we are ever . going to pay down our debts. While . businessmen have stressed their desire for the Chancellor to keep a . tight rein, they have become increasingly frustrated that there have . been no imaginative initiatives to kick-start growth. Companies . in this country have about £180 billion in cash on their books and have . been looking to the Chancellor to come up with a gesture to encourage . them to start spending this money to create orders and jobs. The . fact that the pound fell suggests most economists were taken by . surprise by the timing of Moody’s downgrade – most had thought such a . move unlikely before the autumn. Thinking in the City is mixed this weekend on whether the downgrade will put more than temporary pressure on sterling. However, . if the pound falls more that could create an inflationary pressure that . the Bank of England is unlikely to want to stave off with higher . interests rates because of the damage that would inflict on the wider . economy. The pound is . already seven per cent down from the start of the year, which will make . our imports more expensive. That will be uncomfortable for shoppers who . are already experiencing a squeeze on the purchasing power of the pound . in their pocket. The incoming Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has indicated he is prepared to tolerate inflation if that is the price for growth . The Bank of England has already . said that inflation will top three per cent during the summer but the . betting must be on three per cent looking rather moderate longer term. Incoming . Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has already indicated he is . prepared to tolerate a dose of inflation if that is the price necessary . for growth. Conversely, . though, it would be good news for our exporters who have, recently, been . showing themselves more inclined to pass on the benefits of the weaker . pound in terms of lower prices for their overseas customers rather than . keeping prices level and pocketing a larger profit. The . Treasury’s own worst-case scenario is that we could have to pay an . extra £20 billion a year in interest payments because of our slightly . diminished credit ranking. However, America was actually able to borrow . more cheaply after it was downgraded. And, don’t forget, investors have to put their money somewhere. Only Germany and Canada still have AAA-rated economies – and arguably even Germany could be under pressure. Unlike . us it does not control its own currency and therefore lacks the . flexibility that manipulating the exchange rate can give. Its recent . economic performance has also been weak. Britain’s economic ranking may have lost some of its lustre but it is in good company: ratings are not absolutes.","Osborne always facing a difficult balancing act between austerity and growth .

"It has long been considered Briton's unofficial favourite dish, and it seems we are taking our love of curry to new - spicier - levels. As our tolerance for spicy dishes is on the rise, comedian Omid Djalili has decided to travel the UK, trying some of the spiciest curries on offer. And it looks like an emotional trips, if his tears of pain are anything to go by as he tastes the aptly-named Widower curry for his new series Hot and Dangerous, which premieres on Friday, October 24 on Quest. Scroll down for video . New research in support of Omid Djalili's programme, Hot and Dangerous, has found a rising tolerance for spicy food in the nation . In this series, Omid takes on spicy food-eating challenges. Here: he tries the 'Widow Maker' curry . The curry is served at the Bindi Restaurant in Grantham and measures six million units on the Scoville Scale, used to measure the heat in chillies. The recipe actually uses 20 Naga infinity chillies and is so dangerous chefs wear goggles and even face masks to prepare it. In this clip, Omid takes on the 'Widower' and his eyes well up after just one bite. As the hiccups begin, Omid is somewhat surprisingly successful in keeping his meal down - though his dinner companion can't say the same. Announcing that he is about to vomit due to the spice and the amount of pain it is causing in his stomach, the brave diner escapes outside and is seen being sick in the car park. 1. Tikka Masala - 20% . 2. Korma - 17% . 3. Jalfrezi - 12% . 4. Rogan Josh - 11% . 5. Madras - 10% . 6. Bhuna - 6% . 7. Dupiaza - 4% . 8. Vindaloo - 4% . 9. Saag - 3% . 10. Dansak - 2% . 'I hope my gruelling but ultimately gratifying odyssey through some of the world's hottest foods leaves viewers with a burning taste for more,' Omid explained in a statement. His unusuual news show comes as new research revealed some surprising statistics about the nation's spicy eating habits. Nearly half of Britain's curry-eaters (49 per cent) - and half of all females who have eaten curry (50 per cent) - claim to have seen their tolerance for the spicy dishes rise in recent years. With nine of out of ten Brits admitting to be avid curry eaters, the programme explores the increasing popularity of spicy foods, especially amongst UK women. But don't be fooled: handling such spice is no easy task. Just ask self-proclaimed fiery-food hater and star of the series, Omid Djalili: 'Britain has an insatiable appetite for incredibly spicy food and our dishes are getting hotter every year. 'It appears the female palate is now matching - and in many cases surpassing - that of the macho curry-eating male.' Curries are so popular, in fact, that 35 per cent of Brits admit to eating an Indian-inspired dish every week, with 76 per cent enjoying a curry at least once a month. And with the rise of British women's tolerance to such a throat-burning meal, men are likewise being challenged to step up their game. Over a fifth of male curry fans surveyed admit that they've ordered spicier curries to appear 'more manly,' often also lying about their tolerance levels. According to the survey, women in particular are opting for more fiery dishes - prompting men to up their game . In this particular clip, Omid and his dinner companion are only able to take a bite of the blazing hot curry before beginning to hiccup and cry from the spice . Omid's challenger needs to take a break from his curry once his glasses begin to fog up from the heat . While Omid is able to keep down several bites, his partner fares far worse - becoming sick in the car park . 'Britain has an insatiable appetite for incredibly spicy food and dishes are getting hotter every year,' says Omid . With the country's rising curry obsession also comes a rising cost. The average Brit has been found to spend over £500 every year on takeaways and eating out. So then, it comes as no surprise that the vast majority of Britons (61 per cent) now recognise curry as a national institution, as well as a satisfying culinary challenge.

"Rapist: Defendant Sir Young, 20, pleaded guilty to the rape of a fellow student at Booker T. Washington High School, Dallas, when he was 18 and she was 14 . A high school rapist has been ordered to do 250 hours volunteer work - at a rape crisis center. Defendant Sir Young, 20, had pleaded guilty to the rape of a fellow pupil at Booker T. Washington High School, Dallas, when he was 18 and she was 14. He was facing up to 20 years in prison, but State District Judge Jeanine Howard stunned the Dallas court by making the bizarre order as part of a five-year probation sentence. Prosecutor Josh Healy said Young's victim, who is now 17, had been left in tears by the ruling and that she and her family told him they were 'shocked'  and 'extremely disappointed'. And now Judge Howard has been forced into an embarrassing U-turn after the chief of the local rape crisis center refused to allow Young to carry out the community service portion of his sentence there. Bobbie Villareal, executve director of the Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center, told WFAA.com: 'I’m sure she probably thought that it was his way of giving back perhaps. 'But it’s just not an appropriate place for him to do his community supervision.' Ms Villareal slammed the 'lenient' conditions passed down by Judge Howard, who is known in legal circles for her creative approach to sentencing. 'It is a deterrent to all survivors when you see a very lenient sentence like this passed down,' she said. 'It sends a devastating message to survivors of sexual assault. That victim’s family definitely didn’t feel like there was justice for her and for other survivors of sexual assault.' We won't have him: Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center refused to allow Young to volunteer, with its executive director saying 'it's just not an appropriate place for him to do his community supervision' Young's sentence of deferred adjudication probation means that if he meets various terms laid down by Judge Howard, he will not have a permanent criminal record. As well as the community service order, he must also spend 45 days in jail, as well as a further 24 hours in jail every October 4 - the date of the rape - for the duration of his probation. It came after Young admitted raping the girl at school in October 2011. Changes: Booker T. Washington High School has since added a window to the room where the rape happened . The court heard that the pair were kissing in a practice room at the performing arts school, but that she had told him to stop when he began rubbing her body, reported Dallas Morning News. Ignoring her pleas, he instead pulled off her leggings and raped her. 'I didn’t want to do anything other than kiss,' the victim told the court, adding that she had told Young 'no' and 'stop' before and during the attack. Booker T. Washington High School has since added a window to the room and installed CCTV cameras.","Judge forced into embarrassing U-turn after centre refuses to take him .

"When Angela Carnegie made the disastrous decision to smuggle heroin from Thailand, she had no idea how much worse her life could get. After being caught at Bangkok airport, she was sentenced to life in a Thai prison in 1993 - where she was forced to eat rotting food teeming with maggots, sleep next to prisoners with leprosy and survive without running water. Carnegie, from Livingston, Texas, was in her twenties and had just broken up with a . serious boyfriend. Feeling vulnerable, she decided to take up a . friend's offer for some quick cash by bringing a suitcase lined with drugs back to the U.S. Scroll down for video . Freedom beckons: Angela Carnegie, pictured in 2002, shortly before her release after nine years in the infamous Bangkok Hilton prison for smuggling heroin . Hungry? Stopped straight away at the airport, Carnegie was sentenced to life in a Thai prison - where she was forced to eat rotting, bug infested food and survive without running water . Thai officials spotted her immediately at the airport and she was arrested. She sentenced to life at the infamous 'Bangkok Hilton' prison. Her experiences have been chronicled on National Geographic show 'Locked Up Abroad,' a series about inmates who have endured the hardships of foreign prisons. 'The conditions were very crowded, dirty, and unsanitary,' Ms Carnegie said of her experience on her Facebook page. 'We showered outside rain or shine, often times standing in floating sewage which overflowed from the sewage canal that ran all around the edge of the prison.' Snap: 'Some of the years we were allowed to take a photo to send home to our families.

Sanitary conditions are shocking and the meager diet consists of one bowl of rice per day - which is often rotting. The prison is called the 'Big Tiger' by Thais because 'it eats those on the inside'. The actual Millennium Bangkok Hilton Hotel stands on the banks of the same river. 'After it was “served” onto metal trays it often sat on the table for more than an hour before the prisoners actually got to it. 'During that time birds would sit and eat off the side of the tray…' she said. During her decade at the prison, she would often sleep next to prisoners with tuberculosis, leprosy, pink eye and various other rashes and infections. 'There were times of water shortage, exposure to extreme heat almost constantly, power outages at night while in the room with 200+ other people so no fans or running water even for toilets,' she said.

"Energy  giant Npower faces a multi-million-pound fine and a ban on telesales activity over a bills shambles that has hit 280,000 customers. Industry regulator Ofgem has given it an ultimatum to improve customer service and deliver accurate bills by August or face a fine that could top £10million. The ruling is a victory for the Daily Mail’s MoneyMail section, which triggered the investigation last year by submitting a dossier highlighting the shambles to the watchdog. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said it was 'unacceptable that so many Npower customers have not received the customer service they deserve' It contained dozens of letters and . emails from people who suffered poor service, wildly inaccurate bills . and frustrating delays in getting refunds. Npower received almost 1.4million . complaints in 2013 – and the number in the first three months of 2014 . was up 70 per cent on a year ago. Hundreds of thousands of customers . were not sent bills for months, sometimes more than a year, despite . making repeated requests to know how much they owed. The result was that . they then faced huge bills – of more than £1,000 in some cases – . followed by demands to pay up or face some kind of enforcement action. There were also serious problems with . incorrect direct debit payments. Some customers are owed hundreds of . pounds by Npower as result of over-payments, but have had difficulties . getting their money back. Npower admitted in September that a . computer glitch caused by a transfer to a new billing system had caused . problems with 700,000 customer accounts. In December, it apologised and . agreed to make a payment of £1million to vulnerable customers by way of . redress. However the company still has a huge . backlog of more than 400,000 bills to sort out and has been given an . ultimatum by Ofgem to reduce that figure to 100,000 by the end of August . or face a telesales ban. Big six energy supplier must cut the number of accounts in its late billing backlog from around 400,000 today to 100,000 over the next three months . The watchdog also announced an . investigation into poor customer service associated with the way it . handled complaints that could lead to a huge fine.Sarah Harrison, . Ofgem’s senior partner in charge of enforcement, said Npower customers . had suffered ‘service failures’ for too long. ‘We have been increasingly concerned about the slow progress to tackle failings,’ she said. MoneyMail has been inundated with complaints from Npower customers. After a series of reports detailing wildly incorrect billing, delays getting refunds and poor customer service, we handed Ofgem a dossier of customer complaints last July. Chris Stacey and Natalie Kew from South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, were among the angry users after moving to Npower. The switch took five months to sort out, then the couple were not billed for nine months and were also locked out of their online account. After MoneyMail intervened Npower sorted out the issue and paid £400 in compensation. Mr Stacey said the firm was ‘incompetent from day one’. ‘Npower’s recovery plan has not . delivered as far and fast as is necessary. Our analysis of complaints . data also raises some serious concerns which will be thoroughly examined . in our investigation.’ Thousands of people have contacted . Citizens’ Advice for help in dealing with Npower. Its chief executive, . Gillian Guy, said: ‘Exposing customers to bill shock is completely . unacceptable. Providing accurate bills and dealing with problems quickly . are the basics of decent customer service. Npower is a long way from . providing that.’ Energy Secretary Ed Davey joined the attack, describing Npower’s customer service as ‘unacceptable’. Npower is a subsidiary of the giant . German utility firm RWE, which has a history of failing British . consumers. When it owned Thames Water it was fined £9.7million for . failures in 2005 and 2006. It has also been criticised over its . tax affairs. The firm made £750million profit in the three years 2009 to . 2011 but paid no corporation tax. Npower’s UK chief executive, Paul . Massara, wrote to all 3.4million customers in December apologising but . the company was forced to issue a second apology yesterday. It said it has assigned an extra 650 . staff to help resolve customer service problems and it is spending . £20million to improve its systems. Mr Massara said Npower was ‘committed . to getting things right for our customers’ and promised that none would . be left out of pocket. Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other. Shrewd . consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving . deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest . deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts. Suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so. If . you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big . chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year. Prices . are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you . will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff . that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison . to find the best price.

"Booming: There are an estimated 1.4million landlords in the UK but only 500,000 are registered with HM Revenue & Customs . Landlords and second home owners face a crackdown as concerns grow over the boom in buy-to-let mortgages. As many as 900,000 owners of a rental property, holiday let or second home could be probed by the taxman over claims they have not declared profits they have made. And banks have been warned they face tough scrutiny over the landlord loans they dish out. This could limit the loans being granted. The number of buy-to-let mortgages has boomed in recent years. According to the Council of Mortgage Lenders there are now 1.57million – an increase of 120,000 in the past year. But although there are an estimated 1.4million landlords in the UK, only around 500,000 have registered with HM Revenue & Customs. The estimated 900,000 who haven’t registered now face being quizzed and, in the worst cases, being hit with bills for undeclared income. Someone who owns a second home has to pay tax on the profit from renting it out. They can deduct expenses such as interest on the mortgage and upkeep. Income tax is charged at their highest rate – 20 per cent for a basic rate taxpayer. Accountancy firms have reported that landlords are being targeted. It is thought many have failed to pay the correct tax and owe the Government around £550million a year. The buy-to-let boom is thought to have been spurred on by asset-rich homeowners hoping to cash in on fast-rising house prices. While many first-time buyers and families struggle to pass tough new mortgage rules, existing landlords and older homeowners are able to snap up homes. This has caused prices to rise further and sparked concerns that many are taking on loans they cannot afford to repay should interest rates rise. When ordinary homeowners want a mortgage they have to go through a strict affordability test. Scrutiny: Bank of England governor Mark Carney is 'looking closely' at the booming buy-to-let market . These loans are regulated by City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority. But buy-to-let loans are unregulated and borrowers don’t have to pass such tough rules. Provided they have a good deposit they can take on loans based on the estimated income they will get from the property. The Council of Mortgage Lenders warned that the Bank of England was scrutinising decisions about landlord mortgages. Bank governor Mark Carney said this week that he was ‘looking closely at buy-to-let’. Tough new rules to come soon from the EU are also expected to help put the brakes on the amount banks are willing to lend buy-to-let investors.","Out of 1.4m landlords in the UK, only around 500,000 have registered .

"'We were sending out search parties for people': . Former Labour Cabinet Minister Peter Mandelson has . admitted that his party actively encouraged immigration to the UK while . in government . Labour sent out ‘search parties’ for immigrants to get them to come to the UK, Lord Mandelson has admitted. In a stunning confirmation that the Blair and Brown governments deliberately engineered mass immigration, the former Cabinet Minister and spin doctor said New Labour sought out foreign workers. He also conceded that the influx of arrivals meant the party’s traditional supporters are now unable to find work. By contrast, Labour leader Ed Miliband . has said his party got it wrong on immigration but has refused to admit . it was too high under Labour. Between 1997 and 2010, net migration to Britain totalled more than 2.2million, more than twice the population of Birmingham. The annual net figure quadrupled under Labour from 48,000 people in 1997 to 198,000 by 2009. Lord . Mandelson’s remarks come three years after Labour officials denied . claims by former adviser Andrew Neather that they deliberately . encouraged immigration in order to change the make-up of Britain. Mr . Neather said the policy was designed to ‘rub the Right’s nose in . diversity’. He said there was ‘a driving political purpose: that mass . immigration was the way that the Government was going to make the UK . truly multicultural’. Senior Labour figures have been . reluctant to concede they deliberately engineered the influx of migrants . who have transformed communities over the past decade. But, . at a rally for the Blairite think-tank Progress, Lord Mandelson said: . ‘In 2004 when as a Labour government, we were not only welcoming people . to come into this country to work, we were sending out search parties . for people and encouraging them, in some cases, to take up work in this . country.’ He said: ‘The problem has grown during the period of economic stagnation over the last five, six years.’ When Labour encouraged new arrivals ‘we were almost ... a full employment economy’ but, he admitted: ‘The situation is different obviously now. ‘We have to just realise... entry to . the labour market of many people of non-British origin is hard for . people who are finding it very difficult to find jobs, who find it hard . to keep jobs. ‘For these . people immigration tends to loom large in their lives and in their . worlds, now that is an inescapable fact, and we have to understand it, . address it, engage with people in discussion about it.’ Mr Mandelson's admission that New Labour sought out foreign workers is a stunning confirmation that governments led by Tony Blair, left, and Gordon Brown, right, deliberately engineered mass immigration . His words are far franker than Mr . Miliband’s. Asked earlier this month whether ‘too many people were . allowed to come’, he replied: ‘I wouldn’t put it that way, no.’ Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Peter Mandelson’s candid admission that Labour were purposefully letting immigration spiral out of control when in government is yet another damning indictment on their record on immigration.’ Sir Andrew Green of Migration Watch said: ‘This is an astonishing admission from the highest level that Labour’s mass immigration policy was entirely deliberate. ‘It will be a very long time before their own working class supporters forgive them for the enormous changes that have been imposed on their communities.’ Gordon Brown yesterday accused the Tories of emulating Enoch Powell by using immigration to head off the growing electoral threat from UKIP. Mr Powell’s 1968 ‘rivers of blood’ speech ignited huge controversy in the debate on immigration. Former prime minister Mr Brown – who once called for ‘British jobs for British workers’ – told a pro-union rally in Glasgow: ‘A party that was anti-Powellite on immigration is now becoming very close to being Powellite on that issue.’","Former minister admits Labour deliberately engineered mass immigration .

"Bold move: SSE is to freeze household energy prices until January 2016, leading to calls for its rivals to do the same . Britain's second-biggest energy firm . has announced it will axe hundreds of jobs and slash spending on wind . farms to fund a freeze on gas and electricity bills. However, there are already many cheaper deals available which last for even longer – including one from SSE itself. The . decision by SSE means the average standard tariff dual-fuel bill for . those paying by cheque or cash will be held at £1,266 until January . 2016. It represents a remarkable U-turn for . the company, which had argued that a price freeze would be dangerous . when the idea was put forward by Labour leader Ed Miliband last autumn. The . move also heaps pressure on the other major players to follow suit. British Gas, EDF, Eon, Npower and Scottish Power have also argued . against price freezes. The . news triggered a heated row at Prime Minister’s Questions as David . Cameron and the Labour leader squabbled over who should take credit. For . months, the Prime Minister ridiculed Labour’s pledge to freeze energy . prices if it wins the next election as a ‘price con’ that was impossible . to deliver because of fluctuating global prices. But Mr Miliband . insisted the decision by SSE meant Mr Cameron’s argument had been . ‘totally demolished’. Scroll down for video . SSE’S move to scale back on new wind farms is a crushing blow to the green energy revolution. The decision puts at risk billions of pounds of investment in plans to build and operate wind turbines over the next 20 years. One . of a number of schemes being shelved by SSE is its involvement in the . Forewind scheme off the coast of East Yorkshire, which has the potential . to be the largest in the world and produce almost 10 per cent of the . UK’s electricity needs. Dale . Vince, founder of green energy firm Ecotricity, said: ‘There is so much . political pressure on the industry we are seeing companies make wrong, . short-term decisions and fail to invest in renewable energy. ‘SSE . is cutting 500 jobs and dumping offshore wind projects. It shows how . broken the industry is that these sacrifices have to be made for . short-term price stability.’ SSE said the freeze is possible as it plans to cut costs by £100million, axe 500 jobs and cancel spending on new wind farms. Six months ago, SSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies dismissed Labour’s price freeze plan as ‘unsustainable’. Yesterday . he said: ‘We’re responding to questions that have been asked of us with . a positive agenda for customers, including the longest ever . unconditional energy price freeze.’ However, . the firm’s new deal is still more expensive than others available. And . even SSE itself has a tariff that holds prices until March 2017 and . comes in at an annual average of £1,186, a saving of around £80 a year, . although it has to be paid monthly by direct debit. Clare . Francis, of price comparison website MoneySuperMarket, said: ‘Those . paying the provider’s standard prices could still save money by . switching to a cheaper tariff. 'There are seven tariffs where the price is fixed until 2016 and five fixed until 2017.’ Adam . Scorer, of customer watchdog Consumer Futures, said: ‘A freeze at . current electricity prices will provide security and reassurance for . millions of consumers, even if it will not reduce the burden on . households struggling to afford to keep their homes warm.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband said the SSE price freeze was a vindication for his own policy but Prime Minister David Cameron said it was the result of government cuts to green levies . Breakdown: According to Ofgem these are the elements that make up the average energy bill . The number of people switching energy supplier is lower now than a decade ago, a study shows. In 2003 a total of 7.26million switched gas and electricity supplier, compared to only 5.88million in 2013. The numbers peaked in 2008 at 9.58million and have been falling ever since. The research was carried out by The Big Deal which is arranging collective switching so a large group of customers can secure a better deal. It found that despite what Energy UK and the Big Six claim the amount of switching is lower now than it was ten years ago. Henry de Zoete, co-founder of The Big Deal, said: 'Energy UK and the Big Six claim that the market is working because more and more people are switching. 'The truth is the opposite.  There are less switches now than ten years ago.  Investigating the Big Six is long overdue but people need help with their bills now. ' A review will take years to complete and even longer to implement.  People can rightly ask how many more winters will go by before bills come down?  The Big Deal will deliver cheaper energy now by harnessing people power to get a better deal.'

"An Australian entrepreuner and a tech 'genius' have constructed a car from Lego - and it can actually be driven on the road. The bright yellow hot rod, snappily titled the 'Super Awesome Micro Project', was built using 500,000 pieces of Lego. Even the air-powered engine is made from standard Lego pieces and utilises four orbital engines and a total of 256 pistons. It can reach a top speed of 12-18mph, although the creators - Melbourne entrepreneur and marketeer Steve Sammartino and Raul Oaida, a 20-year-old self-taught 'technology genius' from Romania - do admit they were 'scared of a Lego explosion so we drove it slowly'. Scroll down for video . Well put-together: The 'Super Awesome Micro Project' - a Lego car - was built using 500,000 pieces of Lego . Propulsion: The car has four orbital engines and a total of 256 pistons and can hit 18mph . Mr Sammartino says the car is a world-first and is 'proof-of-concept of environmentally-friendly equipment'. He added: 'What really matters in the world now isn’t so much the new technology. It’s people having access to the technology. It’s about people using their imagination to put things together in ways that people haven’t thought of before. That’s where the real power is.' It cost £11,200 to build and was crowd-funded by forty Australian patrons. One of them is blogger Trevor Young, who said: 'I think ultimately you get involved with something like this because it’s such an awesome idea and good things might flow from it.' The two men were worried that there would be a 'Lego explosion' if they pushed it too hard . Uncomfortable: Even the steering wheel and pedals are created from Lego bricks . The wheels, which are one of the few parts not made from Lego, feature likenesses of the pair of creators . Group project: The car was crowd-funded by 40 different technology enthusiasts from Australia . More than 500,000 Lego pieces were used. The car engine is made from standard Lego pieces and runs on air . The engine has four orbital engines and a total of 256 pistons. Top speed is around 12-18mph. It was built in Romania and shipped to a secret location in suburban Melbourne. It’s a Hot Rod design, 'mainly because hot rods are cool'. The wheels and some load-bearing elements are non-Lego. The pair met when Mr Sammartino reluctantly accepted a random Skype request from the Romanian and from there, their working partnership flourished. 'He wanted me to connect him with this astronaut I know because he’s interested in rockets,' Mr Sammartino said. 'I’m teaching him about business and he’s teaching me a bit about physics. It’s a really nice mash-up.' It's not the pair's first foray into bizarre Lego-related projects. In late 2011, the pair sent a small space shuttle made out of Lego into space, where it reached an altitude of about 35,000 metres above the earth. It landed in the snow near a little village in Germany, the country in which it was launched. Raul retrieved the shuttle using a GPS device. Their initial attempt failed and the space shuttle blew up into thousands of Lego pieces as it couldn’t withstand the pressure of going into space. So for the second successful attempt, Raul simply super glued all the pieces together so the shuttle wouldn’t fly apart as it was buffeted by 124mph winds.

"The bogus sign language interpreter at the Nelson Mandela memorial service was among a group of people who burned two men to death for stealing a television in 2003, say a cousin and three friends. Millions around the world watched Thamsanqa Jantjie, 34, 'waving his hands aimlessly' next to Barack Obama at Tuesday's ceremony as he pretended to interpret the U.S. president's tribute to Mandela for deaf viewers. Now, days after it was claimed he has faced charges for murder, rape and kidnapping, the four sources said he was part of a vigilante execution squad who placed tyres around their victims' necks and set them ablaze - a horrific practice known as 'necklacing'. Unlike two other suspects who went to trial in 2006 for the killings, the four said on Monday that Jantjie never did because authorities determined he was mentally unfit. Scroll down for video . Accusations: Thamsanqa Jantjie's cousin and three friends said he was part of a vigilante execution squad who placed tyres around their victim's necks and set them ablaze . Mr Jantjie, 34, stood just a few feet from President Obama and others who spoke at Tuesday's ceremony that was broadcast around the world . The men, including one of Jantjie's cousins, insisted on anonymity because of sensitivity surrounding the bogus signing, which has humiliated South Africa's government. They say Jantjie was institutionalized and then returned to his neighborhood on the outskirts of Soweto. The accusations come days after it was claimed he has faced charges for murder, rape and kidnapping. Necklacing: 'Necklacing' is the practice of forcing a tyre filled with petrol over victim's head and shoulders and setting it alight. This suspected police informant,  in Duncan Village, South Africa, was saved in 1985 by clergy before the tire could be lit. In the upper right corner, a book of matches can be seen . Claims: Braam Jordaan, a deaf South African and board member of the World Deaf Federation, claimed the man was simply making up his own signs . South African news website eNCA reported that Mr Jantjie, who has schizophrenia, has faced charges for rape (1994), theft (1995), housebreaking (1997), malicious damage to property (1998), murder, attempted murder and kidnapping (2003) charges. 'Necklacing' is the practice of forcing a tyre filled with petrol over victim's head and shoulders and setting it alight. It can often take a victim more than 20 minutes to die in excruciating agony. In the violent 1980s and 1990s, necklacing was a common sentence imposed by 'people's courts' on collaborators with the apartheid regime and criminals in South Africa. It was frequently carried out in the name of the African National Congress and was alleged to have been endorsed by Nelson Mandela's then wife, Winnie. The ANC says it never condoned necklacing. In 1986 Mrs Mandela, caused controversy when she stated: 'With our boxes of matches and our necklaces we shall liberate this country.' The statement, which was widely seen as an implicit endorsement of necklacing, caused the ANC to briefly try to distance itself from her. It is still used in certain, more lawless, parts of Africa, where corrupt police are no longer trusted, to punish thieves and rapists. Incidents have been reported more recently in Haiti, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and India. Brazilian drug lords are also known to have 'necklaced' their enemies, most notoriously the journalist Tim Lopes in 2002. The website said it was unclear if the . 2003 murder case was ever concluded as the court file was found to be . empty during their investigations. It also reported that many of the charges brought against him were dropped, allegedly because he was mentally unfit to stand trial. Mr Jantjie was acquitted on the rape . charge, but he was convicted of theft for which he was sentenced to . three years in prison. The channel could not ascertain if he served the jail time. MailOnline has contacted the NPA for a comment on the claims. Mr Jantjie was yesterday approached by a reporter for the Associated Press who asked him about the criminal charges, but he refused to comment. The news is a further embarrassment to South African officials as it was revealed that Mr  Jantjie had faked sign language at the memorial event. Twitter users with sign language knowledge claimed the interpreter repeatedly used signs for 'donkey', 'lightning bolt' and 'prawns'. Eye Witness News meanwhile has reported trained sign language trainers as saying he also made reference to 'rocking horses'. Braam Jordaan, a deaf South African and board member of the World Deaf Federation, has said he believed the interpreter was making up signs as he went along. Last week, Mr Jantjie explained the embarrassment by claiming he may have suffered a schizophrenic episode on stage and that he saw 'angels' at the event. He said that his hallucinations began while he was interpreting and that he tried not to panic because there were 'armed policemen around me.'","Thmsanqa Jantjie's cousin and two friends accuse him of part in 2003 crime .

"One in five travellers is not counted in and out of Britain or checked against terror and criminal watchlists.

Sir Charles Montgomery, who runs the Border Force, has told MPs that – when it works – the eBorders system ‘provides extremely valuable information to the intelligence services and to the police’. The system, however, is unable to fully count people in and out, leaving officials  in the dark about the true scale of illegal immigration. MPs on the Commons home affairs select committee last night vowed to reinvestigate the shambles. Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘This is an absolute disgrace. eBorders is a fantastic tool to stop illegal immigrants, dangerous criminals and terrorists coming into the country. Vital: Sir Charles Montgomery (left), who runs the Border Force, has told MPs that the eBorders system 'provides extremely valuable information to the intelligence services and to the police', but Tory MP Philip Davies (right) has branded it 'an absolute disgrace' ‘It’s been up and running successfully in Australia and Saudi Arabia for years.

"Harriet Harman today risked a Commons rebuke by wearing a pro-feminism t-shirt to Prime Minister's Questions. Labour's deputy leader sat next to Ed Miliband on the frontbench wearing the shirt declaring: 'This is what a feminist looks like.' Parliamentary officials have previously ruled that MPs should not 'use their clothing to display slogans or make debating points'. Scroll down for video . Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman wore the t-shirt as she sat next to Ed Miliband on the frontbench . David Cameron, pictured in the Commons today, rejected the chance to wear a 'this is what a feminist looks like' T-shirt, sparking anger among women's rights groups . Ms Harman's decision to don the t-shirt will be seen as a rebuke across the Despatch Box to David Cameron, who refused to wear it for a women’s equality campaign. The Prime Minister rejected the chance to wear a ‘this is what a feminist looks like’ T-shirt – despite being asked five times for ELLE magazine’s inaugural feminism issue. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and the Labour leader Ed Miliband both accepted the challenge – alongside celebrities Benedict Cumberbatch, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Tom Hiddleston. Before Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons today, Ms Harman tweeted a picture of herself in the grey t-shirt  with the message: 'This is what a feminist will look like at Prime Minister's Questions today.' However, the rules on what MPs can wear in the Chamber are strict. Last year Green MP Caroline Lucas was rebuked for trying to wear an anti-Page 3 t-shirt during a debate. A House of Commons spokesman said at the time: 'By convention members are expected not to use their clothing to display slogans or make debating points – members are expected to make their arguments through their speeches.' The row over Mr Cameron's refusal to wear the feminist t-shirt came after Mr Cameron sparked controversy when being questioned over his support of women. Last year he was asked by the women’s magazine Red whether he was a feminist. He paused before replying: ‘I don’t know what I’d call myself… it’s up to others to attach labels. But I believe men and women should be treated equally.’ He was later forced to explain his remarks. He told Channel 4 News: ‘When I was asked that question, what I should have said is, if that means equal rights for women, then yes. If that is what you mean by feminist, then yes, I am a feminist.’ Ms Harman tweeted this picture of herself wearing the t-shirt ahead of PMQs in the Commons . Last year Green MP Caroline Lucas was rebuked for wearing a 'No More Page Three' t-shirt during as debate, when the House of Commons said MPs should not wear slogans . Mr Miliband meanwhile backed the campaign. He said: ‘Feminism means a better world for us all and a battle yet to be won.’ Nick Clegg added: ‘I support equality and choice – so yes, I’m a feminist. How on earth in this day and age can you not be? As a wiser person than me once said: “Men who actually treat women as equals are the ones with more cojones.”’ When we asked the PM’s team why he wouldn’t wear the T-shirt for ELLE magazine’s inaugural feminism issue Mr Cameron said he’d rather give us a quote instead. He said: ‘Whether you are a man or a woman, I passionately believe that everyone has a part to play in achieving full equality for women and girls. ‘As a parent I feel strongly that my daughters should have the same opportunities as my son. As a society we have come a long way in gender equality – but the journey hasn’t finished yet, which is why I am committed to doing everything I can do to remove barriers for women and achieve a fairer society.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg posed in the T-shirt for the women's magazine Elle . Labour leader Ed Miliband said: 'Feminism means a better world for us all and a battle yet to be won' ELLE’s Editor-in-Chief Lorraine Candy said: 'We asked the Prime Minister five times if he would wear the Fawcett Society’s iconic This Is What A Feminist Looks Like slogan T-shirt and send us a snapshot (it would only take 10 minutes). Five times, he declined. ‘This is a shame on so many levels, especially given he knew Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband had agreed without hesitation, alongside many other influential men who were more than happy to call themselves feminists. It seems the Prime Minister still has an issue with the word “feminist”.’ Daisy Sands, of the women’s rights group the Fawcett Society, said: ‘We are very pleased the leaders of the UK’s three main political parties have publicly pledged their support for advancing equality between women and men, and have endorsed the ELLE x Whistles for Fawcett collaboration, which has relaunched Fawcett’s iconic This Is What A Feminist Looks Like T-shirt. ‘However, we understand making a personal commitment to the cause of feminism is a matter for the individual to decide. As it stands, it would appear that David Cameron is not comfortable with identifying himself with the cause of feminism, which, given the huge contribution the feminist movement has made to advancing women’s rights, is unfortunate.’ A report last year by Mumsnet and Ipsos Mori found the Conservatives lagging behind Labour among female voters. And in 2011 Mr Cameron was accused of having a ‘patronising and outdated attitude to women’ when he told Labour MP Angela Eagle to ‘calm down dear’ during a Commons debate. Mumsnet chief executive Justine Roberts said: ‘It’s a shame David Cameron seems wary of calling himself a feminist when all it really means is advocating equal rights and opportunities for women.’","Labour's deputy leader appeared on Labour frontbench wearing shirt .

"A photograph of a well-dressed black man holding a baby is reportedly of George Zimmerman's great-grandfather - and could become a crucial piece of evidence in his murder trial. CNN aired the picture last night and if its authenticity can be verified then it supports what the accused murderer's family have been saying since the shooting took place - that Zimmerman is from a mixed-race family and did not kill Trayvon Martin because he was black. The 28-year-old's family and legal team have repeatedly asserted that he killed the unarmed 17-year-old on February 26 out of self defense rather than because of his race. Black roots: This photo shown on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight is said to show George Zimmerman's great-grandfather. Above is Zimmerman's grandmother, and his mother is in the man's arms . Message: Trayvon's mother made a special video for Mother's Day urging tighter gun control laws across America . He is awaiting trial on a second-degree murder charge and has been accused of racial profiling in the shooting death of Trayvon - whose death caused mass protests all over the country. National civil rights leaders and campaigners were up in arms when Zimmerman was not charged over the teen's death. Police cited Florida's 'Stand Your Ground' Law in their decision. Florida, which has some of the most lenient gun laws in the nation, . enacted the self-defense measure in 2005, which provides people wide . latitude to use deadly force if they fear bodily harm. The law is now in . effect in more than 20 states. Trayvon was walking through the gated . Florida community where George Zimmerman was a neighborhood watch guard . when he was shot and killed. He was unarmed. Zimmerman . said the teen attacked him, knocking him to the ground and bashing his . head into the sidewalk. He pulled the trigger of his 9mm handgun in self . defense, he claims. After initial questioning from police that night, he was released without charge. Mixed race: Zimmerman, pictured left as a boy and right after his arrest, was raised in a racially integrated household and himself has black roots through an Afro-Peruvian great-grandfather . Zimmerman's family members have insisted for months that he is no racist. Orlando attorney Mark NeJame appeared . on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight on Thursday with the photo and said it . originated from someone in the family. It shows a middle-aged black man in a shirt and tie with a baby on his lap and young woman standing behind him. The baby is thought to be Zimmerman's mother, and the young woman his grandmother . The . man is Zimmerman's great-grandfather, NeJame told the network, the baby . is Zimmerman's mother and the young woman is his grandmother. Loss: Sybrina Fulton is facing her first Mother's Day without her son Trayvon . Last month, an investigation by Reuters portrayed George Zimmerman as a trusted aid to most of his black neighbors in the gated community of Sanford, Florida that was plagued by a string of burglaries in the weeks leading up to the shooting of Trayvon Martin. The 28-year-old insurance-fraud investigator comes from a deeply Catholic background and was raised in a racially integrated household. It emerged this week he waived his right to a speedy trial while his legal team prepares his defense. The mother of Florida shooting victim Trayvon Martin appears in a Mother's Day gun control video produced by an advocacy group led by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Noting that 'this will be my first Mother's Day without my son, Trayvon,' Sybrina Fulton asks viewers to urge their state governors 'to re-examine similar Stand Your Ground laws throughout the nation to keep our families safe.' 'Nobody can bring our children back,' Fulton says in the video, released on Thursday to several websites by a Bloomberg-led gun control coalition called Second Chance on Shoot First. 'But it would bring us comfort if we can help spare other mothers the pain that we will feel on Mother's Day and every day for the rest of our lives.' Forty-five days after the shooting, following the appointment of a special prosecutor and protest marches across the country, Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder in the racially charged case. He pleaded not guilty to the charge and is free on bail. Mayor Bloomberg often refers to the Stand Your Ground laws as 'shoot first' laws. 'I hope Sybrina Fulton's courage will persuade state legislators to take a second look at shoot first laws and take a second chance to get them right,' he said in a statement. Bloomberg is one of the nation's most outspoken mayors on the issue of gun control. He has crafted gun law legislation at the local and national level, formed a gun control coalition that counts at least 600 U.S. mayors, and in 2006 directed city attorneys to sue out-of-state gun dealers whose weapons were used in crimes in New York City.","If picture is authentic it could be crucial evidence in Trayvon murder trial .

"Benefits will be docked from feckless parents who refuse to take classes on how to improve their children’s discipline, diet and exercise under plans being discussed by senior Tories. A secret party document photographed in Downing Street reveals MPs preparing the Conservative election manifesto are considering attaching new conditions to welfare. Carried by MP Margot James, who sits on a policy advisory board which is drawing up proposals for Prime Minister David Cameron, it reads: ‘Apply conditions for parents on benefits (training or parenting classes)’. Margot James revealed secret Tory plans for the next election after documents she was carrying were photographed as she left No 11 Downing Street this week . Conservative MP Margot James, pictured has worked on proposals to restrict benefits payments to parents who refuse to participate in training to prepare themselves for the workplace . The Government carried out a trial of a voluntary voucher scheme for parenting classes in the wake of the 2011 riots to counter a breakdown of family discipline. But fewer than four per cent of eligible parents in three underprivileged areas took up the £100 vouchers. The CANParent scheme offered mothers and fathers in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, Camden in London, and High Peak in Derbyshire vouchers to spend on classes covering discipline, diet and exercise, bullying and preparing children for school. Miss James’s document suggests the Tories now want to go far further to make parents sign up, by making receipt of benefits conditional on co-operation with training by charities and experts. ‘The notes I was carrying were just my thoughts, and not yet policy, but conditionality is something I think we need to consider seriously,’ she told the Daily Mail. Senior Conservatives are known to favour linking receipt of benefits to parenting in a further wave of welfare reform. Education Secretary Michael Gove wants to dock child benefit from almost 20,000 parents a year whose children play truant from school. He believes £120 penalties issued by schools to families whose children are persistently absent should be clawed back via the welfare system. Parents have a legal responsibility to ensure their children attend school from five to 16. Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured, will consider the proposals even though a trial scheme introduced after the 2011 riots was deemed a failure . The plan is expected to be included in the Conservatives’ election manifesto next year, having been blocked in coalition by the Liberal Democrats. There were 41,224 penalty notices for non-attendance at school issued in 2011/12 – the latest figures available – of which only 22,043 were paid within the time limit of 28 days. Under the proposal being backed by Mr Gove, the remaining 19,181 families would have the penalty doubled to £120 and seen it automatically docked from their child benefit. Ministers argue there is a problem with the enforcement of the current rules. Currently, £1.3million a year is raised from truancy fines. But almost half the total issued since 2004 went unpaid. Between 2004/05 and 2011/12, there were 168,958 fines, yet only 86,787 were paid before the penalty notice lapsed. If fines are not paid within 42 days, the fine lapses and the only recourse for local authorities is to pursue prosecution. However, 60 per cent of those who do not pay their fines are never taken to court. The document Miss James was carrying into Number Ten also set out the Government’s commitment to offer ‘tax free childcare’, with a subsidy of up to £2,000 a year per child for working parents. It also appears to confirm the Tories will encourage schools to operate ten-hour days to boost standards by allowing time for structured homework, as well as fitting in with the working patterns of dual-earner couples.","Plan to slash benefits for parents of unruly children or those with poor diet .

"Ukip has suspended the star of its first European election TV broadcast after it emerged that he condemned Ed Miliband as ‘not a real Brit’, suggested Africans should ‘kill themselves off’ and said Islam was an evil religion with a paedophile prophet. Andre Lampitt also said he loathed the charity Oxfam and welcomed Aids outbreaks in Africa, saying: ‘Inner peace will come when Aids does what it should and reduce  African density.’ Like party leader Nigel Farage, he said he admired Russian leader Vladimir Putin, adding: ‘At least Putin loves his country. David Cameron does not love Britain, he loves the EU.’ Scroll down for video . Zimbabwean decorator Andre Lampitt appeared in the Ukip party political broadcast to complain about the impact of immigration in Britain . Ukip said it was ‘shocked’ by his . views, which will embarrass the party as it prepares for local elections . next month – with Mr Lampitt standing as a councillor in Merton, South . London. The builder, who . describes himself as ‘born British in Rhodesia’, was one of five . supporters hand-picked to appear in a prime-time television campaign . starting this week. He was . featured in the broadcast criticising immigration from the EU, saying: . ‘Since the lads from Eastern Europe are prepared to work for a lot less . than anybody else, I’ve found it a real struggle.’ Yesterday, . the party said it was suspending him after discovering he had expressed . ‘repellent’ views in a series of potentially unlawful messages on . Twitter over recent months. In . one tweet he claimed that Islam was not a religion and called it an . ‘evil organisation respecting a prophet who as a pedo.’[sic] . He added: ‘All Muslims need to leave Europe... or denounce their pathetic satanic religion.’ His appearance had been part of a major drive by the party to present a more professional image . Another message insisted: ‘Most Nigerians are generally bad people... I  grew up in Africa and dare anyone to prove me wrong.’ He . suggested Africans should be ‘left to ‘kill themselves off’ and . suggested people should ‘get over’ slavery, which he said was an ‘act of . war’. 'His racist views might even make the BNP wince with embarrassment' Tim Farron, Lib Dem president . Condemning the Labour leader, he said: ‘Miliband is not a real Brit. I  hope he never gets to be PM! He was only born here.’ In another message, he said Mr Miliband, whose father Ralph was born in Belgium to Polish parents, was ‘Polish, not British’. He . also suggested examination of statistics on rape would reveal a racial . bias among attackers, and in another message declared: ‘Enoch Powell was . right’. A Ukip spokesman said: ‘We are deeply shocked that Mr Lampitt has expressed such repellent views. ‘His membership of the party has been suspended immediately pending a full disciplinary process.’ However, . it was not clear whether Mr Lampitt can be removed from the party’s . list of council candidates in Merton, because nominations closed . yesterday. The timing of the . row is unfortunate for Mr Farage, who has this week rejected claims . from some Labour MPs that his party’s latest election billboards on . immigration are racist. Ukip had suggested its candidates would be put . through more rigorous checks following a series of controversies over . the views of some on race, gay marriage and other issues.

"The appointment of an arch-federalist as the European Commission president risks creating a ‘dramatic’ backlash that will hasten Britain’s exit from the EU, one of the country’s most senior diplomats has warned. A leaked document said Ivan Rogers, the UK’s permanent representative to the EU, believes the ‘die is cast’ in favour of Jean-Claude Juncker, the former prime minister of Luxembourg. His proposed elevation to Europe’s top job has been fiercely opposed by David Cameron, who says Britain rejects the founding EU principle of ‘ever closer union’, which Mr Juncker supports. Former Luxembourg prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker, pictured, seems almost certain to be appointed president of the European Commission . But during a dinner with  Herman van Rompuy, the head of the European Council, Mr Rogers apparently warned that ‘short of a complete U-turn’ by German leader Angela Merkel, Mr Juncker is on course to be appointed. He said Europe was ‘sleepwalking into an institutional crisis’ and apparently  suggested a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU, which Mr Cameron has promised by 2017 if he remains in power, could be brought forward. ‘He warned that Mr Juncker’s appointment could accelerate a British referendum on leaving the EU and will completely change the political landscape’, a diplomatic source was quoted as saying. ‘Rogers warned that the appointment could lead to dramatic events in July and that it should be a priority for the EU to avoid such a train crash.’ David Cameron, left, has failed to convince German Chancellor Angela Merkel, right, to block Mr Juncker's appointment to the top EU post . British officials fear Mrs Merkel may try and use a summit next week in Brussels to rush through Mr Juncker’s appointment, amid worries that relations between Britain and Germany will sour further if the row goes on for months. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister who has been an ally of Mr Cameron in opposing Mr Juncker, suggested he was preparing to accept defeat. ‘I can imagine Juncker will get it, though we’re not there yet,’ he said. Mr Rogers was said to have used the dinner in Brussels last Tuesday to warn that ‘allowing the European Parliament rather than national governments to appoint the commission president is unacceptable and takes the EU to a different place’. The UK ‘would not accept the outcome of the process’, he said, since it would be political ‘dynamite’ that could push the British towards the exit door. A British diplomat said the account of the dinner, also attended by officials representing other EU countries, was ‘exaggerated’. ‘Ivan Rogers was very clear about our views but some of it has got lost in translation,’ the source said. ‘The planned timing of a British referendum has not changed. The appointment of Jean-Claude Juncker might change the dynamic of the referendum but not the timing.’","Jean-Claude Juncker seen as front-runner despite serious British concerns .

"David Cameron is ‘uncomfortable’ with calling himself a feminist it was claimed today – after refusing to wear a T-shirt backing a new women’s equality campaign. The Prime Minister rejected the chance to wear a ‘this is what a feminist looks like’ T-shirt – despite being asked five times by a women’s magazine. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and the Labour leader Ed Miliband both accepted the challenge – alongside celebrities Benedict Cumberbatch, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Tom Hiddleston. David Cameron rejected the chance to wear a 'this is what a feminist looks like' T-shirt, sparking anger among women's rights groups . It comes after Mr Cameron sparked controversy after being questioned over his support of women. Last year he was asked by the women’s magazine Red whether he was a feminist. He paused before replying: ‘I don’t know what I’d call myself… it’s up to others to attach labels. But I believe men and women should be treated equally.’ He was later forced to explain his remarks. He told Channel 4 News: ‘When I was asked that question, what I should have said is, if that means equal rights for women, then yes. If that is what you mean by feminist, then yes, I am a feminist.’ Mr Miliband meanwhile backed the campaign. He said: ‘Feminism means a better world for us all and a battle yet to be won.’ Nick Clegg added: ‘I support equality and choice – so yes, I’m a feminist. How on earth in this day and age can you not be? As a wiser person than me once said: “Men who actually treat women as equals are the ones with more cojones.”’ When we asked the PM’s team why he wouldn’t wear the T-shirt for ELLE magazine’s inaugural feminism issue Mr Cameron said he’d rather give us a quote instead. He said: ‘Whether you are a man or a woman, I passionately believe that everyone has a part to play in achieving full equality for women and girls. ‘As a parent I feel strongly that my daughters should have the same opportunities as my son. As a society we have come a long way in gender equality – but the journey hasn’t finished yet, which is why I am committed to doing everything I can do to remove barriers for women and achieve a fairer society.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg posed in the T-shirt for the women's magazine Elle . Labour leader Ed Miliband said: 'Feminism means a better world for us all and a battle yet to be won' ELLE’s Editor-in-Chief Lorraine Candy said: 'We asked the Prime Minister five times if he would wear the Fawcett Society’s iconic This Is What A Feminist Looks Like slogan T-shirt and send us a snapshot (it would only take 10 minutes).

"Dominic Cummings, right, blasted David Cameron claiming he had 'no priorities, focus or grip' and 'babbled like an uber-pundit' Michael Gove was embroiled in a fresh row with senior colleagues last night as his closest ally mounted a furious attack on ‘bumbling’ David Cameron and his ‘clueless’ senior staff. Amid signs of growing exasperation at No10, the Education Secretary was forced to deny that an extraordinary outburst by Dominic Cummings reflected his own views. Mr Cummings was Mr Gove’s right-hand man for years until he left the Government in January and is close to the Education Secretary. He said Mr Cameron had ‘no priorities, focus or grip’ and thought the job of Prime Minister was ‘babbling like an uber-pundit’. ‘As Bismarck said about Napoleon III, Cameron is a sphinx without a riddle,’ he added. He dismissed Ed Llewellyn, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, as a closet Lib Dem and a ‘classic third-rate suck-up-kick-down sycophant presiding over a shambolic court’. And he said of director of communications Craig Oliver: ‘He’s just clueless.’ In an interview with The Times, Mr Cummings also attacked civil servants for obstructing Mr Gove’s reforms. He suggested the Government’s biggest failure in education policy was in not scrapping GCSEs. He claimed the Education Department was a ‘basket case’ that faced a ‘disaster every half hour’ when he joined as Mr Gove’s special adviser in 2011 – a rate that went down to once a fortnight by the time he left. Mr Cummings said of No10: ‘To get anything done you have to have priorities and there are no priorities. Everyone is discouraged from telling the truth to important people. There’s no grip, no focus. I thought it was a shame... we could have gone faster, further, better. ‘MPs have no real knowledge of how to function other than via gimmick and briefings. That’s also how Number Ten works. It’s how all of them are incentivised to operate. You get ahead by avoiding cock-ups and coming up with tactical wins, you don’t get ahead by solving very hard problems.’ He suggested the Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne had struggled to impose their will on recalcitrant civil servants. Education Secretary Michael Gove, centre, last week was involved in a spat with Home Secretary Theresa May, right . Mr Cummings added: ‘Poor David and George – neither of them has worked in a large, complex organisation that’s well managed. They’ve got nothing to compare it to. All they see is very smart, well-dressed people who are quite like them, who click their heels and say, “Yes Chancellor, yes Prime Minister, we’ll sort your problem tomorrow”. But nothing happens.’ No10 said last night that Mr Cameron had the ‘highest regard’ for those criticised by Mr Cummings. A Cabinet source said colleagues were ‘sick and tired’ of clashes between Mr Gove and his team and other ministers. He has recently been embroiled in public spats with his deputy David Laws and Home Secretary Theresa May. Although Mr Cameron appeared to back Mr Gove last week, some senior Tories insist he should be moved in a forthcoming reshuffle. A source . close to the Education Secretary said of Mr Cummings’ comments: ‘These . are not Michael’s views. He disagrees with what he said about Number . Ten. Dominic says and does exactly what he wants, as was often the case . while he was working for Michael.’ Deputy . Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who was described by Mr Cummings as ‘a . goner’ who was regarded with ‘contempt’, said Mr Cummings obviously had . ‘serious anger-management issues’. ‘The only good thing you can say . about him is he spreads his bile evenly across the Coalition,’ Mr Clegg . added. Defending his comments, Mr Cummings tweeted: ‘I thought I’d been . quite mild given the reality.’ Labour . ex-minister Meg Hillier said she found it hard to believe  Mr Cummings . ‘didn’t have  some understanding with Michael Gove before coming out . with  this criticism’.","Dominic Cummings accused the PM of being 'a sphinx without a riddle'

These playful Gelada Baboons wake up before daybreak and climb to the highest vantage point they can find to bask in the dawn sunshine of Ethiopia's Simien mountain range. The Geladas, which are some of Africa's most sociable monkeys, were pictured by photographer Simone Sbaraglia, who followed the group as they got up early and climbed to the nearest peak to catch the the morning rays.

Perfect spot: A Gelada baboon sits quietly looking out over the spectacular Simien Mountain range in Ethiopia as it waits for the sun to come up . Quiet contemplation: The Geladas are some of Africa's most sociable primates and live in groups of around 60 . Photographer Simone Sbaraglia, 41, said that the best time to photograph the baboons was either as they came out of their nest in morning, or as they returned just before sunset . Gelada baboons are not actually baboons in a traditional sense - and are easily recognisable by the patches of hairless skin on their chests. Due to a diet that consists primarily of grass the Geladas need large foraging grounds, with the heights of the Simien Mountains, which are more than 4,200 meters high, providing the perfect location. Mr Sbaraglia, 41, spent three weeks following the group and said that over time the monkeys started to allow him to get up close and personal with them, as they gained his trust. The photographer, from Rome, Italy, said that the best time to photograph the baboons was either as they came out of their nest in morning, or as they returned just before sunset.

Simone, who is a professor of photography and mathematics, said: 'I really enjoyed being close to Geladas and observing their behavior: the grooming, the babies playing and the occasional fights between males. 'They like to spend the night on the cliffs to seek refuge from predators, so I used to wait for them to come out of their night nest before sunrise and then go back before sunset to wait for them to return. That is where I got the best pictures, showing the monkeys with the amazing backdrop of the Simien mountains. 'I was fascinated by the location that these primates live it. I think this is what makes them special, so I was especially interested in portraying their habitat together with their special features, such as the long fur and the 'bleeding heart' that they display on their chest. 'They are very special in that the live very high up on the mountains - more than 4200 meters above sea level. Furthermore, they feed exclusively on grass - no fruit, no insects like many other primates - so need a large foraging ground. 'They live in large groups with more than one leader. I find them extremely beautiful and fascinating with their fur and heart-shaped mark on the chest. 'They are generally not aggressive and oblivious to photographers and occasional visitors. I spent three weeks following the same group of monkeys from sunrise to sunset, so they grew accustomed to my presence and let me get very close to them.'","The playful Gelada Baboons are some of Africa's most sociable monkeys .

"Support for independence has dramatically stalled in a major boost for the union just seven days before next week's historic referendum - as women, pensioners and students unite against separation. First Minister Alex Salmond showed signs of pressure getting to him today, as Lloyds Bank and even Royal Bank of Scotland threatened to quit an independent Scotland while John Lewis warned it would push up prices for customers. The latest opinion poll puts the No camp six points ahead, but revealed major regional splits over independence - with support for the Union holding up in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Lothian and Fife but falling away in formerly strong Labour areas in central and west Scotland. Scots under 24 and over 65 are also forging an unlikely alliance against independence, while middle-aged men are most likely to be in favour of breakaway. Scroll down for video . Most parts of Scotland are planning to vote against independence - but the central belt between Edinburgh and Glasgow is strongly pro-independence . Middle aged Scots are most likely to back independence, while pensioners and the young are in favour of the union . Scottish women are also much less likely to vote for independence than men, according to last night's Survation poll . Support for independence was trailing way behind in the polls last month but dramatically surged in September. The 'Yes' campaign took the lead in the polls on Sunday, but has since fallen back and is now six points adrift of the 'No' campaign . The new poll, for the Daily Record newspaper, is a major blow to the SNP leader Mr Salmond who claimed that Scottish voters were turning their backs on the Union. Putting a brave face on the result, Mr Salmond told a briefing for international journalists that 'Scotland is on the cusp of making history'. He added: 'The eyes of the world are upon Scotland. And what the world is seeing is an articulate, peaceful, energised debate. 'Scotland will vote Yes next Thursday and they will vote Yes because last minute, cobbled up promises from the No campaign which unravel at the slightest scrutiny will not fool anyone in this country and neither will the blatant bullying and intimidation of the Westminster Government. 'The No campaign is in terminal decline. In contrast a Yes vote is the opportunity of a lifetime. An opportunity to build a fairer more prosperous country.' But according to the Survation survey – conducted over the past week – momentum has  swung back in favour of the 'No' campaign – with just 47 per cent of Scots now planning to vote for separation. Including voters who have yet to have make up their mind, some 47.6 per cent of Scots said they would vote 'No' if the referendum was held today. Just 42.4 per cent said they would opt for separation. But one in 10 Scots remain undecided. The revelation will add fuel to claims that  Mr Salmond suffered a 'Black Wednesday' in his campaign for independence yesterday. First Minister Alex Salmond used a press conference in Edinburgh today to insist his dream of independence was still on track . Mr Salmond was put on the spot about threats from major firms, including Scotland's leading banks, to move their operations to England if voters back independence . Nearly 4.3million people have registered to vote in next week's Scottish independence referendum - 97 per cent of those eligible. The referendum is set to be the biggest poll in Scotland's history, with more people registered to vote than ever before. Registration figures were released today as a new opinion poll gave the 'No' campaign a slim lead, following a barrage of bad news for First Minister Alex Salmond. The latest poll suggested that 53 per cent of Scots opposed independence with 47 per cent in favour, excluding those who have yet to make up their minds. The total number of people who have registered for next Thursday's referendum is 4,285,323, more than for any previous election or referendum in Scotland, according to the vote's 'chief counting officer'. Nearly 800,000 of those applied for a postal ballot - meaning they are likely to have already cast their vote. Official statistics released this year indicated that the total population of Scotland is around 5.33million, with 4.42million of those aged at least 16 - the minimum age to vote in the referendum. That means that just over 97 per cent of eligible voters have signed up to cast a ballot next week. Mr Salmond had already been hit by the news that two major businesses had publicly warned against  separation. And last night Lloyds bank and RBS both revealed they would move parts of their business to England in the event of a Yes vote. Edinburgh-based financial giant Standard Life – which employs 5,000 people in Scotland - revealed it was putting in place plans to move parts of its business to England to protect itself against independence. It came as Britain's biggest fuel company BP warned against voting 'Yes' next week. It released a statement saying the prospects for North Sea oil were best served by the UK. Today the John Lewis Partnership has issued a warning that shoppers in Scotland are likely to face higher prices if the country goes it alone. Chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said it had no plans to reduce its commercial presence north of the border, where it has nine shops, a contact centre and employs more than 3,000 people. And supermarket giant Asda warned independence would have 'cost implications' for its customers. Meanwhile, Gordon Brown has threatened to stand for election to the Scottish Parliament over Alex Salmond’s ‘lies’ about the NHS. The former Prime Minister said he would make a dramatic return to frontline politics north of the border to tackle the SNP head on. The former Prime Minister, who is still an MP in Westminster, said: ‘I say this to Mr Salmond himself. If he continues to pedal this deception then I will want to join Johann Lamont in fighting him and securing the return of a Labour Government as quickly as possible.’ Mr Brown’s surprise threat came as he launched a bid to shore up support for the Union among Scottish pensioners. Mr Brown said Labour would not devolve Scottish pensions to Edinburgh – because they were safer under the protection of the UK Government. But he said Mr Salmond’s claim that the NHS was in danger from London were bogus because the health service was already controlled by Holyrood. Mr Brown also vowed to hand further tax raising powers for the Scottish Government to increase funding for the health service. He added that if Mr Salmond continued to claim that Labour was a threat to the NHS he would stand for office in Scotland. The revelation that Mr Brown was prepared to move his political career to Edinburgh overshadowed his pitch to pensioners to vote against independence. Ed Miliband was joined by dozens of Labour MPs at a rally in Glasgow today, where he was joined by (left to right) Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont, deputy leader Harriet Harman, Lord Winston and Better Together leader Alistair Darling (right) Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, giving a speech in Kilmarnock, suggested he could stand for election to the Scottish Parliament to take on Mr Salmond in the battle for the future of the NHS . Former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy and the party's leader in Scotland Willie Rennie enjoyed a taste test at the George Mewes Cheese shop in Glasgow today . Campaigners from both sides have stepped up their presence on the streets of Scotland with just a week until polling day . Better Together leader Alistair Darling highlighted the warnings from businesses as tempers flared during a fiery Mumsnet debate yesterday afternoon. During the online question and answer session the former Chancellor accused Mr Salmond of being 'despicable', 'mad' and focused on 'throwing stones' at the English. He also accused the SNP of trying to frighten the sick and the elderly into voting for independence by raising bogus fears over the future of the NHS. He said this was 'despicable'. And he claimed Scotland got a 'very good deal' from being in the UK. He said the partnership between England and Scotland 'works well for both sides', adding: 'We should work with our neighbours not throw stones at them'. Mr Darling's inflammatory comments risk fuelling accusations that the 'No' campaign was panicking amid a surge in support for independence. Mr Salmond said the visit to Scotland of the Prime Minister, leader of the opposition and Deputy Prime Minister proved 'team Westminster' was 'coming apart at the seams'. But Mr Cameron urged Scots not to use the referendum to give the 'effing Tories' a kicking, as Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg flew into Scotland to join the fight to preserve the Union. The Prime Minister  speaks during a visit to Scottish Widows offices in Edinburgh, where he made an impassioned plea to keep Scotland part of the union . David Cameron yesterday pleaded with Scottish voters not to use the independence referendum to give the 'effing Tories' a kicking. In an extraordinary intervention, the Prime Minister appeared close to tears during a speech in Edinburgh in which he acknowledged the unpopularity of the Conservatives in Scotland but warned the result of next week's vote will stand for 100 years. Mr Cameron cleared his diary to travel to Scotland, after polls showed the Yes and No camps are neck-and neck with barely a week until the historic referendum on Thursday September 18. In a highly-charged speech, Mr Cameron urged voters not to use the referendum to punish unpopular Westminster parties. The PM said: 'Because it is an election people think it's like a general election. If you are fed up with the effing Tories, you can give them a kick and then maybe we'll think again. This is totally different. 'This is not a decision about the next five years, but the next century.' Mr Cameron went on: 'This vote is not about whether Scotland is a nation or not, Scotland is a nation, it's a strong, proud nation with an extraordinary history and incredibly talented people. 'But it is a nation that has chosen over the last 300 years to be part of a family of nations. A family of nations that enables this great country to punch way above its weight in the world. 'This vote is not about Scotland versus Britain it's about two competing visions for Scotland. 'I hope you choose the vision of Scotland that is about Scottish pride, Scottish patriotism, Scottish nationhood, but is also about being part of the family of nations we have created.'","Poll  puts the 'No' campaign six points ahead, halting independence surge .

"Tony Blair, pictured, said it was 'dangerous and wrong' to blame unemployment on immigration accusing Nigel Farage and Ukip of 'pandering to unpleasant prejudice' Tony Blair was accused of ‘mind-boggling arrogance’ last night after claiming mass immigration made no difference to the job prospects of unemployed Britons. The former prime minister launched a scathing attack on Nigel Farage and Ukip, saying politicians hostile to immigration were guilty of pandering to unpleasant prejudice. They were also guilty of deceiving the public by giving the impression that the arrival of migrants from Poland and other countries harmed their job prospects. The truth, he said, was that the ‘white, working-class, unemployed youth in alienated communities in Britain’ were held back by their own lack of education and skills. In what many critics see as further proof that Mr Blair is positioning himself for a bid to become president of the European Council, he told an audience of business chiefs in London that it was ‘dangerous and wrong’ to blame immigrants for unemployment among British workers. He said it was ‘a deception to tell  people they’re better off shutting down in the face of [global change] or stigmatising those different in race, colour, religion or faith’. ‘The answer to the white, working-class, unemployed youth in alienated communities in Britain is not to tell them their problems would be solved if there were fewer Polish people working in the UK. It is to provide them with the education and the skills and the  connectivity that gives them the ability to face the world’s challenges and overcome them. ‘Anything else is worse than a delusion – it actually holds them back by giving them a grievance rather than a chance. It is dangerous and wrong for leaders in British politics to think you are going to address the concerns of people worried about jobs, their future, how they get some hope and opportunity – to play into an idea that what’s holding them back is someone else coming in and taking their opportunity from them, because it isn’t true and it’s not helpful.’ He added: ‘If you look at what’s going to make this country great in the future it is to use the  connections that Britain has – its language, its position in the world, its history. If we do that, we’re going to be highly successful as a country. We’re never going to do it by an attitude that says we don’t like foreigners. ‘You have got to distinguish between the justifiable concerns and the desire for order and what is, in the end, a prejudice that is neither very pleasant nor very fruitful.’ Mr Blair is widely seen as having thrown open the gates to mass immigration as prime minister. In the mid-1990s, net migration was consistently around 50,000 a year. But during the 2000s it regularly topped 200,000. Conservative MP Douglas Carswell accused Mr Blair of 'mind-boggling arrogance' claiming life looks very different from a 'gilded square' in central London compared with a small cottage in Essex . Douglas Carswell, the Tory MP for Clacton, said the former PM’s ‘mind-boggling arrogance’ beggared belief. He added: ‘If you look at the world from an expensive property in a gilded square in Central London, then immigration looks very different to if you are in a small bungalow in my part of Essex. ‘Immigration might have been a good thing for overpaid over-opinionated former PMs because it means we have got more Russian plutocrats and Arab sheiks to rub shoulders with. But in my constituency immigration can mean being priced out of work.’ An official report in 2012 by the independent Migration Advisory Committee found that for every 100 extra foreign-born, working-age migrants in the UK, there was a reduction of 23 in the number of Britons in employment. Mr Blair’s speech to the Confederation of British Industry accused those who advocate pulling out of the EU of ‘traducing’ the national interest. Their arguments, under what he said was the ‘false banner of independence’, would leave Britain dependent on other global powers it would be unable to influence. It would also mean Britain stepping down from the ‘principal stage of the world’. Despite Mr Blair’s insistence he was not in line for the European Council job, there was speculation last night that he could become a compromise candidate if no deal is done by later this year.","Tony Blair attacked Ukip claiming they were pandering to prejudice .

"An Australian appointed as the most senior official in Parliament will be totally out of her depth, Betty Boothroyd said last night . An Australian appointed as the most senior official in Parliament will be totally out of her depth, Betty Boothroyd said last night. In an astonishing attack, the popular former Speaker of the House of Commons declared the selection of Carol Mills a mistake. MPs are also raising questions about the new Commons clerk, an appointment made by a panel led by Commons Speaker John Bercow. Michael Fabricant, a Tory, said Mr Bercow must reverse the decision and claimed the episode ‘posed serious questions again about his judgment’. Lady Boothroyd urged Mr Bercow to ‘remember he is not the master but that he is the servant of the House’ and should not act without consulting colleagues. She told the BBC: ‘I’m very sorry for this lady, Miss Mills, because she is totally out of her depth, she has no experience, she has no knowledge of the constitutional role of a parliamentary clerk.’ Miss Mills heads the department of parliamentary services in the Australian Senate in Canberra – a job that involves managing catering and other services but does not involve extensive understanding of the country’s constitution. As Commons clerk she would be required to give the Speaker detailed advice on parliamentary procedure and law – as well as acting as Commons ‘chief executive’. Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ‘Unfortunately the candidate who has emerged does not know the Australian constitution let alone the British. 'She used, apparently, to run the Sydney Opera House. 'This doesn’t sound like the level of qualification needed to be the most senior constitutional adviser not just to the Speaker but to every individual member of the House of Commons.’ The popular former Speaker of the House of Commons Lady Boothroyd declared the selection of Carol Mills a mistake (left).  MPs are also raising questions about the new Commons clerk, an appointment made by a panel led by Commons Speaker John Bercow (right) MPs are also raising questions about the new Commons clerk, an appointment made by a panel led by Commons Speaker John Bercow . He said the job should have  gone to David Natzler, deputy to  outgoing Sir Robert Rogers,  who had a difficult relationship with Mr Bercow. Mr Natzler has reportedly asked for documents relating to the selection process – raising suspicions he may challenge the decision to overlook him. The row exploded after a senior Australian parliamentary official, Rosemary Laing, wrote an email casting serious doubt about Miss Mills’s suitability for the £200,000-a-year post. The note reportedly expressed the ‘disbelief and dismay’ among her colleagues. A spokesman for the Speaker said: ‘It was a thorough and very fair recruitment process.’ The Queen’s formal approval will be sought within days.","Former speaker Betty Boothroyd declared selection of Carol Mills a mistake .

"Internet users have the right to tell Google to hide embarrassing details of their past in search results, European judges  ruled yesterday. Anyone will be able to ask the technology giant and other search engines to block any reference to information about their life. Although content cannot be removed  from the internet altogether, the decision means it can be hidden from search results if it is ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive’. Scroll down for video . The decision affects 500 million citizens and states that if search services don't comply, they face heavy fines. Google (pictured) began removing search results last month and said it has received more than 70,000 requests since it put a form online on May 30 . Under the European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17 includes the ‘right to be forgotten and to erasure’. Under . Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to . ‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to . them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data.' This . particularly relates to data about the person when they were a child, . when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was . collected, the person who owns the content withdraws their consent, the . storage period has expired, or if it was gathered illegally. The EU defines ‘data controllers’ as ‘people or bodies that collect and manage personal data.’ The EU General Data Protection Regulation means any data controller who . has been asked to remove data must ‘take all reasonable steps, . including technical measures' to remove it. If a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined. It effectively enshrines in law the . Brussels doctrine of the ‘right to be forgotten’, which says people . should not be damaged by discussion of their mistakes or misjudgments in . the distant past. The ruling by the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice yesterday provoked a wave of anger in Britain. Both . privacy and freedom of expression watchdogs said it was a threat to . free speech – condemning efforts to allow people to ‘whitewash their . personal history’. Influential . Tory Eurosceptic MP Dominic Raab added: ‘This ruling is a draconian . attack on free speech and transparency, totally at odds with Britain’s . liberal tradition. ‘It . highlights the increasingly authoritarian dimension to the EU, which . threatens basic freedoms we have long taken for granted.’ The judgment came as an unwelcome surprise to ministers who have opposed EU moves to establish a ‘right to be forgotten’. The . Government had been led to believe the European Court of Justice would . reject yesterday’s case when an adviser to judges last year said . suppressing content in the public domain would affect the ‘freedom of . expression’ of web publishers. But . yesterday a board of 13 judges ruled that information could be . suppressed even if it was ‘true, accurate and lawfully published’. The ruling was made by the European Union Court of Justice (pictured). It comes after a Spanish man complained an online auction note about his repossessed home infringed his privacy. Google told MailOnline it is 'disappointed' by the ruling and argued it should not be a censor for data held on websites in its index . In June 2013, an adviser to EU’s highest court said that Google should not have to remove personal information from its search results, even if that information is damaging to a person's reputation. The statement was made by by Advocate General Niilo Jääskinen and was seen as a major blow against the 'right to be forgotten' campaign. Jääskinen said: 'Requesting search engine service providers to suppress legitimate and legal information that has entered the public domain would entail an interference with the freedom of expression. 'Search engine service providers are not responsible, on the basis of the data protection directive, for personal data appearing on web pages they process.' They . found in favour of Spanish citizen Mario Costeja Gonzalez, who had . demanded that Google block  links to newspaper reports dating back to . 1998 about his social  security debts. Mr Gonzalez told the court that the proceedings concerning him had been ‘fully resolved for a number of years’. Judges . said he had a right to suppress the information under a 1995 EU data . protection directive and the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, adding . that his rights to privacy ‘override, as a general rule, the interest of . internet users’. Google was . held responsible because, the judges decided, even though it is a . US-based corporation, it has local sales offices in Spain. The . search giant said yesterday: ‘This is a disappointing ruling for search . engines and online publishers in general. We now need to take time to . analyse the implications.’ European . Commission vice-president Viviane Reding, who is trying to persuade EU . nations to adopt a formal directive on the right to be forgotten, said . the decision was a victory for privacy and would mean people could now . ‘manage their data’. ‘Companies can no longer hide behind their servers being based in California or anywhere else in the world,’ she said. Emma . Carr of Big Brother Watch said: ‘The principle that you have a right to . be forgotten is a laudable one, but it was never intended to be a way . for people to rewrite history.’ Index . on Censorship added: ‘It allows individuals to complain to search . engines about information they do not like with no legal oversight. ‘This . is akin to marching into a library and forcing it to pulp books.

"TV shows such as Homeland, 24 and Spooks are guilty of ‘glorifying torture’ and making the mistreatment of prisoners more palatable to the public, Amnesty International claimed last night. A poll showed more than one in four people (29 per cent) think torture is sometimes necessary and acceptable to protect the public. That means British public opinion is more accepting than the Russian public in their tolerance of brutal methods. In 24 - which returned to TV screens last week - agent Jack Bauer is shown using violence to extract information from suspects. Scroll down for video . Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer is back in 24, a show that features torture . In one notorious scene in Spooks an agent was tortured by having her hand put in a deep fat fryer. In Homeland, an enemy agent is subjected to a gruelling sleep deprivation with bright lights and loud music pumped into his cell. The poll showed some 29 per cent of Britons think torture is sometimes necessary and acceptable to protect the public. That compares with 25 per cent in Russia. Amnesty said alarming findings showed TV programmes had ‘glorified torture to a generation’. Kate Allen, the director of Amnesty International UK, said: ‘These findings are alarming, we really didn’t foresee this sort of response from people in the UK and it shows we have got a lot of work to do. ‘It looks from these results like we have placed panic over principle. People have bought into the idea that their personal safety can be enhanced in some way through the use of torture. That is simply untrue. ‘Programmes like 24, Homeland and Spooks have glorified torture to a generation - but there’s a massive difference between a dramatic depiction by screenwriters, and its real-life use by government agents in torture chambers. Homeland with Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison. In Homeland, an enemy agent is subjected to a gruelling sleep deprivation with bright lights and loud music pumped into his cell . ‘We decided as a society, a long time ago, that torture is simply wrong and can never be justified in any circumstances. That is one of the moral pillars on which our culture is based.’ The survey was published as Amnesty launched a new Stop Torture campaign around the world. It found evidence of 27 different types of torture in 2013/14 taking place in at least 79 different countries. These included beatings, needles being forced underneath a victim’s fingernails, a prisoner having their joints drilled and boiling water being poured onto the body feature on the macabre list of torture techniques used across the world. Electric shocks, stubbing out cigarettes on the body, water torture and use of stress positions and sustained sleep deprivation also feature.

"A grandmother has been sentenced to three months in prison after she was filmed giving her granddaughter a hug. Kathleen Danby, 72, was jailed by the secretive Court of Protection, which decided she had disobeyed its order that she should not see the teenager. Under a draconian judgment kept secret from the public, Mrs Danby had been banned from making contact with the girl, who is 18 but has learning difficulties. Ban: Kathleen Danby, 72, has been sentenced to three months in prison after she was filmed giving her granddaughter a hug after disobeying an order she should not see the 18-year-old . She was told she could only speak to her . on the phone once a month at a set time, with social workers listening . in. Mrs Danby was ordered back to court when social workers heard that . she had met the girl at a model railway exhibition. Police also . presented CCTV footage of her hugging her granddaughter outside a pub. Mrs Danby was not at the hearing in Birmingham in April to give her version of events but Judge Martin Cardinal said the CCTV showed she was in contempt. He ordered that she be jailed for three months and issued a warrant for her arrest. However Mrs Danby, who lives in Orkney, said yesterday that no police officers had arrived to execute the warrant. ‘I haven’t been jailed simply because I refused to go down there to court,’ she said, adding that she would refuse to go to prison simply for making contact with her granddaughter. Ruling: Judge Martin Cardinal said the CCTV showed Mrs Danby was in contempt . ‘She is 18 and can decide for herself what she wants to do, she is being denied her human rights,’ Mrs Danby said. ‘She has the educational standards of somebody half her age, and behaves like a much younger child, but she is completely lucid in what she wants.’ Mrs Danby said the girl was moved into care in Derbyshire in 2007, when she was 11, a year after being removed from her father in Orkney.  He was banned from seeing her after he was convicted for ill-treatment for restraining her from running into a busy road while she was having a temper tantrum, Mrs Danby said. She said it was a ‘spurious excuse’, adding: ‘Social services completely cut off contact which was of course cruel to her in the extreme.’ The girl’s father has been jailed twice for trying to contact her – once for waving at her taxi as she travelled to school – she said. The teenager was in the care home against her will and had run away 175 times, Mrs Danby said. Judge . Cardinal is the judge who sent Wanda Maddocks to jail in secret for . trying to free her 80-year-old father from a care home where she feared . his life was at risk. Judge . Cardinal jailed Miss Maddocks without publishing her name or making any . details of her contempt public. She served six weeks in jail. The case . came to light more than six months later and led to new rules so that no . one may ever again be imprisoned without their name being published. In . Mrs Danby’s case, Judge Cardinal said that the teenager, named only as . B, finds it hard to control her anger, has self-harmed and frequently . runs away. Social workers believe her distress increases when she is . contacted by her father or grandmother, he said. Derbyshire County Council said Mrs Danby . broke the injunction banning contact by meeting her granddaughter at . 5.27pm on February 28 outside the pub next to the care home. Four days earlier, the teenager escaped from her minder and took a circuitous route to the town of Chapel-en-le-Frith. Judge Cardinal said the girl knew that for the last three years her grandmother has attended a model railway show there in February. She told a care worker that her grandmother had come from Scotland to see her. ‘I am sure this grandmother needs restraint,’ he said. Last night lawyers were debating whether, by failing to give any information about why Mrs Danby is banned from seeing her granddaughter, Judge Cardinal had met the full requirements brought in after the Maddocks case.","Kathleen Danby, 72, jailed for three months by secretive Court of Protection .

"The disaster unfolding in Iraq was branded ‘Tony Blair’s legacy’ last night as Britain ruled out military intervention. Though Islamist extremists are threatening to seize Baghdad, Foreign Secretary William Hague said Britain was ‘not contemplating’ any form of action, and Nato chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said there was no role for the alliance. US President Barack Obama insisted his country had an interest in stopping jihadists taking control and said he was looking at ‘all options’, including drone strikes. Iraq is facing a return to its darkest days after al Qaeda-linked militants seized a huge swathe of the Iraq’s northern region and vowed to press on to the capital. The collapse of Iraq and the impending disaster was last night branded as 'Tony Blair's legacy' after the former Prime Minister, left, agreed to George W Bush's middle east war, left . The developments have reignited debate over the wisdom of the decision of Mr Blair and US President George W Bush to invade Iraq in 2003, at the cost of 179 British lives and at least £9 billion. Critics say the US and UK governments of the time failed to prepare properly for the aftermath of the invasion. In 2007, Mr Bush ordered a ‘surge’ of troops to quell insurgency, but in 2011, the last British forces pulled out of Iraq. Researchers have estimated that as many as half a million Iraqis have died as a result of the conflict, though the figure is hotly disputed. Home Office minister Norman Baker, a Liberal Democrat who is a longstanding opponent of the Iraq War, told the Daily Mail: ‘Saddam Hussein was a dictator who gassed his own people, but the country was stable, in a vile sort of way. ‘The reality is that the intervention by Tony Blair and George Bush has destabilised this country and left it open to extremism, and we are seeing that now. Iraq today is Tony Blair’s legacy.’ The accusation was made by Liberal Democrat MP and Home Affairs Minister Norman Baker who said Tony Blair's decision to go to war in Iraq has left the country 'open to extremism' Conservative MP John Baron, who resigned from his party’s front bench to vote against the Iraq conflict, said events in the country demonstrated the folly of intervention across the Middle East. ‘One of the dangers of invading Iraq is that we underestimated the religious tensions and the resources needed to leave robust structures in place when the West left. A weakened Iraq was always going to be more susceptible to extremism,’ he said. ‘Other examples include Libya, and possibly Afghanistan. In Libya, a weak central Government has been unable to establish its authority over militias. In Afghanistan, Western confidence that the Afghan security forces will be able to hold the line surely needs re-evaluating after these events.” ‘All in all, such developments once again bring into question the wisdom of our recent interventions.’ Jihadi militants from the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) , pictured, have seized Mosul and Tikrit after heavy fighting . Mr Hague said there was no prospect of the UK offering military assistance of any kind to Iraq, though the Government is providing humanitarian support. The Department of International Development confirmed that a team of experts have been sent to the country after two major cities, Mosul and Tikrit, fell to insurgents from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). ‘No military assistance has been requested from the UK, we're not contemplating military intervention or assistance from the UK,’ Mr Hague said. ‘We are considering what we can do to relieve the humanitarian pressures caused by the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, that is something that the UK is well-placed to provide.’ Mr Hague insisted that the Iraqi authorities – which failed even to persuade enough MPs to turn up to parliament to vote on a request by prime minister Nouri al-Maliki to declare a state of emergency – form a more effective consensus between the country’s rival religious and ethnic groups. ‘It is very much an issue for the Iraqi leaders to make sure that together they form a political unity and consensus to deal with this involving Shia, Sunni and Kurds working together. We look to the Iraqi government to do that,’ the Foreign Secretary said. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he also opposed military action, referring to the 2003 war: ‘I don't think having made one mistake you repeat it by making a second one.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, speaking on his radio show ruled out any further military intervention in Iraq claiming 'I don't think having made one mistake you repeat it by making a second' Mr Clegg said the Iraq was now in a ‘very, very dangerous situation’ and were in part due to the knock-on effects of the civil war in Syria. The Deputy Prime Minister told his LBC radio phone-in that his view was that the legal basis for the invasion of Iraq in 2003 was ‘very shaky’, adding: ‘I personally do not think legality was ever proved. My party was alone in thinking at the time, as the Conservatives and Labour parties both argued for the invasion of Iraq, that we shouldn’t have invaded Iraq in the first place. ‘This porous border between Syria and Iraq is really becoming the absolute fulcrum for ever more organised violent forces usurping the government of Iraq and occupying as you say, very large parts of that part of the world. ‘It is an incredibly serious situation but at the end of the day the only way that this is going to start turning around is if the violence subsides in Syria and politics can start taking root where violence at the moment is raging.’ Nadhim Zahawi, an Iraq-born Conservative MP who is a member of Downing Street’s policy board, said Britain's failure to intervene in Syria has fuelled Iraq’s descent into civil war. He also blamed the decision of Paul Bremer, the head of the occupational authority in Iraq following the invasion, to disband the 700,000-man Iraqi Army 11 years ago. David Cameron last summer said he wanted to launch airstrikes on Syria, but the plan was scrapped after Labour MPs and some Conservative backbenchers voted it down in the Commons. Mr Zahawi told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘I argued for very limited intervention to take the chemical weapons out of the game in Syria to protect the silent majority of innocent people. ‘Early intervention in Syria, supporting people who were working towards replacing Bashar al Assad with a moderate democracy which is inclusive would have been the right move. ‘Otherwise the message you send to the silent majority is actually you don't care about them. That is where these groups thrive because they go in and they are brutal and they take over and fill that vacuum.’","Government 'rules out' new Iraqi campaign despite major Jihadist threat .

"In his Mansion House speech, the Chancellor will announce plans for new criminal sanctions designed to clean up the City . City traders who manipulate foreign exchange and other markets in London will face years in jail, George Osborne will warn today. The Chancellor will announce plans for new criminal sanctions designed to clean up the City, which has been the subject of a series of investigations following allegations of abuse. ‘The integrity of the City matters to the economy of Britain,’ he will say. ‘Markets here set the interest rates for people’s mortgages, the exchange rates for our exports and holidays, and the commodity prices for the goods we buy. ‘I am going to deal with abuses, tackle the unacceptable behaviour of the few and ensure that markets are fair for the many who depend on them.’ The Government has already cracked down on abuse of the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) – the rate at which banks lend money to each other – after it emerged that traders had been manipulating it to their own advantage for years. Today the Chancellor will use his annual speech at Mansion House in the City, in which he addresses leaders of the financial industry, to announce further measures. They will include new oversight of the £3trillion-a-day foreign exchange market following allegations of market manipulation. Despite being one of the world’s largest financial markets, the foreign exchange market has largely escaped regulation. Prices for transactions are usually fixed by traders involved in the deals. More than 40 currency dealers around the world have been fired or suspended following claims that traders used client order information improperly to attempt to manipulate prices. Even the Bank of England suspended an employee earlier this year after an internal investigation. Mr Osborne is now proposing a more formal system to set prices for transactions and greater transparency. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is expected to signal measures to reduce risks to the economy from rapidly rising house prices . Manipulating the foreign exchange market is to be made a criminal offence, in line with measures introduced last year in the wake of the Libor fixing scandal. The offence is expected to attract unlimited fines and up to seven years in jail. Legislation will also be extended to cover the bonds and commodity markets amid fears about the damage allegations of abuse are doing to London’s standing as a leading financial centre. Mr Osborne will say that the UK will not opt in to forthcoming EU rules. He will insist that Britain’s new regime will be as strong or stronger than those proposed by Brussels but will preserve flexibility. The Chancellor will say that a joint review by the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority into the way key financial markets operate will take place over the next 12 months and draw up further measures. Bank governor Mark Carney, who will also address the Mansion House today, is expected to signal measures to reduce risks to the economy from rapidly rising house prices. Next week the Bank is expected to consider tighter curbs on mortgage lending. Cathy Jamieson, Labour’s Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘This review is too little, too late.’","Government already cracked down .

"Google has had one demand every seven seconds to suppress information about people’s pasts, it was revealed today. The rush of censorship requests follows the internet giant’s move to provide forms allowing people to ask that certain information about them be hidden when their name is searched online. The figures indicate that large amounts of material could disappear from public reach as a direct result of an EU court decision that search engines must enforce a ‘right to be forgotten’. Scroll down to see video . Requests: Managers at the search engine said the online form was used 12,000 times on Friday - the first day it was available. Google's UK headquarters in London are pictured . Managers at the search engine said the online form was used 12,000 times on Friday – the first day it was available – with applications arriving at the rate of 20 a minute during its busiest periods. Demands came from all 28 EU countries, but are understood to involve hundreds from Britain. The flood of requests follows last month’s ruling at the EU’s Court of Justice in Luxembourg that people have a right to ask for ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive’ material about them to be dropped from search results. However one internet pioneer, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, said today that the European attempt to suppress information would not work because of the global scale of the web. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: . ‘They don’t censor the US version. That is not going to happen. There . are many search engines around the world which don’t have a presence in . Europe and who won’t abide by this ruling.’ Although . Google is based in California, judges ruled that it could be considered . a European organisation because it maintains sales offices in European . countries. Internet pioneer: Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales said that the European attempt to suppress information would not work because of the global scale of the web . A high proportion of the information expected be lost to European search engine users is likely to be connected to convicted criminals trying to remove records of their past that could be seen by employers, clients or social contacts. Over the first three days following the court judgement, those asking for records to be removed in Britain included a convicted user of child pornography, a politician with a chequered record in office, and a doctor with a controversial professional record. 'There are many search engines around the world which don’t have a presence in Europe and who won’t abide by this ruling' Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia founder . The ruling was triggered by a test case involving a Spanish citizen who wanted Google to stop providing an embarrassing link in searches for his name. The link provided a regional newspaper advert from 1998, in which authorities were auctioning the man’s house to recoup debts to the social security system. Judges said search engines should be required on request to remove links which breached the ‘right to be forgotten’ – a new rule strongly supported by officials in Brussels but one which has yet to be incorporated into EU treaty law. The scope of the rule – against which there is no appeal – is not yet clear. The BBC, which runs an archive of news stories dating back to the 1990s, is also among organisations to receive requests that material cease to be flagged up. Information not shown in internet search results is effectively beyond the reach of web users who do not know the specific location of what they are looking for.","People can ask that certain information about them be hidden on Google .

"One in ten people going through a divorce try to turn mutual friends against their partner, a study found yesterday. It also said half try to cheat their husband or wife over the financial settlement and seven out of 10 cannot separate their emotions from the process of deciding where their children will live. The survey by law firm Slater and Gordon comes amid renewed Government efforts to persuade people mired in divorce to swallow their pride and end their marriage amicably. Dirty tricks: One in ten people going through a divorce try to turn mutual friends against their partner, a study by Slater and Gordon has found. It also said half try to cheat their husband or wife over the financial settlement . It added that the majority of couples are too far gone in acrimony to make rational decisions in their children’s best interests, and that many are actively trying to damage their ex. Based on polling of more than 1,000 divorcees, the study said two out of three people said their divorce had harmed their children’s wellbeing. Seven out of 10 said they ‘could not separate the emotions they felt from the practicalities of resolving financial issues and the residency of their children.’ Around half of those asked said they fought their spouse for more than they knew was a fair share of their money and property. Pain: One in 10 people going through a divorce said they way they had conducted themselves had hurt their children unnecessarily (file picture) The same number said they thought their spouse would be trying to get more than was fair, so they decided to ‘fight dirty from day one’. A third said they went for more than was fair solely to ‘get one up’ on their former partner. Almost as many, 31 per cent, said they did not like being aggressive but felt that they would not get a good settlement unless they took a combative approach. A minority of divorcees, the survey found, were willing to try to do serious damage to each other or their children to satisfy their desire for revenge. One in 10 tried to turn people against their spouse ‘to make them suffer’, while more than a third said they wanted their former husband or wife to suffer because they were suffering. And one in 10 said they way they had conducted themselves had hurt their children unnecessarily. Meanwhile, one in seven went to court to try to embarrass their former partner, and the same number tried to persuade a judge that they were a victim. Liz Cowell of Slater and Gordon said she hoped new Government legislation that requires divorcing couples to consider mediation, in which they agree to settle their affairs with the help of a single mutual adviser, would help to calm angry husbands and wives. ‘These findings don’t surprise me one bit,’ she said. ‘We have all dealt with clients where one party has let their anger influence their decisions during a separation. ‘Often we find that clients coming in here won’t even consider being in the same room as their ex. But after a few months people calm down and see that an amicable separation and mediation can actually be quite a good way of resolving issues without spending a lot of money and heading to the court room.’ 'Beyond reach': Yesterday, analysts of marriage declared the 'conscious uncoupling' style of mutually agreed break-up claimed by Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin (pictured) is beyond the reach of ordinary couples . But other analysts of marriage said it was hard for couples to rise above their bitterness and that the ‘conscious uncoupling’ style of mutually agreed break-up claimed by Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin is beyond the reach of ordinary couples. Harry Benson of the Marriage Foundation think tank said: ‘The good divorce is a myth. ‘It has been said for years that couples can divorce amicably and minimise harm to their children. These findings blow that idea out of the water. ‘It is very hard for people without enormous resources to be quite as amicable as Gywneth Paltrow and Chris Martin. Most people find it hard to uncouple consciously without the kind of rancour that harmd the children.’ Mr Benson added: ‘In fact where couples hide their conflict and behave amicably it can be more damaging for the children, because children do not see the split coming and cannot understand why mummy and daddy do not love each other any more.’","One in ten going through divorce try to turn mutual friends on partner .

"Marie was nine years old when she was cruelly abused by our legal system. Her crime? To reveal she had been sexually abused for years, and then to have the courage to accuse her abuser in a court of law. Repeatedly accused of being a liar by the alleged abuser’s lawyer, the girl broke down time and time again until, eventually, the judge decided he must stop the trial to bring Marie’s ordeal to an end. Yet there would have been medical evidence and corroboration from other children to support her story, if only the jury had been allowed to hear it. As it was, the child and her family have been left deeply traumatised, and the alleged abuser walked free. A terrible double injustice. Marie broke down time and time again until the judge decided he must stop the trial (picture posed by model) Her case - by no means untypical - is the perfect illustration of why our current adversarial legal system, based on live cross-examination, is unfit for purpose and fails to produce justice for abused children. I believe the savagery of live cross-examination is the reason many abusers are able to prey upon children for decades, without ever having to answer charges in a court of law. For even when a child has the courage to ask for help, even when they go to the police and agree to give evidence in court, in every case I know of, the police and lawyers have either refused to take the case to trial or tried to persuade the child’s family not to pursue their complaint. So it seems to those families that our law is siding with the abusers. As the founder of ChildLine and a trustee of the NSPCC, I believe now is the time to bring in a simple reform, and pre-record those cross-examinations. This way, these vulnerable children can answer the lawyers’ questions without fear that the eyes of their abusers and the court are on them. If the questioning is pre-recorded it doesn’t have to take place in the gladiatorial environment of the court with the barristers playing to the jury. It can be calm and private, with barristers using language appropriate for a child. The nature of the exchange can turn into one that is focused on the child rather than the jury. At the moment, matters are cruelly different. In one of the recent trials of the wicked Asian sex gangs who prostituted children, a victim was so distressed by her cross-examination that she ran out of the court. 'The defence barrister had to do was to ¿break down¿ the children, then the judge would stop the case' In another trial, the lawyer played to the jury by asking a toddler to define truth: a philosophical conundrum that would stump many adults. I am not alone in my view these interrogations should be pre-recorded. Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, and the Attorney General agree. It’s a reform that was first recommended by a Home Office Committee in the Pigot Report more than 20 years ago. Now it’s up to the Ministry of Justice to put pre-recording into practice, but the stumbling block, they say, is the expense. How much can it cost? And have they counted the cost, in human misery and in cold pounds and pence, of allowing dangerous child abusers to go free? Marie’s story tells us everything that is wrong with our system. Her police statement had been crystal-clear as she described the sexual abuse she suffered. It had become so bad she couldn’t sit down, and the man who abused her had threatened to kill her mother if she told anyone. She believed him. Her grandmother, Louise, had tears in her eyes as she listened to Marie’s account. But there was worse to come. Marie was about to undergo live cross-examination via a video link. It had taken the family great courage to reach this point. For Marie’s mother, Jean, had been advised by a Crown Prosecution Service lawyer not to allow her to give evidence. ‘It’s a game you cannot win,’ the barrister had told Jean. He explained that the children would be first to give their evidence: so all the defence barrister had to do was to ‘break down’ the children, then the judge would stop the case. Jean was shocked. She believed that all Marie had to do was tell the truth. She and the other families agreed to stand firm and give all the children the chance to give evidence. The cross-examination began gently but the style of questioning quickly changed. Marie’s grandmother explains: ‘It was as if the barrister was going for the kill. She told Marie she was lying. Marie stayed strong that first time and said she wasn’t, but then the barrister started to criticise her mother. The barrister accused Marie of lying for a third time, and she burst into tears (picture posed by model) ‘The barrister accused Marie of telling lies to help her mother, and this time she couldn’t answer because she was crying so hard.’ The judge suggested Marie take a break. As a potential witness, Jean, wasn’t allowed in the courtroom. She was downstairs with the other children. Jean says: ‘The police and the prosecution barrister came into the room and tried again to persuade me to stop the trial. The lawyer said Marie had broken down under cross-examination and that I ought to take her home. ‘I asked if I, or someone, could speak to Marie to see what she wanted to do, but they refused. One of the other mothers begged me not to stop the trial. Her daughter Angie had been told in therapy that once she’d told the court what had been done to her, she could leave the memories of the abuse behind, so Angie was desperate to give evidence. I said the trial must go on.’ The barrister accused Marie of lying for a third time, and she burst into tears. The judge stopped the trial again, warning: ‘This process is abusive. I must warn you if it continues to upset the child, I will have to stop the trial.’ Marie was given another break. ‘I felt alone,’ she said. ‘What made it hard was knowing the man who’d done it was looking at me.’ The cross-examination continued until Marie was silenced by her sobs. ‘The judge stopped the trial - he said he was doing so to protect Marie’s mental well-being. None of the other children could give evidence, and the man was acquitted.’ When the case collapsed, Marie was taken to her mother, who says: ‘She was shaking. She kept apologising to the other children. Angie was hysterical, because she couldn’t give evidence. All the children were in tears and their parents were in pieces. The barrister told us to go home, have a good summer and forget it. How could we possibly?’ Wigs off . Children under the age of 14 do not have to give an oath in court and the judge is expected to remove his gown and wig . At least the case had reached court. The majority of children who ring ChildLine to report abuse never reach a court of law. The man who was acquitted lives near Marie, so, as her mother says: ‘We can meet him any time. The biggest problem is Marie is still frightened. He’d told her I would die if she told anyone, and now I’ve been diagnosed with cancer, Marie feels she’s to blame. ‘I once considered driving my car over a cliff with the children in it because I can’t bear what’s happened to my family.’ The tragic legacy of sexual abuse is that victims feel they must be to blame - Marie’s mother most of all because she allowed her daughter to give evidence.   And yet she was right. Our legal system must not be treated as a game. We must allow justice to prevail. And only when families like Marie’s are prepared to tell their story can we make the changes that are so necessary. For hers is a tragic story but by no means an unusual one, which is why I appeal to lawyers, judges and the Ministry of Justice not to tolerate this abuse of children in our courtrooms for a moment longer, but to champion the reform which is long-overdue. A defence lawyer who had been cross-examining a child in an abuse case once told me: ‘I don’t care how great a monster my client is or what it takes to break down a child, it’s my job to do it and I will.’A chilling thought. For Marie’s sake, and for the sake of all the thousands of children whose voices have not been heard, we need to act now before more dangerous abusers go free.","Our current adversarial legal system is unfit for purpose .

"Dah Yaya is an Afghan village set in stony hills and steeped in traditions that limit women to second-class status in this desperately poor country ravaged by Taliban insurgency. But in a school set up by an Afghan-American woman named a 2012 top 10 hero by TV network CNN, girls are learning to dream of a different future, of saying 'no' to the dictats of their elders. Just a 40-minute drive from Kabul, the village feels as if it's in the middle of nowhere. The road winds through the arid, dusty hills that encircle the Afghan capital, past mud-brick homes. Afghan schoolgirls study during a lesson in the village of Dah Yaya in Dih Sabz District of Kabul province . Afghan schoolgirls show their work to a teacher during a lesson in the village of Dah Yaya in Dih Sabz District of Kabul province . Dah Yaya is an Afghan village surrounded by rocky hills, and traditions that are reserved for women only a secondary role. But in a village school, girls learn to imagine another destiny, to say 'no' to the choices that are imposed on them . Women and girls wear burqas. Only once they are safely behind the gates of the Zabuli Education Center, do school girls take them off and leave them hanging on a banister, AFP reports. Founded by Razia Jan as part of her battle to educate girls in rural Afghanistan, the school wants to exact change in a country notorious for dreadful women's rights. 'I have 400 girls,' says Jan, who founded the school in 2008. Funded by private donors, it offers a free education to pupils. 'We made these girls speak for themselves, so that if something terrible happens in their life and they don't want it, they fight it, they have the force to say no, no, no,' she added. 'The more education there is, the more doors open for them.' A massive increase in the number of girls going to school since the fall of the repressive Taliban regime in 2001 is touted as one of the biggest achievements of Western intervention in the country. From 1996 to 2001, the Taliban banned girls from going out to school. According to the Afghan education ministry, 42 percent of children in school are girls. Women and girls wear burqas.

But the Zabuli Education Center provides girls with better than average teaching. Girls learn English as young as four, and they also have access to computers and to the Internet. Some profess to being fans of US superstar Jennifer Lopez and Canadian heart throb Justin Bieber -- pop singers far beyond the traditional horizons of Afghan culture. Zuhal Ansaari, 15, is passionate about art and is convinced that one day she can realise her dreams of becoming a teacher. 'Women and men have the same rights,' she told AFP. 'If a woman is educated, her role in the family becomes more important, she can teach her children and have a better life, because she knows at least the same thing as her husband.' Nazaneen Jahd, 14, even believes that one day a woman could lead the country if she is properly educated and gets the chance. 'I hope that very soon there will be one,' she said. According to the UN Girls' Education Initiative, the literacy rate for Afghan women aged 15-24 is 18 percent, compared to 50 percent for boys, and only 13 percent of girls complete primary school.

It quotes statistics estimating the mean age of marriage at 17 years while child marriages (where at least one participant is under 18) account for 43 percent of all marriages, which plays a part in the gender gap in education. 'When a girl becomes an adult or a teenager, their parents, especially their father, can force a girl to marry, even with a 65-year-old man,' says Nahid Alawi, a teacher at the school. The school may not be able to interfere in family matters, but its mission is to support those girls who put their foot down. 'I can give her advice: it's not time for her to get married, but unfortunately some families force them to get married,' Alawi said. Afghan schoolgirls are watched by a teacher during a lesson.

Mer Ruhullah, the village chief who sends four of his daughters to the school, said attitudes were starting to change and praised the school for changing the lives of girls in the village . Rahila Rohullah, in ninth grade, fought with her family for six months when her father tried to beat and threaten her into marrying the father of a woman he wanted to marry himself. She resisted, finding at school the comfort that allowed her to hold out until her father finally gave up. 'It's my own decision who I will marry, and I wont allow my parents to force me. It's every girl's right,' she said.

'There is no doubt there are people who don't want such a girls' school in our village. There are also people who don't send their girls to school, but times have changed. People are more open-minded now,' he said. But Jan still fears that one day her efforts could be destroyed if the Taliban return to government in any peace deal after US-led NATO combat troops withdraw next year. 'You cannot trust them, they're murderers,' she said. 'When a snake bites you once, you don't go to the den again to get bitten,' she said.","Zabuli Education Centre is transforming life for girls in Afghan village .

"Theresa May is to be hauled before MPs to face questions over what she knew about a damaging letter leaked by her closest aide to undermine Michael Gove. The Home Secretary – who is seen as a Tory leadership contender – will be asked about her role in the ‘unseemly’ public feud with the Education Secretary over how Islamist extremism is tackled in schools. She will be asked about any personal involvement in the release of a letter she wrote to Mr Gove raising concerns about his department’s response to allegations of a plot by Muslim hardliners in Birmingham. Home affairs committee chairman Keith Vaz has called Home Secretary Theresa May to give evidence in Parliament after the deeply damaging row led to the resignation of her close aide, Fiona Cunningham . Keith Vaz, chairman of the home . affairs select committee, said he had written to Mrs May to demand a . full investigation into what had happened. He also revealed that her . special adviser Fiona Cunningham, who was forced to resign on Saturday . night, could be called to give evidence. Labour’s . Yvette Cooper yesterday stepped up pressure on the Government by . accusing the Home Secretary of breaching the ministerial code that sets . out the standards of conduct for those in government. Mr Cameron is said to be ‘deeply frustrated’ over the row between two key Cabinet figures. There . will be concerns in Mrs May’s camp that the questions over her conduct . could harm her leadership ambitions, and she is known to be furious that . she has lost Miss Cunningham – one of her most loyal and trusted . advisers. Last night, . Whitehall sources suggested that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood . may have already concluded that Mrs May did not know about the letter’s . publication because he only told Mr Gove to apologise. The . bitter row started late last Tuesday when comments published in The . Times from an unnamed source – made by Mr Gove during a lunch at the . newspaper – criticised Home Office counter-terrorism chief Charles . Farr’s approach to preventing the spread of extremism. Within . hours of the story appearing, a letter Mrs May previously sent to Mr . Gove questioning his department’s response to the Islamist ‘Trojan . horse’ allegations in Birmingham schools was placed on the Home Office . website by Miss Cunningham. This . was a confidential item of Cabinet correspondence and should not have . been released. A Home Office aide also briefed against Mr Gove to the . BBC on Wednesday morning. Furious that Wednesday’s Queen’s Speech had been overshadowed, David Cameron ordered Sir Jeremy to carry out an inquiry. It . led to Miss Cunningham taking the blame for the letter and resigning on . Saturday night. Mr Gove wrote to apologise to the Prime Minister and Mr . Farr. It is unclear if he will also be forced to apologise to the . Commons. Fired: Home Secretary Theresa May, left, was forced to fire her aide Fiona Cunningham, right, in the aftermath of a vicious row with Michael Gove . Although the . Education Secretary will face a rough ride in the House today when he . publishes 21 reports by Ofsted into the Birmingham schools affair, it is . Mrs May who is facing more questions over her conduct. Mr . Vaz said: ‘I have written to the Home Secretary for a full explanation . of what has happened. The committee will question her about these . matters. There is a strong case to hear from Ms Cunningham herself as to . why she has resigned. David Cameron will reshuffle his Cabinet in the next ten days – and is expected to use the opportunity to promote women. Employment minister Esther McVey, who impressed the Prime Minister with her defence of benefit reforms, is among those being tipped for the top table. The Liverpudlian was a presenter on Children’s BBC and GMTV before becoming an MP. She was also a successful businesswoman, setting up the firm Making It UK, which provides training for small businesses. However, she has a majority of just 2,436 in her constituency of Wirral West. Children’s minister Liz Truss and women’s minister Nicky Morgan could also be promoted. Long-serving Cabinet ministers who may have to make way for a female influx include Andrew Lansley, the Leader of the Commons, who could become Britain’s next European commissioner. Chief Whip Sir George Young and Ken Clarke – the veteran minister without portfolio – may also go. Despite their public row over extremism in schools, both Education Secretary Michael Gove and Home Secretary Theresa May are expected to keep their jobs. ‘This unseemly row obscures the pressing issue of how to combat radicalism in schools. ‘Theresa . May must also ensure that in the future there are no potential . conflicts of interests that may impact on her decision-making.’ Miss . Cooper said Mrs May needed to explain her actions, including whether . she breached the ministerial code, which states that ministers should . not leak confidential letters between members of the Government. She . told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘We’ve seen the Education Secretary . apologise, the special adviser to the Home Secretary resign, but we’ve . heard nothing from the Home Secretary even though it looks clear that . she has breached the ministerial code by writing and then authorising . the publication of this letter. ‘The . Prime Minister is responsible for enforcing the ministerial code. He . needs to act and to make sure that that happens. Theresa May needs to . come out publicly and answer what she did to publish this letter.’ Labour says Miss Cunningham should not receive the substantial severance pay to which she may be entitled after losing her job. Jonathan . Ashworth, Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: ‘If she has been . awarded severance pay this would amount to £37,000, which is the maximum . possible and £10,000 above the average wage. This would be considered . unacceptable in light of the circumstances of her departure.’ Last night Downing Street was unable to say whether any payment had been made. Pupils as young as six were taught to treat Western women as ‘white prostitutes’ by a school at the centre of the ‘Trojan Horse’ Islamist plot. The shocking disclosure comes ahead of two bombshell reports into claims Muslim radicals conspired to infiltrate governing bodies of Birmingham schools. A leaked copy of one report says teachers at Oldknow Academy told school inspectors they were alarmed by the use of terms such as ‘white prostitute’ and ‘hellfire’ in school assemblies, and that non-Muslim teachers were banned from being present. A leaked report speaks of alarm at language and teaching in Oldknow Junior School, Birmingham . A report by the Education Funding Agency says: ‘We were told by teachers that non-Muslim teaching staff are no longer allowed to take Friday assemblies. In separate interviews, staff told us that in Friday assemblies, occasionally words have been used such as “white prostitute” and  “hellfire” which they felt were inappropriate for young children.’ Well-placed sources have told The Mail on Sunday that the term ‘white prostitute’ was used to suggest to pupils that Muslim women were moral but non-Muslim women were not. Oldknow Academy, which has around 600 pupils, is said to have been the subject of a gradual takeover by extremists, who allegedly pushed out head teacher, Bhupinder Kondal, because she opposed the ‘Islamisation’ of the school. Head teacher Bhupinder Kondal opposed the 'Islamisation' of Oldknow Junior School . Officially, Mrs Kondal is on sick leave, and she refused to discuss the matter with The Mail on Sunday. She was among four of the school’s six senior managers who have left in recent months. It is also claimed that in one assembly, just before Christmas last year, a senior teacher led ‘an anti-Christian’ chant. He allegedly shouted at the pupils ‘Do we believe in Christmas?’, to which the pupils replied collectively ‘No we don’t.’ The senior teacher is said to have made other ‘anti-Christian comments’ at the same assembly. Officials from education watchdog Ofsted, who have also studied the ‘Trojan Horse’ claims, investigated the ‘anti-Christmas’ chant incident, but found no evidence of it. However, a source said that teachers and pupils at Oldknow have referred to Christians as ‘kaffirs’, a derogatory Arabic term meaning infidels. The source said that as part of the Islamic takeover, urinals from the boy’s toilets were removed, in accordance with Muslim custom which frowns on those who stand up to urinate. More than 95 per cent of Oldknow’s pupils are Muslim. It holds Islamic prayers every Friday, teaches Arabic and organises trips to Mecca. Last week, Oldknow teacher, Samir Rauf defended the school, accusing Ofsted inspectors of ‘having an agenda’. He said he had seen no evidence of an extremist takeover, and denied Christmas had been banned. In February, a senior Oldknow teacher is said to have posted a message on social media urging all Muslims to disown those who gave up their faith. He said: ‘Do not love the one who does not love Allah. If they can leave Allah, they will leave you.’ Only a year ago, an Ofsted inspection of Oldknow found it ‘outstanding’ in all areas, including in promoting multi-racial harmony. It is one of 21 schools being probed for claims extremists tried to influence teaching. Education Secretary Michael Gove is expected to put five schools into special measures when the reports are published tomorrow. He will make a Commons statement as head teachers hold a press conference in Birmingham to speak publicly for the first time. According to a leaked report, teachers at the school lead chants criticising Christmas . The five schools include Oldknow, and secondary schools Park View and Golden Hillock. The running and teaching at all three have been described as ‘inadequate.’ Ofsted inspectors criticise poor teaching at Golden Hillock, and in their report say: ‘Too little is done to keep students safe from the risks associated with extremist views.’ The school, which has just under 900 pupils, is said to have been taken over by extremists with an ‘Islamising agenda.’ Former head teacher Matthew Scarrott reportedly left because he opposed the change. Ofsted say Golden Hillock did not provide adequate sex education and that some female teachers at were spoken to in a way they found ‘intimidating’. The school did little to ‘mitigate against cultural isolation,’ leaving students ‘vulnerable to the risk  of marginalisation from wider British society and the associated risks, which could include radicalisation’. However Mohammed Shafique, chairman of governors at Golden Hillock, said he would challenge any move to put the school into special measures: ‘Ofsted’s views are completely unfounded, we do not practise isolationism or segregation. They did not check the reality on the ground. They were listening to comments Michael Gove made.’ At Park View, it is alleged that pupils were told homosexuality is evil, given lists of Christian teachers and told to try to convert them and that staff preach ‘mind-blowing’ anti-Western propaganda in assemblies.","Michael Gove forced to apologise for criticising Theresa May's policies .

"It takes dedication to follow in the footsteps of your hero - particularly if that hero happens to be global explorer and adventurer Sir Francis Drake. But after 30 years travelling thousands of miles and at an estimated cost of £100,000, Michael Turner says he has re-traced almost every journey taken by the famous Elizabethan. The 57-year-old teacher has visited 42 countries over three decades since becoming obsessed with Drake as a schoolboy. Adventure: Michael Turner has spent his adult life re-tracing the journey's of Sir Francis Drake all over the globe . He claims to have ticked off 98 per . cent of the destinations reached by Drake in the 16th century and has . just two trips left to complete his mission - the Western Sahara and . Cape Horn off South America. Since the start of his adventures, Mr . Turner has been jailed in Guatemala, almost lost his ear to a knife . attack in Colombia, hacked through jungles and dived 170 feet off the . coast of Panama in a bid to see Drake's final resting place - his . lead-lined coffin. The supply teacher said: 'I have certainly had some experiences.' In February Mr Turner visited Panama . for the tenth time where he cut his way along a 16th-century trail to . reach the ruined settlement deep in the heart of the rainforest which . Drake raided in 1571. He said: 'We had to deal with mud, . sweat, cuts, exhaustion, thirst, blisters, bruised toes, mosquitoes, . poisonous vipers and scorpions. 'The crowning glory was to traverse a . steeply undulating ridge with no water supplies to reach the Cerro . Brewster Mountain from where Drake saw the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. 'This was a pivotal moment in English . history when Drake was inspired to sail a ship into the Pacific Ocean . which led to him circumnavigating the world.' Hero: Mr Turner idolised (right) the adventurer as a child, and learned a different Francis Drake (left) story every year as he grew up . He continued: 'This became the most . famous voyage in English history and stimulated England to beat the . Spanish Armada of 1588 and to become the world's most powerful navy. 'This was the first expedition to identify this Drake landmark and to visit it since February 1572.' Despite Drake being a famous sailor, . Mr Turner tackles most of his adventures on foot, flying into ports and . islands Drake visited before trekking through jungles or along . coastlines to stand on the very spot his hero visited 440 years ago. He has just two trips left to tackle, but is hoping for government help and extra funds to finally tick them off his list. Sir Francis Drake was the first Briton . to circumnavigate the world and second-in-command of the English fleet . against the Spanish Armada in 1588. It is said that prior to the battle he . was playing a game of bowls on Plymouth Hoe, and when warned of the . enemy's approach declared there was plenty of time to finish the game . and still beat the Spaniards. Mr Turner, who lives in Burnham-on-Sea . in Somerset, and teaches Humanities and P.E. tried to visit Cape Bouj . Dour and Cape Barbas off the coast of the Western Sahara in 2008, but . nobody was willing to take him out on a boat without an official letter . from the Moroccan government.

"Midwives have been given the green light to take the main role in performing abortions. New Department of Health rules say for the first time that midwives and nurses may ‘participate in the termination’. The controversial guidelines were last night condemned by MPs and anti-abortion campaigners. Crossbench peer Lord Alton said: ‘It is . particularly perverse that midwives, who do the beautiful work of . helping babies into the world, will now be called upon to end the lives . of children they might otherwise work to save.’ Main role: New Department of Health rules say for the first time that midwives and nurses may 'participate in the termination' (file picture) Tory MP Fiona Bruce said the new rules would ‘allow abortions to be administered by nurses or midwives instead of doctors’. She added: ‘This is a clear liberalisation of abortion law which people do not want. Moreover, I do not believe that it is what Parliament intended.’ Under previous guidelines, midwives and nurses could undertake ‘certain actions’ in helping to terminate unwanted pregnancies. 'Lliberalisation': Tory MP Fiona Bruce said the new rules would 'allow abortions to be administered by nurses or midwives instead of doctors' But the new rules go much further and state clearly that a ‘nurse or midwife may administer the drugs used for medical abortions’. The new guidance, which also rules out abortions carried out on the grounds of the sex alone, comes at a time of controversy over abortion law, which allows nearly 200,000 terminations to be performed in England and Wales each year. About a fifth of pregnancies end in abortion. The 1967 law which governs abortion says that two doctors must approve the termination and the procedure must be conducted by a doctor. In 1981, the courts gave approval for nurses to be involved, and Whitehall guidance restated the principle in 1999. But the new rules for the first time say that a doctor needs only to approve and begin a termination. The bulk of the procedure can be carried out by nurses. The move follows pressure from the Royal College of Nursing and abortion providers, who believe the law should be changed to allow nurses full control of abortion induced by drugs or some other techniques. Labour MP Jim Dobbin, the co-chairman of the all-party Parliamentary Pro-life Group, said: ‘We simply cannot trust the Department of Health on abortion. ‘They take every opportunity to make life easier for the abortion industry, even on legally contentious grounds. The Abortion Act is crystal clear that a qualified doctor is the only person able to perform an abortion. Pregnancy: A file photograph of an ultrasound of a seven-week-old foetus. Under previous guidelines, midwives and nurses could undertake 'certain actions' in helping to terminate unwanted pregnancies . ‘Not satisfied with this, the department is now making nurses and midwives accomplices to the tragic taking of innocent human life. We are looking at a judicial review to challenge the legality of this appalling decision.’ Pro-choice organisations say that over the past 20 years nurses have taken over many of the clinical functions once reserved for doctors and so the law should be liberalised to allow them to take over the lead role in abortion. 'This is a clear liberalisation of abortion law which people do not want. Moreover, I do not believe that it is what Parliament intended' Fiona Bruce, Conservative MP . Ann Furedi, chief executive of the biggest abortion provider, BPAS, said: ‘We think nurses are the best people to deliver early abortions. Abortions should be carried out by people who are clinically qualified to do it, including nurses.’ The Department of Health said the new guidelines made no difference to the law and merely clarified the existing rules. Dr Michael Scott, a consultant psychologist and critic of abortion law, believes the new guidance is designed to free up funds in the NHS. ‘Nurses would be cheaper than doctors,’ he said. ‘One can see that from a purely economic point of view, the Government is moving in that direction.’ Dr Tony Cole, chairman of the Medical Ethics Alliance, added: ‘Midwifery is one of the most life-enhancing fields in the whole of medicine and to ask midwives to carry out these death sentences is obscene. It is a betrayal of what midwives are for.’","New rules state midwives and nurses may 'participate in the termination'

"About 35 per cent of Australians admit they will buy gifts out of pure obligation this Christmas . As Christmas edges nearer and the shopping list of presents grows longer, millions of Australians will find themselves obli-gifting this festive season. A global Christmas survey of over 12,000 people by Groupon revealed that 35 per cent of Australians admitted they buy gifts out of pure obligation. The average Australian will not only purchase at least three obli-gifts this Christmas season, but they'll spend about $150 doing so, amounting to $855 million worth of obli-gifts being received across the country. Serial obli-gifter, Kate Hoyle, from Camden in New South Wales, told Daily Mail Australia that she spends at least $200 each Christmas, buying presents for people who she'd prefer not to buy anything for. 'A lot of it comes from when I'm catching-up with people before Christmas and you're in that 'I don't know if you're going to buy me something or not but I don't want to be the awkward one who doesn't have anything to give,' situation Mrs Hoyle said. The mother-of-three recalled how she was caught out one year when her neighbour's children arrived to her doorstep, bearing presents for her own children. 'I just ran inside and grabbed a gift I'd bought for my son – and luckily it had already been wrapped – and handed it over to them,' Mrs Hoyle laughed.'

'That concept that your always looking for things to buy rather than buying what they want or need, that's part of obli-gifting too really.' At least 57 per cent of Australians, most of them no doubt on the receiving end of an obli-gift, admitted to re-gifting an unwanted present. Meanwhile, about 55 per cent of respondents who forgot someone on their present list, confess that they prefer to lie, with the most popular excuse being that the receivers non-existent present had been bought online, with the post office copping the blame.

"A BBC reporter slipped up today by referring to Baroness Thatcher's funeral as a 'wedding'. Charlie Stayt was talking to DJ Terry Wogan when he made the blunder, which was widely ridiculed by viewers on social media. ITV also came under fire for refusing to broadcast the momentous ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral. While the BBC and Sky News each set aside hours of programming dedicated to the service, ITV decided to continue with its normal morning shows. Scroll down to watch the gaffe .

Mr Stayt was standing outside St Paul's when he . interviewed Mr Wogan, saying: 'It's interesting, it's an eclectic mix of . people who are invited to the wedding... yourself - to the funeral, my . apologies.' The veteran DJ chuckled at the mistake, but viewers were quick to leap on the error and took to Twitter to mock the BBC. 'Gaffometer soars - Charlie Stayt BBC .

Claire McLoughlin added: 'Charlie Stayt just accidentally called Thatcher funeral a wedding. Giggle!' Ceremony: The funeral of Baroness Thatcher was broadcast live on BBC and Sky News today . Interview: ITV decided not to broadcast the funeral in favour of This Morning, featuring Chris Evans . On ITV, Daybreak, Lorraine and . This Morning all featured interviews with commentators and friends of . Lady Thatcher, and cut away to the scene at St Paul's every so often. However, . from 9.30 to 10.30, ITV was broadcasting The Jeremy Kyle Show, the . controversial talkshow dedicated to sordid family dramas which often . features fistfights in the studio.

Should every major TV station have been broadcasting Baroness Thatcher's funeral or were ITV right not to? Now share your opinion . As the BBC showed David Dimbleby . interviewing Conservative grandees and political veterans, and Sky News . showed scenes from inside the cathedral, ITV broadcast a shouting match . between two girls and a man who was trying to deny that he was their . father. And while grandees filed into St Paul's and Lady Thatcher's coffin was driven to the cathedral, a young woman told the studio audience that she was trying to work out who her real father was. Matthew Woolcott wrote on Twitter: 'Live coverage on BBC of Thatcher funeral. On ITV... Jeremy Kyle. Yes, really.' This Morning was hosted as usual by Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby - neither known for their political acumen. The last time Mr Schofield attempted a high-profile political occasion, he caused controversy by handing David Cameron a list of alleged paedophiles which he had collected from the internet. Disrespect? The Jeremy Kyle Show, a notoriously sordid chat show, was broadcast in the run-up to the funeral . Contrast: At the same time Jeremy Kyle was on, David Dimbleby was interviewing friends of Lady Thatcher on the BBC One coverage . As the coffin was taken into the cathedral, This Morning ran a feature on dangerous criminals - apparently ignoring the start of the funeral. They also interviewed the victim of an arson attack in a Leicester gay bar from October 2011. Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans then joined Mr Schofield and Ms Willoughby on the show, discussing his own career. The pair also interviewed a writer who said that seeing his wife give birth gave him post-traumatic stress order, and interrogated him on his love life. Viewers criticised the decision to cover the funeral from the This Morning sofa, claiming that it trivialised the moment of national mourning. Paul Hempstead tweeted: 'Liking the respectful coverage of thatcher on ITV. Now over to the sofa to discuss it with 2 random women and Harry Hill #thismorning'. Chris Voss wrote: 'Did ITV miss out on the rights to Thatcher's funeral?' Screaming: A father and daughter were on The Jeremy Kyle Show shouting obscenities at each other . Low tone: On This Morning, Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield hosted a discussion of violent criminals . The BBC did not escape criticism for its coverage of Lady Thatcher's funeral - although the choice of the experienced Mr Dimbleby as anchor was widely praised. 'BBC is covering Thatcher's funeral properly with a Dimbleby at the microphone,' Twitter user Rob Clarke wrote. 'Much better than that Queen's Jubilee c**p.' Ahead of the service, the Corporation seemed keen to interview anyone it could - including Mr Wogan, who admitted his connection to the former Prime Minister was 'tenuous'. Andrew Pelling wrote on Twitter: 'Terry Wogan's commentary uncomfortably inappropriate for a BBC coverage of Margaret Thatcher's funeral that should be respectful today.' Mr Stayt, the presenter of BBC Breakfast, also came under fire for not wearing a black tie - unlike Adam Boulton, who was anchoring the Sky News coverage at the same time. Mourning: The scenes of Lady Thatcher's coffin being transported across London were missed by ITV . Presenters: ITV chose Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield to anchor their coverage, whereas the BBC went for the far more experienced David Dimbleby . Some web users also accused the BBC of being overly negative, focusing more on the possibility of unrest than the respectful mood felt by most bystanders. 'The BBC must be disappointed only finding two Anti-thatcher supporters on the streets of London this morning,' Stephen Woods tweeted. Jacqui Burke added: 'BBC reporters at Thatcher funeral sound so disappointed that they can't get anyone to say anything negative.' Others pointed out that the free-market stateswoman was not fan of the state-funded broadcaster. Robert Wilkin wrote: 'Watch the funeral on the BBC? You must be joking.

"Brave: Stephen has terminal cancer . There can't be many people who haven't heard about Stephen Sutton. I doubt it was ever his intention, but his handsome, young face, giving the thumbs up from his hospital bed, bidding the world a cheery farewell as he faced up to terminal cancer, has made him a global superstar. After sharing his story with the world on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, he has raised more than £3 million for the Teenage Cancer Trust thanks to the kindness of friends and strangers. Who could have failed to be delighted at the news he'd been sent home from hospital because he was feeling better and might have a few more months of life left after all? Not everyone, it would seem. I've seen some terrible things in my life, but nothing to compare with the response to his news from social media trolls. They have truly surpassed themselves in their vileness. 'How disappointing he hasn't actually died as he said he would,' said one on Twitter. 'It's a con.' Over on Facebook, the sneering and baiting continued: 'It feels like we're being conned. One minute he tweets he's dying and won't see the next day, then all of a sudden he's being released to go home.' How could anyone say such things about this poor boy? Stephen, now 19, has put a very brave face on it, telling them that  his bowel cancer, which first struck when he was just 15, is still terminal. But how must he have felt knowing there were people out there who would want him dead? I know from experience what a fragile knife edge you're on when you have cancer, whether terminal or not, and I have written extensively about my own diagnosis with breast cancer in 2006. I remember veering wildly between courage and optimism, depression and despair. I can't imagine Stephen being any different and am aghast that anyone could risk bursting the little bubble of hope his return home must have given him and his family. I made a vow a long time ago, never to ask: 'What is the world coming to?' It was an expression my mother used to show her displeasure at anything from short skirts to decimalisation, and it marked her out as a fuddy-duddy of the 'older generation', something I never wanted to be. Support: Prime Minister David Cameron and celebrities have rallied round the teen but he's also received vile abuse from trolls . But no other expression came to mind this week. What is the world coming to when a young man, dying of cancer, who’s inspired the entire country, can be targeted by repulsive individuals hiding behind the cloak of anonymity the internet provides? The world has come to the lowest point imaginable, where cruelty has become a competitive sport that thrives unchallenged on social media sites, where there are no measures to protect the weak and vulnerable. Stephen's experience makes me certain free speech is not always the right approach. We all, I guess, have the capacity for cruelty. We can all be bullies or jealous or react violently when provoked, but we generally control it. We’re taught that there are certain rules that must be obeyed or we’ll be shamed. It's what keeps society ticking over, so we bite our tongues or sit on our hands because we don't want people to know what we may be  capable of. And there's the crux: the world wide web continues to be a safe haven for online tribes who've discovered that you can get away with expressing all the horrid thoughts that you'd be too ashamed to say to anyone face to face. Speaking from experience: Jenni knows how mean trolls can be . It's not only the young who find their vulnerability exploited. My cancer was eight years ago, before social media exploded, and the response to my being open about it was generally empathetic from people who signed their letters and emails. But that hasn't been the case since Facebook and Twitter took hold. It's no secret that I'm overweight and I wear a scarf over one shoulder to cover up the slight imbalance in my chest area after my mastectomy. Even a tough old bat like me, who decided not to go through the extensive surgery of full reconstruction, can feel self-conscious that there's one breast remaining and a chicken fillet stuffed into my bra on the other side. I can't tell you how sick I am of being described by trolls as 'Jabba the Hutt with that stupid curtain over her shoulder.' Likewise, if I write about my experience in the hope of giving encouragement to others, it's pretty galling to get: 'There she goes - on about her bloody tits again' or worse: 'Shut up! Shame you didn't die, bitch!' I never spit back, telling myself such people are beneath contempt, but it still hurts. It's a game that does seem to have a uniquely British air about it; boost the ego of the ambitious on the way up - knock 'em on the way down. The world-class swimmer Rebecca Adlington, who should have enjoyed nothing but adulation after her Olympic triumphs, was told how ugly she looked by a number of wicked idiots who couldn't see the beautiful, powerful woman the rest of us saw. The brilliant classicist Professor Mary Beard merely appeared on Question Time and gave her opinions. The verbal online attacks on her were sexual, vulgar and frightening. Mary fought back, successfully closing down the website from which the comments had emerged. But it takes a lot of courage and confidence to take on people who are threatening to harm you. I like to think, as Stephen said, that 'on the whole, people are good; let's concentrate on that'. But I'm not sure he's right. The potential for nastiness is in us all and when an environment exists, such as the internet, that enables severe breaches of the moral code to go unpunished, it may, I fear, continue to be unleashed. Rebecca Adlington, left, has been reduced to tears by trolls slating her appearance while Mary Beard fought back when she received online abuse . A new low was plumbed last year following the death of leukaemia sufferer Amanda Slann, 17. She'd had a visit in hospital from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and appeared in the papers, which is perhaps why she attracted the envy of the trolls. When her parents set up a memorial Facebook page for their daughter, it was defaced by sick comments threatening to desecrate her grave. Her parents, unsurprisingly, have called for tougher laws to prevent such anonymous postings. Now, I'm not normally in favour of gagging, but in this instance I am with them all the way: shut down the cruel, pornographic sites which can only deaden humane sensibilities and work out a way of making sure the trolls are unable to hide behind anonymity. They're the ones who need to be named and shamed - not their innocent victims. I admire Stephen Sutton's response: 'Trolls and cynics exist. It's a shame, but just try not to retaliate too aggressively or get too riled.' I truly hope he is unaffected, but I think his analysis is wrong. I'm riled, and I think the Mary Beard response of fury and taking action is the correct one. Stephen's story has brought into stark focus the best and worst of humanity. There's the courage of a young man trying to make the best of what's left of his time on Earth and the heartless cowardice of those who seek to spread hate and destroy his peace of mind. It's essential we work hard to make sure it's Stephen who wins.","Teenager has terminal cancer .

"The Sanford, Florida police chief in charge of the investigation into the shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin resigned temporarily on Thursday. Bill Lee Jr., stood down as the outcry over the death of the 17-year-old, gunned down by a neighborhood watch captain as he went to buy candy, spread across the U.S.. It also emerged today that the police officer who first responded to the scene had been previously involved in another racially-charged investigation. The officer, Anthony Raimondo, was involved in an alleged police cover up of an incident in which the white son of a police lieutenant punched a black homeless man and was never arrested. Out: Police chief Bill Lee Jr resigned Thursday afternoon amid mounting pressure from the fumbling of the investigation into the shooting death of Trayvon Martin . Unarmed target: Trayvon Martin, 17 (pictured left) was killed by George Zimmerman, 28 (right) after the neighborhood watch captain pursued him as walked in a gated community in Florida . The resignation of Mr Lee was the first significant action in the . case. 'I'm aware that my role as the leader of this agency has become a distraction,' Mr Lee said. 'It is my hope the process would move swiftly and thoroughly through the justice system,' he continued. His announcement came just hours after the local city commission gave him a vote of no confidence. During . the Wednesday meeting, city commissioner Velma Williams said that . Sanford had long had racial tension and the death of Trayvon Martin is . hurting any chances of advancement. 'And now this. It's a national embarrassment,' said Ms Williams, who is the only black commissioner. No confidence: The Sanford city commission, including Velma Williams (right) voted that they had no confidence in police chief Bill Lee Jr. (left) and called for him to resign . The actions of the Sanford Police Department following the shooting of Trayvon Martin on February 26. Immediately after they responded to the scene, they took George Zimmerman back to police headquarters but while there, they did not test him for alcohol or drugs. Considering he is heard slurring his words on the 911 call, that was a particularly agregious move. Not only that, but playing into to thoughts of Mr Zimmerman, the police instead tested Trayvon's dead body for alcohol and drugs. He was clean. They allowed Mr Zimmerman to leave the police station without pressing any charges. And until the very recent press buzz about the case, they proceeded to do no further investigation after that fateful night. It has taken almost a month for anything to change in the case, which has upset Trayvon's family and their supporters. Ms Williams nearly fainted after the close vote, which ended up 3-2 against Mr Lee, because she was so emotional. The . two commissioners that supported Mr Lee- Patty Mahany and Randy Jones- . said that the police chief is essentially being given a trial in the . court of public opinion which is unfair. The case has . caught national attention and brought severe scrutiny to the practices . of the Sanford, Florida police department and their murky history of . dealing with cases involving racially-motivated crimes. In the case involving Justin . Collison, the police lieutenant's son, Mr Raimondo chose not to press . charges against the boy even though he broke the homeless man's nose. Mr . Raimondo was the one to release the teen from custody. There . was a video of the incident, and the police chose to cover it up. Only . after local news outlets found out about that cover up did they press . charges against the boy. Though . the police chief at the time resigned in the incident's wake, Mr . Raimondo was investigated and received a formal complaint. Including that incident, he has three validated complaints on his file, and another one pending. Past precedent: Police officer Anthony Raimondo- the same officer who responded to the Martin shooting- was allegedly involved in the cover-up of Justin Collison's (left) attack on Sherman Wade (right) in 2007 . Trayvon's parents held a brief press conference shortly after the news was announced saying that they were not satisfied. 'The . temporary step down of Bill Lee is nothing!' Tracy Martin said after . meeting with federal investigators to go over the details of the case. 'I'm aware that my role as the leader . of this agency has become a distraction. It is my hope the process . would move swiftly and thoroughly through the justice system.' -Police chief Bill Lee Jr. 'We want an arrest! We want a conviction for the murder of my son!' he said to crowds of supporters and fans while standing next to Reverend Al Sharpton. Trayvon's death was memorialized across the country on Wednesday and there was a massive march in New York in support of Martin's parents who want the shooter, George Zimmerman, arrested. Others are taking more pointed . action, and a black militia group have announced that they plan to . attempt a citizen's arrest on Mr Zimmerman. The New Black Liberation Militia said . that they hope to find him and bring him into the custody of federal . authorities because they feel that the Sanford police have not been . sufficient. Wanted man: Many, including the parents of slain Trayvon Martin, are demanding the arrest of George Zimmerman . Coming together: Thousands of protesters, some banding together from other causes, attended the Million Hoodie Rally in Manhattan's Union Square on Wednesday . The latest finding about the . involvement of Mr Raimondo in both the Collison incident and the latest . shooting will not reassure them at all. 'We'll find him,' militia leader Najee Muhammed told local WKFTV. 'We have his mugshot and everything.' This is exactly the kind of action that Trayvon's parents do not want. Mr Martin and Sybrina Fulton have appeared on numerous talk shows and news segments in an effort to publicize the February 26 shooting and put pressure on the police department to arrest Mr Zimmerman. While in New York to appear on the Today Show, the parents heard that a Million Hoodie March, named so in honor of Trayvon who was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt at the time of his death, and agreed to speak at the initial rally. Unexpected: Tracy Martin, pictured, said he and his son's mother found out about the march after arriving in New York City, where they have done interviews about the case . The teen's mother, Sybrina Fulton, told the crowd: 'My heart is in pain, but to see the support of all of you really makes a difference.' The demonstrators responded: 'God bless you!' The march started in Union Square and proceeded to splinter off, with some heading north to Times Square and others headed south to the Wall Street bull statue, much like the Occupy Wall Street protesters frequently did. 'We're not going to stop until we get justice,' said the teenager's father, Tracy Martin, after thanking the crowd that marched in Manhattan. 'My son did not deserve to die.' 'I don't feel this is the time to break down, even though it's a very troubling time in my life. 'I've told myself, when I get justice for Trayvon, then I'll have my time to break down.' The case is now being reviewed by the . Justice Department's civil rights division to address the tension in . Sanford. The FBI has also been sent to reopen the case. Scene: Martin was visiting his father and stepmother in Sanford where they live at The Retreat at Twin Lakes, pictured, when he went out to buy snacks for his younger brother . Florida is among 21 states with a ‘Stand Your Ground Law,’ which gives people wide latitude to use deadly force rather than retreat during a fight. The self-defense law helps explain why a neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman has not been arrested in the shooting death of an unarmed teenager. The Florida law lets police officers on the scene decide whether they believe the self-defense claim. In many cases, the officer's defer to making the arrest, letting the courts work out whether the deadly force is justified. In this case, however, police have said they are confident they did the right thing by not charging 28-year-old Zimmerman, a white Hispanic. Martin's family questions Zimmerman's story, and believes if their races were reversed, there is no doubt a black shooter would be jailed, even if he claimed self-defense. ‘They are making it look like Zimmerman is the victim and their son is in the grave,’ said Benjamin Crump, attorney for Martin's parents. ‘It's about equal justice.’ In a statement released Wednesday, Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee insisted his officers were ‘prohibited from making an arrest based on the facts and circumstances they had at the time,’ including physical evidence that supported Zimmerman's self-defense claim. ‘The Sanford Police Department has conducted a complete and fair investigation of this incident,’ Lee said, adding that it's now up to prosecutors to determine whether to bring charges. Late Wednesday, commissioners in Sanford, a city of 53,000 people outside Orlando that is 57 per cent white and 30 per cent black, voted 3-2 to express ‘no confidence’ in the police chief. -Associated Press .

"When Sir Alex Ferguson gave Angel Di Maria his man-of-the-match award at the end of last season’s Champions League final it was for 120 minutes of incredible football. But for the Argentine winger the real ‘game of his life’ had been played out in the previous 14 months amid the turmoil of a career under threat at Real Madrid and a baby daughter born three months premature. As emotional as the events of winning the club’s 10th European Cup in Lisbon were, nothing Di Maria achieves in football will rank alongside the story of his daughter Mia. Scroll down for video . Family values: Di Maria with his wife Jorgelina Cardoso and their daughter Mia, who was born prematurely . Winner: The Argentine had a sensational year for Real Madrid and helped them win the Champions League . A year before that extra-time run and assist for Gareth Bale to score the decisive goal in a 4-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, Di Maria’s wife Jorgelina Cardoso had suffered pregnancy complications and doctors had given the couple’s baby a 30 per cent chance of survival if the birth was not induced. Mia was born three months premature on April 22, 2013, the night before Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in a Champions League semi-final. Di Maria missed the game to be with his wife and the couple agonised for the next two months as their daughter stayed in intensive care before finally being allowed to go home. With Mia safe and sound Di Maria was able to turn his full attention back to playing football but Real Madrid had signed Bale in his place and he appeared to be facing up to a season on the bench. Dedicating his goal: Di Maria looks up to his family after scoring Argentina's winner against Switzerland . Angel's No 1 fan: Baby Mia wears an Argentina top with 'Papa 7' on the back in tribute to her famous father . ‘My daughter taught me that everything that appears to be really difficult can end up being easy if you put the effort in and wait for the rewards,’ he said. ‘She transmitted so much energy to me and it helped me to have the spectacular year that I had.’ Di Maria was the top goal provider in the Spanish league last season with 22 assists, he scored in the Copa del Rey triumph over Barcelona and outplayed everyone in Lisbon as Real lifted the Champions League trophy. Former Real manager Jose Mourinho had requested his signing four years earlier, with his agent Jorge Mendes helping to bring the wiry winger to the Spanish capital after two years in Portugal with Benfica. The transfer fee was big at £20million but the wages were low and the fact that they never increased as his value to the side grew remains the main reason why he is now a Manchester United player. La Decima: Di Maria was named man-of-the-match in the Champions League final against Atletico Madrid . Showboat: Di Maria enjoys performing 'rabona' crosses, where he flicks one leg behind the other . Real boss Carlo Ancelotti said this week that ‘the club did everything it could to keep him’, but that is not the case. He also said after Real lost the Super Cup to Atletico without 26-year-old Di Maria: ‘We didn’t need him today.’ Ancelotti was told in the summer that James Rodriguez would be arriving and that Di Maria would be the sacrifice. The coach’s long career working for Silvio Berlusconi at AC Milan means he is well-schooled in the art of accepting every command that drops down from on high, no matter how ill-advised. Real’s reluctance to put Di Maria on anything like pay parity with Bale and new signing Rodriguez owes much to image. Madrid’s business model is built on footballer pin-ups. Di Maria does not fit the poster-boy brigade. Nicknamed El Fideo (the noodle) for that long streaky physique, he is more hall of mirrors than hall of fame but there is an admirable durability to both his character and his constitution. Before he accepted the man-of-the-match award in Lisbon last May from former United manager Ferguson he had other important business to attend to. On the final whistle he went looking for his father Miguel and when they found each other pitchside it was a case of a dad hugging the son who had just lived his dream for him. Unstoppable: Atletico Madrid right-back Juanfran tries to stop Di Maria during the Super Cup on August 19 . Familiar foe: The 26-year-old is set to complete a move to Manchester United for £59.7million from Real Madrid . Angel’s father had made it to River Plate’s first team as a player but had his progress cut short by a knee injury that would not be career-ending today. He quit football and took a job delivering coal in Rosario, regularly taking Angel along to help him and occasionally — when his delivery route allowed — stopping off to see his son train at Rosario Central, the club that signed him when he was only seven. Angel made it to those training sessions thanks to the commitment of his mother Diana, who used to take the boy on her bicycle. Each trip was a 50-minute test of endurance with Angel on the back of the bike and his three-year-old sister on the handlebars. Stamina runs in the family. Daughter Mia celebrated her first birthday last April and the Di Marias invited all the parents and babies who had 12 months earlier shared the agony of the incubator unit of Madrid’s Monteprincipe Hospital. All the babies born prematurely with Mia had, like her, survived. A part of Di Maria will always remain in Madrid because of the medical staff that gave Mia the round-the-clock care she needed to pull through. It will also not be easy to swap the No 22 for the No 7 at Old Trafford, no matter what the historic significance of the latter — 22 is, after all, the number he picked out when he arrived at Madrid in 2010 and ended up being the date of birth of his little girl. Is he worth £59.7m? No, and United should not have to pay that. They are the only club bidding. PSG can’t buy him because of Financial Fair Play restrictions and Manchester City turned down the chance to buy him this summer for the same reason. It will be interesting to see if the clubs agree on the price paid. Real said Gareth Bale  cost around €90m and Spurs insisted it was €100m. The sale of Di Maria is hugely unpopular, so Real president Florentino Perez needs the highest price possible. Where will he play? The most logical position for Di Maria in Louis van Gaal’s 3-5-2 is in the midfield five just inside the left wing back. Last season he played on the left of the midfield three at Real Madrid and had his best season at the club. He can cover the runs of the left wing back and makes runs to the left to get round the back of teams. His versatility is one of his best qualities. In a 3-5-2 he could play left wing back; he could play left or right in a 4-4-2; and in a 4-3-3, in the midfield three or front three. Jose Mourinho even had him down as an emergency left back. Is he a worthy No 7? Xabi Alonso tweeted: ‘Thanks for everything. I wish you all the best, even if you are going to United. We will never forget the zig-zag in extra time in Lisbon.’ Tired legs everywhere and Di Maria as fresh as if it were the 10th minute, not the 110th, hurtling down the left and crossing to Bale for the Champions League-winning goal. If he produces moments like that for United he will be more than worthy. Why are real selling? The same reason they sold Arjen Robben in 2009. The desire for new stars must be financed, in part, by sales. Three Champions League finals later, nobody can say Bayern were wrong to sign Robben.","The versatile midfielder was one of Real Madrid's stars last season and was named man-of-the-match in the Champions League final win over Atletico .

"China yesterday sounded the alarm over ‘worrying’ developments in the eurozone and called on debt-ridden countries to put their finances in order. Speaking after meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel in  Beijing, Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao voiced concerns over the future of Greece, Spain and Italy and the effects that the eurozone’s problems are inflicting on the rest of the global economy. The turmoil in the single currency bloc has dented demand for Chinese exports and dragged the country into its worst downturn in three years. In the strongest comments yet from Beijing, Mr Wen said: ‘Recently, the European debt crisis has continued to worsen, giving rise to serious concerns in the international community. Fears: Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, right, expressed his alarm at Europe's debt problems after meeting today with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, left . Trip: Merkel is in Beijing for talks aimed at boosting trade and allaying Chinese fears about Europe's heavy government debts . ‘The main worries are two-fold. First . is whether Greece will leave the eurozone. The second is whether Italy . and Spain will take comprehensive rescue measures. ‘Resolving these two problems rests with whether Greece, Spain and Italy and other countries have the determination to reform.’ The criticism from China is a major . embarrassment for eurozone leaders as they struggle to get to grips with . the financial crisis. It also underlined the damage the euro debt storm . is doing to the global economy. Europe’s downturn has battered China’s . exporters, wiping out thousands of manufacturing jobs. Exports to Italy . in July plunged 26 per cent from a year earlier, while those to Germany . were down 6.5 per cent. Exports to France fell 8 per cent. Chinese President Hu Jintao, who met . the German leader later in the day, said: ‘The sooner Europe gets out of . its straits, the more helpful it will be for the global recovery and . stability and China’s economic development.’ 'The European debt crisis has continued to worsen, giving rise to serious concerns in the international community. Frankly speaking, I am also worried,' Wen told reporters after the meeting. He cited uncertainty over whether Greece leaves the eurozone and whether Italy and Spain take 'comprehensive rescue measures,' a reference to budget cuts and tax increases to balance their budgets. Talks: Merkel, left, listens during her joint press conference with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, right, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing . 'Resolving these two problems rests . with whether Greece, Spain, Italy and other countries have the . determination for reform,' the premier said. 'Resolving the European . debt problem requires fiscal tightening and finding balance within . individual economies.' Wen's comments were unusually pointed for China, which says governments should not interfere in each other's affairs. But . the country's leaders are increasingly worried about the safety of . their European debt holdings and European economies where Chinese . companies are expanding. Wen said Beijing was willing to buy European bonds so long as it could evaluate the risks and to help the European Union, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank - the so-called troika - support indebted eurozone countries 'in overcoming hardships'. Wen made a similar pledge of possibly Chinese aid to Europe during Merkel's last visit to Beijing in February. Merkel told reporters that while the crisis is not over, countries such as Italy and Greece were 'on an intensive road of reforms. I am convinced that this will bear fruit.' Greek politicians agreed this week on an austerity package demanded by creditors but were negotiating details. Inspectors from the troika are due in Athens next month for a review on which hinges a rescue loan installment of (euro) 31 billion. 'I want Greece to remain part of the eurozone,' Merkel said. 'I have at the same time indicated that credibility is very important in the eurozone. Therefore we expect the program to be implemented.' Ahead of Merkel's visit, German officials told reporters Berlin wanted to reassure Beijing that European debt is a 'safe and good investment'. United: The pair shake hands following the joint press conference . Later, Wen and Merkel presided at a signing ceremony for billions of dollars in business deals - a regular event during visits by European leaders. Airbus Industries committed to invest $1.6 billion in the second phase of an aircraft final assembly plant opened in 2008 in Tianjin, Wen's hometown. A Chinese state company signed an agreement to purchase 50 Airbus jetliners valued at $3.5 billion. Volkswagen AG, Europe's biggest automaker, signed a deal to invest $219 million in an 'environmentally friendly production facility' and vocational training initiative, also in Tianjin. Officials of the two governments also signed agreements to collaborate in biotechnology, electric vehicles, agriculture, education, labor and the environment. The next round in a regular series of Chinese-German meetings was scheduled for next year, but German officials say Wen asked Merkel to come early before the Communist Party begins a once-a-decade handover of power to younger leaders in October. Merkel's two-day visit includes meetings with Xi Jinping, who is due to become party leader and president, and Li Keqiang, in line to become premier. It comes as Beijing is struggling to pull China out of its deepest economic slump since the 2008 global crisis. The government has cut interest rates twice and is pumping money into the economy with a wave of investments by state companies. Worries: The Chinese Premier cited uncertainty over whether Greece leaves the eurozone as a cause of concern. A view of the Acropolis in Athens is pictured . A Cabinet official said Wednesday that official measures are starting to take effect and growth was 'stabilising at a slow pace.' But corporate profits are down and a survey of manufacturers released last week showed future export orders have fallen. Germany is China's biggest European trading partner and one of the few developed economies with which it runs a trade deficit, due to large imports of German factory equipment and industrial components. Beijing reported a $16.3 billion trade deficit with Germany last year and $13 billion for the first seven months of this year. Europe's downturn has battered China's exporters, wiping out thousands of manufacturing jobs. Exports to Italy in July plunged 26 per cent from a year earlier, while those to even relatively strong Germany were down 6.5 per cent. Exports to France fell 8 per cent. The trade slump, coupled with weak consumer demand in China, has raised the threat of unrest as the party tries to enforce calm ahead of its leadership transition. Investment: Wen and Merkel also presided at a signing ceremony for billions of dollars in business deals with Airbus Industries committing to invest $1.6 billion in the second phase of an aircraft final assembly plant in Tianjin . Merkel was accompanied by a 20-member delegation of executives from German companies in the auto, chemicals, energy, commodities and other industries. The visit also comes amid tension over a request by European manufacturers of solar power equipment for anti-dumping duties on Chinese products they say are improperly subsidised. Chinese manufacturers that depend on the European market have warned Beijing might retaliate. The visit focuses mostly on economic issues, but a senior German official told reporters he expects an 'open discussion' with Chinese leaders on Syria, which is in the throes of a civil war that has left an estimated 20,000 people dead. Russia and China have repeatedly used their veto power in the U.N. Security Council to block strong Western- and Arab-backed action against President Bashar Assad's regime that could have led to sanctions. Germany hopes a Security Council agreement on humanitarian issues could help provide a basis for a stronger agreement on political questions, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Today, Merkel and Wen planned to travel to Tianjin, east of Beijing, to visit the Airbus plant.","Wen Jiabao expressed his .

"Iaroslav Semenenko of Ukraine won the first heat of the men's swimming despite not having any arms . The Paralympic Games got underway today and within one of the first events proved why it is going to be a display of 'superhuman' abilities. Iaroslav Semenenko, a swimmer from Ukraine, powered to the finish of the first heat of the men's 100m backstroke, well ahead of the other competitors despite not having any arms. The 25-year-old Paralympian used just his legs to propel himself along the pool and completed the swim more than two seconds ahead of second place swimmer Sebastian Iwanow from Germany. His achievement came before Great Britain's first Paralympic medal, a silver won by Mark Colbourne this afternoon, in the C1-2-3 one-kilometre time-trial. At the end of his race, Semenenko swam at full speed into the wall, banging his head on the edge of the pool to hit the timer. Elsewhere, cyclist Mark Colbourne today bagged Paralympics GB’s first medal of the Games - just three years after breaking his back in a horrific paragliding accident. His breathtaking performance in the velodrome was cheered on by thousands of fans, who watched him get silver in the men’s individual 1km Time Trial. The achievement marks an incredible turnaround, after he was forced into an emergency landing when his paragliding wing collapsed in 2009. Colbourne, a former professional Welsh volleyball player, broke his back in the fall and underwent five months of gruelling physiotherapy just to learn to walk again. Mark Lee Colbourne of Great Britain celebrates alongside physio Kirstin Henderson as he moves in to silver medal position in the Men's Individual C1-2-3 1km Cycling Time Trial . His silver medal is all the more impressive as he only took up the sport three years ago. Britain didn't have to wait too long for gold. Cyclist Sarah Storey landed the top . spot on the podium, winning the C5 individual pursuit.  She had earlier . broken the world record in the event in front of the Duke and Duchess of . Cambridge at the Velodrome. And she was followed by 20-year-old swimmer Jonathan Fox, who lived up to his world record holder status, triumphing in the S7 100 metres backstroke race. Gold: Team GB's Jonathan Fox celebrates with his 100m backstroke medal . Podium finish: Nyree Kindred won silver in the 100m backstroke . In the women's swimming heat, Lu Dong . completed her swim with a huge roar from the crowd which lifted the roof . off the Aquatics Centre at the Olympic Park in Stratford following her . performance. She also . briefly held Paralympic Record with her time of 1.28.18, but in the . second heat Nyree Kindred, 31, gave Britain hope for gold when she beat . Dong, setting a personal record with 1.27.96. But the Chinese swimmer stormed to gold in the final, setting a new world record - forcing Kindred to settle for silver. This afternoon two British competitors qualified for the men's 50m S5 freestyle event. Anthony Stephens qualified with a time of 35.59 seconds while Andrew Mullen completed the race in 37.4 seconds. Uncertainty . surrounded the start of the women's competition at the Aquatics Centre with double . world record holder Victoria Arlen set to learn if she can participate . in the London 2012 Paralympic Games after initially being found to be . 'non-eligible' for competition by the International Paralympic . Committee. The IPC had received evidence . compelling them on Tuesday to assess Arlen, who holds world records for . S6 100metres and 400m freestyle, and found she was ineligible for . competition. Scroll down to see a video of Semenenko swimming . Semenenko beat his nearest rival by two seconds and came to a halt by crashing his head into the wall . Semenenko is helped into the pool ahead of the men's 100m Backstroke S6 heat . Anthony Stephens qualified in the men's 50m S5 freestyle with a time of 35.59 seconds . The U.S. appealed and the 17-year-old is now set to be reclassified on today's opening day of the swimming programme. It . is a situation that could affect teenager Ellie Simmonds who is in the . same S6 classification as the American with the Briton the defending . champion over 100m and 400m freestyle. An IPC spokesman said: 'She was . reclassified on Monday and found non-eligible; she did not meet the . eligibility criteria for her chosen sport. She must be reclassified . tomorrow morning.' Arlen, a . former junior state champion, returned to swimming last year after a . neurological virus called Transverse Myelitis affected her spinal cord . in 2006 and left her in a vegetative state for two years, and set the . world records at the US trials in June. Simmonds had last week earmarked Arlen as one who presented a very real threat to the defence of her titles. Dong Lu of China swam three seconds ahead of her fellow competitors in the 100m backstroke and got into the final . Nyree Kindred beat Dong's Paralympic record time in the second heat of the 100m Backstroke . Simmonds was just 13 when she was flung into the public eye after her tears on the podium in Beijing following her two gold medal-winning performances. Since then the Walsall-born athlete has won European and world titles and earlier this year made history when she became the first swimmer to break a world record at the Aquatics Centre when she set a new mark in the SM6 200m individual medley in March. Simmonds said: 'I have learned not to . put pressure on myself - not to target (medals) - I am just going to go . out and swim the best possible I can because you never know what you . are going to wake up to.' Britain's Ellie Simmonds had said that Victoria Arlen was her main rival in the Paralympics . Amy Marren was born a little over two miles from the Olympic Park in Newham and she credits Simmonds as her inspiration. Competing in the S9 category, Marren - who turned 14 on August 14 - said: 'I got into Paralympic swimming when I watched Ellie win her double gold in Beijing. 'I thought I would really love to do something like that when I get older. I haven't told her to her face (about being inspired by her). I still get starstruck around her.'

"The police have finally released the 911 calls made in relation to the killing of an unarmed black teenager who was shot by a white neighborhood watch captain. George Zimmerman, 28, had called 911 to report a suspicious man and can be heard pursuing Trayvon Martin, 17, on foot against the dispatcher's advice causing the teen to run away. Moments later the police are bombarded with calls from terrified neighbors as a voice in the background can be heard desperately screaming for help before the sound of two gun shots.

He is on drugs or something,' Zimmerman told the dispatcher from his SUV. He added that the black teen had his hand in his waistband and was walking around looking at homes. 'These a-------. They always get away,' Zimmerman said on a 911 call. During Zimmerman's initial call, he . told the dispatcher he was following Martin and the dispatcher told him, . 'You don't need to do that.' But Zimmerman sounds as if he continues to pursue the teen saying: 'He ran.' Scroll down for video . By the time police officers arrived, unarmed Trayvon, who had been carrying Skittles and soda, was dead on the ground from a single gunshot . He then refuses to meet police . officers at an agreed location and asks for them to call him on arrival . instead so he can tell them where he is. Sanford police officials, who have not charged Zimmerman after accepting his claim that his actions were in self defense, finally released eight 911 calls on Friday after mounting pressure. Martin's family had demanded the release of the calls to help better understand how Martin died while walking home from a convenience store last month. 'He was yelling for help, and no one could help him. He saw his life being taken away from him,'  the teen's father Tracy Martin said. He said they will continue pushing for charges to be filed against Zimmerman. 'We’re hoping this doesn’t happen again to another family, and that America opens their eyes ... even though this won’t bring Trayvon back, we don’t want there to be another Trayvon,'  Mr Martin said. Scroll down for video . The teenager's parents; mother Sabrina Fulton, right, and father Tracy Martin, left, are said to be devastated after hearing the 911 calls of their son's last moments . Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Martin's family, said that the 911 calls show that the teenager spent the last few moments of his life terrified and Zimmerman should be charged . After listening to recordings of 911 calls, Martin's family said they're more convinced than ever that the Zimmerman should be charged with a crime. 'You hear a shot, a clear shot, then you hear a 17-year-old boy begging for his life,' said Natalie Jackson, the family attorney. 'Then you hear a second shot.' The case has been turned over to the State Attorney's Office which can decide whether to file charges or present evidence to a grand jury. Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is also representing the family, told reporters outside Sanford City Hall that Martin's parents both broke down and cried as they listened to the recordings. 'They are completely devastated, and they are in unbelievable grief,' Crump said. 'The last seconds of his life were in absolute fear.' Scroll down for video . Martin was visiting his father and stepmother in Sanford where they live at The Retreat at Twin Lakes, pictured, when he popped out to buy snacks for his younger brother . He added that a third witness has come forward saying it was the boy who was crying for help. Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, previously sued to have the recordings released. A hearing for the case had been scheduled for Monday. Moments after Zimmerman's initial call, dispatchers were bombarded by seven 911 calls from frantic neighbors describing a fight between two men, screaming and then a gunshot. 'There is somebody screaming outside,' one female caller said, as an unknown male voice can be heard crying in the background. Then a shot is heard. A male caller described a physical altercation between Martin and the shooter. 'I just heard a shot right behind my house,' The caller said. 'They're wrestling right behind my porch. The guy is yelling 'Help.' I'm not going outside.' Another woman said a man in a 'white top' was on top Trayvon. Earlier on Friday, Martin's parents called on the FBI to take over the investigation, saying they no longer trusted the Sanford police department. Sanford police Sgt. David Morgenstern said the department stands by its investigation but welcomes help from any outside agency. FBI agent David Couvertier said the agency has been in contact with Sanford police and is monitoring the case. 'We are committed to having somebody review this to see if we made a mistake,' said Sanford Mayor Jeff Triplett. 'If we made missteps and there is something there, we will act accordingly' Trayvon's family believe Zimmerman should be charged and brought to justice for shooting their young son . Several Sanford residents who spoke to The Associated Press said they think there would have been an arrest already if the shooter had been black and the deceased had been white. They said blacks and whites in this city of 53,000 residents were pretty much in agreement that an injustice had been done with no one arrested, and that there was no racial divide in how the case is being perceived. The city is 57 percent white and 30 percent black. Zimmerman's father delivered a letter to the Orlando Sentinel on Thursday, saying the way his son is being depicted in the media is cruel and misleading. He also says his son has received death threats and moved out of his home. George Zimmerman is Hispanic and grew up in a multiracial family, the statement says.

"Paul Ryan is due formally to accept the vice-presidential nomination in a high-stakes speech to the Republican and tell voters that ‘after four years of getting the run-around [under President Barack Obama], America needs a turnaround, and the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney’. According to prepared excerpts, the Wisconsin congressman will say: ‘I accept the calling of my generation to give our children the America that was given to us, with opportunity for the young and security for the old – and I know that we are ready. Our nominee is sure ready. His whole life has prepared him for this moment – to meet serious challenges in a serious way, without excuses and idle words.’ The selection of Ryan, 42, a staunch fiscal conservative who advocates tackling America’s national debt crisis head on, including by reforming entitlement programmes like Medicare, has energised Romney’s candidacy and put the state of Wisconsin into play. Pointers: Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan was seen practicing on stage earlier Wednesday in preparation for his prime-time address at 10pm this evening . Family friendly: Ryan was joined onstage by his children (left-right) Sam, Liza and Charlie. In excerpts of the speech that were released hours before the live event, he quotes his father's words of wisdom . Even if he does not win the vice-presidency in November, Ryan – 23 years younger than Romney - is viewed as a star of the next political generation – much as Barack Obama was when he spoke at the 2004 Democratic convention. In what promises to be a poignant moment, Ryan will recall his father, who died of a heart attack when the future congressman was just 16, saying: ‘My Dad used to say to me, “Son. You have a choice: You can be part of the problem, or you can be part of the solution”. ‘The present administration has made its choices.  And Mitt Romney and I have made ours: Before the math and the momentum overwhelm us all, we are going to solve this nation’s economic problems. And I’m going to level with you: We don’t have that much time.  But if we are serious, and smart, and we lead, we can do this.’ Ryan will also take Obama to task for his health care reform, pushed through in 2010 without a single Republican vote. ‘Obamacare comes to more than two thousand pages of rules, mandates, taxes, fees, and fines that have no place in a free country,’ he is due to say. ‘The president has declared that the debate over government-controlled health care is over.  That will come as news to the millions of Americans who will elect Mitt Romney so we can repeal Obamacare…We have a plan for a stronger middle class, with the goal of generating 12 million new jobs over the next four years.’ He is also planning to say that this election will be decisive and a stark contrast is on offer between Obama and Vice President Joe Biden and the Romney-Ryan ticket. Big night: Paul Ryan and his wife Janna appear on stage at the Wisconsin delegation's Beers and Brats event on Wednesday . ‘The right that makes all the difference now is the right to choose our own leaders. You are entitled to the clearest possible choice because the time for choosing is drawing near.  So here is our pledge. We will not duck the tough issues – we will lead. ‘We will not spend four years blaming others – we will take responsibility. We will not try to replace our founding principles, we will reapply our founding principles. The work ahead will be hard.  These times demand the best of us – all of us, but we can do this.  Together, we can do this.’ Ahead of his high-profile speech that . cements his place as Mitt Romney's running mate and introduces him to . the nation, the congressman spent most of the day with his children, . keeping his mind elsewhere. The Midwesterner made a quick visit to the . cavernous hall and then to a celebration of Wisconsin's beer and brats. Asked . by reporters this afternoon about his speech, the typically chatty . congressman played coy as he tinkered with the height of the podium and . got used to the echo from the microphones while his three children . practiced waving to the crowd. 'You'll find out tonight,' Ryan said. 'Why would I spoil it now?' Family man: Paul Ryan takes his wife Jenna and their children Sam and Liza to a soundcheck during the third day of the Republican National Convention in Tampa . He . and his wife then headed to the Wisconsin delegation's Beers and Brats . event, where he tried to downplay the significance of the speech just a . few hours away to the thousands in the hall and the millions watching on . television. 'I've got to give this speech later on today so I'm going to keep it brief and save my voice,' he said. Ryan said he and Romney would outline their plans for the country in the coming weeks, starting with his own speech. 'We're going to give the country a very clear choice that they deserve,' Ryan said. Ryan is expected to talk about his Irish immigrant ancestors and small-town values, offering a personal presentation of a lawmaker largely known for sober policy analysis. He will also praise Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, and criticize President Barack Obama. The speech will likely be heavy on personality and light on policy, the latest example of Ryan deferring to Romney's preferences. As Ryan puts it, Romney is 'the boss.' Checking it out: Charlie (left), Liza (center) and Sam (right) all soaked up the spotlight during the rehearsal . That message was underscored in . Ryan's preparations. Wearing a blazer and open-collar shirt, he asked to . be shown where Romney will be seated, conscious that he would speak in . front of the man he hopes will be his future partner. Ryan . and his team, a mix of longtime aides and new advisers, have spent a . chunk of the past few weeks writing - and re-writing - the speech. Drafts have been emailed from his campaign plane and his kitchen table . in Janesville, to speechwriters in Tampa and top Romney advisers at the . Boston campaign headquarters. Early versions were scrapped and adjusted to include bits of Ryan's natural, easygoing speaking style. In between campaign events and daily workouts, Ryan has been working to put his own voice into the drafts. He is an experienced speechwriter, having served in that capacity for 1996 vice presidential nominee Jack Kemp and former Education Secretary William Bennett. But at campaign events, Ryan has tended to favor policy over his personal story. From Ohio to Virginia to Florida, he talks more often about the nation's debt and deficit than his own life as a congressional aide who became a congressman at age 28. The 42-year-old is more comfortable citing Congressional Budget Office statistics than real people. Romney's aides want that to change. Advisers are pushing Ryan toward more personal territory. Pulling the heartstrings: The hope among Romney's team is that the nation gets to know Ryan's story, one they say working-class voters could relate to . The hope among Romney's team is that the nation gets to know Ryan's story, one they say working-class voters could relate to. Left unsaid is that Ryan's policy positions, specifically his contentious budget proposals, have caused headaches for Romney and dominated the storyline of the campaign since he was introduced as the running mate. Ryan planned to talk Wednesday not just about Romney's promises to repair the economy and what they contend are Obama's failures to do so, but also about his own upbringing. A message of self-reliance is set for a prominent role in the speech. Ryan previewed his message earlier this week at the high school he attended two decades ago. He spoke of his ancestors' journey in the 1850s from Ireland to Wisconsin. Aides sought to lower expectations and cautioned against expecting a blockbuster speech like the one delivered by 2008 vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin. Instead, Ryan is likely to paint himself as a reasonable governing partner for Romney.","Portions of vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan's speech were released Wednesday afternoon in preparation for his primetime speech this evening .

"A grieving mother has branded Facebook ‘heartless’ after it stopped her logging into her dead daughter’s page. When Louise Palmer’s 19-year-old daughter died from a brain tumour, she was devastated. But at her lowest points, she found comfort by logging into Becky's Facebook page and reading her old messages. However, four weeks ago Mrs Palmer discovered the log in details had been changed. And when she challenged Facebook they told her she could no longer login – due to fears it could invade Becky’s privacy. Louise Palmer, left, discovered the login details to her daughter Becky's, right, Facebook page had been changed and was told she could not login due to fears it could invade her privacy . Last night the 47 year old nurse said: 'I can't believe Facebook can be so heartless and inconsiderate. The loss of my only child has been heartbreaking. But at least in my darkest hours I could login to her Facebook account and read her messages remembering her as the vibrant girl she used to be. 'Becky had no privacy from me - we shared absolutely everything.  Towards the end of her life she couldn't write or read more than a few sentences so I used to log in for her and read out to her what her friends were up to. But also I fail to see how anyone can invade the privacy of a dead person.' Mrs Palmer, a divorcee, began logging into her daughter's account after she fell ill with a seizure on New Year’s Day 2010. Mrs Palmer, a divorcee, began logging into her daughter's (the pair are pictured together) account after she fell ill with a seizure on New Year's Day 2010 . Since Becky's (pictured) death in December 2010, Mrs Palmer, from Kingswinford, West Midlands, continued to login to remove spam comments from the page . Tragically tests revealed a brain tumour and although her daughter underwent surgery and chemotherapy within six months she had lost her speech and was unable to write or read more than a few words. 'For the last four months of Becky’s life I used to log into her Facebook account for her,' says her mother, who was always a friend with her daughter on Facebook, 'she loved me to read out messages from all her friends.' Since her death in December 2010, Mrs Palmer, from Kingswinford, West Midlands, continued to login to remove spam comments from the page. Mrs Palmer says Facebook is 'heartless' and 'inconsiderate'. She said her and her daughter shared everything . 'I also gained a lot of comfort from reading all her old messages and conversations with friends before she got ill. When I was feeling desperately low, just logging into her page made me feel so much better. I could hear her voice through those conversations and remember how bubbly Becky was when she was alive. In its official guidelines Facebook . says when a user passes away it is their policy to memorialize all . user's accounts to protect their privacy. Memorializing an account . automatically gives privacy settings which means only confirmed friends . can see the profile or locate it in a search. Family and friends can . still leave posts in remembrance but memorializing an account prevents . anyone from logging into it. Facebook requests that if someone is deceased then this information is reported to them by friends or family. Verified next of kin can submit a . special request for a deceased user's account to be deleted. In this . case Facebook will require the family member to provide documentation . such as a death certificate. 'At the same time I would sometimes change her profile photo and remove any spam that had been posted on her wall to keep her page tidy.' However at the end of January Mrs Palmer went to log into the page as usual to find the log in details had been changed with a strange message that the page had been ‘memorialized’. At the same time the page was made only visible to confirmed Facebook friends. She says: 'I felt there must be some mistake as a request for something such as this could only come from the next of kin and I hadn’t asked for it.' However, when she contacted Facebook they replied in an email: ‘unfortunately for privacy reasons, we cannot make changes to the profile or provide login information for the account.' She says: 'I was angry and devastated as although people can post on the Wall, I can’t read any of her old conversations nor remove any spam. It means her page looks like an uncared for grave with weeds growing on it. 'People who did not have a Facebook account or who weren’t friends on Facebook can now no longer even see the page even though they might want to leave a message of condolence on the Wall.' A Facebook group has now been set up by 1500 protesters asking for the page to be reinstated as it was. Mrs Palmer said: 'Many are bereaved parents who’ve also had their child’s page ‘memorialized’ and like me they are incredibly upset. Others are desperately worried the same thing could happen to their loved-one’s Facebook page. 'We just want Facebook to show some compassion.' A Facebook spokesman said: 'When an account is memorialised then certain profile sections and features are hidden from view to protect the privacy of the deceased. 'For example, recent statuses are removed, groups the person has joined are hidden, and the person’s privacy settings are changed to ""Only Friends"" so that only his/her Friends can see the Profile. 'Facebook’s policy is not to provide login information for an account to anyone but the account owner to protect their privacy. 'This means that when we receive a report that a user is deceased we memorialize the account, which restricts profile and search privacy to friends only, but leaves the profile up so that friends and family can leave posts in remembrance. 'However, we do honor requests from close family members to deactivate the account, which removes the profile and associated information from the site.'","Facebook told Louise Palmer she couldn't login due to fears it could invade her daughter's privacy .

"A Michigan man who has witnessed his scrotum balloon to 100lbs over the past decade due to a rare condition may soon be able to have sex with his wife for the first time in years thanks to a life-changing surgery. Dan Maurer, from Battle Creek, suffers from scrotal lymphedema - an ailment that has caused one of his testicles to become abnormally large. The 39-year-old husband said his condition has affected his relationship with his wife of 20 years, Mindy. Scroll down for video . Massive problem: Dan Maurer, 39, suffers from a rare condition called scrotal lymphedema, which caused his scrotum to become unusually large and weigh 120lbs. He has now undergone successful surgery to remove the growth . The couple reportedly have not been intimate in seven years due to Dan's illness. Two months ago, the tale of Maurer's struggle went viral after a series of stories appeared online documenting the man's efforts to raise money for a costly and dangerous surgery to remove the growth on his scrotum. The publicity allowed the 39-year-old Michigan man to raise close to $30,000 towards the operation, which was performed Thursday in California. 'With any surgery, there’s a chance of something going wrong. So, there is fear. Then, there’s the excitement of changing my life forever,' Maurer told The Detroit Free Press on the eve of the procedure. Hours before the operation, Maurer took to his GoFundMe page to post an update about the upcoming operation. 'My Surgery is in 2 hours. So this might be my last post. I love you all and I can not thank you enough for your support in all of this,' he wrote. Nervous and excited: Maurer said before the surgery that he was looking forward to having sex with his wife, Mindy (left), for the first time in seven years . 'My wife is everything to me and to get a second chance to give her then man she deserves means a lot to me. I will post as soon as I can if andwhen I wake up.' Speaking to New York Daily News before going under the knife, Mr Maurer reiterated that he was anxious, but that the risk was well worth it. 'With the surgery, my life is on the line and losing my penis is on the line,' he said. The Michigan resident added that he was excited about the prospect of having sex with his wife for the first time in seven years. Beside marital relations, Maurer is also looking forward to doing more traveling and riding a jet ski. Maurer, originally from Kalamazoo, first noticed that something was wrong with his anatomy when he was in his 20s. Maurer's scrotum started getting bigger, but when he sought medical help, doctors informed him that he has to lose weight. ‘I was doing two miles a day in the pool, so I lost 50lbs like that,’ said Dan. But even as he was shedding the extra pounds, his scrotum continued expanding, eventually ballooning to the size of a large cantaloupe. ‘The bigger it gets it seems to me like the faster it grows. When he stands it almost hangs to his ankles,’ his mother, Connie Maurer, told My Fox Detroit. Dan Maurer again consulted with physicians but got the same response as before: he must lose more weight. 'Misdiagnosed': Maurer first noticed that something was amiss with his body in his 20s, but doctors told him he just needed to lose weight . Setback: Maurer was able to shed 50lbs through daily exercise, but his scrotum continued growing . ‘As far as they were concerned, I had to have lap-band surgery to lose weight,’ Dan told the station KSDK. Maurer eventually fell ill and had to be hospitalized with what turned out to be a broken cyst inside his oversize scrotum. Then one day, Dan Maurer came across the TLC reality show The Man With The 132 Pound Scrotum about the plight of Wesley Warren Jr. At that moment, Maurer knew what was wrong with him. Scrotal lymphedema is a disease that is caused by blockage of the lymphatic vessels in which tissue builds up outside of the testicles, resulting in swelling. Maurer then discovered that his only hope was Dr Joel Gelman, a California-based urologist who operated on Wesley Warren in April 2013 to remove his outsized growth. Realisation: Mr Maurer discovered was was wrong with him when he watched TLC's reality show The Man With The 132 Pound Scrotum about Wesley Warren Jr (pictured) Last hope: Dr Joel Gelman (left), who also treated Wesley Warren, has agreed to operate on Dan Maurer (right), but the $20,000 surgery is not covered by his insurance . Warren passed away in March of this year at age 49. It is believed that he died from complications with diabetes. Gelman has agreed to perform the dangerous operation to remove Maurer's massive growth, but the urologist is not in the patient's medical network and the procedure is not covered by his insurance. In the case of Wesley Warren, Dr Gelman agreed to treat him free of charge. Dan Maurer has launched a campaign on the site GoFundMe.com to raise $20,000 toward the surgery. As of Thursday afternoon, people have donated over $27,200.","Dan Maurer, 39, from Michigan, suffers from rare condition called scrotal lymphedema .

"The circus surrounding Julian Assange’s extradition descended even further into farce yesterday as George Galloway waded into the row. The Respect MP claimed Assange should not be facing a rape charge in Sweden as he was accused only of ‘bad sexual etiquette’. In a lengthy diatribe on his video podcast, Good Night with George Galloway, the MP for Bradford West said he did not believe the two women who had accused Assange of rape and sexual assault. Scroll down to watch . Bad manners: Respect MP George Galloway said Assange should not face a rape charge in Sweden as he was only accused of 'bad sexual etiquette' on his video podcast Good Night with George Galloway . Not rape: Galloway backed Assange against rape allegations made by two Swedish women as the Wikileaks founder spoke on the balcony of Ecuador's London embassy on Sunday . He added: ‘Even taken at its worst, . if the allegations made by these two women were true, 100 per cent true, . and even if a camera in the room captured them, they don’t constitute . rape. ‘At least . not rape as anyone with any sense can possibly recognise it. And . somebody has to say this.’ In their Supreme Court ruling, Britain’s most . senior judges said the accusations made against the WikiLeaks founder . in the European arrest warrant amounted to rape. One of his accusers, a WikiLeaks . supporter, admits she had consensual sex with Assange in August 2010 but . woke the following morning to find he was having sex with her again, . without using a condom. Mr . Galloway said this could not be rape, as the pair had already had sex . and were ‘already in the sex game’. He went on: ‘It might be really bad . manners not to have tapped her on the shoulder and said, “Do you mind if . I do it again?”. ‘It might be really sordid and bad . sexual etiquette, but whatever else it is, it is not rape or you . bankrupt the term rape of all meaning.’ 'Already in the sex game': Galloway said that the way Assange treated one of his accusers, who had consensual sex before allegedly raping her, 'might be really bad manners' Supported Iraqi dictator: Galloway, left, was filmed praising the 'strength, courage and indefatigability' of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, right, who was later convicted of war crimes and executed . Last night, another supporter of Assange provoked anger by appearing to name one of the alleged  victims on BBC2’s Newsnight. Craig Murray, 53, former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, said the name twice during a debate claiming it was in general circulation, sparking a rebuke from host Gavin Esler. Mr Murray said: ‘It’s well worth people going online to discover what they can about the allegations… who made them, what the people who made them did afterwards, and look at what happened.’ Mr Esler told him: ‘You should not be naming a potential rape victim.’ Assange denies all the allegations against him but claims he cannot return to Stockholm to defend himself at trial because of fears Sweden would extradite him to the U.S. VIDEO: George Galloway made comment on his Molucca Red blog.

"David Cameron has echoed the US in warning President Bashar Assad that the use of chemical weapons would be ‘completely unacceptable’. The Prime Minister said following a phone call with Barack Obama that Britain would be forced to ‘revisit’ its approach to Syria if these weapons were deployed. Downing Street said the two leaders agreed there was ‘much more to do’ to stop the killing of thousands of civilians in Syria. Scroll down for video . Agreement: Prime Minister David Cameron and US . President Barack Obama have said the use of chemical weapons in Syria or . even a threat to deploy them would be 'completely unacceptable' Threat: Syrian President Bashar Assad is said to be in control of a sizeable stockpile of chemical weapons . Mr Cameron’s comments are the clearest suggestion yet that the UK might contemplate military intervention if chemical weapons were used by the Assad regime. The Prime Minister also discussed the situation with French president Francois Hollande and the two agreed to ‘work more closely to identify how they could bolster the opposition and help a potential transitional Syrian government after the inevitable fall of Assad’. Earlier this week, Mr Obama warned any movement of Syria’s stockpile of chemical weapons would be a ‘red line’. The President said he had ‘at this point not ordered military engagement’. But he added: ‘There would be enormous consequences if we start seeing movement on the chemical weapons front or the use of chemical weapons.’ Syria holds the world’s fourth-largest stockpile of such weapons. Deploying and using them would exacerbate a refugee influx to neighbouring countries including Turkey, which has already received more than 70,000 Syrians. Western leaders also fear the armaments could fall into the wrong hands. Last month, a Syrian foreign ministry spokesman insisted they would never be deployed inside the country. Chinese state media have accused Mr Obama of planning to use Syria’s chemical arsenal as an excuse for military intervention. Meanwhile, Russia yesterday insisted it had guarantees from Syria that it will not use or move the weapons. Both countries have repeatedly blocked attempts to impose tougher UN sanctions on Syria. But a Downing Street spokesman said Mr Cameron and Mr Obama had ‘agreed that the use – or threat – of chemical weapons was completely unacceptable and would force them to revisit their approach so far’. A spokesman added: ‘The Prime Minister restated the risk to the wider region posed by the fighting and the fact that regional and international co-operation was vital.’ The leaders also ‘firmly agreed there was much more to do in order to help put Syria on a path towards peace and stability’. Fierce fighting raged in Damascus yesterday, with regime forces shelling several areas of the southern city before tanks continued the assault. The northern city of Aleppo saw battles in which Amnesty International warned civilians were enduring a ‘horrific violence.’ At least 41 were reported dead in the bombardment of Damascus over the past 24 hours. Human rights groups say more than 20,000 people have been killed since the uprising against Assad’s regime began in March last year. Free Syrian Army fighters exchange fire with regime forces in the city of Aleppo. Mr Cameron has agreed with French President Francois Hollande to work to identify how they could bolster the opposition . On Tuesday the United Nations claimed Iran appears to be supplying Assad's regime with funds, weapons and intelligence support. Syrian rebels also say Tehran has sent Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah fighters to assist government forces. 'The . Secretary-General has repeatedly expressed his concern about the arms . flows to the two parties in Syria, which in some cases appear to violate . resolution 1747 passed by this council banning arms exports under . Chapter 7 authority,' U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman told . the U.N. Security Council. Next week, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will attend a summit meeting of leaders of non-aligned developing nations in Iran. He will also meet with senior Iranian officials to discuss 'Iran's nuclear program, terrorism, human rights and the crisis in Syria,' his spokesman said. A U.N. Security Council panel of independent experts that monitors sanctions against Iran has uncovered several examples of Iran transferring arms to Syria's government. Damascus has accused Qatar and Saudi Arabia of arming rebels determined to topple Assad's government. The United Nations has said more than 18,000 people have died and some 170,000 people have fled the country as a result of the fighting in Syria. U.N. aid chief Valerie Amos has said that up to 2.5 million people in Syria needed aid. 'This conflict has taken on a particularly brutal and violent character,' Amos told a news conference in New York on Wednesday after visiting Syria and Lebanon last week. 'We face problems with access to people in need, particularly where there is intense and ongoing fighting, but funding is also holding us back. If we had more resources, we could reach more people,' she said.","Two leaders say there is 'much more to do' to stop brutal killing of civilians .

Nutritionist Dr Joanna McMillan speaks to Daily Mail Australia about her top three tips on how to cparty with the best of them while destroying all of your good work you done throughout the year. One of the first things Dr Joanna noticed when moving from the U.K. to Australia 15 years ago was that Australian have a prolonged period of time over the Christmas break. 'People always come to me in the new year and say 'I feel rubbish"",' she said. 'It's worse here because it's not just that couple of weeks because there's the lead up to Christmas and then lots of people go on holiday in January.' 'There is that saying it doesn't matter what you do between Christmas and new year but what you do between new year and Christmas that counts.' Dr Joanna McMillan (centre) speaks to Daily Mail Australia about how you can party with the best of them while destroying all of your good work you done throughout the year . 'Spending time with family and friends is absolutely a key part of your health and happiness,' Dr Joanna says . Enjoy yourself during the festive season . There is no need to become anti social to avoid putting on weight during the holiday break. 'I'm always most concerned when people talk to me about actually being scared to go to social functions because they feel like can't trust themselves around the food and drink side of it and that is not healthy,' Dr Joanna said. 'Enjoy the Christmas season and the parties and being social and spending time with family and friends is absolutely a key part of your health and happiness.' 'You don't have to be a goody two-shoes and get it all right i mean goodness I'm in this job and I get it wrong too sometimes,' she said. 'It's about being human but just think about the choices you are making from a lifestyle, dietary and health perspective - you can't let it all go and not think about your health.'

Between napping on the sofa, sitting in the beer garden and laying on the beach - get your body moving. 'It might be a half hour walk or a yoga class - or maybe gardening for a couple of hours just doing something that keeps you moving and breaks up our sedentary time in the day which is really important,' Dr Joanna said. 'If you're an office worker - get up every hour and go to speak to a colleague rather than phoning or emailing.' The 'all or nothing' attitude is never going to be a winner. 'I also think its a good idea for people who exercise hard to take a bit of break but it's going from eating well and exercising regularly to doing nothing that isn't good,' she said. 'Do different exercise maybe go for long walks - in summer its lovely to get out early morning or early evening and getting outdoors.' 'When you are out of routine with more food and drink around you don't get to gym as much and do your usual exercise you can start the year with an extra couple of kilos and feeling a bit run down.' Don't turn up hungry to functions so you can control how many canapes you grab off the platter . Be consciously aware of what you are eating . Dr Joanna advises to keep hold of the reins while allowing you to enjoy social situations . 'Exercise conscious control over what you are eating - be mindful about the way you are eating,' she said. 'If you are at a party and there are canapes don't take one from every plate that walks past give it a little bit more thought - think about ""am I really hungry?"".' 'Don't go to the party ravenously hungry so you devour anything that's there,' she said. 'Be cognitive about what you are eating and when to stop eating because I think those situations at parties is when people fall short they don't realise how many plates they have had from the buffet.' 'It's this unconscious eating where you are not really enjoying it.'

"Town halls have launched an astonishing 9,600 spying missions on the public in the past three years. The surveillance operations exploit anti-terror laws but many are targeting minor offences such as flouting the smoking ban, dog fouling and dropping litter. Council officers have also gone undercover to carry out ‘test purchases’ at local escort agencies, it was revealed last night. Snoopers: Town halls have launched an astonishing 9,600 spying missions on the public in the past three years . In other cases, tactics included . obtaining phone records and trapping householders putting out rubbish . early by using motion-activated cameras on lampposts and inside tin . cans. Families suspected of cheating school catchment area rules have been followed by council ‘spies’. Civil liberties campaigners said was clear the hugely controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act was being abused. They urged the Coalition to stop merely ‘tinkering’ with the ‘broken’ law – passed ostensibly to fight terrorist fanatics – and subject it to an overhaul. In a painstaking report, which took months to compile from Freedom of Information Act requests, the Big Brother Watch group discovered 345 councils had been authorised to use RIPA 9,607 times since 2009 – the equivalent of around nine spying missions a day. Some 26 local authorities have used RIPA to spy on dog owners to see whose animals were responsible for dog fouling. A further seven have used their powers to investigate suspected breaches of the smoking ban. Suffolk County Council conducted a ‘test purchase of dating agency services’. Bin cam: Tactics include trapping householders putting out rubbish early by using motion-activated cameras on lampposts and inside tin cans . Many councils are targeting minor offences such as flouting the smoking ban, dog fouling and dropping litter . Stockton Borough Council mounted an . operation to check on the ‘proper movement of pigs’ and to investigate a . ‘fraudulent escort agency’. No action was taken. Northumberland mounted three spying operations on a ‘tarmac resurfacing service’. No action was taken. BBW said Kent was the worst authority in the country for RIPA investigations, with 315 in three years. Alarmingly, seven public authorities . refused under the Freedom of Information Act to disclose why or how . often they have used the powers. They included the BBC and Ofsted. The spies are called ‘covert human . intelligence sources’. In many cases they will be council employees, . such as dog wardens or trading standards officials, but school children . are sometimes recruited to test for the sale of underage alcohol or . cigarettes. Eric Pickles, the communities secretary, admitted councils had been misusing RIPA. Stockton Borough Council mounted an operation to investigate a 'fraudulent escort agency'. No action was taken . He said: ‘Under Labour, councils . seriously abused and over-used such snooping powers – for matters as . trivial as spying on garden centres for selling pot plants; snooping on . staff for using work showers or monitoring shops for unlicensed . parrots.’ Mr Pickles said the Coalition had . changed the law so that, from November, town halls will require the . permission of a magistrate before they can launch snooping missions. But campaigners and experts – . including the Government’s own watchdog – have questioned how much . difference the change will make. BBW director Nick Pickles said: ‘The . current law is broken and before further surveillance powers are . considered we need to fix the situation. ‘Despite nearly ten thousand . investigations in three years, most resulted in no action being taken, . reinforcing the need for a comprehensive review.’ He wants the public to . have a right to know they have been spied upon.

Interception of Communications Commissioner, said in his annual report: . ‘I still remain unconvinced that the Government’s proposal to require . all local authorities to obtain the approval of a magistrate before they . can use these powers will have much impact other than to introduce . unnecessary bureaucracy into the process.’ However, Mehboob Khan, of the Local . Government Association, said that without snooping powers it would be . harder for councils to tackle rogue traders. The BBW report also laid bare the extent to which scores of other public bodies and quangos are spying on the public. Job Centre Plus made use of RIPA . 34,093 times between 2009 and 2012. On almost 18,000 occasions, people . were put under surveillance to see if they were living as a couple. Women are entitled to receive more state handouts if they are classed as living as a single mothers. The BBC refuses to reveal the tactics it uses to catch licence-fee evaders . A string of public bodies including the BBC have refused to disclose how often they have used the spying powers. The lack of transparency was yesterday described as ‘unacceptable’ by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. Hundreds of state bodies are entitled to use the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which was introduced by the last Labour government. Normally, they reveal under the Freedom of Information Act how many surveillance operations they have carried out and why. But the BBC, Ofsted, Royal Mail, the UK Border Agency, the Prison Service, Office of Fair Trading and UK Trade and Investment all refused requests from the Big Brother Watch campaign group. They claimed ‘disclosure would, or would be likely to, prejudice a range of law enforcement functions and activities’. In the BBC’s case, this is likely to involve operations to catch licence-fee evaders. Unlike town halls, under a change in the law later this year, public bodies will continue to be allowed to snoop without approval from a magistrate. Mr Pickles said: ‘For public bodies, funded by and working for the taxpayer, to be using RIPA yet so vociferously trying to avoid accountability is simply unacceptable. From the BBC to Ofsted, the Royal Mail to UK Trade and Investment, public bodies should be transparent about why there are using these powers. ‘It is important that the public can have faith that surveillance powers are being used only in those situations where serious crimes are taking place and when there are no less intrusive alternative routes of investigation.’ A TV Licensing spokesman said the BBC used RIPA only to detect licence evaders ‘as a last resort’, adding: ‘The reason we do not release more details on how and when it is used is to ensure people without a valid TV licence don’t use this information to their advantage.’","Surveillance operations exploiting controversial anti-terror laws .

"A supporter of Julian Assange sparked anger last night by appearing to name one of the alleged victims on BBC2's Newsnight. Craig Murray, 53, former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, said the name twice during a debate claiming it was in general circulation, sparking a rebuke from host Gavin Essler. Mr Murray said: 'I think incidents which are dubious themselves as to what has happened, and Julian Assange has denied the accusations against him, are being seized on as a political agenda. Former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan Craig Murray (left) revealed the name of Julian Assange's alleged sex attack victim on Newsnight last night . 'It's well worth people going online . to discover what they can about the allegations, about how they were . made, who made them, what the people who made them did afterwards, and . look at what happened. 'Let us look at the conduct of these women. I'm going to say some things I know to be true.' Mr Esser told him: 'You should not be . naming a potential rape victim. People can look at it on the internet, . but please do not name a rape victim on television, thank you. 'If you want to make a point, then make a point, and do it anonymously.' The father-of-three is married to . Nadira Alieva, whom he left his wife of 20 years for after meeting her . at a lap dancing club in Uzbekistan in 2003. Not rape: Galloway backed Assange against rape allegations made by two Swedish women as the Wikileaks founder spoke on the balcony of Ecuador's London embassy on Sunday . Bad manners: Respect MP George Galloway said Assange should not face a rape charge in Sweden as he was only accused of 'bad sexual etiquette' on his video podcast Good Night with George Galloway . Mr Murray's diplomatic career ended . when he was sacked by the Foreign Office in 2004 after blowing the . whistle on state-sponsored brutality in Uzbekistan. Louise Mensch, ‏outgoing MP for Corby . and East Northamptonshire, said on Twitter: 'You can tell a lot about a . man by his supporters. #Assange has #Galloway and #CraigMurray. Nice . #feminism.' Another viewer added: 'Craig Murray could not be behaving more inappropriately here. Absolutely staggering.' 'Already in the sex game': Galloway said that the way Assange treated one of his accusers, who had consensual sex before allegedly raping her, 'might be really bad manners' Supported Iraqi dictator: Galloway, left, was filmed praising the 'strength, courage and indefatigability' of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, right, who was later convicted of war crimes and executed . The circus surrounding Assange’s . extradition had descended even further into farce yesterday as George . Galloway waded into the row. The Respect MP claimed Assange should not be facing a rape charge in Sweden as he was accused only of ‘bad sexual etiquette’. In . a lengthy diatribe on his video podcast, Good Night with George . Galloway, the MP for Bradford West said he did not believe the two women . who had accused Assange of rape and sexual assault. He added: ‘Even taken at its worst, . if the allegations made by these two women were true, 100 per cent true, . and even if a camera in the room captured them, they don’t constitute . rape. ‘At least . not rape as anyone with any sense can possibly recognise it. And . somebody has to say this.’ In their Supreme Court ruling, Britain’s most . senior judges said the accusations made against the WikiLeaks founder . in the European arrest warrant amounted to rape. One of his accusers, a WikiLeaks . supporter, admits she had consensual sex with Assange in August 2010 but . woke the following morning to find he was having sex with her again, . without using a condom. Mr . Galloway said this could not be rape, as the pair had already had sex . and were ‘already in the sex game’. He went on: ‘It might be really bad . manners not to have tapped her on the shoulder and said, “Do you mind if . I do it again?”. ‘It might be really sordid and bad . sexual etiquette, but whatever else it is, it is not rape or you . bankrupt the term rape of all meaning.’ Assange . denies all the allegations against him but claims he cannot return to . Stockholm to defend himself at trial because of fears Sweden would . extradite him to the U.S. Supporters of fugitive sex suspect Julian Assange have launched cyber attacks on Government websites. The hacking group Anonymous sent codes designed to clog up the Ministry of Justice, 10 Downing Street, the Home Office and the Department of Work and Pensions websites. One automated programme allowed users to automatically bombard the Prime Minister's official website with 1,000 service requests per second - launching the programme with a 'Fire!!!' button. The software assaults - known as denial of service attacks - were announced on Twitter by hackers using the phrase 'Tango Down'. Graham Cluley, a security expert at anti-computer virus firm Sophos, said: 'The attacks clog up the websites and make them difficult to use - imagine 15 fat men trying to get through a revolving door. 'These attacks have been used by Anonymous before and they may still be doing this now ready to launch another attack. 'It is one of the easiest ones they can do, which is why they do it.' Most sites were not vulnerable to the attacks and seemed to be working normally this morning, but the MOJ admitted it had been affected by the hacktivists' assaults. It would be 'suicide for Great Britain' if authorities tried to enter Ecuador's embassy to reach Julian Assange, the country's president said. Rafael Correa said that if the British authorities forced their way into the London site to arrest the WikiLeaks founder, then other people should be able to gain access to British embassies in foreign countries. Mr Assange, who is wanted in Sweden for questioning on sexual assault allegations, has been seeking refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for two months, sparking a diplomatic row between the South American country and the UK. Speaking on state television, Mr Correa said such a course of action would be 'suicide for Great Britain because then people could enter their diplomatic premises all around the world and they wouldn't be able to say a thing'. He added: 'While the United Kingdom hasn't retracted nor apologised, the danger still exists. 'Remember that David beat Goliath. And with many Davids it's easier to bring down a number of Goliaths. 'So we're hoping for clear and coherent backing because this violates all inter-American law, all international law, the Vienna Convention and all diplomatic traditions of the last, at least, 300 years on a global scale.'

"John Travolta is facing the fourth claim of sexual harassment against him in the space of a week after a former male massage therapist at the Peninsula Hotel claimed the 'Pulp Fiction' star was banned for lewd conduct . A masseur at the posh Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan has claimed that John Travolta was blacklisted for three years from the hotel's spa for inappropriate behaviour. Former Peninsula masseur Michael Caputo said that Travolta always asked for a man for his massage at the hotel's famous rooftop spa and was barred after several creepy-run ins. Caputo, 55, said that male staffers complained that the 'Pulp Fiction' star would grind against the massage table, remove the towel and lift his butt in the air during his therapy. 'Travolta would always request a man for his massage, but after a while no one would take him because of his inappropriate behavior,' said Caputo. 'It got to the point where they couldn’t find any men to take him, and they had to ban him,' explained the masseur known as Magic Mike, who said he worked at the Peninsula from 1992-2008. The ban lasted for three years and happened around a decade ago according to Caputo, who now works from his Queens, New York home offering massages for $100 an hour. 'If he was banned, do you think he’d ever go back?” said Travolta’s attorney, Marty Singer, dismissing the allegation as complete nonsense — noting that his client was at the hotel’s famous rooftop spa as recently as six months ago. 'He’s never been banned, I guarantee you. . . . The hotel never told John he was banned, and John never acted improperly,' according to the New York Daily News. This new allegation comes as Travolta faced a slight reprieve in the increasingly murky sexual assault allegations against him. Mike Caputo served as a masseur at the Peninsula Hotel's spa in New York from 1992 to 2008 and claimed that John Travolta was banned for three years for his lewd conduct . The Peninsula New York: Where John Travolta was allegedly banned according to a masseur who said he worked there from 1992 to 2008 . The first masseur, dubbed John Doe #1, who accused the Hollywood star of inappropriate behaviour towards him has been dropped by his attorney. Okorie Okorocha has apparently had second thoughts about representing the man who now claims he was mistaken about the date of the alleged attack. He called the date mix up a 'miscalculation' and still insists the assault allegedly happened a few days prior. The Texan had claimed that Travolta made sexual advances towards him on January 16 2012 and could prove the Grease star was in Los Angeles at the time. But the A-list star's attorney Marty Singer has produced photographs and a restaurant bill to show that Travolta was in New York at the time and strongly denies the lurid allegations. 'Okorocha did not feel he could represent John Doe #1 going forward anymore and recommend him finding another lawyer,' a source told RadarOnline. 'He is still representing John Doe #2 and other alleged victims who are possibly coming forward.' Meanwhile, Travolta was hit by fresh sexual harassment claims earlier this week after another man came forward. Fabian Zanzi has accused Travolta of accosting him back in 2009 while he was working on the Royal Caribbean cruise ship. Chilean-born Zanzi was an employee on the liner at the time and was in charge of VIP guests. New claims: Now Fabian Zanzi claims actor John Travolta accosted back in 2009 while he was working on the Royal Caribbean cruise ship . Going public: Zanzi is the fourth man to come . forward making sexual assault claims against the actor (right) Zanzi - the first of the alleged three victims to be publicly named - told South American news website ABC.es that Travolta approached him and offered him $12,000 to have sex with him. He told the website he refused the Pulp Fiction actor's advances. Zanzi recalled: 'He . had something on his neck. I thought it was a fuzz. As I approached, he . took off his white coat and was naked. 'He hugged me and asked me to do a . massage.' New . York dining: A receipt from a meal the Pulp Fiction actor ate at Mr. Chow restaurant in New York on the same day has also emerged . Reports suggest Zanzi has filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Travolta - although this has yet to be verified. The news comes following claims from . two unidentified masseurs alleging Travolta sexually assaulted them. They are suing for $2m in damages. Travolta's lawyer, Marty Singer has strenuously denied the two initial claims and is yet to comment on the latest allegations. The . first two masseurs to come forward have been named as John Doe #1 and . John Doe #2 in U.S. lawsuits. Both are being represented by lawyer . Okorie Okorocha and claim the Grease actor made sexually advances . towards them. Yesterday . Travolta's camp put forward photographic evidence which appeared to . provide Travolta with an alibi with regard to claims by John Doe #1, who . alleges he was assaulted by the actor on January 16 of this year at a Beverly Hills hotel in Los Angeles. Travolta's lawyers, however, claim the actor was in New York City on that date - releasing a restaurant receipt from the Mr. Chow restaurant in NYC and two photographs of the actor as evidence. It is claimed by TMZ.com that . two photos show him first at 4:30pm and then again at 5:21pm, at a . fitting for his upcoming movie Killing Season in the Big Apple. In a new development today, the New York Daily News . reports flight records prove Travolta landed in Westchester, New York, . hours before sunrise on the day John Doe #1 claims the alleged sexual . harassment took place in Los Angeles. It supports the actor's alibi he was 3,000 miles away from the scene of the alleged groping. In . another bizarre twist the unidentified masseur has released a statement . wishing Travolta 'health and happiness' - despite pressing ahead with . the lawsuit. In a statement to RadarOnline he said: 'Even though Mr Travolta and his counsel . are on opposing sides in this matter, I do wish them good health, . happiness, and want them to be judged with absolute fairness as our . great nation affords all citizens regardless of their wealth or . station.' Lawsuit: . Travolta, pictured with wife Kelly Preston, is facing accusations of . inappropriate sexual behaviour towards at least three men . Yesterday a second man filed filed a lawsuit claiming the actor tried to grab his . penis during a massage session on January 28 in Atlanta. RadarOnline . claims to know the hotel where the alleged incident took place and has . spoken to a member of staff there who says employees have been warned . they will be fired if they speak to the media. Okorocha, the lawyer representing the first two alleged victims - claims there are over 100 other men prepared to . come forward with similar stories about the Hairspray star. He told . RadarOnline.com: 'By the time this case is over Marty Singer [Travolta's lawyer] will have to . accuse more than 100 men of lying because I have been contacted by people, . mostly men, that have first hand information about similar behaviour on John . Travolta's part to that contained in the lawsuits. Second accuser: Court papers were amended when the second masseur claimed sexual battery by the star . 'I have already filed against him.

"David Cameron will fly home from holiday this week into a political firestorm, with Tory MPs launching fresh rebellions on three fronts. MPs are in open revolt over soaring rail fares, demanding the Treasury acts to soften the blow for hard pressed commuters. Backbenchers are also threatening to block plans to kickstart the economy by letting developers build on greenbelt land and permanently extending Sunday trading hours. Facing a firestorm: David Cameron is being attacked on three fronts as he prepares to return from his holiday this week . Tories fear all three issues will undermine support in marginal constituencies and torpedo hopes of a Tory majority at the next election. It emerged last week that most rail fares will rise in January by 6.2 per cent – 3 per cent above inflation – and some routes by up to 11 per cent. MPs representing constituencies in the Kent and Essex commuter belts want Chancellor George Osborne to repeat last year’s help, when the Treasury capped rises at 1 per cent above inflation. Sir John Stanley, who represents Tonbridge and Malling, accused ministers of ‘exploiting commuters’ and using rail fares as ‘a disguised form of taxation’ since the extra 2 per cent goes straight into the Treasury’s coffers. Open revolt: Tory MPs including Priti Patel, right, and even Tory deputy chairman Michael Fallon, left, are demanding the Treasury acts to soften the blow of rising rail fares . Witham MP Priti Patel called on ministers to ‘do more’ to get a better deal for travellers. ‘Our commuters are paying a lot of money to commute to work and they’re getting a poor deal,’ she said. Even Tory deputy chairman Michael Fallon, a close ally of Mr Cameron, has called for rail operators to show restraint. Robert Halfon, MP for Harlow, has written to Transport Secretary Justine Greening – who has also called on the Treasury to help – demanding action. He said: ‘It is a simple cost-of-living issue.’ Tracey Crouch, MP for Chatham and Aylesford, said: ‘Household living standards are already squeezed and people who have to commute are feeling very aggrieved.’ Miss Crouch has also joined the backlash against plans to rethink planning laws. Fare rise: It emerged that most rail fares will rise in January by at least 6.2 per cent, with some routes increasing by 11 per cent . Senior ministers have discussed proposals to build on the green belt to help boost housebuilding and major infrastructure projects. But those proposals contravene a promise in the Tory Party’s last election manifesto and are opposed by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. Miss Crouch said: ‘It would be quite wrong for the Coalition to take away the green belt from the next generation.’ Fellow Tory Chris Skidmore, who has campaigned to protect the green belt in his Kingswood constituency, said: ‘We have a duty of trust to protect greenbelt land for future generations.’ Mr Cameron is also under fire from MPs, . unions, supermarkets and the Church over the suggestion that extended . Sunday opening hours, put in place for the Olympics, will be extended . permanently. Downing Street and Mr Pickles have vowed to study whether the change – which extends maximum opening hours for big stores from six to eight hours on a Sunday – has helped boost the economy. Sainsbury’s chief executive Justin King yesterday said the usual restrictions were ‘a great British compromise’ and that ‘relaxing Sunday trading laws is certainly not a magic answer to economic regeneration’. Extended permanently: Cameron is also under fire from supermarkets, unions and the Church over suggestions that extended Sunday opening hours for the Olympics be continued . He was backed by Bishop of Oxford the Right Reverend John Pritchard, the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers and the Association of Convenience Stores, who signed a letter describing a permanent relaxation as ‘alarming’. A No 10 source said: ‘We will look at the impact but no one has decided to do anything.’ On rail fares he said: ‘We are aware this is a big cost of living issue but it is incredibly expensive to do what we did last year. Long-term we are committed to the principle that the rail system should be paid for primarily by rail users rather than taxpayers.’","David Cameron flies home from holiday this week .

"One of the brightest young managers in English football isn’t sure how many GCSEs he’s got, except to say ‘not many’. But when it comes to learning on the job, Karl Robinson has acquired enough to fill a few textbooks. ‘I’ll need them for this game,’ he told Sportsmail. Manchester United are in town, a brand that Robinson compares to Coca Cola up against one a touch smaller and more maligned. A manager of great achievements and arrogance is going up against a man 30 years his junior, who tends to think like someone a little older. ‘One thing that gets me is players wearing headphones when they come off the coach,’ Robinson said. ‘I’ve stopped that here. Total football: MK Dons boss Karl Robinson is looking forward to pitting his wits against Louis van Gaal . Relaxed:  Robinson talks candidly to Sportsmail's Riath Al-Samarrai at Stadium MK ahead of Tuesday's game . ‘I find it disrespectful. If a man worked hard all week, bought a ticket and comes to watch us with his kid, you show them respect. Look at them and say “hello”, sign an autograph. That’ll make a kid’s day and then his dad is happy too. ‘I can sound like a 40 or 50-year-old man, but things like that mean a lot to me.’ In fact, Robinson is 33, possibly one of the oldest 33 year olds in football. In the years since his playing days ended as a teenager with an injured back, he has crammed a fair bit in, from coaching at Steve Heighway’s Liverpool’s academy, to working under Paul Ince and Sam Allardyce. He is victim to pranks from Robbie Fowler, calls in Ian Wright occasionally for striker sessions – ‘I need top players beside me because I can’t talk to a player about the Premier League because I didn’t do it’ – and in all has managed more than 200 games. This is his biggest opponent, though, and the latest chance to learn something. ‘Believe me, I’d love to have a chat to Louis van Gaal,’ he said. ‘I love Dutch football. After a game on a Saturday I love to jump on the Eurostar. I’ll go to Belgium, France, Holland. 'I’ll go to watch Excelsior, Brugges, Lille, anything. It’s a chance to take in another culture, another system, a way of doing things. Van the man: Robinson spoke of his love for Dutch football and the influence it has had at MK Dons . Football addict: The 33-year-old said he tries to experience different styles of football whenever he can and often jumps on the Eurostar to watch teams like Lille and Excelsior after MK Dons have played on a Saturday . Dutch master: Louis van Gaal's Manchester United side have failed to impress in their first games of season . ‘Look at what Van Gaal did at Ajax. I’m enthralled by how Dutch clubs have a connection through the age groups. ‘Here, I have a numerical system. All MK Dons No 8s through the age range will look the same, all No 6s will drop into the same places. They do that in Holland, at Ajax. It is very Dutch. ‘I’d very much hope to get a chance to talk to Louis van Gaal. People say Manchester United are vulnerable. Come on, it’s Manchester United. ‘But we are going to give our best. Steve Heighway used to tell me that failure is not trying. He helped give me standards and those standards run through this club.’ Eyes on the prize: Robinson's team on the other hand, have won four of their first five games this campaign . Leading by example: MK Dons captain Dean Lewington will relish the chance to test himself against United . Beyond Robinson’s father, who made his Liverpool-supporting son clap off Arsenal after they won the 1989 title on the final day at Anfield, Heighway was his first major mentor. ‘It’s ridiculous that Steve has not been utilised more in the game,’ he said. ‘I remember him doing a crossing session at Liverpool. He was stood out wide and getting the players to pass to him. A kid rolled him the ball and he smashed it back. “This is Liverpool, I was an international and so are the rest of the team you’ll be playing with. Do it properly”. ‘The kid was about 12. Steve got messages into people, including me. I have been so lucky to learn from the people I have. I went from Liverpool to here to coach with Paul Ince. He would park his car and race me to the building. ‘His self-drive was incredible. He made me want to be better every day. We went to Blackburn and I can tell you no-one knows more than Paul about players – in my phone he is “Gaffer”. It’s mad that Paul is not working. ‘When he left Blackburn and Sam Allardyce came in, I remember thinking I’d be going too. I was on the M62 and the phone rings, withheld number. Here we go. ‘I heard, “Karl, it’s Sam. It went on for 15 minutes. I am answering in my poshest Scouse voice. Then he started laughing. It was Robbie Fowler. ‘I put the phone down, 15 minutes later it goes again. “Karl, it’s Sam”. I can't tell you what I said. But it was Sam and he wanted me to stay. I learnt from him every day as well. No-one would do a better job of keeping you in the Premier League. He’s in my phone as Sam Algaffer.’ Ready to do battle: Robinson stands by the pitch at Stadium mk ahead of Tuesday night's Capital One Cup game . Expecting more: Van Gaal will want an improved performance from his United side against MK Dons . After reuniting with Ince at MK Dons, he was appointed manager in 2010, aged 29. He’s done well, twice delivering play-off places and a cup run every year. His thoughts have been sought by Gareth Southgate at the FA and his success is slowly helping the image of the club. ‘I have always operated with an understanding of the cloud we are under,’ he said. ‘I made a point of learning it all - I know the club’s history.’ Whatever happens in Tuesday night's test against Van Gaal, he has already made a pleasant addition.","The 33-year-old told Sportsmail he loves Dutch football and often jumps on the Eurostar to watch matches in Holland and France after MK Dons games .

"A couple who refused to let a gay couple share a bedroom at their seaside guest house have won permission to take their case to the Supreme Court. Court of Appeal judges earlier this year dismissed a challenge brought by the couple who run a guest house in Cornwall, against a ruling that they breached equality legislation when they turned away a gay couple. The appeal court had upheld the January 2011 verdict of Judge Andrew Rutherford at Bristol County Court that Peter and Hazelmary Bull, who run Chymorvah House in Marazion, Cornwall, had directly discriminated against the couple, who were awarded a total of £3,600 damages. Peter and Hazelmary Bull from Marazion, Cornwall, run Chymorvah House (pictured) Peter and Hazelmary Bull (pictured left) refused to let Martyn Hall and his civil partner Steven Preddy (pictured right) share a double room in the hotel that they run. The case is to be heard by the Supreme Court . The Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, has now decided to hear the Bull’s case. Mr Bull, 72, and Mrs Bull, who is in her late 60s, are Christians who regard any sex outside marriage as a ‘sin’. Consequently, they would not let Martyn Hall and his civil partner Steven Preddy share a double-bedded room. The Bulls denied that they had discriminated against the couple, arguing that their policy of only allowing married couples to sleep in a double bed, in accordance with their religious beliefs, was applied to everyone, regardless of sexual orientation. They said they had also prevented unmarried heterosexual couples from sharing double rooms since they opened 25 years ago. In February this year, Sir Andrew Morritt, Chancellor of the High Court, sitting with Lord Justice Hooper and Lady Justice Rafferty, dismissed the case and said the restriction was ‘absolute’ when it came to homosexuals but not heterosexuals. Peter and Hazelmary Bull said they refuse to let unmarried couples share double rooms, in accordance with their Christian beliefs . He said: 'In those circumstances it must constitute discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. Such discrimination is direct'. Lady Justice Rafferty said a homosexual couple 'cannot comply with the restriction because each party is of the same sex and therefore cannot marry'. The Bulls had accepted an £80-a-night double room booking, believing Steven Preddy, 38, would be staying with his wife. When Mr Preddy arrived with his 46-year-old civil partner Martyn Hall, the men, from Bristol, were told they would not be able to share one room and instead had to sleep separately. Martyn Hall (right) and his civil partner Steven Preddy (left) were awarded £3,600 in damages in January 2011 . Peter and Hazelmary Bull Cornwalll say they did not discriminate against the couple because they were homosexuals . In January last year Judge Andrew . Rutherford ruled at Bristol County Court that the Bulls had breached . equality legislation and ordered them to pay the couple a total of . £3,600 damages. In the . Appeal Court ruling earlier this year, Lady Justice Rafferty said: 'Whilst the appellants' beliefs about sexual practice may not find the . acceptance that once they did, nevertheless a democratic society must . ensure that their espousal and expression remain open to those who hold . them. 'However, in a pluralist society it is inevitable that from time to time, as here, views, beliefs and rights of some are not compatible with those of others. 'As I have made plain, I do not consider that the appellants face any difficulty in manifesting their religious beliefs, they are merely prohibited from so doing in the commercial context they have chosen.' The Equality and Human Rights Commission, had backed Mr Preddy and Mr Hall in their action. John Wadham of the EHRC said “We believe that this case will help people to better understand the law around freedom of religion. 'When offering a service, people cannot use their beliefs, religious or otherwise, to discriminate against others.' But Simon Calvert, of the Christian Institute, which funded Mr and Mrs Bull’s appeal, said: 'Something has gone badly wrong with our equality laws when good, decent people like Peter and Hazelmary are penalised but extremist hate preachers are protected.'","Peter and Hazelmary Bull said that they did not discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation .

"A tiny village is believed to be home to Britain’s oldest tree - a yew that first took took root more than 5,000 years ago. The majestic yew that lives in in a Welsh churchyard was 3,000 years old when Jesus Christ was born, according to tree ageing experts. Experts have run tests on the tree in the St Cynog’s churchyard at Defynnog near Sennybridge, Powys, including DNA and ring-dating. Awe-inspiring: The ancient yew (pictured) in a Welsh churchyard has standing since more than 3,000 years before Christ according to tree ageing experts . The process of ageing a tree is called dendrochronology. There are now many different methods used - from physically measuring the circumference of a a tree's trunk, to tree-ring measuring to DNA testing. Trees rings are a result of new growth during the year, so the number of rings directly corresponds with the number of years a tree has been alive. However, different species of tree have different growth rates. There are hundreds of ancient yew trees dating back at least 600 years across Britain, but the 60-foot-wide giant at St Cynog’s is believed to be the most ancient. Tree ageing expert Janis Fry, 64, who has studied yews for more than 40 years, said: 'I’m convinced this is the oldest tree in Europe. 'It was planted on the north side of the ancient burial mound which is now the churchyard,probably in honour of a neolithic chieftain. 'It is so old that it has split into two halves - one 40ft (12 metres) wide and the other 20 ft (6 metres) wide. 'Its DNA has been tested by the Forestry Institute and its ring count is 120 per inch which makes it [more than] 5,000 years old.' There are hundreds of ancient yew trees across Britain, but the 60-foot-wide giant (pictured with church vicar Rev Paul Wilding) at St Cynog's is believed to be the most ancient of them all . The yew tree is a poisonous species of . conifer native to Western, Central and Southern Europe, Northwest . Africa, Northern Iran and Southwest Asia. The . trees usually live between 400 and 600 years, although some live a . great deal longer - such as in the case of the recently analysed Welsh . yew. One reason for the . plant's longevity is that it is able to split under the weight of . very old growth without falling victim to disease in the fracture, as . most other trees do. Another reason is its ability to give grow new shoots, even in old age. All . across the pre-Christian world, the yew tree had incredible cultural . significance. Many pagan religions believed the trees were sacred because they . were evergreen - symbolising eternal life - and fallen branches could . easily regenerate and take root in nearby soil. A number of . pagan cultures across Europe believed that the yew tree could help ancient priests or druids summon spirits and connect with the Otherworld. The trees were also thought to posses magical powers because, on hot days, they release a . gas called taxine that has the ability to cause hallucinations. Trees and plants were incredibly important in ancient pagan cultures. Here an illustration depicts druids performing a ritual with mistletoe, a plant which was thought to possess protective qualities . Yews were potent . symbols of death too - particularly in ancient Rome, Greece and Egypt - because of their toxic leaves and red berries. The yew is found in churchyards across Europe because . the early Church often took over existing religious buildings as it . converted and took over pagan regions. But . the tree has since become a strong Christian symbol - its long life and evergreen leaves now represent Christ's transcendence of death in his resurrection. The yew's leaves also bear a resemblance to palm leaves and were commonly used on Palm Sunday for Easter rituals. Indeed some ancient British folklore has even hinted that Christ was crucified on a yew tree - lyrics such as . Another, . less magical reason for their existence in churchyards is that poisonous yews were actively planted by the local parish to discourage . farmers from letting their cattle graze on burial grounds. Source: Various . The tree previously thought to be Europe’s oldest yew is in a cemetary in the village of Fortingall in Perthshire, Scotland. Modern expert estimates have put its age at up to 5,000 years old. Church in Wales property services chief Alex Glanville said: 'Yew trees have survived in Wales better than anywhere else because of our wet climate and lower light levels.' It is believed that the yew (recording-breaking specimen pictured) is found in churchyards across Europe because the early Church took over existing religious buildings as it converted and took over pagan regions . The Church in Wales has now launched a campaign to protect the yew trees in their churchyards. It is sending out certificates to parishes and communities which have some of the oldest yews - giving information on where to get the best advice for managing and making the most of them. Mr Glanville said: 'It is time we celebrated these amazing trees and the communities that have cared for them down the centuries.' The world's oldest tree lives on a mountain in central Sweden – and it is still growing. The 9,500-year-old Norwegian Spruce (pictured, right) was discovered by scientists at Umeå University during a 2004 tree census in Fulufjällets National Park in Sweden. The age of the tree was established using carbon-14 dating at a laboratory in Miami, Florida after an investigation by the university. It has been able to survive so long thanks to the process of vegetative propagation, which means it is able to effectively clone itself. While the visible portion of the 13ft tall tree is relatively new, its root system has been growing for almost ten thousand years.","The ancient yew lives in a Welsh churchyard and is thought to have been standing more than 3,000 years before Jesus Christ was born .

"Defence Secretary Philip Hammond faces a mutiny over plans to scrap the Army battalion named after Britain’s Waterloo hero, the Duke of Wellington. Army sources say the Duke of Wellington's battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment is among those to be axed in a cost-cutting cull of the Forces. The proposal, revealed on the eve of tomorrow’s 197th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, has prompted an angry protest by the present Duke of Wellington, who is the regiment’s Deputy Colonel-in-Chief. Facing a mutiny: Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond's plans to scrap the Army batallion named after the Duke of Wellington has drawn criticism . The regiment's Colonel-in-Chief is Prince Andrew. The Duke has written to the head of the Army, General Sir Peter Wall, urging him to save the historic name of the battalion. The 96-year-old Duke, who won the Military Cross in the Second World War, told the Chief of the General Staff that abandoning the name of his ancestor, known as the 'Iron Duke' and one of Britain's most famous battlefield leaders, would be a grave mistake. The Duke was backed last night by Major General Sir Evelyn Webb-Carter, chairman of Waterloo 200, a group set up to organise the 2015 commemoration of the 1815 battle that marked Napoleon’s final defeat. The Major General told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I accept there may have to be cuts for financial reasons, but given the prominence of the name Wellington in the history of our nation and the Armed Forces, it would be extraordinary if it is not  to be preserved. ‘It would be especially contrary when we are approaching the 200th anniversary of Waterloo. ‘The brave soldiers in the Duke of Wellington’s battalion, who are  performing so magnificently in Afghanistan today, greatly value the link with the Iron Duke’s family.’ Jane Wellesley is the great-great-great-grand-daughter of the 1st Duke of Wellington . Senior officers were shocked to  be told at a regimental dinner in York last month that Army chiefs have decided that the historic name  will go. In March, five men of the battalion, together with a sixth from another regiment, were killed by a Taliban bomb in the single worst enemy attack on UK troops in Afghanistan since operations began in 2001. Earlier this month, Private Gregg Stone, 20, of 3rd Battalion, was killed during a successful raid to free an Afghan policeman taken hostage by the Taliban. His wife Samantha is pregnant with their first child. The regiment dates back 300 years and fought under Wellington’s  command at Waterloo as the 33rd Regiment, reportedly prompting Napoleon to comment: ‘These English dogs of war never know when they are beaten.’ It was renamed The Duke of  Wellington’s Regiment by Queen Victoria in 1853, the year after the Duke died. Badge of honour: The emblem belonging to the historic Yorkshire Regiment . The regiment fought in the American War of Independence, India, the Boer War and in the First World War at the Somme. In the Second World War it  campaigned in North Africa, Italy, France and Burma. It also took part in the 2003 Iraq War. Nine of its soldiers have been awarded the Victoria Cross. Affectionately known as the ‘Dukes’, the regiment was amalgamated with the Prince of Wales’s Own Regiment of Yorkshire and The Green Howards to form the Yorkshire Regiment in 2006. It became 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (Duke of Wellington’s). The Mail on Sunday understands that the Yorkshire Regiment is to  be reduced to two battalions. The . Ministry of Defence last night denied any final decision had been taken. A total of 600 of the Yorkshire Regiment’s 1,800 soldiers are expected to lose their jobs, including some from the Duke of Wellington’s battalion. The row follows Mr Hammond’s decision to reduce the strength  of the Armed Forces from 180,000 to 150,000 over five years as part  of £38 billion of defence savings. The Army will be cut to 82,000 soldiers. Critics say it means it can no longer be classed as an army but rather a self-defence force, a term often applied to forces numbering fewer than 100,000. An Army spokesperson said: ‘The Army is currently considering  redesign options. No decisions have been taken.

"As the 197th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo is marked  today, a battalion named after the  Duke of Wellington is facing a very modern fight for survival – against the money men of the  Ministry of Defence. The Duke of Wellington’s battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment faces the axe under plans to cull Army numbers and disband or merge 50 regiments.

"Lawsuit: John Travolta, pictured with wife Kelly Preston, is facing accusations of inappropriate sexual behaviour towards a male massage therapist . John Travolta is being sued over accusations that he tried to have sex with a male a masseur during a therapy session at the luxury Beverly Hills Hotel. The married actor, who has repeatedly denied being gay in the past, is said to have touched the unnamed therapist's genitals during a $200-per-hour massage appointment, the lawsuit claims. The claim filed in court claims that Mr Travolta stripped naked - and appeared aroused - before being massaged while at the same time trying to remove the towel covering his bottom. After the hour's session was over, the 58-year-old star is then alleged to have touched the man's scrotum and penis. But the masseur insists he pulled away and claims he then informed the actor that he was a professional masseur and not a prostitute. Mr Travolta, who has been married to Kelly Preston for 21 years, is then said to have responded that 'we must have got our signals crossed', before adding: 'Come on dude, I'll jerk you off.' The star is then said to have suggested a 'reverse massage', which is believed to mean that he wanted the masseur to lie on the table while the actor gave the man a full body rub. The lawsuit, filed at the U.S. District Court of Central California, claims Mr Travolta then masturbated. During the alleged encounter Mr Travolta - who claims the accusation are 'fiction' - is also said to have told the man that Hollywood 'is controlled by homosexual Jewish men' who expect sexual favours in return for granting parts in films during the encounter in an annex of the five-star Beverly Hills Hotel. The Grease star is alleged to have then claimed he had done things that 'would make most people throw up' during the apparent incident, said to have taken place on January 16. Happily married: Travolta with wife Kelly on . April 25th as they left Barbra Streisand's 70th birthday party and two . days before the alleged incident on January 16th, they appeared at the . G'Day LA event . Damning detail: This is the alleged interaction between the plaintiff and John Doe which forms the crux of the case . He allegedly claimed that he got his . first big movie break due to the sexual favours he performed while . starring in the 1975 TV series Welcome Back Kotter. Whispers about John Travolta’s sexuality have plagued his movie career almost from the outset. Various camp roles in films – most notably as a drag queen the musical Hairspray – have helped fuel rumours he is secretly gay. But there have also been strongly denied accusations he has been living a double life strikingly at odds with his family man image. They include rumour that his 1991 marriage to Kelly Preston was arranged by the shadowy cult-like religion of Scientology, of which he is a leading disciple. Seven years later, the father-of-two Travolta was named as a homosexual in court papers by a former member of the Church. The case never got a hearing, however. And in 2001, Travolta faced unsubstantiated claims that he had tried to pick up a business executive in a health club. However, the rumour mill reaches a crescendo in 2006, when the actor was seen apparently kissing a male friend as he prepared to board his own Boeing 707 jet in Canada. The plaintiff, or accuser - who refuses to be named because his . lawyer claims he is frightened of the Hollywood powerhouse - alleges . that Mr Travolta picked him up in his black Lexus SUV after a anonymous phone . appointment was made instructing the masseur to wait in a specific spot . in a nearby street. During the journey, the man noticed condoms alongside chocolate cake wrappers littering the console of the vehicle, . After pulling up outside the Beverley . Hills Hotel, they are then said to have entered one of the business's . annexes opposite the main building, which are known as bungalows. They were then greeted by an . 'overweight' black man who was grilling hamburgers. This chef is then . said to have disappeared when Mr Travolta allegedly tried to have sex . with the male masseur. The masseur is seeking more than $2 million in damages. A . spokesperson for John issued a vehement denial, he said: 'This lawsuit . is complete fiction and fabrication. None of the events claimed in the . suit ever occurred. 'The plaintiff, who refuses to give . their name, knows that the suit is a baseless lie…On that date when . plaintiff claims John met him, John was not in California and it can be . proved that he was on the East Coast. 'Plaintiff's attorney has filed this . suit to try and get his 15 minutes of fame. John intends to get this . case thrown out and then he will sue the attorney and Plaintiff for . malicious prosecution.' Okorie Okorcha, the lawyer representing the masseur told RadarOnline.com: 'My client is afraid of John Travolta. 'Fiction' A spokesperson for Travolta has hit out at the claims, even claiming that Travolta was not in LA at the time - though he was pictured at a G'Day LA event with his wife two days earlier . Witness:The plaintiff recalls a chef cooking burgers present for the first half of the massage, which passed without incident . Serious allegations: Travolta is absolutely refuting that he was even in LA at the time of the alleged incident . Denial: Travolta, on the set of his latest film Savages in LA last year, will fight the case, according to his lawyer . He added: 'Mr. Travolta made very explicit threats against my client, which are contained in the lawsuit. 'Specifically, John Travolta told my client that Hollywood is controlled by homosexual Jewish men who expect favors in return for sexual activity. 'Let's face it, John Travolta is an extremely powerful man, and my client absolutely felt threatened by Mr. Travolta. My client was sexually assaulted by Mr. Travolta and he needs to be held accountable for his actions.'","Travolta 'lured masseur to Beverly Hills Hotel and touched therapist's penis during $200-an-hour session'

"Two manhole covers were blown into the air by an underground explosion which led to temporary power cuts to over 1,000 homes. Fire crews raced to a street in Oldham, Greater Manchester after flames were seen coming from two manholes around one mile apart shortly after midnight last night. The blast, caused by a faulty underground cable, was the latest of a series of manhole explosions around the UK. Scroll down for video . Manhole covers on Ripponden Road, Oldham were blown into the air last night as flames leapt into the street . Locals said it was lucky the explosion happened late on a Sunday night as the busy street would have been full of vehicles and pedestrians  at daytime. Retired Mavis Lloyd, 73, said: 'I was sat watching TV and saw an orange flash through the curtains and heard a loud bang. The TV went off and the lamps went out. 'Just as I looked outside a massive flash of flames came out of the manhole. The flames came about 5ft high. The manhole cover had been blown out and gone down the road. 'A car had stopped by the side of the road. He must have driven over the hole and it exploded as he went over. He said when it happened he thought he was going to die.' More than 1,000 homes and business lost power for more than five minutes after the explosion and electrical engineers are now on the scene. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said crews were called to Ripponden Road shortly after midnight, where fires were seen coming from manholes. The blazes were out by the time firefighters arrived and they secured the scene for engineers from Electricity North West. Earlier this year, fire crews were called to central London after a manhole cover exploded, destroying a van . A spokesman for the firm said: 'The fault, which occurred on a piece of equipment underneath the pavement, caused external damage on site, but we would like to assure customers that incidents of this nature are extremely rare and we regularly maintain our underground network to ensure customers across the North West receive a reliable supply of electricity.' The blast, which left no one injured, is the latest in a series of similiar incidents in recent months. In October, a huge fireball burst through a manhole cover in Islington, north London, leading to homes being evacuated and five people being rescued. Earlier this year, 50 homes in the same area of London had to be evacuated when an electrical fire burst out into a busy shopping area. A man was severely injured and confined to a wheelchair for three months after a manhole cover exploded next to him in Harrow, north-west London, in August 2011. It is believed the explosions can be caused by heavy rainfall, which causes water to come into contact with electrical wires.","Locals in Oldham, Greater Manchester report late night explosion in street .

"Google is already receiving requests to remove objectionable personal information from its search engine after Europe's top court ruled that people have the 'right to be forgotten', a source has revealed. The firm is yet to put a process to handle the expected flood of requests in place after Tuesday's ruling, said the source, who is not authorised to speak on the record about the issue. The decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union, which affects 500 million citizens, requires that search services remove information deemed 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant' and failure to do so can result in fines. The decision affects 500 million citizens and states that if search services don't comply, they face heavy fines. Google (pictured) began removing search results last month and said it has received more than 70,000 requests since it put a form online on May 30 . 'There's many open questions,' Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday in response to a question about the ruling and its implications on Google's operations. Under the European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17 includes the ‘right to be forgotten and to erasure’. Under . Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to . ‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to . them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data.' This . particularly relates to data about the person when they were a child, . when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was . collected, the person who owns the content withdraws their consent, the . storage period has expired, or if it was gathered illegally. The EU defines ‘data controllers’ as ‘people or bodies that collect and manage personal data.’ The EU General Data Protection Regulation means any data controller who . has been asked to remove data must ‘take all reasonable steps, . including technical measures' to remove it. If a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined. 'A simple way of understanding what happened here is that you have a collision between a right to be forgotten and a right to know. From Google's perspective that's a balance,' Schmidt said. 'Google believes having looked at the decision, which is binding, that the balance that was struck was wrong.' He was not asked about the recent take-down requests. MailOnline has contacted Google, but the firm has yet to reveal the number of take-down requests it has received. Google will need to build up an 'army of removal experts' in each of the 28 EU countries, including those where Google does not have operations, the source said. Whether those staffers merely remove controversial links or actually judge the merits of individual take-down requests are among the many questions Google is yet to decide, the source said. Europea citizens can submit take-down requests directly to Internet companies rather than to local authorities or publishers under the ruling. If a search engine elects not to remove the link, a person can seek redress from the courts. The criteria for determining which take-down requests are legitimate is not completely clear from the decision, said Jeffrey Rosen, a law professor at the George Washington University and head of the National Constitution Centre. The ruling was made by the European Union Court of Justice (pictured). It comes after a Spanish man complained an online auction note about his repossessed home infringed his privacy. Google told MailOnline it is 'disappointed' by the ruling and argued it should not be a censor for data held on websites in its index . The ruling seems to give search engines more leeway to dismiss take-down requests for links to webpages about public figures, in which the information is deemed to be of public interest. But search engines may err on the side of caution and remove more links than necessary to avoid liability, said Rosen, a long-time critic of such laws. He was asked by Google to speak to reporters on Tuesday's ruling, but has no formal relationship with the company. Search engines will also have to authenticate requests, he noted, to ensure that the person seeking a link's removal is actually the one he or she claims to be. Google is the dominant search engine in Europe, commanding about 93 percent of the market, according to StatCounter global statistics. Microsoft Corp's Bing has 2.4 percent and Yahoo Inc has 1.7 percent. Google has some experience dealing with take-down requests in its YouTube video website, which has a process to remove uploads that infringe copyrights. Google has automated much of the process with a ContentID system that automatically scans uploaded videos for particular content that media companies have provided to YouTube. Google may be able to create similar technology to address the EU requirements, said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis. Even if Google does not automate the process, the extra cost of hiring staffers is likely to be insignificant to a company that generated roughly $60 billion in revenue last year, Gillis said. If Google were to pay staffers $15 an hour to process take-down requests, for example, the company could get a million hours of work for $15 million, he said. 'It's the cost of doing business for them.' Google has said it is disappointed with the ruling, which it noted differed dramatically from a non-binding opinion by the ECJ's court adviser last year. That opinion said deleting information from search results would interfere with freedom of expression. Yahoo is 'carefully reviewing' the decision to assess the impact for its business and its users, a spokeswoman said in a statement. 'Since our founding almost 20 years ago, we've supported an open and free internet; not one shaded by censorship.' Microsoft declined to comment. Brett Dixon, founder of DP Online Marketing, told MailOnline: 'The news that search engine operators will be subject to a European Union dictat on the right to be forgotten is ludicrous. 'This ruling advocates nobody being responsible for their own actions. Akin to press censorship, it's absolutely wrong that information that is of interest to the general public ought not to be in the public domain. You might as well say to a journalist who's written up a story that they have no right to publish it. 'The danger is that a public figure can behave as badly as they like, but with no consequences whatsoever, the story effectively becomes buried and forgotten about. 'There are a minority of cases whereby an individual is associated with unsolicited negative attention due to factually incorrect information on Google and other search engines, but cases such as these should not dictate the lay of the land for everyone.'","Decision affects the 500 million citizens and .

"Ireland's voters gave a grudging seal of approval to an EU treaty that paves the way for further austerity measures across the continent in a desperate attempt to fight the debt-crisis that threatens the existence of the euro. The treaty's approval, to be declared officially later today, relieves some pressure on EU financial chiefs as they battle to contain the eurozone's debt crisis. But critics said the tougher deficit rules would do nothing to stimulate desperately needed growth in bailed-out Ireland, Portugal and Greece nor stop Spain or Italy from requiring aid too. Result: Ireland's voters have given their seal of approval to the European Union's deficit-fighting treaty . Tense: A Yes campaigner watches the counting of votes in the City West Conference Centre in Dublin . Around 60 per cent of those polled are believed to have backed the austerity plans. The first constituencies to return a result were Tipperary South and Galway East. They declared an overall 62 per cent majority in favour as campaigners on both sides accepted victory for the Yes campaign. Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny said his government was relieved that voters have approved the European Union's deficit-fighting treaty, and now must work with EU partners to build a plan to boost growth prospects across the debt-battered eurozone. Ireland's Socialist Party leader Joe Higgins, who opposed the treaty, said: 'The 'yes' side is going to win. 'The question now is where will the jobs and the stability they have promised come from, against the backdrop of a continuing and deepening capitalist crisis within Europe? Their policies will only make the situation worse.' Dozens of party activists monitoring the ballot counting at several centres across Ireland reported the 'yes' side solidly outpolling 'no' voters several hours ahead of the official result announcement at Dublin Castle.

The activists, called 'tallymen', stood near official ballot-counters and made their own calculations. A . strong majority of districts reported pro-treaty majorities, with the . 'yes' side polling between 55 per cent and 75 per cent in largely . middle-class suburban areas of Dublin, home to a third of Ireland's . 4.5million people. Eurozone unemployment has hit a record high and job losses are likely to keep climbing as the debt crisis eats away at businesses' ability to hire workers while indebted governments continue to cut staff. Around 17.4million people were out of work in the 17-nation eurozone in April (11% of the working population) - the highest level since records began in 1995, the EU's statistics office Eurostat said today. 'This 11% level is going to continue edging up in the coming months and probably until the end of the year,' said Francois Cabau, an economist at Barclays Capital who sees the eurozone's economy contracting 0.1% this year. 'The economic activity situation tells you the story of the labour market. There's been basically no economic growth since the fourth quarter of last year and indicators are pointing to very weak growth momentum for the second quarter,' he said. ING economist Martin van Vliet said he sees the unemployment rate reaching slightly above 11.5% if the economy starts to recover later this year. But if the downturn worsens, 'the risk is for an even higher peak in unemployment,' he said. As the debt crisis intensifies, companies in the euro zone are trying to keep their labour costs low as they struggle with falling demand and profits, while a German-led drive to cut deficits and debt is pressuring governments to shrink spending. But some economists say austerity policies in an economic downturn are self-defeating because governments receive less tax receipts as unemployment grows and must pay out more money in jobless benefits. The . anti-treaty vote was strongest in urban working-class districts where . anger over the crippling cost of Ireland's bank-bailout program runs . highest. But even there, tallymen reported, the votes were splitting nearly evenly. Unofficial vote tallies from rich and . poor parts of Dublin and Cork, the second-largest city, illustrated a . stark class divide in how Ireland voted. The Dublin Southwest and Dublin Midwest districts, with swathes of run-down public housing blocks, voted 51 per cent against the treaty. But on the prosperous south side, the suburban port of Dun Laoghaire voted 72 per cent for the treaty, Dublin South 66 per cent in favor. Significantly, turnout was much higher in more affluent districts. Overall, about half of Ireland's 3.13million registered voters participated in yesterday's referendum, typical in an officially neutral country that is constitutionally required to hold a referendum on each European treaty. Public rejection could have blocked Ireland from receiving new EU loans once its 2010 bailout money runs out next year. It also would have sent political shockwaves through other eurozone members, where anger against austerity and bank bailouts runs similarly high but citizens are denied the chance to vote on the treaty. Ireland is the only country that will put the fiscal treaty - a German-led plan for stricter budget rules - to a referendum. The treaty needs the approval of only 12 of the 17 euro zone countries to be ratified, but an Irish rejection would have undermined one of Europe's key initiatives just as problems mount in Spain and Greece. Analysts said that a 'Yes' vote would give Ireland a better chance of getting back to bond markets as planned next year and hand Europe a rare piece of good news, though one it will have little time to bask in with more to worry about elsewhere. 'I don't think there will be much market reaction this morning, simply because it's in line with expectations that were built up because of the polls,' said Dermot O'Leary, chief economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers. 'It is a message of support from Ireland to Europe, I think that's very simply what it is. Policymakers won't have long to celebrate because there are wider issues in the euro area that they now must move their attention onto.' Irish two-year bond yields were higher on the day at a near five-month high of 7.53 per cent, meaning short-term borrowing costs still remained above those on longer-term bonds, a sign that investors are pricing in the possibility that Dublin will need a second bailout. In a sign of the modicum of stability that has returned to Ireland's economy, data showed on Thursday that deposits held by Ireland's domestic banks rose to a 14-month high in April. That was in sharp contrast to Spain where depositors worried about their banks moved money abroad at the fastest rate since records began, recalling the tens of billions of euros that flew out of Ireland ahead of its bailout. Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, who campaigned with warnings that Ireland would face harsher austerity if it rejected the treaty, offered a cautious welcome for the early results and declined to declare victory. 'I'm hopeful for a strong 'yes' vote. The early trends would indicate a strong run in favor of the `yes' vote. We'll wait to see what the trends are around the country,' said Kenny. He rose to power 14 months ago on a platform promising to pull Ireland out of recession, minimise the cost of bank rescues, and getting the country borrowing normally again on bond markets by next year. The treaty, signed in February by leaders of 25 countries including Ireland, proposes that all members who ratify it should reduce their annual deficits to no more than 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product. The current eurozone limit is 3 per cent. Ireland, already four years into a brutal austerity program that has slashed around 15 per cent from many workers' incomes, is committed to reaching the 3 per cent threshold by 2015. Opponents of the treaty argued that the tougher new deficit rule would force Ireland to stay on the austerity road until 2020 at least. Ireland has posted the EU's worst deficits since 2009, including an EU-record 32.4 per cent in 2010 and 13.1 per cent last year. Both figures were greatly inflated by the exceptional costs of Ireland's decision to nationalise five of its six banks rather than see any collapse - a debt burn that pushed Ireland itself to the brink of bankruptcy in 2010. Repayments to international bondholders, central banks and interest on decades-long loans are expected to cost Ireland's taxpayers €68billion, equivalent to €19,000 for every man, woman and child.","Low turnout relieves pressure on EU bosses battling to contain debt crisis .

"The Milky Way is blowing huge, mysterious bubbles that stretch for tens of thousands of light years. These 'Fermi' bubbles, which are mostly made up of gamma rays, were discovered four years ago by Harvard physicist Douglas Finkbeiner - and scientists have been trying to explain them ever since. Now a group of US researchers has used data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Telescope to create a 'portrait' two bubbles stretching out above and below our galaxy. Scroll down for video . The Milky Way is blowing huge, mysterious 'Fermi' bubbles that stretch for tens of thousands of light years . Dmitry Malyshev, at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology in Stanford, found that the bubbles have very clear outlines and are fixed at each pole of the Milky Way. The bubbles themselves, he claims, glow in nearly uniform gamma rays and appear like two 30,000-light-year-tall incandescent bulbs screwed into the centre of the galaxy. But according to current astrophysical theories, these gamma rays shouldn't be there, and scientists have been unable to find a source. There are a number of theories. For example, they could have been created by huge jets of accelerated matter blasting out from the supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy. The bubbles extend 30,000 light-years across.  Hints of the bubbles' edges were first seen in X-rays (blue). The gamma rays mapped by Fermi (shown in magenta) extend much farther from the galaxy's plane . Or they could have been formed by a population of giant stars, born from the plentiful gas surrounding the black hole, all exploding as supernovae at roughly the same time. Another theory is they are the result of collisions between dark matter particles that result in their annihilation, emitting charged particles in the process. There are a number of theories attempting to explain why the Milky Way is blowing these enormous bubbles.

'There are several models that explain them, but none of the models is perfect,' said Dmitry Malyshev, a postdoctoral researcher at the Kavli Institute. 'The bubbles are rather mysterious.' From the vantage point of most Earth-bound telescopes, all but the highest-energy gamma rays are completely screened out by our atmosphere. It wasn't until the era of orbiting gamma-ray observatories like Fermi that scientists discovered how common extra-terrestrial gamma rays really are. Pulsars, supermassive black holes in other galaxies and supernovae are all gamma rays point sources, like distant stars are point sources of visible light, and all those gamma rays had to be scrubbed from the Fermi data. Hardest to remove were the galactic diffuse emissions, a gamma ray fog that fills the galaxy from cosmic rays interacting with interstellar particles. 'Subtracting all those contributions didn't subtract the bubbles,' said KIPAC postdoctoral researcher Anna Franckowiak. 'The bubbles do exist and their properties are robust.' In other words, the bubbles don't disappear when other gamma-ray sources are pulled out of the Fermi data – in fact, they stand out quite clearly. The researchers plan to continue to gather data on the bubbles, while attempting to explain how they got there. A giant gamma-ray structure was discovered by processing Fermi all-sky data at energies from 1 to 10 billion electron volts, shown here. The dumbbell-shaped feature (centre) emerges from the galactic core and extends 50 degrees north and south from the plane of the Milky Way, in the sky from the constellation Virgo .","Scientists have created a data-based 'portrait' of two massive bubbles .

"A functioning man-made leaf that absorbs water and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen, just like natural leaves, has been created by an art graduate. The new material could provide a steady source of oxygen for humans on long missions in space and even help us colonise new planets. Julian Melchiorri claims that the leaves could also transform life on Earth as we know it, because buildings could be clad with the material to oxygenate homes and polluted urban areas. Scroll down for video . You better beleaf it: A graduate has invented a man-made biological leaf (pictured) that absorbs water and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen, just like natural leaves do on Earth. He thinks the material could be used in space exploration, the colonising of planets and to clad buildings back on Earth . Julian Melchiorri claims that the leaves could facilitate long-distance space travel by providing oxygen on future space craft. They could be dumped on planets that humans will colonise, as 'real' plants can't grow in zero gravity. But the man-made leaves also need water to perform photosynthesis. The leaves could be used in interior design on Earth and the designer has already made lightshade using the material, which could oxygenate as well as decorate rooms. He thinks the leaves could be used to clad buildings and even funnel the oxygen produced inside structures. The Royal College of Art graduate told Dezeen that Nasa is researching ways to ensure a supply of oxygen over long journeys so that people can live in space, but that plants don’t grow in zero gravity. ‘This material could allow us to explore space much further than we can now,’ he said. Mr Melchiorri, who lives in London, was working on his leaf while on the RCA’s Innovation Design Engineering Course and collaborated with scientists at Tufts University silk lab in Massachusetts to engineer the material. It is made up of chloroplasts from plant cells  that are suspended in a web of silk protein. The protein is extracted from natural silk fibres. ‘This material has amazing properties of stabilising molecules,’ he explained in a video. The material is made up of chloroplasts from plant cells (illustrated) that are suspended in a web of silk protein. The protein is extracted from natural silk fibres . Mr Melchiorri claims that he has made the 'first photosynthetic material that is living and breathing as a leaf does.' But just like real leaves, the new material needs a small amount of fresh water and light to produce oxygen, which still needs to be discovered on planets for humans to call home. Mr Melchiorri says that his material consumes very little energy and as a result he thinks it could be incorporated into modern buildings, to absorb carbon dioxide. It could be used to clad facades, ventilation systems, he said. ‘You can absorb air from outside, pass it through these biological filters and then bring oxygenated air inside.’ He has so far created lampshades made from the material, which produce oxygen while helping to light up a home.

"Most fathers are opposed to shared parental leave with many worried about the impact on their careers, research shows. A law introduced yesterday allows men to share up to 50 weeks of parental leave with their partner if their child is born after March 31 next year. Instead of taking just two weeks of statutory paternity leave, fathers can take almost a year off to care for the baby. But a study suggests many have no intention of taking up the offer. Scroll down for video . Three out of four British men disagree they should have equal rights to parental leave, file photograph . Research by jobs website Glassdoor found that only one in four men surveyed agreed that both parents should take parental leave. This falls to one in five for over-45s but rises to one in three for men under 25, showing a generational gap in attitudes. Under the new rules women must take the first two weeks, but men can then take over for the remaining 50 weeks. They can also take the time off at the same time. Yet Glassdoor found just one in ten men wanted to take the maximum amount of leave allowed, while almost half said they would still take two weeks. A separate report by law firm Linklaters found almost two-thirds of men and women were concerned that taking shared leave could damage their career prospects. Half of men said they would be deterred from taking shared parental leave if male colleagues did not take it. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured, announced plans for shared parental leave in January 2011 . Jeremy Davies, of think tank the Fatherhood Institute, claimed that men’s reluctance to take parental leave was mostly financial and not because they did not want to care for their child. He said: ‘Pay is the main factor. We know that for men to take advantage of these sort of things they need to be able to afford to do so. ‘Is status anxiety an issue? Yes. You’ve got to feel confident that if you do this it’s not going to mess your career up.’ Couples who take shared parental leave could also be offered less favourable packages than women on maternity leave. The law says firms must pay 90 per cent of an employee’s weekly earnings for the first six weeks then £138.18 or 90 per cent of salary, whichever is lower, for another 33 weeks. In reality, many offer more generous maternity pay on top of this so that staff are not financially penalised for caring for their child. There is no obligation for employers to extend this enhanced pay to those on shared parental leave. However, Lucy Lewis, a partner at law firm Lewis Silkin, warned that employers could be sued for discrimination if they failed to offer the same generous package to men. Yesterday, a report by the Trades Union Congress said many pregnant workers are victimised by bosses with ‘sacking, bullying and side-lining’ commonplace. In the last five years, 9,000 women have brought tribunal claims against their employer for unfair dismissal or suffering a detriment because of pregnancy.","One in four British men said parental leave should not be shared equally .

"Two members of a girl gang savagely attacked a pair of legal secretaries following a Royal Wedding street party. Kalee Powell, 18, and Precious Gordon, 19, attacked Daniela Holischeck and  Birgit Habersetzer after spending the day boozing at a street party to celebrate the marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton. Ms Holischeck, who worked for City law firm Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker, was left a bloodied mess following the savage beating. Convicted: Precious Gordon, left,  and Kalee Powell, right, savagely attacked a pair of legal secretaries during a Royal Wedding day attack . She spent the night in A&E after the attack and had to take a fortnight off from work. Powell and Gordon, along with a 17-year-old who cannot be named, attacked 'like a pack' after they were called 'idiots' when they knocked a pizza out of the hands of Ms Habersetzer. Gordon admitted affray and assaulting Ms Holischeck and Ms Harbersetzer, while Powell was convicted of affray for her part in the attack on Ms Holischeck after a trial at the Old Bailey. Both were given community orders and told to pay a total of £300 compensation to their victims. Judge Stephen Kramer QC said Ms Holischeck and her flatmate had been caught up in 'an ugly incident in which mindless, drunken and unlawful violence was used'. 'It must have been a shock and thoroughly frightening for the two women who were victims,' he added. Haunted: Daniela Holischeck, pictured (right) with fellow victim Birgit Habersetzer, says she has been denied justice after members of a girl gang who savagely attacked them walked free from court . 'I am satisfied what you both did you did that night because you were fuelled by alcohol, having gone to a street party and drunk alcohol celebrating the Royal Wedding. 'You have each come within a whisker of a custodial sentence. I hope you both appreciate that and these courts will never see you in this sort of position again.' Ms Holischeck told jurors she felt as if it was 'raining fists' during the 10 minute attack in Bathurst Gardens, Kensal Rise, northwest London, on April 30 last year. She became so desperate she kicked out at a car in an attempt to start its alarm. 'They managed to grab my hair and pull me to the ground, and started to kick me,' she said. 'I could feel pizza being rubbed in my hair - bits of cheese coming down on me. 'There was so much blood everywhere - my face was full of blood, my hair was full of blood.' Ms Habersetzer, also a legal secretary, was also attacked while two boys from the group stood watching in Kensal Rise, London, just after midnight. Miss Habersetzer had brought the pizza as a late night snack and was taking it home. Prosecutor Helen Guest said: 'As they passed on the pavement, one of the girls knocked the box out of the hands of Birgit Habersetzer, and then followed that up with a punch to her face. 'She threatened to call the police, and then a girl came to Daniela Holischeck and started to attack her. She ended up on the floor, and they were kicking and punching her.' The attack only came to an end when a passing police car pulled up. Powell told officers she was drunk but had been trying to stop the fight. Ms Holischeck said she spent the night in A&E and had to take two weeks off sick. 'I had some trapped nerves in my back, and was not able to get out of bed by myself for a week,' she said. 'I had friends come to help me get out of bed.' 'I had a nose bleed from punches to the head.' Attack: Powell and Gordon had spent the day boozing at a street party to celebrate the marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton . The two victims - both German - had been celebrating the wedding of Prince William to Kate Middleton in a local pub but had drunk only fruit juice because they were in training for a charity fun run. Powell, of Northolt, northwest London, denied affray and common assault on Ms Holischeck and was convicted. She was given a 12-month community order requiring her to spend a total of 24 hours at a senior attendance centre run by the Probation Service. She will also be under a nightly 8pm to 8am curfew for three months and will have to pay £100 compensation to Ms Holischeck. Gordon, of Kensal Rise, admitted affray and common assault on both victims. She was given a 12-month community order requiring her to spend a total of 27 hours at a senior attendance centre and ordered to pay £100 compensation to each of the victims.","Kalee Powell, Precious Gordon and a 17-year-old attacked their victims 'like a pack'
