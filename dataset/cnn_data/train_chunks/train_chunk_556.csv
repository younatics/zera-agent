Complaints to the banking watchdog have soared to unprecedented levels as banks refuse to settle thousands of  customers’ PPI disputes. The Financial Ombudsman Service is being swamped by 15,000 a week, two thirds of which are upheld, and is having to take on an extra 1,000 staff to cope with the deluge. Customers can appeal to the FOS when complaints made directly to financial firms are rejected, so its figures are just the tip of the iceberg. The new figures published by the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) make clear that banks are continuing to reject legitimate complaints . Complaints about the mis-selling of . payment protection insurance for loans, credit cards and mortgages . dominate the figures, representing 10,000 a week. In the three months to December, the . FOS received 180,679 complaints from across the financial sector, . including mortgage sales and pensions, bringing the total for the nine . months to December to 341,666 – 29 per cent more than the total for the . entire 2011-12 financial year. A British Bankers Association spokesman said: ‘Banks are committed to handling PPI complaints efficiently. ‘But the actions of unscrupulous . claims management companies, who refer huge numbers of claims to the . ombudsman whether there are grounds to or not, mean the system is being . clogged up.’ The big banks have already set aside . some £12billion to compensate victims of what is the biggest mis-selling . scandal in British banking history. However, even this figure may not be enough and the banks are making attempts to put a time limit on any new claims. The findings suggest the big banks, some of which would not exist but for being rescued by billions of taxpayer pounds, continue to treat customers with contempt . PPI . was sold to customers on the basis that it would provide a financial . safety net, covering repayments to the bank if they suddenly lost their . job or fell ill. However, . it was pushed by hard-sell bank staff, many working on commission, to . people who would never be able to make a claim, including part-time and . seasonal workers, pensioners and others with long-standing illnesses. The . ombudsman said it is upholding 66 per cent of PPI complaints, which . only reach the ombudsman after the customer has been turned away by . their bank. FOS is having . to take on an extra 1,000 staff to try to handle the avalanche of . complaints from across the financial sector, including sales of . mortgages, pensions and the management of share portfolios. PPI is not the only area where . complaints are rising sharply. FOS said there were 1,893 complaints . about life insurance policies between October and December, which was up . by 26 per cent on the same period a year earlier. Complaints . about personal pensions rose 18 per cent to 1,537, with 33 per cent . upheld, while investment portfolio management complaints were up by 24 . per cent to 1,173, with 53 per cent upheld. Executive . director at the consumer champion, Which? Richard Lloyd said: ‘PPI is . now the biggest financial mis-selling scandal of all time and the banks . should be proactively contacting their customers and making sure it is . as easy as possible for those with a legitimate claim to get their money . back, without any hassle.’ The . banks recently asked the FSA to consider setting a deadline for . customers to claim compensation for mis-sold PPI amid fears about the . uncertainty that the rising bill is creating for investors.","New figures by the Financial Ombudsman Service suggest banks are rejecting legitimate claims .

Mega Bloks Barbie will allow young girls to build, design and decorate their own, mainly pink, Barbie world – and even construct her signature convertible car. The new line of toys is a result of a collaboration between Mattel and the makers of Mega Bloks. It appears to be a reaction to the decision by Lego to launch a hugely successful – but controversial – series of building sets specifically for girls, called Lego Friends. New toys: Mattel are set to release Mega Bloks Barbie to rival Lego's similar pink range . There has also been a trend towards more gender neutral toys as manufacturers and retailers react to concern among some parents that boys and girls are being stereotyped from an early age. However, the Barbie construction sets, with their vivid pink colours, are definitely more girly than gritty. Mega Bloks Barbie invites girls to build, design and decorate their own Barbie world with compatible playsets and mini-fashion figures. Girls will be able to build a luxury mansion, a fashion boutique and even the Barbie doll’s signature convertible car one pink brick at a time. The sets, which are designed for girls aged four and up launched in the USA ahead of Christmas and are coming to UK stores in March. I'm a Barbie girl: The pink hued Barbie themed toys will see children design a building blocks version of her popular house . Just for her: Mega Bloks Barbie definitely goes against the gender-neutral trend on the toy marked . Mini-figures of Barbie and her friends start at £5.99, while the ‘Build and Style’ pink convertible is £16.99, a pool party set is £39.99 and the luxury mansion is £79.99. Lego launched its construction sets for girls – Lego Friends – a year ago. That is also dominated by pink and pastel colours, while the set themes include a beauty parlour, a café, a stage, a convertible car and a splash pool. The initiative drew some criticism from parents on web forums with commentators arguing it was wrong to restrict children to specific types of toys and colours. Some complained that it was a betrayal of what had previously been a ‘beautifully genderless toy’. Same audience: Lego's Friends range launched to attract girls to buy Lego products . Dr Maureen O’Brien, developmental psychologist and Mega Bloks child play expert, said girls love and benefit from creative construction just as much as boys. ‘Playing with building toys provides children with an ideal way to engage in discovery-based learning,’ she said. ‘It is through this type of learning that children are able to build their confidence through trial and error and develop a sense of achievement, enabling them to physically link their world to the play world, building their brain power in the process. ‘Combining block play with open-ended and imaginative play, children experience an extraordinary level of brain building. ‘This combination of play patterns encourages exploration and storytelling, building context for children and a better understanding of the world around them.’ A senior vice president for Mattel, Stephanie Cota(correct), explained the decision to launch the sets, saying: ‘We know what girls want in Barbie’s world – to imagine, explore and discover. ‘The Mega Bloks Barbie collection invites girls to build Barbie’s world in a way that is true to the Barbie brand – fashionable and aspirational.'","Mattel to unveil Lego-lookalike building blocks Mega Bloks Barbie .

Its demise has been widely blamed on online shopping. And yesterday the internet caused further problems for struggling HMV – when staff hijacked the firm’s Twitter account to post a blow-by-blow account of mass sackings at head office. Angry staff gave live updates of the ‘mass execution’ at the beleaguered music firm’s London headquarters. Around 190 workers both there and across its distribution centres were fired. The incident triggered panic among HMV . executives who were seen marching around the office pleading for advice . on how to delete the tweets and shut down the @hmvtweets feed. The first read: ‘We’re tweeting live . from inside HR where we’re all being fired! Exciting!!’ One minute later . came the update: ‘There are over 60 of us being fired at once! Mass . execution of loyal employees who love the brand.’ Another followed: . ‘Just overheard our marketing director (he’s staying folks) ask “How do I . shut down twitter?”.’ One message, spread over two posts, . read: ‘Under usual circumstances, we’d never dare do such a thing as . this. However, when the company you dearly love is being ruined and . those hard working individuals, who wanted to make HMV great again, have . mostly been fired, there seemed no other choice.’ The company managed to delete the tweets by mid-afternoon, however not before they had been re-tweeted thousands of times.

Poppy Rose Cleere, who described . herself as HMV’s social media planner, said last night she was behind . the tweets. The 21-year-old said senior managers ‘never seemed to grasp’ the importance of social media. ‘I hope they’re finally listening,’ she said in a message from her personal account. ‘Since my internship . started, I worked tirelessly to educate the business of the importance . of social media – not as a short-term commercial tool, but as a tool to . build and strengthen the customer relationship, and to gain invaluable . real-time feedback from the consumers that have kept us going for over . 91 years.’ Final stand: The rebellious tweets went on to say the firm was being 'ruined' so they had no other choice . HMV later deleted all its tweets then added these two tweets later, saying there have been job losses but 'not in our stores' Cuts: Administrators Deloitte said today that they hoped the brand had a future as a 'restructured business' Just looking: Supportive Twitter users praised the courage of the rogue member of staff .

"By . Sean Poulter . PUBLISHED: . 19:49 EST, 28 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:33 EST, 29 January 2013 . Health experts are calling for a 7p-a-can ‘fat tax’ on sugary soft drinks to tackle the rising menace of childhood obesity. A powerful alliance of 61 organisations, including the country’s most eminent doctors and the Royal Society for Public Health, wants the move to be announced in the spring Budget. The experts argue that the 20p-a-litre levy on bottles and cans of fizzy drinks could help cut consumption in the same way that tax is used to deter smoking and drinking. Crackdown: Experts claim adding 7p to the price of a regular 330ml can of fizzy drink will cut consumption and help tackle childhood obesity . The move, which would add nearly 7p to the price of a regular 330ml can of Coca-Cola or Pepsi, would raise £1billion a year to promote healthier eating. The alliance has been brought together by Sustain, the campaigning food and health group. The Prime Minister has indicated some sympathy for the idea in the past. Sustain campaigns director Charlie Powell said: ‘Sugar-laden drinks are mini health timebombs, contributing to dental diseases, obesity and a host of life-threatening illnesses which cost the NHS billions each year.’ Most of the money raised through the levy would be ring-fenced for a Children’s Future Fund, which would be spent on improving children’s health by, for example, providing free school meals or free fruit and vegetable snacks. Epidemic proportions: One child in three is already obese or overweight before they leave primary school . An independent body would be given responsibility to oversee how the drinks duty, which would apply to products with added sugar, is implemented and spent. The initiative has the support of the Academy of Royal Medical Colleges, which effectively speaks for the entire medical profession. Dr Mike Rayner, of the Department of . Public Health at Oxford University, said: ‘Just as we use fiscal . measures to discourage drinking and smoking and help prevent people from . dying early, there is now lots of evidence that the same approach would . work for food. ‘This modest . proposal goes some way towards making the price of food reflect its . true costs to society. 'Our obesity epidemic causes debilitating illness, . life-threatening diseases and misery for millions of people. It is high . time government did something effective.’ Britain . is the fattest country in Europe, with one in four adults classed as . obese while one child in three is already obese or overweight before . they leave primary school. Dealing . with diet-related illnesses, such as Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, . costs the NHS £6billion a year, predicted to soar to £50billion by . 2050. Countries such as Finland, France and Hungary, and in some states in the US already impose a tax on unhealthy foods. France . brought in a duty of 6p a litre on all drinks with added sugar or . artificial sweeteners a year ago. The tax rises to 40p a litre on energy . drinks. Gavin Partington, director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said a fat tax on fizzy drinks would not reduce obesity. ‘Obesity is a serious and complex problem, but a tax on soft drinks, which contribute just two per cent of the total calories in the average diet, will not help address it,’ he said. ‘Over the past ten years, the consumption of soft drinks containing added sugar has fallen by nine per cent while the incidence of obesity has increased by 15 per cent.’","Shocking figures show Britain is the fattest country in Europe .

The horse meat scandal has escalated after it emerged that Asda and the Co-op have been selling contaminated beef burgers. Four out of 17 burgers tested by the Co-op showed up positive for equine DNA, while one was as much as 17.7per cent horse meat. Similarly, four frozen burgers made for Asda were positive for trace levels of horse DNA. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Scandal: It has emerged today that Asda (pictured) and the Co-op have been selling beef burgers contaminated with horse meat . The news represents a major escalation of the food adulteration scandal, which has called into question whether supermarkets have any idea what goes in to their products. Concerns about illegal horse meat contamination of burgers first emerged two weeks ago when Tesco and Iceland were named as selling tainted burgers in the UK. Separately, these stores, together with Aldi and Lidl, were doing the same in their supermarkets in Ireland. Evidence emerged today that it is likely that tens of millions of burgers containing horse meat have been sold to British families since May of last year. The Co-op’s and Asda’s were manufactured by a company called Silvercrest, which is part of ABP Foods, based in County Monaghan in southern Ireland. The same company was also responsible for making contaminated burgers for Tesco, where the meat content was up to 29per cent horse. Contaminated: Concerns about illegal horse meat contamination of burgers first emerged two weeks ago when Tesco and Iceland were named as selling tainted burgers in the UK (file picture) Silvercrest also made cheap burgers for Burger King, which, to date, insists there is no evidence that its products were contaminated. One British company, Dalepak, which is also owned by ABP foods, produced burgers contaminated with horse DNA for Iceland from a factory in Yorkshire. Dalepak also makes cheap burgers for Waitrose, which denies that any of its products are tainted. The management of Silvercrest are being blamed for the contamination scandal after they decided to use a series of non-approved ingredients. These included large and cheap consignments of frozen blocks of meat off-cuts, including horse, imported from Poland. The Co-op's and Asda's contminated burgers were manufactured by Silvercrest, which is part of ABP Foods, based in County Monaghan in southern Ireland . Up until today, both Asda and the Co-op denied any link to horse meat contamination, however they had withdrawn products made by Silvercrest as a precautionary measure. Asda has attempted to play down the significance of the news, saying: ‘Four products, which were manufactured at the Silvercrest factory in Ireland have tested positive for very small trace elements of horse DNA, equivalent to a grain of salt in a bag of crisps, most likely as a result of cross contamination in the factory concerned. ‘We are continuing to investigate this… In the meantime none of the withdrawn products will be on our shelves and we will not be taking any further supplies from that factory. ‘Any customers that have concerns are welcome to bring the products back to store for a full refund.' The Co-op said: ‘We pride ourselves on the quality of the products we sell, and we are taking this matter very seriously. Burgers were pulled off the shelves at Tesco after the supermarket discovered that there were traces of horse meat in their products . ‘Whilst there are no safety issues involved, it is now apparent that some of the withdrawn products have not met the high standards we and our customers expect. We apologise for this. ‘We specify that all meat in our frozen burgers should be 100 per cent British, but we now strongly believe that some of the meat used to produce these burgers came from outside the UK and was not British in origin, and as a result we have taken the decision to delist Silvercrest as a supplier with immediate effect.’ Tesco today pointed the finger of blame at Silvercrest, saying it had no right to include imported meat off-cuts in its burgers. It said it had cancelled all contracts with the company. Its technical director, Tim Smith, said: ‘The evidence tells us that our frozen burger supplier, Silvercrest, used meat in our products that did not come from the list of approved suppliers we gave them. ‘Consequently we have decided not to take products from that supplier in future. We took that decision with regret but the breach of trust is simply too great.’ The chief executive of Silvercrest’s parent company, ABP, Paul Finnerty, said: ‘We have learnt important lessons from this incident and we are determined to ensure that this never happens again.‘We have already implemented total management change at the Silvercrest facility – which remains closed.’ Tesco Everyday Value beefburgers were removed after it was discovered they contained horse meat . The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has today said a mixture of beef and horse offcuts found in contaminated burgers sold in supermarkets could have been used for a year. The contaminated meat was in the form of blocks of frozen product from the Polish supplier which had been used for a year, FSA chief executive Catherine Brown told the Commons Environment Committee. Investigations are going on into how long contaminated meat might have been in use, Ms Brown told MPs. Asked how UK consumers could know if horse meat had not been in burgers 'for months, if not years', Ms Brown replied: 'We haven't (in the past) identified horsemeat in burgers as a likely significant risk in this country, and therefore it is possible... and that's why I'm saying that it's very important now that we get to the bottom of the Polish connection and the Irish investigation because it is possible that these burgers have been on sale in this country. 'The probable limit of possibility... is a year because it's been a year that this supplier has been supplying. 'And therefore when the Polish get to the bottom of this we will hope to know whether it's likely that this has been going on for a year.' Meat in Tesco burgers which was found to contain horse DNA did not come from a list of approved suppliers, the supermarket admitted today. The meat also came from outside the UK or Ireland, which was contrary to the supermarket's policy. The supermarket has vowed to introduce a DNA testing system on meat products to 'ensure the quality' of the food on its shelves in the wake of the scandal that has disgusted customers. Silvercrest, which is part of ABP Foods, is being blamed for using a series of non-approved ingredients, included frozen blocks of meat off-cuts, including horse, imported from Poland . Tesco was forced to issue a public apology earlier this month after tests in Ireland discovered traces of horse meat in three frozen beefburger lines. The findings sparked a national outcry and 10 million burgers were pulled from shelves as a result of the scandal. The supermarket launched an investigation into how the meat ended up in stores in the UK and Ireland on January 16. Today it promised to set a 'new standard' with the introduction of a testing system designed to detect 'any deviation from our high standards'. It issued a statement saying: 'We made a commitment to customers to investigate thoroughly and share the findings with them. Since then, we have been working hard to understand what happened and how we can stop it ever happening again.' It added: 'Ultimately Tesco is responsible for the food we sell, so it is not enough just to stop using the supplier. 'We have a well-equipped, expert technical team and world-class checks in place but we will not take anything for granted after this incident. 'It has shown that, in spite of our stringent tests, checks and controls there remained a small possibility that something could go wrong and it did. We want to stop it ever happening again, so we are taking action to reduce that possibility still further. 'To underpin the strong measures already in place, we will now introduce a comprehensive system of DNA testing across our meat products. This will identify any deviation from our high standards. 'These checks will set a new standard. 'It will be a significant investment for Tesco, borne by Tesco. We want to leave customers in no doubt that we will do whatever it takes to ensure the quality of their food and that the food they buy is exactly what the label says it is.'

The future of British energy supply . could be placed in Chinese hands after a major setback for the . Government’s nuclear plant building programme yesterday. Centrica had been planning to build four plants with the French supplier EDF, but has now pulled out of the partnership. EDF will now try to rescue the . multi-billion-pound scheme by casting around for a new partner, and is . talking to the Guangdong Nuclear Corporation, which is owned by the . Chinese government. Changes: Energy giant Centrica has pulled out of a deal to build four news nuclear power plants, including next to the existing Sizewell development on the Suffolk coast . If a deal went ahead, it would mean much of Britain’s future nuclear power supply would be controlled by a consortium which is owned by the governments of France and China. The building of nuclear power stations to replace existing ageing plants is central to Government energy policy. Without it, the country faces the prospect of a gap between energy demand and supply within 20 years and even possible blackouts. Centrica, which owns British Gas, was Britain’s only energy company with the financial resources and expertise to invest in building new nuclear power stations. Its decision to pull out was driven by concerns at the rise in costs following changes to regulations after Japan’s Fukushima disaster in 2011. A deal with EDF would have given Centrica a 20 per cent stake in two reactors at Hinckley Point, Somerset and two at Sizewell, Suffolk. Withdrawal: Sam Laidlaw, Chief Executive of Centrica, claims increased project costs and an extended construction timetable means they must pull out . The company will now write off some £200million that was spent developing the proposal for the stations. While Centrica will not be building . new nuclear reactors, it still retains a  20 per cent stake in eight . existing power stations, which are due for closure over the next 20 . years. Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw . said: ‘Since our initial investment, the anticipated costs have . increased and the construction timetable has extended by a number of . years. ‘These factors, in particular the . lengthening time frame for a return on the capital invested in a project . of this scale, have led us to conclude that participation is not right . for Centrica and our shareholders.’ Centrica is not alone in turning its . back on new nuclear plants. Last year, German power giants RWE and Eon . abandoned plans to build reactors here. The uncertainty has been fuelled by . questions over how to store the waste. Cumbria recently rejected a plan . to store it underground and no alternatives have been identified. Environmentalists believe the . Government should switch investment to alternatives, such as wind. However, building new wind farms is hugely expensive and reliant on . subsidies through customers’ bills. Despite the setback, the Government said it will press ahead with nuclear power. The Department of Energy and Climate . Change said: ‘We are determined to make the UK a leading global . destination for investment in new nuclear, which will play a key role in . our future energy mix. ‘The decision by Centrica reflects the company’s investment priorities and is not a reflection on UK government policy.’ Greenpeace policy director, Doug Parr, said: ‘The Centrica pull-out has exposed a very troubled UK energy strategy. ‘This Government’s relentless focus . on new nuclear has lost us years of investment in truly green energy and . it now needs a Plan B to deliver a clean, safe energy system – one that . doesn’t depend on deluded estimates of how much nuclear will get . built.’ The GMB union said the only option is . to nationalise nuclear power, bringing it under UK control, rather than . leaving it to the governments of France and China.",Owner of British Gas says projects are too expensive and will take too long .

Shrinking: Unilever has shrunk cans of deodorant from 150ml to 75ml to make packaging greener . The next time you buy a can of deodorant, don’t worry, you haven’t picked up the travel size by mistake. It really is meant to be that small – and it really is exactly the same price as the bigger one.From today, cans of Unilever deodorant, such as Sure and Dove, will be 75ml rather than 150ml. The firm has shrunk its packaging to make it greener. It claims the new cans will last just as long and deliver the same amount of deodorant as the old ones. The smaller cans contain less gas and . around a quarter less aluminium, so much less energy is used to make . them. They also take up less space, so transporting them takes a third . fewer lorries. Unilever . says its new ‘compressed aerosols’ are a packaging breakthrough, and are . good news for the planet because making and transporting them produces . fewer carbon emissions. Of course, they are also good news for Unilever, because its own costs will be reduced – but this saving will not be shared with customers. The recommended retail prices of the new smaller cans are exactly the same as the larger originals: £2.19 for Sure, £2.49 for Dove and £1.86 for its Vaseline spray. It follows a trend of big brands and supermarkets shrinking household name products while keeping the price the same, in what consumer groups claim is an underhand price hike. But Unilever says its changes are not part of the same tactic, as while the can is smaller it will deliver the same number of sprays as its larger predecessor. The secret to the new cans lies in the nozzle. First initiative: The company says they are the first to reduce packaging for aerosol deodorants since they were introduced and says the change will help reduce the amount of aluminium it uses by 24 tonnes a year in the UK alone . 'Compressed aerosols': Unilever says the secret to the new cans lies in the nozzle . Previously, reducing the amount of gas . would have resulted in blockages, but the new design prevents this . happening. The company is so confident in the cans that it is offering . to give customers their money back if they are not satisfied. Amanda Sourry, Unilever’s chairman . for the UK and Ireland, said: ‘Compressed aerosols provide consumers . with a product that lasts just as long as the previous one, and is more . sustainable. 'We are confident that this represents the beginning of a . revolution in deodorants, as people come to see the benefits of this new . packaging.’ The company . claims this is the first major initiative to reduce  packaging for . aerosol deodorants since they were introduced, in the late 1960s. It . says the change will help reduce the amount of aluminium it uses by 24 . tonnes a year in the UK alone. But the firm defended its decision not to . pass on the savings in materials and transport costs to shoppers, . saying developing the new cans had been expensive.

Hoey allegedly wasn't alarmed by Calo's condition and said 'he’d seen this before' and that she 'was going to be fine.' Victim: Calo, 41, collapsed and died after taking high-quality cocaine at a three-way sex party with Thomas Hoey and his former mistress Nicole Zobkiw . The banana mogul had sex with Zobkiw and then set his attention towards Calo, a personal trainer, said retired NYPD detective Edward Boyle, who investigated Calo's 2009 death. Hoey , pictured, refused pleas to call 911 even as her lips turned blue . Calo had first snorted the coke laying on a coffee table and when she went back for more, she began overdosing and 'her head dropped to the table with a thud,' Boyle told jurors at Manhattan federal court, where Zobkiw is on trial for making false statements and perjury. Zobkiw, 29, is accused of lying to a grand jury about the fatal party. Mr Hoey has not been charged. Boyle, who investigated the death, told the court that Mr Hoey had sex with both women and offered Calo cocaine using his business card, according to the New York Post. The Post quoted Boyle as saying that Calo began convulsing before 'her head dropped to the table with a thud. 'She was frothing at the mouth. Her eyes rolled back in her head. Her lips started turning blue,' he added. The court was told Zobkiw . attempted to get Hoey to call the emergency services but he refused, . allegedly telling her that Calo would be fine. She is seen in a security video going to the hotel reception three times to try and get help, Boyle said. Boyle told the court that Hoey assured Zobkiw that a 'doctor friend' was on the way. Zobkiw's lawyer Leonard Lato admitted his client had to tried to hide what happened on the night. But . she was intimidated two days before her grand jury testimony in 2011 by . a 'corrupt lawyer' allegedly linked to Hoey, Lato said. Scene: The wild sex party took place at a $700-a-night suite at The Kitano hotel on Park Avenue in Manhattan. Zobkiw ran to the reception desk three times as she tried to get help for Calo . Zobkiw was told she would not get custody of her son if she did not lie, Lato explained. The conversation was secretly recorded by her boyfriend, according to Lato, who told members of the jury 'your eyes are going to pop out of your head' when it is played. During opening statements, Manhattan federal prosecutor Margarat Garnett said Zobkiw told a 'string of lies' about the evening. She is accused of impeding an investigation into Calo's death by denying either woman had sex with Hoey or took cocaine. Federal agents launched an investigation into Hoey last year but no charges were brought. The company was founded in 1991 and employs between ten and 20 employees. According to Cortera business director, Long Island Banana has annual sales figures of under $500,000. The trial is expected to continue today.","Kimberley Calo, 41, died after consuming high-quality cocaine .

A HMRC crackdown on tax credit fraud and error missed its target 'by a mile', as tax bosses failed to stop losses of more than £850 million. Despite instigating a plan to tackle inefficiencies, error was still rife in the taxation system throughout 2010/11 as £2.27 billion was lost. Watchdogs criticised the failed approach, demanding that tax bosses 'get a grip' and saying that the money could have been spent on 'schools and hospitals'. Inefficiencies: Despite instigating a plan to tackle inefficiencies, £2.27billion was lost in 2010/11 due to tax credit error and fraud . There was also criticism of the system as it was revealed that the majority of the loss was due to error rather than fraud. HMRC had hoped to reduce losses by £1.4 billion in 2010/11 but was only able to reduce the total by £500million, despite deploying 400 staff to address systematic problems. While it was hoped that error and fraud rates would be cut from nine per cent to five per cent, the push only resulted in a decrease to 8.1 per cent. Action: Margaret Hodge, chair of the Commons public accounts committee, demanded that senior officials resolve the 'deeply worrying' issues . One fifth of all claims, an estimated 1.4 million, still resulted in people being overpaid. The National Audit Office said that there had been 'little progress' in dealing with . people failing to declare partners' income or in checking claimants' stated work and hours. The two areas accounted for £1 billion . of the fraud and error in 2010/11 while £640 million was down to . children being wrongly included in claims. The chair of the Commons public . accounts committee demanded that senior officials resolve the 'deeply worrying' issues. Labour MP Margaret Hodge said: 'It . set itself a target, which it missed by a mile. In 2010/11 error and . fraud was still at 8.1% with £2.27 billion lost to the taxpayer - £850 . million higher than expected and money that could have been spent on our . schools and hospitals. 'According to HMRC's own figures, the . majority of this £2.27 billion - £1.6 billion - was due to error rather . than fraud by claimants. She added: 'I also find it deeply worrying that even after HMRC has taken action, one in five claims still contain error or fraud.' Mrs Hodge did draw attention to some signs of improvement, . noting that HMRC had 'tried to be smarter and sharper'. But she said there was 'little progress' elsewhere, adding: 'HMRC needs to develop a rigorous plan for . rooting out error and fraud in each and every category if it is to . achieve a sustainable reduction in losses. 'It needs to inject much more rigour . into its collection and analysis of data, particularly around changes in . claimants' circumstances, where mistakes are most likely to be made.' HMRC had hoped to reduce losses by £1.4 billion in 2010/11 but was only able to prevent £500million, despite deploying 400 staff to address systematic problems . Mrs Hodge warned HMRC not to 'take its eye off the ball', despite the fact that tax credits are to be . replaced by a new universal credit. Tax credit payments are based on estimates of income - which critics say leaves the system 'wide open to abuse'. HMRC estimates that up to £4 billion . of tax credit debt is unlikely ever to be recovered and has already been . forced to write-off large sums. NAO head Amyas Morse, who last year declined to sign off HMRC's accounts because of tax credit fraud and error, said it faced 'significant challenges'. 'The tax credit system is complicated, and HMRC will have to overcome significant challenges if it is going to achieve value for money. 'HMRC deserves credit for demonstrating innovation, but it has further to go to achieve sustainable reductions in tax credits error and fraud. 'To tackle error and fraud effectively, there needs to be an improved understanding of risks and better use of information.'","£2.27billion lost in 2010/11 due to tax credit fraud and error despite efforts to curb losses .

"By . Tamara Cohen and Keith Gladdis . PUBLISHED: . 19:17 EST, 7 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:16 EST, 8 February 2013 . Ministers were last night accused of breaking promises to reduce plastic bag usage and its devastating impact on the environment by appearing to dismiss calls to charge a small fee. Despite growing momentum to introduce a charge for the bags, Richard Benyon said it ‘may not be the best option’ due to ‘pressures on household budgets’. Measures to slash the billions of carrier bags handed out by retailers every year were backed by David Cameron, Nick Clegg and then prime minister Gordon Brown when the Mail launched its ‘Banish the Bags’ campaign in 2008. Death at sea: Ministers were accused of failing to reduce plastic bag usage and its impact on the environment, such as this turtle entangled in a bag, by appearing to dismiss calls to charge a small fee . Usage initially dropped by 14 per cent, but the issue was then kicked into the long grass by the Coalition and in 2011 350million more bags were handed out. Mr Cameron responded by issuing an ultimatum to supermarkets ordering them to deliver significant falls in numbers or be forced to by law. 'Banish the bags': Despite momentum to introduce a charge for plastic bags, Richard Benyon said it 'may not be the best option' due to 'pressures on household budgets' A poll last year found a majority of the public would back a charge. However Mr Benyon – the minister in . charge of the natural environment – laid out objections on cost grounds, . despite research showing a fee would make people re-use bags and . therefore escape the charge. The Coalition has also raised a plethora of unavoidable green taxes which put a far heavier burden on family finances. Just . three months ago farming minister David Heath said a charge – which has . been successfully introduced in Wales at 5p, is coming to Northern . Ireland in April and is being consulted on in Scotland – would change . behaviour in ‘that very large middle group who want to do the right . thing and feel guilty when they do not’. Campaigners say plastic . carriers are used for an average of just 20 minutes but damage the . environment for hundreds of years, killing birds and wildlife which . ingest them and blighting beaches. Dr Sue Kinsey, senior pollution policy adviser at the Marine Conservation Society, said: ‘We are absolutely astounded that Richard Benyon has come to this decision. 'Our research shows that bag charging is popular and effective.’ Tory MP Zac Goldsmith who backs a charge, said: ‘I understand the Treasury's reluctance, but it is important to recognise that no one is asking for a tax. 'This would be a simple levy that shoppers can easily avoid, and which would be distributed to community groups, not the Government. Wherever it has been applied, it is popular and effective. ‘If Columbus had dropped plastic bags over the side of his boat 500 years ago, there’s a pretty good chance they would still be floating around intact today.  We are an extraordinarily wasteful country and of all the waste we generate, the plastic bag is surely the most idiotic.’ Green MP Caroline Lucas accused the Government of ‘betraying its promise’ to take action and said the Mail’s campaign had ‘demonstrated the level of public support for such a measure’. Adam Royle of the Campaign to Protect Rural England said taxpayers already foot a huge bill for councils to clear up littered bags. He said: ‘Carrier bags are not a free resource. Littered carrier bags find their way everywhere – becoming unsightly and horrible eye-sores right across our countryside, and causing horrible harm to wildlife. This is the real price that is being paid.’ A poll by Break the Bag Habit found 75 per cent of people think a bag charge would cut usage and help to protect the environment, and most -56 per cent – backed a small 5p charge. It is understood the Treasury wanted to block a charge which could raise millions of pounds a year for good causes. The Environment Department, Defra, insist they have not made a decision yet and are still monitoring the situation in other parts of the UK while ‘considering all the relevant factors, including the pressure on household budgets at this time’. A Number 10 source denied the idea had been axed and said it was ‘still on the table, and we are looking closely at the situation in other parts of the UK’. Taxpayers will foot most of a £95,000 bill for a garden featuring an ‘avenue of dead trees’ to educate the public about plant diseases. Defra will use the cash for the feature at the Chelsea Flower Show in May – despite cuts to flood defences and animal disease controls. Critics called it a ‘cock-eyed’ plan considering 60 experts in forest research have been sacked as part of government cost-cutting.

The trial aims to find out if people will do their washing on 'green' days when it is windy . Windy days have always been the time to do your washing, washerwomen of old hanging out clothes in the breeze so they dried quicker. And that tradition is set to continue long into the future - because putting the washing machine on could be cheaper when it is windy. Energy firms are trying out a system which alerts customers when electricity prices are cheaper because wind conditions mean green power is cheap and plentiful. ‘Day ahead electricity alerts’ send text messages to customers or put an alert of their smart meter so they know to put their washing on. The year-long trial - conducted by Imperial College London, EDF Energy and UK Power Networks - aims to find out whether people are prepared to do their washing, tumble drying, and other electricity intensive tasks on windy days. The researchers have recruited 1,000 people for the trial, which could pave the way for firms to introduce new tariffs that encourage customers to make use of electricity at times when energy is at its cheapest or demand is at lowest. The Energy Saving Trust estimate that customers can save £250 on their energy bill by using appliances differently. Goran Strbac, Professor of Electrical and Electronic Energy Systems at Imperial, said it could save the whole country money and carbon by using electricity more efficiently. ‘It is crucial that we understand the role that residential consumers can play in the development of smarter electricity systems that will facilitate cost-effective evolution to a low carbon future,’ he said. But not everyone is convinced the system will save much money. John Constable, Direct of think tank . Renewable Energy Foundation, said building wind turbines has already . added money to people’s bills - and putting washing in on a windy day . will not make up for that cost. The Energy Saving Trust estimates that people could save £250 by being more efficient . He said: ‘This sort of research should have started years ago, before the wind policies got under way, and, though interesting, the announcement is a clear case of too little too late. ‘National Grid is already constraining Scottish wind farms off the system at significant cost to the consumer, and the market data shows that Grid is bracing itself to constrain large offshore wind farms in English waters, such as the London Array, Greater Gabbard, and Thanet, to protect the system in the near future. This will be expensive.’","Energy firms are to let customers know when it is cheapest to do their washing .

The island thought to have inspired The Wicker Man goes on sale for £2.6million after the locals say they cannot repopulate it. The current two owners of Tanera Mor, the largest of the Summer Isles in Scotland, have had no luck arranging a community buy out that could have seen people move on to the 800-acre isle. The local community on the nearby mainland at Achiltibuie in Wester Ross have decided that re-populating the island is too much to take on. Island home: The two owners of Summer Isle Tanera Mor have had no luck arranging a community buyout that could have seen people living on the 800-acre island . The island, which in 1881 had no fewer than 118 residents, is thought to be the set inspiration featured in pagan cult film The Wicker Man which was set on an isolated island, although the 1973 movie was filmed in Galloway and Plockton. Mr Iain Muir, chairman of the Coigach Community Development Company who was given the first opportunity to buy the island on behalf of residents, said the community already had two renewable energy schemes and a possible buyout of a former smokehouse already on its plate. Mr Muir, whose grandmother used to teach on the island, said: ‘People realised it was a good opportunity but the community is spread to thinly in its resources to take it on. ‘The decision was taken with a heavy heart not to pursue the very generous offer. Tanera is so important to the community - economically, socially and environmentally. Needs people: Once home to up to 118 people, residents of the nearby mainland say re-populating the island is too much for them to take on . ‘It is very much part of the community. Its future is in everybody’s interests. We are hoping the island will now go to a buyer who realises they are part of a vibrant community. Consultant, Munro Gauld, carried out a ‘quick options appraisal’ on Tanera Mor to help the community make an informed decision. Mr Gauld said: ‘Nobody wants to live on an island on their own - unless they are Robinson Crusoe and even he needed Man Friday. ‘And the Scottish Government would not fund a holiday home island full of holiday lets. Where is the public benefit in that? ‘So the island needs people to live there. There has been some positive ideas, tinged with realism, including its management. The world’s changed since the island was evacuated in the 1930s - around the same time as St Kilda but with broadband you can work anywhere. Heart of the community: Mr Iain Muir, chairman of the Coigach Community Development Company, said the island's future was in everybody's interests . ‘The valuation is a big stumbling block. It would swallow up this year’s land fund in one go.’ With residents to move ‘offshore,’ it was one of the most unusual community buyouts ever proposed. It would have been taxpayer-funded under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. A £6m land fund which will help more rural communities buy their land was launched last year by the Scottish Government. Mr Gauld also carried out the feasibility study for the proposed community buyout of Scalpay in the Western Isles where English businessman Fred Taylor had offered inhabitants the island for free. All residents left in 1931 and permanent habitation has been intermittent since then. Many of the old cottages have been renovated and are now used as holiday accommodation. Island inspiration: Tanera Mor is thought to have inspired 1973 pagan cult movie The Wicker Man, starring Christopher Lee (pictured), although it was filmed in Galloway and Plockton . Tanera Mor is also home to a salmon fish farm, a small sailing school, a cafe and a post office, which has operated its own local post and printed its own stamps since 1970. The island has no roads.Ironically the area around Achiltibuie, home to about 260 people, is not community-owned and is spread out mainly on two private estates. Lizzie and Richard Williams, Tanera Mor’s two residents, took over running the island from Lizzie’s family, the Wilders who bought the island in 1996 after selling their dairy farm in Wiltshire. Bill and Jean Wilder passed the title of Tanera Mor on to their three offspring - Jack, Harry and Lizzie - in 2010. Now that all three siblings have their own young families, they took the decision to approach the community to discuss the possibility of a community buyout. Tanera Mor is also notable as the location for Frank Fraser Darling’s book Island Years.","The 800-acre isle Tanera Mor is the largest of the Summer Isles in Scotland .

Surrounded by her four grown-up children, Jackie Meacock poses for the sort of snapshot seen in countless family photo albums. They had all just been out for dinner together and enjoyed an evening filled with laughter, jokes and treasured memories. Yet hours after this picture was taken, Mrs Meacock, her children again by her side, ended her own life in a Dignitas clinic in Switzerland. Our last night: Jackie Meacock (second from right) with her children (from left) Caron, David, Donella and Nina . The constant pain of dystonia, an incurable nerve condition, meant the 71-year-old grandmother felt life was no longer living. Recalling their last evening together, her daughter Donella Trickey, 47, said her mother had enjoyed herself so much she had stayed up late and had seconds of her favourite pudding, crème brûlée. ‘It was a lovely night – it was quite an informal meal as that is what we are like as a family, so there were no speeches or anything like that. ‘We all had cocktails, and we laughed and shared stories about ourselves. ‘We even played dare games and Mum was telling us stories. We wanted to keep the mood light.’ The next day, however, that fun-filled night seemed a lifetime ago. Jackie Meacock (right) and her daughter Donella pose for a photo outside Dignitas . Mrs Trickey, from Brighton, her sisters Caron Gill, 53, and Nina Sloper, 51, and their brother David Sloper, 44, accompanied their mother on the short journey from their hotel in Zurich to the Dignitas clinic on September 13 last year. ‘Mum held my hand so tightly,’ Mrs Trickey recalled. ‘Nobody said a word all the way to the clinic. We just sat in silence. There was part of me still thinking “this isn’t happening”. It was hard to come to terms with the fact we were going to leave her there.’ Her mother, however, was thinking of more immediate matters. ‘Mum went into practical mode,’ Mrs Trickey said. ‘She started taking all her rings off and gave them to us. She gave me her wedding ring. ‘She checked who was going to take her purse and who was going to take her shoes. It was difficult. Mum came with a bag full of stuff, and she wasn’t coming home.’ Mrs Meacock, a grandmother of nine and great-grandmother of six, paid £10,000 for an assisted suicide and cremation package at Dignitas. She made the decision after her struggle to cope with her condition became too much and she tried unsuccessfully to take her own life. That resulted in her being taken to hospital and sectioned as mentally ill. But her daughter insisted: ‘Mum didn’t have mental health issues. She wanted to die with dignity. And she got her final wish.’ Mrs Meacock’s family meant everything to her, and she’d tried to hide the pain for more than a decade. ‘She was very outgoing, very family-oriented and she worked all her life,’ her daughter said. She said her mother had been a security manager who spent 25 years ‘chasing shoplifters’. At home she was ‘always there with lots of hugs’. Despite her sunny nature, the agony of dystonia, which made her body twist and muscles go into spasm, left her life a misery. ‘It was relentless. She was exhausted with it. Her face was etched with pain. Over the last few years it got worse. Happier times: Mrs Meacock with her daughters at Christmas in 1968. Her family meant everything to her and she'd tried to hid the pain for more than a decade . ‘She couldn’t even watch TV. She had to sit in a certain direction because her head veered that way,’ Mrs Trickey said. And when Mrs Meacock’s husband Tony died of leukaemia in 2011, her grief made her physical pain all the more difficult to bear. By the start of 2012 she was on daily painkillers, including liquid morphine. As the months progressed, she could do less and less. Driving was impossible and even a shopping trip resulted in her giving up in tears after half an hour. That was the trigger that convinced her she no longer had any quality of life and she tried to commit suicide in April last year. When that attempt failed, Mrs Meacock was taken to hospital and sectioned as mentally ill. Her family challenged the ruling and she was discharged from a secure unit after two weeks but remained terrified of being sent back to hospital. Mrs Meacock paid £10,000 for an assisted suicide and cremation package at Dignitas (one building pictured) When the opportunity to go to Dignitas came up, she decided the time was right. Mrs Trickey described her mother’s last moments at the clinic. ‘We all went into the lovely gardens and took photos and had lots of hugs. And then Mum said: “I am ready now, I want to do this now”. ‘She had to drink this horrible liquid in one go. ‘It tasted disgusting so as soon as she knocked it back she asked for chocolate and drank some water. ‘And then she said, “I’m feeling really sleepy. I love you all”. Within two minutes she was asleep. It was exactly what she wanted. ‘Quick, peaceful and dignified. It wasn’t about us... it was all about Mum. ‘I am happy she is free of pain. Death is something we all face. For some people it’s about how long you can live, but for other people it isn’t. ‘They want quality of life, and without that quality, there is no life.’","Jackie Meacock suffered from dystonia - an incurable nerve condition .

Swirling darkly over the sea, this twister has the power to toss aside swimmers, boats and even aircraft that cross its path. But for the sailors on board the towering column of water wasn’t a Hollywood film - but nature at its most terrifying. This enormous water tornado passed off the Italian coast, narrowly avoiding hitting a giant container ship. Close call: This twister passed so close to the ship pictured that it appeared to be towering over it . The tornadoes, known also as water spouts, are a serious marine hazard and can pose a deadly threat to boats, swimmers and even aircraft in their path. Inside the twister, winds reach speeds of up to 80 miles an hour. Sea-life has been known to be sucked up and dumped on land. Dwarfed by the enormous dark grey vortex of water the ship escaped the potentially deadly impact by minutes, witnesses said. Photographer Francesco Magoga, who captured the remarkable image off the coast of Genoa in north-west Italy, said: ‘ It must have been this captain’s lucky day, as the tanker only missed it by ten minutes’. Near miss: Water spouts are a serious marine hazard and can pose a deadly threat to boats and swimmers . Waterspouts are a natural phenomenon that occurs when tornadoes form over oceans, lakes and rivers. They number about 15 a year in Italy, with around 160 across Europe. The intense funnels are formed when layers of cool air blowing over the water cause warm, moist air to sweep up from underneath, forming a column of condensation.","Water spouts are a serious marine hazard and pose a deadly threat to anything in their path .

A storm has blown up over the name of the huge nor'easter that dumped up to 40 inches of snow on the north-eastern U.S. in the last few days. The Weather Channel (TWC) began naming winter storms in October. This one was christened Nemo, bringing up images of the cute orange fish in the Disney/Pixar film Finding Nemo. While the name Nemo was widely used on social media, including by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, other meteorologists are refusing to use it. They claim that only hurricanes and tropical storms should be named and that this is a PR stunt by The Weather Channel. Finding Nemo? This 'snowfish' appeared during the nor'easter that dropped up to 40 inches of snow on the north-eastern U.S. But many meteorologists don't think the name Nemo should be used at all . The National Weather Service (NWS), the official government agency, is responsible for naming tropical storms, which then keep their names if they develop into hurricanes. And the NWS is refusing to acknowledge The Weather Channel's monikers for winter storms. On Thursday a . spokesman said: 'We never have, nor do we have any plans to . consider naming winter storms.' A spokeswoman told The Verge: 'The Weather Channel started naming winter storms, that's their . project,' she said. The NWS also put out a statement explaining their policy: 'The National Weather Service does not name . winter storms because a winter storm's impact can vary from one . location to another, and storms can weaken and redevelop, making it . difficult to define where one ends and another begins.' Yet the name Nemo was widely used in many places, including by New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, and on Twitter. Albert Brooks, the actor who voiced Nemo’s dad, Marlin, in the hit film, tweeted: 'They have named this new nor’easter Nemo. I am not looking for it.' Whatever you call it, the winter storm blanketed the north-eastern states in snow. Here, the thaw begins on cars parked at a dealership in Hartford, Connecticut on Sunday February 10 . TWC started naming winter storms in October, claiming that attaching a name would raise awareness about the dangers of extreme weather. 'The fact is that Twitter needs a hashtag,' Bryan Norcross, a TWC meteorologist responsible for winter weather, told the New York Times recently. But others were annoyed by The Weather Channel taking it upon itself to name storms. As reported by the LA Times, Joel . Meyer, founder of AccuWeather, issued a statement in fall criticizing the Weather Channel . for its actions. 'In unilaterally deciding to name winter . storms, the Weather Channel has confused media spin with science and . public safety,' Meyer said. 'We have explored this issue for 20 years and . have found that this is not good science and will mislead the public. Winter storms are very different from hurricanes.' Nearly two feet of snow blanketed Massachusetts, including a bank of pay phones on Boston Common in front of the Statehouse . George Wright, a meteorologist at Wright Weather Consulting, said: 'A named storm should be a hurricane, and . only a hurricane. 'A hurricane is something . that's more unusual and devastating. If you start naming other storms, . people will suddenly think this might be a hurricane.' The LA Times reported Thomas Downs, a meteorologist with Weather 2000, saying: 'This is more of a PR stunt by the Weather Channel. It's not something the government is running with. 'There's not really a hold-fast criteria to determine when to name it like there is with hurricanes and tropical storms.' Downs suggested that stations owned by NBC Universal, which also owns The Weather Channel, would be most likely to use Nemo to describe the storm. Indeed, NBC Universal channel MSNBC did use the name, while rivals Fox News and CNN both called it a . 'monster storm' or a 'winter storm': . If you were able to enjoy it, like this family in Boston, the snow created a winter wonderland . Local CBS affiliate WFSB in Connecticut called the . storm Blizzard Charlotte, keeping with a long-standing station . tradition of naming major winter storms affecting the state that dates . back to the early 1970s. In relations to the name Nemo itself, Mr Norcross told the New York Times that 'Nemo is a Latin word.' Norcross helped designate storm names at The Weather Channel last year and said that the translation ('no one' or 'no man') was inspiration for the choice rather the film. Norcross also claims that Captain . Nemo, the memorable character from Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand . Leagues Under the Sea' also came up in discussions. 'Captain Nemo was a . pretty tough, fierce guy,' Mr . Norcross said.

Actor William Shatner has attacked social news network Reddit, accusing it of allowing racism, bigotry and sexism, in a post on the site itself. The Star Trek legend, who joined the online community after a Q&A session in January, posted a request to turn off private messages from users which turned into a full-blown hit on the site's hands-off approach to moderating its content. The 81-year-old Canadian said he was appalled that 'horrifically racist, sexist, homophobic, ethnic' posts were ignored. Appalled: William Shatner, pictured with his wife, Elizabeth in 2005, has hit out at social news network Reddit for not moderating its content, leaving it open to racism, sexism and homophobia . Reddit is an online community where users are free to share links and post commentary on any subject. William Shatner has been a member since he took part in an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session in the Star Trek subreddit in January. He posted a post entitled 'turning off private messages' on Saturday asking for a way to avoid receiving private messages from users, having been swamped with emails from fans asking for autographs and favours. His attack came in the comment field below after a fellow Reddit user pointed out some of the 'unsavoury aspects' of the site. Mr Shatner wrote: 'I am apalled (sic) by some of the immature, horrifically racist, sexist, homophobic, ethnic... etc.. posts that are just ignored here. Why are these accounts still active?' Trekkie fans: William Shatner, famous for his role as Captain Kirk in Star Trek, became a Reddit user for a Q&A session last month and, unlike many celebrities who part-take in such, has remained an active member . 'While Reddit has done well in getting . interest from the mainstream I just wonder if by allowing these children . to run rampant and post whatever they feel will cause the most . collateral damage if Reddit is biting off it's own nose in taking that . step to become a mainstream community.' Reddit users were quick to hit back . at Shatner, saying censorship through moderation goes against the sites policies and that internet . hate is a downside of freedom of speech. User 'froggymorning' said the hateful . posts would not be tolerated offline and ‘would earn you swift action . from your parents’ if said in public, but added that ‘the internet has . no parents and is a relatively free speech zone.’ Reddit is a social news website which uses the slogan Front Page of the Internet. It functions like a mass blog which you can browse both as a user and as a non-user. Contributors' posts can be a news story, a link, a picture, a written piece etc, and is then given up- or down-votes by others regulating which posts become a 'hot topic' and move up on the site. The comments on a post are organised in best, top, new, hot, controversial and old. There are also forum-like categories for posts on a specific subject which are called subreddits. These can be created by a user and come in a wide variety of topics such as Star Wars, world news, gif-images and gaming. There are currently over 67,000 different subreddits on the site. Others took a more hardline stand in defending Reddit. ‘Nothing . on Reddit is a “free speech zone”,’ replied user NOT_ACTUALLYRELEVANT, . explaining that it is up to the creator of a subreddit to ban re-posts . from the forum to Facebook or Gawker, giving users and moderators the . opportunity to censor racial hatred, homophobia and sexism. 'This idea of freedom of speech on Reddit, a privately-owned website, is bulls***.’ Mr Shatner replied that Reddit was the first ‘mainstream site’ to allow ‘racists and other hate mongers to group, congregate, incite and spread their hatred. ‘What mainstream sites do you think are more racist?' ‘The fact that someone could come here, debase and degrade people based on race, religion, ethnicity or sexual preference because they “have a right” to do so without worry of any kind of moderation is sending the wrong message, in my humble opinion.’ ‘I don’t pretend to know where the managers of Reddit wish to go with this site but embracing that kind of culture I feel is counterproductive to where this world is heading and I think that is probably hurting this site.’ Others . sympathised wholeheartedly with Mr Shatner saying freedom of speech is . being used as an excuse to get away with anything from sexism to . inciting hatred and using slurs against users who dare criticise. ‘I . love Reddit, but it's wearing me thin,’ wrote raegunXD. ’R/WTF is one . of the worst. I once saw a picture of a person's 14 year old cousin's . still born baby posted there.' Free speech: Reddit has over 67,0000 categorised forums for specific interests, known as subreddits, the topic and moderation of which were questioned by Mr Shatner . Reddit calls itself ‘a pretty open . platform and free speech place’ and uses a handful of rules and a . reddiquette which it asks its users to abide by. It’s reddiquette section asks members . to ‘remember the human’ and consider the person behind the online . moniker they are addressing and ask themselves ‘Would I say it to the . person's face?’ or ‘Would I get jumped if I said this to a buddy?’ Reddit has previously found its moderation policies scrutinized, in particular the case of the exposure of one of its moderators Michael Brutsch who posted on the site under the moniker 'violentacrez'. Mr Brutsch, a 49-year-old computer programmer, contributed anonymously as 'violentacrez' to a number of controversial subreddits devoted to explicit materials and was the creator of subreddit r/jailbait which was dedicated to posting provocative pictures of teenagers. The thread was shut down after journalist Anderson Cooper condemned it on his CNN show Anderson Cooper 360 in late 2011, after which 'sexually suggestive content featuring minors' was officially banned from the site. Mr Brutsch's identity was exposed by blog Gawker in October last year as it questioned the site's decision to give moderator status to a user who posted explicit and sexist material, and as a result Mr Brutsch lost his job.","Star Trek legend Shatner joined social news network in January .

The toilets are also not working meaning that passengers have had to make do with bags or buckets. Help is on the way: In this image released by the U.S. Coast Guard on, a small boat belonging to the Coast Guard Cutter Vigorous patrols near the cruise ship Carnival Triumph in the Gulf of Mexico . Assistance: The U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Vigorous closes in on the Carnival Triumph cruise ship . Not smiling anymore: Brent Nutt, husband of Carnival cruise passenger Bethany Nutt, both pictured here, said that fights were breaking out over food onboard the nightmare holiday ship. Disabled: The Carnival Triumph sits without power in the Gulf of Mexico . Brent Nutt, whose wife Bethany is on board, claimed that brawling had started because some passengers have got so hungry and food is so scarce. At least one person has also been transferred off the ship because they are in need of dialysis and can't wait for the power to come back on. The Carnival Triumph was left stranded 150 miles off the coast of Mexico after a fire broke out in the engine room. By Monday afternoon, some of the ship's power had been restored, but not enough to get the disabled ship moving again. Although none of the 3,150 passengers and 1,100 crew were injured, the ship was adrift off southern Yucatan peninsula for an entire day before a tugboat arrived. The Carnival Triumph, owned by Carnival Cruise Lines, is now being taken to Mobile, Alabama, where it is expected to arrive on Thursday, the company's President and CEO, Gerry Cahill, said in a statement. Mr Cahill added: 'All guests on the current Carnival Triumph voyage will receive a full refund for the cruise, along with transportation expenses. Getting a tow: The ship is now being taken to Progreso, Mexico, where it is expected to arrive on Wednesday afternoon . Not so triumphant: The Carnival Triumph cruise ship, with over 4,000 people on board, was adrift for a day off the coast of Mexico after an engine room fire . 'In addition, they will receive a . future cruise credit equal to the amount paid for this voyage, as well . as reimbursement of all shipboard purchases during the voyage, with the . exception of gift shop and casino charges.'

Our shipboard and shoreside teams are working around the clock to care for our guests and get them home safely.' Mr Nutt, of Angleton, Texas, said his . wife called him to say the plumbing wasn't working - but he was . horrified by what he heard next. He told CNN: 'She said that that would be the last phone call I was going to get. They have no power, there's no way to charge cell phones or anything. 'To hear your loved one crying saying she just wants off of the ship and it all to end. 'All of the girls in their group were calling their family members as well and they were crying. Everybody wants off of this. 'It's a big mess, there's no power, there's no toilets, there's no food - it's like a bunch of savages on there. 'People are fighting over food and stuff - that's a bunch of savages. It's ridiculous. 'Carnival has nothing at all in plan in case something like this happens.' Asked if his wife had been given any help, Mr Nutt said: 'The only help they've got is that they told them they needed to stay on the decks or in common areas' Writing on Cruise Critic, a cruise blog, user Clinty76, whose wife and mother-in-law are on the ship, painted a similar picture. Stagnant: Carnival says that none of the passengers are in danger and that many of the toilets are being brought back online . No shock: Previous passengers of the Carnival Triumph said the were not surprised, citing engine trouble on past journeys. The ship's troubles on this trip has left passengers fighting over food and toilets and sleeping in tents on the decks to get out of their sweltering, air conditioner-less cabins . All safe: No person was injured in the incident but relatives of passengers described tearful phone calls with sobbing loved ones stuck onboard . He wrote that they told him: 'We are about to get supplies from another cruise ship and apparently the tug boats should be here tomorrow around noon. 'We have no power AT ALL, which means we can't use the toilets, wash our hands, or take a shower.' On USA Today, Gary Keyes of Baton Rouge, La, wrote: 'My wife (is) on this cruise and has said the conditions were horrible. No power, no water, having to use the bathroom in bags'. Carnival said that none of the passengers are in danger and that many of the toilets are being brought back online. It also said that some power has been restored to the buffet, meaning that limited food and hot coffee service is being offered. The engine room fire, which took place on Sunday morning, was quickly contained thanks to the automatic fire extinguishing system and but the ship was left to operate on emergency generator power, Carnival Cruise Lines said in a statement. This is the latest commercial catastrophe to hit Carnival Cruise Lines, which reported it's 'most challenging year' in the history of the company in 2012. In January last year, the Costa Concordia, a 114,500 ton luxury cruise ship operated by the Carnival-owned Costa Cruises, ran aground and sank off the Tuscan island of Giglio in Italy, killing 32 people. Last month, Costa Cruises said Italian investigators were looking into Carnival Cruise Lines' potential responsibility for the shipwreck. The company lost more than $310 million in full-year revenues compared to 2011 and although bookings for 2013 were at the same capacity as previous years, the company has been forced to lower their prices. The Carnival Triumph set sail from Galveston, Texas, on Thursday, and was due back on today. However, recent travelers with the Carnival Triumph were not surprised, San Fransisco Gate reported. Cruise fans took to Twitter and online forums saying recent trips with the vessel had been plagued by engine problems with some experiencing delays and others prevented from reaching their destination. A Carnival official told the paper that he was uncertain of problems on previous cruises. Carnival said all passengers would receive a refund and ‘cruise credit equal to the amount paid for this voyage’ and the next two voyages for the ship has been cancelled.","More than 4,000 people, including 3,143 passengers, were stranded Sunday on Carnival cruise in Gulf of Mexico .

It cost £25million, weighs 1,300 tons and was part of Iran's masterplan to double its natural gas production by the summer. So when this vast rig plunged below the waves of the Persian Gulf in just 30 seconds, witnesses could only watch in horror. They were, however, the lucky ones. Colleagues perched on top of the towering metal platform were forced to scramble upwards before diving into the choppy waters in a desperate bid to survive. Some were still clinging to it as it went down though it is believed no-one suffered serious injury or died. Scroll down for video . Mayday, mayday: The gas rig is already well on its way into the Persian Gulf and the men can be seen scrambling in order to get off in time . The accident took place in the vast South Pars gas field, located in the Persian Gulf between Iran and Qatar, last month after a crane broke during installation. It is thought that the water at the spot where the gas rig sank is over 260ft deep. Iran has called for foreign help in raising the platform, a rare request by an industry isolated by international sanctions. Ahmad Qalebani, managing director of the National . Iranian Oil Company, said assessments indicated the jacket had not been seriously damaged and could be recovered. An official with Pars Oil and Gas Company, Sepehr Sepehri, earlier told Iranian news agency Mehr that crisis groups had been set up on the site and in Tehran and that steps to recover the giant structure could begin when the weather and sea conditions improved.

Lydia Bradford was murdered around 12pm on January 21, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, after a man with a gun burst inside her Cocoa, Florida, apartment and fired shots at her and her mother. At the time, Bradford’s three daughters, ages 7, 4 and 1, were playing with a friend in a front room near the entranceway as neighbors were on their way over with a birthday cake. Murder victim: Lydia Bradford was shot and killed around 12pm on January 21, Martin Luther King Jr. Day as she was preparing for her 7-year-old daughter's birthday party . Tragic: Bradford¿s three daughters, ages 7, 4 and 1, were playing with a friend in a front room near the entranceway when an armed man came into the apartment . The armed man entered the front door, which had been left open, scaring the girls away, police told NBC News. As the unidentified man moved into the apartment, the girls reportedly ran to a neighbor's home to get help. While the children nervously tried to explain what had happened, gunshots rang out. The intruder sprayed gunfire at Bradford and her mother, Equaller, 58, in the back of their apartment. Equaller Bradford was hit in the face and chest and stumbled outside where she collapsed on the front lawn, police said. Inside the apartment, Bradford reportedly lay severely wounded, bleeding from her upper body. Caring mother: Bradford, a single mother, grew up in the area and studied at a nursing school aimed at helping young women get their careers on the right track, a relative told reporters . Goodbyes: Bradford's grieving family members buried her on Saturday, February 2. Neighbors who had heard the gunshots told police they saw a man run from the scene, leap over a wooden fence and disappear. One of the neighbors dialed 911. ‘I got a lady laying out on the lawn out here,’ he told a dispatcher. ‘They're saying there's a lady shot inside.’ Another man called 911 from Bradford's apartment and asked for an ambulance to come immediately. ‘Please hurry,’ he said. The dispatcher reported that he heard a woman howling in the background, ‘She's dead, she's dead.’ The dispatcher asked who did it and the woman yelled back, ‘a man with a ski mask on his face came and opened that door and just shot 'em.’ Medics loaded Equaller Bradford onto a helicopter to take her to a nearby hospital. Police searched the Central Florida neighbourhood by helicopter and on foot, using dogs to trace the killer's path along the fence. The dogs lost the scent, but police found a discarded handgun. The gun is now being examined to determine if it was the murder weapon, and if it will lead police to the killer. No arrests have been made. Family woman: When she wasn't working, Bradford focused on family events, including cookouts, card games and kids' birthday parties, her relatives said . Bradford's grieving family members buried her on Saturday, February 2. Her mother remained in intensive care in the hospital, and could not attend the funeral service. Those who did attend included the lead detective on the case, who ‘was devastated’ by the sight of the weeping daughters, said Cocoa police spokeswoman Barbara Matthews. ‘Our investigators have taken this case so personally,’ she said. Bradford was one of at least 91 people killed by gunfire in the U.S. during Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend, NBC reports. Her tragic death came as the nation continues to debate gun rights in the aftermath of the December 14 massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. Bradford, a single mother, grew up in the area and studied at a nursing school aimed at helping young women get their careers on the right track, a relative told reporters.

For the first time, NASA's rover Curiosity used its on-board drill to collect a sample of Martian bedrock that might offer evidence of a long-gone wet environment, the U.S. space agency said last night. Drilling down 2.5 inches - 6.4 cm - into a patch of sedimentary bedrock, Curiosity collected the rock powder left by the drill and will analyze it using its own laboratory instruments, NASA said in a statement. This is the first time a robot has drilled to collect a Martian sample. First sample: Nasa's rover Curiosity has drilled a hole 2.5inches deep to take a Martian planet sample . Groundbreaking: The rover Curiosity is the first ever robot to drill for a Martian sample. The rock powder left by the drive will be analysed using instruments on the robot . John Grunsfeld, NASA associate administrator for the agency's Science Mission Directorate said: 'The most advanced planetary robot ever designed is now a fully operating analytical laboratory on Mars.' The hole can be seen in pictures taken by Curiosity next to a shallower test hole nearby. As images from the drilling operation streamed to Earth, some team members shared their excitement on social media. The 'full drill hole was a success! I'm sure it was LOUD and they heard the drilling action for MILES!' tweeted rover driver Paolo Bellutta. Curiosity drilled into a rock named John Klein' after a Mars Science Laboratory deputy project manager who died in 2011. Pulverised: Nasa's Curiosity rover drilled this 0.8in deep hole on the surface of Mars as a test in advance of more drilling to collect samples for analysis to see if it could ever have harboured life . Drilling for life: Completion of the 'mini drill' test was confirmed in data from Mars received late Wednesday at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California . In the next few days, ground controllers will command the rover's arm to process the sample by delivering bits of it to the instruments inside Curiosity. Before the rock powder is analyzed, some will be used to scour traces of material that may have been deposited onto the hardware while the rover was still on Earth, despite thorough cleaning before launch, NASA said. The drilling and analysis is part of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory Project, which is using the Curiosity rover to figure out whether an area in Mars' Gale Crater ever offered a hospitable environment for life. Previous Mars landings carried tools that scraped away the exterior layers of rocks and dirt. Opportunity and Spirit - before it died - toted around a rock grinder. Phoenix, which touched down near the Martian north pole in 2008, was equipped with an ice rasp to chisel frozen soil.

A jobless Briton is on the run after he duped banks into giving him almost £300,000 in credit - and then blew the cash on a jet set lifestyle. Tony Murphy, 40, was listed as unemployed yet managed to obtain credit cards, a mortgage and a secured loan by claiming he owned several successful businesses. He bought two homes - including a suburban townhouse rented by a crime boss who lived next door to barristers, accountants and teachers. He also went travelling round the world visiting Egypt, America and Thailand. Living the high life: Tony Murphy, pictured with a tiger in Bangkok, conned banks into giving him nearly £300,000 .

Police investigating Murphy's finances . raided his £350,000 home in Hale, near Altrincham, Greater Manchester, to . find pictures of him posing with a tiger and an orangutan during a visit . to a zoo in Bangkok. They also found a holiday photo of him parasailing in Sharm-el-Sheik and old passports detailing his journey across the globe. Other pictures included a sepia photo of Murphy posing as a 1920s gangster in a pin striped suit and trilby hat with a young child holding a Tommy Gun. A giant poster of the 1980 mob movie Scarface starring Al Pacino hung on his bedroom wall. Unemployed: Murphy, pictured parasailing in Sharm El Sheik in 2009, declared just £2,232 of earnings to the taxman over a six year period . Officers also found photos of Murphy with crime boss Jimmy Maxwell, 35, who is now serving 22 years in a Florida jail after being convicted of running an Ecstasy scam. But while awaiting sentencing for his £295,000 fraud, Murphy did a runner and flew to either Alicante or Malaga and is thought to be hiding out in Spain's Costa Del Sol. Greater Manchester Police today appealed for British ex-pats to call them if they recognise Murphy. According to tax records, the fraudster had declared just £2,232 earnings over a six year period. Guilty: Tony Murphy, pictured in a zoo at Bangkok in Thailand, was found guilty of fraud and obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception . Yet on one credit card application he claimed he earned £70,000 through owning a car business, and on another that he earned £40,000 as an electrician for Manchester city council. He bought Maxwell's townhouse in Hale, Greater Manchester for £225,000 following the gangsters arrest in the US in 2008. Each room was fitted with giant plasma TV screens and erected stare of the art CCTV cameras to keep watch on activities outside. Murphy, pictured with an unknown child dressed as a gangster, has gone on the run before he could be sentenced for his crime . Murphy also bought a house in Urmston near Manchester for £90,000 after getting a secured loan and handled £30,000 of cash which was gained through crime. After the police raids he pleaded guilty at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester totwo counts of fraud, four counts of obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception and one charge of acquiring criminal property. But he fled before sentencing and last week was jailed for two and a half years in his absence. Det Sgt Pat Goodrich of Greater Manchester Police said: 'We had been investigating Murphy's financial background for a year before the raid. 'We found some very interesting evidence at his house - apart from the photos he had posters of the film Scarface on the wall of his property. We very much hope we can trace Murphy.' Greater Manchester Police is in the process of applying for a European arrest warrant for Murphy. Maxwell was the head of a Manchester based mob which successfully infiltrated the American Ecstasy market. He came up with a scam to sell the Class A drugs at a vastly inflated price.

Guilty: Rohan Pershad QC, arriving at Blackfriars Crown Court today, has been convicted of cheating the public revenue after avoiding paying hundreds of thousands of pounds of tax . A high-flying barrister was found guilty yesterday of more than a decade of tax fraud, using the money to buy luxury homes and to privately educate his four children. Rohan Pershad, 45, could face up to seven years in prison when he is sentenced on February 26 after being convicted of failing to pay nearly £628,000 in VAT over a 12-year period. He had been working as a Queen’s Counsel, a member of the legal profession’s elite, at London’s 39 Essex Street Chambers, enjoying a gold-plated pay package. It is headed by Robert Jay, QC, the senior counsel to the Leveson Inquiry on the culture, practices and ethics of the Press. Pershad, whose income rose from £85,000 in 2001 to £346,000 by 2008, was charging VAT on his fees but failed to pass a penny on to HM Revenue & Customs between June 1999 and September 2011. The money helped to buy a £1.1million home in Virginia Water, Surrey, and a £490,000 home in Somerset. Pershad, whose online CV depicts a lawyer with a particular expertise in fraud cases, insisted he was simply ‘extremely poor at paperwork’. His conviction at Blackfriars Crown Court comes weeks after the Crown Prosecution Service promised a crackdown on middle-class professionals, such as lawyers, who don’t pay their taxes. Yesterday a statement from 39 Essex Street Chambers said: ‘It is and always has been clear that all members of these Chambers, in common with all other self-employed barristers, are personally responsible to account to, and pay, HMRC for VAT received, and for income tax.’ Prosecutor Andrew Marshall told the court: 'Through all of that time, he was collecting the VAT. 'It’s just that for that period of 12 years, whilst it was being collected in, it wasn’t being accounted for or handed over as VAT. 'It provided him, if you think about it, with a private, tax-free income because VAT was not being paid. This money, it stayed with Mr Pershad.' Convicted: Pershad, a barrister, stopped paying his own VAT in 1999 - shortly before he moved to the Thirty Nine Essex Street chambers - and then fell off the tax register, meaning he 'disappeared off the VAT radar' Hearing: Pershad was today found guilty of cheating the public revenue at London's Blackfriars Crown Court after the jury was asked to give a majority verdict following more than nine hours of deliberations . 'This is a man that is used to looking at other people’s business and dissecting it and finding fault in it,' he told jurors. Denial: Pershad denied the charge against him, claiming he believed Thirty Nine Essex Street paid his VAT . Pershad denied the charge against him, claiming he believed Thirty Nine Essex Street paid his VAT. But his defence - branded 'preposterous' by the prosecution - was rejected by the jury. Keri Ashworth-Beaumont, specialist prosecutor from the Crown Prosecution Service Central Fraud Division, said: 'Rohan Pershad QC failed to pay VAT for a period of 12 years, despite charging his clients that VAT. 'As a result, he retained an additional private income of £624,579, which should have been paid to HMRC and the public purse. 'By convicting him today, the jury has concluded that Pershad was acting dishonestly and his failure to pay was not simply an error or mistake. 'He claimed that his chambers had given the impression that payment of his VAT had been taken care of, but the jury clearly rejected that assertion. Pershad always admitted that he understood the law and the responsibility for meeting his obligations rested on him alone. 'The message is clear; paying tax is not an optional extra in any area of working life and withholding tax dishonestly may lead to prosecution.' Pershad was called to the bar in 1991 and was made QC in 2011. He was interviewed after HMRC intervened in September that same year.","Rohan Pershad QC pocketed more than £600,000 over a 12-year period .

Nuisance: Gemma Fairhurst, pictured, brought misery to Farnworth, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, with her anti-social behaviour . A teenage ladette who brough missery to an entire town has been hit with an ASBO - sparking a major dip in crime. Gemma Fairhurst, 18, tormented residents of Farnworth, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, with a reign of terror which included threatening a pregnant social worker at a youth club and mocking a group of disabled youngsters with special needs. Police blamed her for being behind much of the trouble in the market town which also included locals pubs being pelted with stones. Last year Fairhurst was ordered to sign an 'acceptable behaviour contract' - a police tool to get her to behave - after being referred to Bolton Council. But despite a further series of warning letters she continued to ignore the terms and has now been given an ASBO. The ASBO bans her entering from Connexions and Zac's Youth Bar in the town plus the Welcome Inn and Saddle pubs. She also faces up to five years jail if she breaches the ASBO by behaving in a manner likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress. Fairhust also cannot be in company with another unnamed young woman in a public place and failing to leave any premises, having been directed to leave by a member of staff. Today Greater Manchester Police said since she was ordered to comply with the ASBO, the number of anti-social behaviour incidents in Farnworth town centre and market have dropped. Sgt Jon Seeds said: ‘Gemma was provided with one-to-one support by a local youth leader. However, her behaviour was a rollercoaster of disruption and compliance. 'Rollercoaster of disruption': Police blamed Fairhurst for much of the trouble in the market town of Farnworth, pictured, near Bolton, Greater Manchester . ‘Unfortunately she was at the centre of many of the incidents that we have seen in Farnworth and, as a result, an ASBO was obtained. ‘Farnworth town centre and market have seen a reduction in incidents and work continues with increased patrols over the half-term period and additional youth provision. ‘Any youths who are intent on causing anti-social behaviour in Farnworth will be brought to account. While perception of young people in Farnworth plays an emotive part in reports we receive, it is hoped, through high visibility of the police and direct action, we can reassure residents we will not tolerate poor behaviour from our young people.’ Result: Since issuing Fairhurst with an ASBO, police say they have seen a significant drop in crime in her hometown of Farnworth, pictured, near Bolton, Greater Manchester . Councillor Derek Burrows, Cabinet Member for Police and Community Safety at Bolton Council, said: ‘We work very closely with the police to prevent and tackle antisocial behaviour. ‘We will always try to work with individuals to prevent them repeating behaviour and wherever possible, go through a number of stages, including Acceptable Behaviour Contracts, but as a last resort, we will take them to court. ‘We hope that this demonstrates to others that we will continue to crack down on this type of behaviour.’ Zacs Youth Bar refused to comment.","Gemma Fairhurst, of Farnworth, Bolton, threatened pregnant youth worker .

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission says more than 1,000 people from more than 30 states have registered to compete in the month-long ‘Python Challenge.’ The pythons killed since the competition began Saturday will be processed by the University of Florida. Scroll down for video . Eleven Burmese pythons have been killed during the first three days of a public hunt for the non-native species in the Florida Everglades . Fred Merrell, 48, hunts for pythons in the Big Cypress National Preserve during the Python Challenge in the Florida Everglades . Captain Jeff Fobb explains the problem to the media with the help of an 85-pound python . Officials say they hope the large number of hunters will help researchers gather more information about the snakes' habits. As well as culling South Florida’s population of invasive Burmese pythons, the purpose of the hunt is also to raise awareness about non-native species and their detrimental effects on the local ecosystem. It's unknown how many pythons live in the Everglades. Researchers say the large snakes menace native wildlife. Florida law prohibits possession or sale of the pythons for use as pets. Hunters are restricted to four state wildlife management areas; Everglades National Park is off-limits. They may use some firearms, as well as captive bolts and machetes to kill pythons. Native species may not be taken. The state is offering cash prizes to . whoever brings in the longest python and whoever bags the most pythons . by the time the competition ends at midnight Feb. 10.

Captain Jeff Fobb, of Miami-Dade Fire Rescue's Venom One unit, displays a 13-foot snake that was captured a year ago swimming in a backyard pool . Dozens of would-be python . hunters showed up for some last-minute training in snake handling . Saturday morning at the University of Florida Fort Lauderdale Research . and Education Center in Davie. The training came down to common sense: Drink water, wear sunscreen, don't get bitten by anything and don't shoot anyone. Many of the onlookers dressed in camouflage, though they probably didn't have to worry about spooking the snakes. They would have a much harder time spotting the splotchy, tan pythons in the long green grasses and woody brush of the Everglades. 'It's advantage-snake,' mechanical engineer Dan Keenan concluded after slashing his way through a quarter-mile of scratchy sawgrass, dried leaves and woody overgrowth near a campsite in the Big Cypress National Preserve, which is about 50 miles southeast of Naples and is supervised by the National Park Service. Keenan, of Merritt Island, and friend Steffani Burd of Melbourne, a statistician in computer security, holstered large knives and pistols on their hips, so they'd be ready for any python that crossed their path. The snakes can grow to more than 20 feet in length. Dan Keenan battles through thick brush in search for Burmese pythons, also described as the 'zombies of the Everglades' The most useful tool they had, though, was the key fob to their car. Burd wanted to know that they hadn't wandered too far into the wilderness, so Keenan clicked the fob until a reassuring beep from their car chirped softly through the brush. The recommended method for killing pythons is the same for killing zombies: a gunshot to the brain, or decapitation to reduce the threat. (The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals doesn't approve of the latter method, though.) Pythons are kind of the zombies of the Everglades, though their infestation is less deadly to humans. The snakes have no natural predators, they can eat anything in their way, they can reproduce in large numbers and they don't belong here. Florida currently prohibits . possession or sale of the pythons for use as pets, and federal law bans . the importation and interstate sale of the species. Wildlife . experts say pythons are just the tip of the invasive species iceberg. Florida is home to more exotic species of amphibians and reptiles than . anywhere else in the world, said John Hayes, dean of research for the . University of Florida's Institute for Food and Agricultural Sciences. Careful lookout: Another hunter, BR Slocum, uses a golf cart as he searches for snakes with his son . Roughly 2,050 pythons have been harvested in Florida since 2000, according to the conservation commission. It's unknown exactly how many are slithering through the wetlands. Officials hope the competition will help rid the Everglades of the invaders while raising awareness about the risks that exotic species pose to Florida's native wildlife. Keenan and Burd emerged from the Everglades empty-handed Saturday, but they planned to return Sunday, hoping for cooler temperatures that would drive heat-seeking snakes into sunny patches along roads and levees. Burd still deemed the hunt a success. 'For me, I take back to my friends and community that there is a beautiful environment out here. It's opening the picture from just the python issue to the issue of how do we protect our environment,' she said.

Former soldier Barach Bandavad, the ex boyfriend of her stepdaughter, is accused of her murder . A former soldier murdered his ex-girlfriend's stepmother by slashing her throat after telling her: 'There is a need for us all to die', a court has heard. Barach Bandavad, 38, butchered Judith Ege, 58, after she arrived at his house with her husband to collect her step-daughter's belongings following their split, it was said. After appearing 'polite and co-operative' during the handover it is alleged that he suddenly 'flipped', revealing that he had a gun and two knives and demanded they take him for a drive. The couple refused and Mrs Ege's husband Augustine grabbed the car keys and fled in the hope that Bandavad would run after him and leave his wife alone. But the Ministry of Defence worker then repeatedly stabbed her as she sat in the back of the car before slicing her neck open, a jury was told. Bandavad, who worked at the Abbey Wood procurement centre in Bristol, denies murder at Bristol Crown Court. Mr Ege, a teacher, told the court that in the moments leading up to the murder he had become convinced Bandavad wanted to kill them. He said: 'My first thought patterns were that if we got into the car and went to this place I didn't think we would come back alive. 'I felt if the three of us got into this car and drove off he would kill both of us. 'I recall him saying ""there is a need for us to die"" and at this stage he was quite erratic and I remember him saying ""I'm now getting very, very nervous"". 'I think he then told me again that he was getting very nervous and that he wasn't afraid to use the weapons, I slowly took the keys from the ignition. 'That is when I ran down the road. I thought it was me he was after and that he would come running after me and I was feeling confident I would out-run him. 'I wanted to try and draw him away from my wife. 'But as I ran off I heard a really loud scream, it was definitely female, and definitely my wife.' The heard how Bandavad had been in a relationship with Samantha Hines for 18 months after they had met on a music course at the University of Bristol. Following their break-up Samantha arranged to collect her belongings from his house in Horfield, Bristol, on June 30th last year. Police officers and forensics at the scene of the murder of Judith Ege in Highbury Road, Bristol. It was claimed Bandavad slit her throat as he said 'there is a need for us all to die' It is claimed he suddenly 'flipped', revealing that he had a gun and two knives and demanded they take him for a drive when Mrs Ege and her husband arrived to collect their daughter's possessions . She travelled from Oxfordshire to Bristol in a rented Vauxhall Corsa car with her father, a teacher, and step-mother, a special needs teacher. She did not want to see Bandavad again so her parents dropped her off at the shops while they went to his house at around midday. Mr Ege told the court that when they arrived he greeted the pair and begun to calmly load Samantha's possessions into the car. But his mood quickly changed when he brought out the last bag and noticed that Mrs Ege was ticking items off a list that her step-daughter had given her. Mr Ege told the jury: 'He said 'the three of us are going to go for a drive'. 'His manner was reasonably calm. My reply was that this was not what we agreed. I said we would come, collect the stuff and go. 'He said 'No, we are going for a drive to a place where I went to when I first came to this country'.' Bandavad then pulled up his jumper to reveal the handle of a gun - which later turned out to be an imitation - tucked in the waistband of his trousers, the court was told. The couple refused to go with him and Mr Ege then noticed he was holding two knives in his left hand. According to Mr Ege, Bandavad then told him: 'You don't understand. We are going for a drive. You're making me very nervous now. I'm not afraid to use this.' At this point Mr Ege grabbed the car keys and fled the scene, leaving Judith stranded in the back of the two-door car surrounded by boxes. Michael Fitton QC, prosecuting, told the court that Judith would have been left defenceless, trapped between Bandavad and Samantha's possessions. He said: 'She was stabbed a number of times by the defendant, to the chest and neck and then he sliced her throat open. 'Having cut her throat this defendant did nothing to try and help her but ran off with the blood stained knife still in his hands in hot pursuit of Augustine.' Mr Ege asked two men nearby to dial 999 but Bandavad ran past shortly afterwards - still brandishing the bloodied knife - and grabbed their phone and ended the call. A witness then saw Bandavad return to the scene of his crime, unable to find Mr Ege, and forced Judith's body back into the car before attempting to drive off. He then removed a bottle, believed to be barbecue lighter fluid, from a rucksack and poured it into the car's petrol tank before attempting to set it alight. However this failed and he fled the scene, dumping his coat, t-shirt and backpack into a nearby wheely bin. Mr Fitton added: 'At 12.06am Mr Bandavad made a call to a friend. 'He said: ""I just called to bye. I did something bad today and I'm going to die. ''I had a false gun to make Augustine talk to me and take me somewhere but he had his girl in the car and I killed her.""' Bandavad, who is of Caribbean origin, later called police to hand himself in, telling officers Mrs Ege had accidentally come into contact with the knife during a struggle. The case continues.

The fraudster was exposed when the elderly woman told a social worker that Aston had cashed in £30,000 of her premium bonds as she was no longer receiving payments. West Midlands Police unearthed £160,000 worth of banker's drafts made out to Aston's business Key Moves when officers launched a probe into his affairs. He claimed the money had been given to him as a loan, and insisted he had permission to take out the cash in 'bits and bobs'. But investigators discovered Aston's withdrawals from his victims' accounts actually amounted to more than £100,000. He was subsequently arrested and charged with fraud. After initially denying the offences, Aston changed his plea to guilty today on what was to be the first day of a trial at Birmingham Crown Court. Detective Constable Vicky Henry, of West Midlands Police, said: 'He transferred large sums of money on a regular basis to help clear his debts, he left his elderly victims financially destitute with little or no balance left in their bank accounts.' The officer said Aston 'slyly weaved his way' into the pair's confidence in order to carry out the scam. 'He played the role of a helping hand there to offer support - but all along he was targeting their money to help dig himself out of a financial hole,' she said. 'He quickly rolled out sob stories about his struggling business and between them his victims handed over £6,000, this clearly whetted Aston's appetite and on being granted Power of Attorney his fraud became much greedier,' DC Henry explained. 'Attorneys have certain duties, including not taking advantage of their position and to act in the best interest of the attorney ""donor"" at all times - but Aston's actions couldn't have been more at odds with those promises,' she added. Aston is due to be sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on February 21.","Heartless Darren Aston weaved his way into the confidence of a 92-year-old widow and her 87-year-old male friend, before draining their bank accounts .

Carlos Tevez was fined more than £1,500 after he did not respond to police letters when his car was clocked speeding . Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez has been disqualified from driving at court today after he failed to understand the word 'constabulary' on official letters from the police. Tevez, 28, was banned from driving for six months at Manchester Magistrates' Court and ordered to pay £1,540 in fines and costs. The court heard he received letters from . the police when his car was clocked speeding twice but his solicitor said he failed to respond because . he did not recognise the word constabulary. The striker, who did not attend the hearing in person, pleaded guilty to two counts of failing to furnish information in relation to the incidents. Tevez also admitted not having a proper UK driving licence, but denied he was driving when his car was caught speeding. The footballer’s solicitor, Gwyn Lewis, told the court: 'He does understand the word ""police"", but not more complicated words. 'The letters are written from Cheshire Constabulary and the word police doesn’t appear on it anywhere.' He said that was also the case in relation to the speeding office in Morecambe, which was pursued by Lancashire Constabulary. 'The word constabulary is not one that is recognised internationally, but of course police is,' Mr Lewis said. 'The correspondence was not dealt with properly and that has resulted in these offences.' When discussing the possibility of a fine, Mr Lewis told the bench: 'He is a footballer and in that regard he is relatively well paid.' The court ordered that the disqualification period would start from November 26, last year, when an interim driving ban was imposed on the player. Tevez, from Alderley Edge, Cheshire, mimicked driving a vehicle after he scored twice in his team’s Premier League win at home to Aston Villa on November 17 last year. The striker mimicked driving a vehicle when he scored against Aston Villa on November 17 last year . Last November Lancaster magistrates imposed an interim ban on him after he failed to provide information when his car was clocked doing 39mph in a 30mph zone in Morecambe, Lancashire, on March 28 - the night he played for City’s reserves against Morecambe Reserves. The court heard he failed to respond to letters sent to him by police on April 3 and May 4. Mr Lewis told the court his client accepted he did not provide identification - which carries six penalty points - and that under the totting up procedure he was now liable for disqualification. The court heard that Tevez’s Hummer vehicle was also clocked doing 66mph in a 50mph zone in Crewe, Cheshire, on May 8 and that he again failed to respond to letters from the police about it. On November 15, last year, his Porsche Panamera was impounded in Manchester as he could not produce a full UK driving licence. The car was seized under section 165 of the Road Traffic Act in a routine patrol near to the Britannia Airport Hotel. Tess Kenyon, prosecuting, said police pulled the car over after they checked it on the police system and it was found that Tevez was listed as a provisional driving licence holder and he was not displaying L-plates. He was spoken to at the side of the road with the aid of a Spanish interpreter, the court heard. He was then summonsed for driving otherwise in accordance with a driving licence. The striker, pictured arriving at training last year, was sent letters when his car was twice caught speeding and his Porsche Panamera was later impounded when he could not produce a full UK driving licence . Three years ago - when he was playing for City’s rivals Manchester United - his Bentley Continental GT Speed was impounded in similar circumstances. The Bentley was removed by police near to junction six of the M60 in February 2009 after it was found he did not have a full UK driving licence. As an Argentinian driving licence holder, Tevez, is permitted to drive in Britain for the first 12 months of his stay in the country but is then required to apply for a provisional licence and pass the UK driving theory and practical test. Mr Lewis said the theory test will be problematic for his client as it is normally conducted in English. The centre forward joined West Ham United in 2006 and then moved to Manchester United a season later. He signed for Manchester City in the summer of 2009.","Manchester City striker did not respond to Cheshire Constabulary letters .

Former prime minister Gordon Brown will speak in the House of Commons tonight for the first time in more than a year. It marks only the fourth time the ex-Labour leader has spoken in the Commons since losing power in May 2010. He will use the rare appearance to highlight a plan to save two Fife Remploy factories. Scroll down for video . Former prime minister Gordon Brown will speak in the Commons for the first time since November 2011 . Mr Brown has been criticised for rarely speaking in the Commons and has addressed MPs only three times since leaving No 10, with his most recent appearance in November 2011. The former Labour leader, MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, will say that two textile factories, which have been part of the fabric of the local economy for 60 years, have full order books and a product with an acclaimed design and established market which could end up being produced in Asia if the plants close. When the debate was announced last week Mr Brown said: 'If we cannot save these two factories which employ disabled men and women and which have a full order book, a renowned design, a successful product and an established market, it is unlikely that we will save many of the 50-plus Remploy factories around the United Kingdom. 'So this is a test case of the willingness to invest to ensure a future for disabled men and women who work hard today and want to work in the future.' Mr Brown has only spoken three times in the Commons since leaving Downing Street in May 2010 . A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: 'Our priority throughout the commercial process has been to safeguard jobs, which is why we are offering a wage subsidy of up to £6,400 per disabled employee to encourage interested parties to come forward. 'We have also been clear from the start that we have protected the £320 million budget for disability employment services.' The Government has focused efforts on getting disabled workers into mainstream employment. 'All disabled employees affected by the changes will be guaranteed tailored support from an £8 million package, including a personal case worker, to help with the transition into mainstream employment,' the spokesman said.","Ex-Prime Minister plans first speech in Commons since November 2011 .

James Bond’s favourite car-maker Aston Martin celebrated its centenary today – exactly 100 years to the day after it was founded. The British luxury sports car company marked the landmark anniversary with a special ceremony outside the firm’s original home in London where a commemorative plaque was put up. The car firm,  which gave British agent 007 his licence to drive one of the world’s most desirable cars, also put on show the oldest surviving Aston Martin - an A3 – and  one of its latest – a new Centenary edition Vanquish – outside the company's first headquarters in Chelsea, south-west London. The new DBS model starred in the James Bond film Casino Royale and showed how the Aston Martin had remained popular with fans . Where it all began: The original Aston Martin Coal Scuttle, produced in 1915 when the company was founded . Wheel-y good! The Aston Martin's second prototype of the 'Coal Scuttle' from 1920 won many admirers for its design . In Aston Martin's first 90 years the company built fewer than 15,000 cars. This is the smooth-looking DB4 from 1961 . Aston Martin was founded 100 years ago today by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford. Their  company Bamford & Martin later became Aston Martin, acknowledging Bamford's success at the Aston Clinton Hillclimb in Buckinghamshire, where he had successfully raced their very first cars. The centenary ceremony took place at 16 Henniker Mews, off Callow Street, Brompton, London, SW3 6BL where Bamford and Martin, which later went on to become Aston Martin Ltd was incorporated on  15 January 1913. Among those taking part were Aston Martin chairman David Richards and Roger Carey, chairman of the Aston Martin Heritage Trust (AMHT) as well as the firm’s  directors and leading members of the Aston Martin Owners Club. The anniversary also comes at a fitting time for Bond fans as 007 picks up screen honours and is short-listed for a number of Oscars. Star of the screen: 007 actor Sean Connery made the car iconic in the spy films . Boy racer: Carroll Shelby in Aston Martin DBR1, winner of the 1959 Le Mans 24 hour race . Iconic: The 1964 Aston Martin DB5 Superleggera. The cars became a firm favourite with Bond . The classic 1964 car from Goldfinger: The Aston Martin DB5 became a star of the screen in its own right . In the original Ian Fleming books, Bond is  associated more with a super-charged Bentley. But in his first screen outings in 1960s movies such as Goldfinger and Thunderball with Sean Connery in the driving seat he was put into the now iconic Aston Martin DB5, complete with machine guns and ejector seat. He has since been reunited with the DB5, most recently with Daniel Craig in the driving seat in the latest movie Skyfall, which picked up a Golden Globe award for its theme tune co-written and sung by Adele. In Aston Martin's first 90 years the company built fewer than 15,000 cars. But in the past decade it has built more than 45,000. The very first Aston Martin, named ‘Coal Scuttle’ was built in 1915. The firm hopes to take on rivals like Porsche and Ferrari in the future. Pictured is the Aston Martin DB9 . Smooth operator!

Following Coal Scuttle and the Great War, three more prototype cars were built including Bunny -no longer in existence - and chassis number A3 built in 1921 which was the third Aston Martin ever built,  the oldest in existence, and the car on display today. It is owned by the Aston Martin Heritage Trust which is co-hosting with the company a major centenary diner tonight at London’s Hilton Hotel in Park Lane. Aston Martin is also having a  week-long centenary celebration festival at its headquarters in  Gaydon, Warwickshire, until July 21 as well as major event in London featuring up to 1,000 Aston Martins, and a Bond-themed centenary drive  taking in locations used in a variety of Bond movies. Although the iconic Aston Martin DB5 has been a firm favourite of 007 since the 1960s, the firm’s current line up comprises the Vantage family of V8, V8 S, V12 Vantage and V12 Zagato, the Cygnet city car, new DB9, Rapide four-door sports car and new super GT – the Vanquish.

The new partner is European investment group Investindustrial which is taking a 37.5 per cent stake in its business. As a result of the deal Aston Martin said it planned to invest £500million in new models and technology over the next five years. The cash lifeline to the luxury manufacturer based at Gaydon in Warwickshire will allow it to 'proceed with its extensive and exciting plans for sustainable long-term growth' and take on rivals like Porsche and Ferrari. Kuwaiti groups Investment Dar and Adeem Investment Co  bought Aston Martin five years ago for around £500million from  US car giant Ford which controlled the brand from 1987.

Long battle: Former school dinner lady Carol Hill has won the right to compensation two years after winning a claim for wrongful dismissal . A school dinner lady who was sacked after telling a seven-year-old girl's parents about a 'brutal' bullying incident has won her two-year battle to get compensation for wrongful dismissal. Carol Hill, 61, was devastated when she was suspended from Great Tey Primary School in Colchester, Essex, after she inadvertently told a pupil's parents about the bullying in June 2009. Mrs Hill spoke to the press about her shock at her suspension and was then sacked in September 2009 by the headteacher for 'breach of confidentiality'. Mrs Hill then began her campaign for justice. As the Mail reported at the time, Mrs Hill - who supervised pupils' games at lunchtime - had gone to the aid of a seven-year-old girl who had been tied to a fence and whipped with a skipping rope by four children. When Mrs Hill later bumped into the schoolgirl’s parents at a Beaver Scouts meeting, she assumed they had been told and asked how she was – only to discover they had been informed she had suffered a ‘minor accident’. The girl — who had rope burns on her wrist and red welts on her thigh — had been sent home with a note for her parents stating only that she had been hurt in a 'skipping rope incident'. An employment tribunal in January 2011 found Mrs Hill had been unfairly dismissed but her compensation was cut at a second hearing because she had spoken to the press about her ordeal. However, an employment appeal tribunal has found the decision was wrong. She will get at least £600, but could get more pending a further hearing. Dismissal: Carol Hill was sacked from Great Tey Primary School, in Essex, after telling a pupil's parents about a bullying incident in June 2009 . Constant reminder: Carol Hill, who worked at the school for seven years, can see the playing fields from the end of her garden . Mrs Hill, from Great Tey, said: 'It has been a horrible ordeal but I feel a step closer to justice. 'I was never doing it for the money, I was doing it because I believe what I did was right. 'I was getting blamed for doing something I truly believed was right. 'It the principle I was fighting for, it was never about the money, although I am happy about the outcome now.' Mrs Hill now works as a cleaner around the village but misses dealing with children. Mrs Hill was suspended by the school's headteacher Debbie Crabb, pictured, before being dismissed for 'breach of confidentiality' She said: 'I loved that job, I would definitely still be doing it if this has not happened. 'It is a real rollercoaster ride, one minute you're up and the next you're down. 'I am delighted with the outcome.' Mrs Hill was initially suspended by Debbie Crabb, headteacher at the primary school in July 2009, and was fired in September after speaking to the press about her ordeal. A statement from Great Tey Primary School, in Chrismund Way, said: 'The employment appeal tribunal upheld Mrs Hill's appeal into her compensation payout following dismissal from Great Tey Primary School. 'It does not change the outcome of the overall case but there may need to be a further liabilities hearing at an employment tribunal to reassess the amount originally awarded.' Speaking after she first won her case for unfair dismissal in 2011, Mrs Hill told of her distress over the ordeal. She said: 'I lost weight and my hair thinned because of the stress. 'The worst part was not being at the school any more. Not because of the money – but because of the job itself. I love kids and to be taken away from them like I was some sort of criminal was heartbreaking. 'I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep, I lost weight, I snapped at people, I suffered high blood pressure, but now I feel vindicated and can hold my head up high again. 'I know I couldn’t have lived with myself having seen what I saw and keeping quiet. Another hurdle: Mrs Hill won her employment tribunal for wrongful dismissal in 2011 but had her compensation cut for speaking to the press about her ordeal . 'It was important for me to fight for my job, even though I earned only £125 a month, because I thought I was right. 'What mother wouldn’t want to know that their child had been tied up and whipped with a skipping rope?’ Dave Prentis, general secretary of public sector Unison, said: 'Carol has been put through a terrible ordeal by the school and lost a job she truly loved. 'The value of someone being free to speak out against injustice must be upheld and this decision by the employment appeal tribunal strengthens and clarifies this important principle.'

Acquitted: Roy Cope, 63, stepped down from his job as a deputy headteacher after being subjected to a disciplinary hearing by the school for the alleged assault - despite being cleared in court of any wrongdoing . A deputy headteacher has quit his job before the end of a disciplinary hearing after he was alleged to have slapped an 'uncontrollable' pupil who he described as the worst he had ever taught. Roy Cope, 63, who has been a teacher for 40 years, left St Bartholomew's CofE Primary School in Blackburn despite being cleared by magistrates of assault. He was alleged to have held a seven-year-old boy by the wrists and hit him after the child flew into an 'incandescent rage', hitting 10 other pupils. The boy became 'hysterical and out of control' during a lesson and was sent out for hitting the other children. One teacher described him as being in a rage and grabbed hold of railings to avoid being taken to Mr Cope's office, screaming 'get off me, get off me'. Once he finally got to the deputy head's office he sat on the carpet where Mr Cope told him to calm down. The same teacher then said he saw Mr Cope hit the child and threaten to do it again if he failed to calm down. He told . magistrates: 'Mr Cope was not using a technique I knew, but he seemed in . charge. He was being forceful but fair. 'The child's arms were flailing and . he kept on shouting, getting more and more hysterical. Mr Cope released . or lost control of the boy's left arm and then he struck him across the . face.' But Mr Cope told the hearing: 'As a . teacher with over 40 years' experience, with a good reputation within . the school and local community, this allegation has come as a great . shock to me and caused me and my family great distress. 'Since the boy started school he was a . disruptive and aggressive pupil and frequently disrupted the school. He . is probably the worst of the pupils I have ever taught in 40 years of . teaching and on occasions he is uncontrollable. 'Whilst in Year 1 it was necessary to remove him from the classroom to stop him attacking pupils. In Class 2 as he became stronger on many occasions he attacked other pupils. Incident: The seven-year-old boy flew into an 'incandescent rage' at St Bartholomew's primary school in March last year . 'It was suggested that in order to . control volatile incidents the headteacher said that he should be . removed to another class room. He was hitting children with his . schoolbag and pinning another to the wall by the throat before . registration. 'The Chair of Governors was very alarmed at his behaviour.' He said the boy was often sent to his . office for bad behaviour and on the day of the incident had been sent . out of class again for hitting other children. Mr Cope added: 'We were preparing for . our production of Wind in the Willows with the eight to 10-year-olds. When I got downstairs he wasn't in Class 2, he was outside Class 1 . standing on the corridor shouting at the Class 1 teacher. 'She was telling him to go inside but he was shouting ""I don't want to I'm not going to"". He was shouting it very loud indeed. The rest of the children were looking out. I held his hand and he was . still shouting and screaming and because I was holding his hand he was . shouting ""get off me"". 'He worked himself into an . incandescent rage, I knew it was all bluster and knew he would . eventually calm down. I had to be calm but firm with him. 'He was a bit like a long playing . record ""get off me, get off me"", even though I was saying ""calm down"". I . would say he said it 50 to 100 times repeating it. 'He was throwing himself from side to . side and rocking on his bottom trying to get away, trying to break free. He was shouting and children in the hall could hear him.' As well as being cleared in court of any wrongdoing, Mr Cope has received the support of parents and other staff at the school. However, he was due to face a disciplinary hearing into the matter and decided to quit, leaving at the end of January. Despite being cleared of assault he remained suspended until the hearing was over. He decided after 'careful deliberation' to stand down from the £44,000-a-year job. The alleged incident took place in March last year and Mr Cope said the boy was 'the most badly behaved I have ever taught'. Speaking of their disappointment that . the school had lost such a valued member of staff, one parent said: 'Mr . Cope is an absolutely outstanding man and has dedicated his life to the . school. 'You would not find a more dedicated . teacher and all the staff and parents have been 100 per cent behind him. For his distinguished career to end like this is a disgrace.' Mark Mackley, headteacher at St . Bartholomew's, said: 'After careful deliberation, Mr Cope has decided . that he will not be returning to his position of deputy headteacher and . has left the employment of the school with effect from 31 January, . 2013.' Parents spoke of . their disappointment that the school has lost a member of staff . described as 'an absolutely outstanding teacher' who had 'dedicated his . life to St Bartholomew's'. One said: 'Mr Cope is an . absolutely outstanding man and has dedicated his life to the school. You . would not find a more dedicated teacher and all the staff and parents . have been 100 per cent behind him. For his distinguished career to end like this . is a disgrace.' The incident with the boy happened towards the end of . classes in March last year while Mr Cope, from Accrington, was involved . in a rehearsal with 80 pupils for a forthcoming . school production of Wind In The Willows. At the time of Mr Cope's acquittal Mr Cope's . son Robin said: 'The family have had overwhelming support over my . father's case but it should never have come to court in the first place. 'The fact is there is an issue today . with unruly children and it has come to this where dedicated teachers . are repeatedly appearing before the courts on their say-so.' A Lancashire County Council spokeswoman said any allegation had to be investigated and confirmed a disciplinary investigation had been carried out. She refused to comment further about the result.","Roy Cope, 63, endured five-month court ordeal before being cleared .

A large family of little people are happy to answer questions about their daily lives, take pride in what makes them unique and are determined to correct misconceptions about dwarfism. 'We are pretty much like everybody else... If you have a question, just ask,' says Amy Morris, 33. Amy is the oldest daughter of the Tucson household, which includes parents Linda and Brian, brothers Josh and Zach, sister Andrea and her daughter Alicia. 'We live pretty regular lives. Sometimes people are surprised to hear that.' Amy Morris uses a step stool to grab a snack from the freezer at the family home in Tucson . Linda, 60, and Brian, 69, are both achondroplasia dwarfs (see below) who met and married in Michigan. As reported by the Arizona Daily Star, Linda is from Tucson, while Brian was born in England. While living in the Detroit suburb of Northville, the couple had their first children, Amy and Josh, both also little people. Soon after these new arrivals, their parents to decided to adopt two more children, so Zach and Andrea joined the family. While they did have the choice of adopting average-sized kids, Linda and Brian told the Arizona Daily Star that they decided on little people. 'Because our birth children had been . dwarfs, we chose to adopt fellow dwarfs,' Linda said. 'Had we had an . average-sized child, we definitely would have considered it. 'It is nice to have someone who is like you in the family,' she added. From left to right, Amy Morris, Nicole McNamara, Alicia Shanklin and Linda Morris sing during a Sunday service at Grace Evangelical Lutheran Church . Linda explains that she was raised just like her three older siblings. 'I remember the first time I saw another little person at Randolph Park, not knowing I was like him,' she remembers. So Linda and Brian have done the same with their four children. 'We live pretty regular lives,' says Amy. 'Sometimes people are surprised to hear that.' According to the Arizona Daily Star, Brian is a certified public accountant . while Linda has a degree in nutrition and dietetics, and was a . dietitian at hospitals in Tucson and North Carolina. Josh works as a story editor for television shows like Jersey Shore in Los Angeles. Zach is a touring member of Mini Kiss, the Kiss tribute band made up entirely of little people with a form of dwarfism. Andrea was adopted from Mumbai, India, when she was seven. She now has a daughter of her own, Alicia Shanklin. They live with Linda, Brian and Amy in a four-bedroom house in Tucson. But no one in the family is taller than five feet, so they are used to questions about their lifestyle. 'We've heard them all,' says Amy. The answers to the most common questions are easy.

Except for Zach the rest of the members of the family have achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism. Zach has hypochondroplasia, a less severe form. But while they are proud of their . ordinary lives, the family are . highly active in the little people community. Brian helped launch the Dwarf Athletic Association of America, which organizes athletics for little people, in the mid-1980s. This group now hosts the World Dwarf Games, which brings people of short stature to East Lansing, Michigan, every four years. 'It almost brings tears to my eyes,' Linda told the Daily Star. 'When you go now, there are so many people involved. It has grown so much.' Amy . is the president of the local chapter of Little People of America, . called the Tucson Roadrunners, which is growing every year. This family are always open to queries. Achondroplasia is the most common type of short-limbed dwarfism. The condition occurs in 1 in 15,000 to 40,000 newborns. The word achondroplasia literally means 'without . cartilage formation'. However, the problem is not in forming cartilage . but in converting it to bone, particularly in the long bones of the arms . and legs. All people . with achondroplasia have short stature. The average height of an adult . male with achondroplasia is four feet, four inches, and the average . height for adult females is four feet, one inch. Characteristic . features of achondroplasia include an average-size trunk, short arms . and legs with particularly short upper arms and thighs, limited range of . motion at the elbows, and an enlarged head with a prominent forehead. Of the Morris family, only Zach has hypochondroplasia, which is similar to called achondroplasia, but the features tend to be milder. The incidence of hypochondroplasia is unknown, but researchers believe that it may be about as common as achondroplasia. People with hypochondroplasia have short arms and legs and broad, short hands and feet. Other characteristic features include a large head, limited range of motion at the elbows, a sway of the lower back (lordosis), and bowed legs. These signs are generally less pronounced than those seen with achondroplasia and may not be noticeable until early or middle childhood.

Approaching cars to their right slow down to allow them to cross but an impatient driver behind the waiting cars decides to overtake by speeding down the wrong side of the road straight into the path of the woman and child. Both are knocked down by the black Audi estate and can be seen being dragged along the road as shopping bags and their contents tumble on to the street. The driver momentarily slows after the impact but then speeds off without checking on the woman or child as other pedestrians rush into the street to help them.

Passengers on board the stricken Costa Allegra will not make landfall until at least Thursday, more than 72 hours after the ship first lost power in the Indian Ocean. The 1,049 passengers and crew have been forced to stay up on the deck of the ship to keep cool after a fire in the engine room, left the vessel without power, lights and air-conditioning. Fresh food is said to have run out and is being airlifted in by helicopters as a French fishing trawler, called Trevignon, tows Allegra from the pirate-infested waters to safety. Tow: French fishing vessel The Talenduic (right) is towing the Costa Allegra (left) to the capital of the Seychelles . Out on deck: Passengers are being told to stay on top of the liner because the power cut means there are no lights in the cabins or rooms . It was initially heading towards the island of Desroches, where it was expected to dock this afternoon. But Costa Cruises has now revealed it will proceed to the Seychelles capital of Mahe, because of 'safety and security issues', where it should arrive in two days. A statement said: 'The disembarkation in Desroches does not assure the necessary and adequate security conditions for mooring the ship and guests’ disembarkation. 'In addition, logistics and hotels on the island are not enough. Thus the ship will be towed to Mahe also with the assistance of two tugs that are approaching the ship and that would allow to increase the speed.' Italian prosecutors have opened an investigation into how the fire started in the crippled liner's engine room. Blaze: Fire broke out onboard the Costa Allegra (pictured) when it was in the pirate-infested Indian Ocean . Chief prosecutor Michele Di Lecce, . who is based in Genoa, where Costa has its HQ, said: 'From the . information we have we know there was a fire onboard and we need to . investigate how it started and what caused it. The fire started in . international waters so the jurisdiction is down to us as the ship is . Italian. Thirty one British passengers are . among holidaymakers onboard and to combat the heat as air conditioning . is not working, they have all been gathered on the outer decks of the . ship. In a statement Genoa based Costa Cruises . said they were 'all served a cold breakfast' while the Allegra's . captain Nicolo Alba was in constant touch with the Trevignon and . maritime authorities. Italian . coastguard officials in Rome who are co-ordinating the rescue have said . the Allegra is in no immediate danger and she is 'upright and . floating', adding that weather in the area was calm with the odd shower . passing through. A tracking page on Costa Cruise's website shows where the Allegra is adrift off the Seychelles . Onboard the . Allegra, which was a week into a month long cruise of the Indian Ocean, . Red Sea and the Mediterranean, are nine Italian marines from the elite . San Marco regiment, who are armed with Hecker and Koch submachine guns . and who ready to defend the ship from possible pirate attacks. The area off the east African coast has been targeted by Somali pirates in the past and the marines are there as a deterrent. The . ship had been due to make its way north through the Indian Ocean with . stops in Mauritius, Madagascar and the Seychelles before heading to . Oman, Jordan, Egypt and finally ending in the Italian port of Savona on . March 17. Costa sources said the most likely cause of the fire was an 'electrical fault' and that it would be thoroughly investigated. The . incident is another blow to Carnival-owned Costa Cruises, which is . still investigating the Costa Concordia tragedy, which occurred in . January, when the vessel hit rocks off the coast of Italy, killing 25, . with seven still missing and presumed dead. The captain of the Concordia, . Francesco Schettino, is also under investigation after he allegedly . changed course so the ship could carry out a sail by salute of the .

Costa officials were last night locked in discussions over the compensation package that  would be offered to passengers.

Sir Lancelot was prepared to risk his honour as a knight, death at the hands of the villain Maleagant, and even the wrath of his king to win the love of Queen Guinevere. And it seems modern men are little different from the knights of Arthurian legend. A new study reveals that men are willing to take dangerous gambles to get the attention of the opposite sex, and the romantic tendency is apparently firmly rooted in evolution. Sir Lancelot rides off with his lover Guinevere, the wife of King Arthur: A new study reveals that men are willing to take dangerous gambles to win the attention of the opposite sex - and the tendency is rooted in evolution . One version of the Lancelot legend has the gallant knight falling in love after catching only the briefest glance of King Arthur's wife Guinevere. After she is kidnapped by the evil knight Maleagant, Lancelot is willing to jeopardise his honour as a knight by riding in a cart reserved for criminals, then face death in a duel to rescue her. Finally, after further trials, he risks the jealous rage of King Arthur himself by becoming Guinevere's adulterous lover. And it's not just Lancelot: from Romeo to Robin Hood, myths and fiction are are littered with men willing to face potentially deadly trials in the name of romance. But taking risks to impress women has a strong foundation in real life, where the willingness to face dangers for the fairer sex has been commonplace since the dawn of man. A recent study from the Journal of Risk Research finds risk-taking behaviour has in part been evolved to enhance an individual's ability to attract a mate. According to the study: 'In the evolutionary past, our ancestors were faced with a hazardous environment where they were forced to take greater risks in order to find shelter, food and sexual partners. 'Thus, individuals who played it safe in that they did not take any risks at all, were unlikely to survive.' I-I-I love you: The study looked at three examples of risk taking behaviour in men and women - sexual risk taking, gambling and reckless driving - and found men were more willing to take risks for women . So, it appears, men have inherited this willingness to face dangers for women from our risk-friendly ancestors. But in a modern age where these primeval problems are all but extinct, men are looking for other risks to boast their willingness to face danger. The study looks at three examples of risk taking behaviour in men and women: sexual risk taking (like unprotected sex), gambling and reckless driving. In all three tests, men were more likely to take the inherent risks involved once a romantic element has been induced. Women however showed no more desire to take unnecessary risks.

A 9-year-old boy being picked up by his mother from daycare was shot and killed, apparently at random, by a crazed man with a semiautomatic pistol. Devin Aryal, who was in the fourth grade, was shot by 34-year-old Nhan Lap Tran as he fired at random at passing vehicles outside of the Twin Cities, police said. His mother, Melissa Aryal, was also wounded in the shooting, and held her dying son in her arms as he breathed his last. ‘It all happened really fast,’ she told the Pioneer Press, saying that she pulled over when she saw she was bleeding. She saw Devin slumped over in his seat. ‘Just hearing his breath, I had hope,’ the grieving mother told the paper. The mother and son were rushed to Regions Hospital in St. Paul, where Devin was declared dead. Doctors said he had been shot in the brain. According to the police, Tran, 34, of Oakdale, shot at random while standing alongside a road starting at around 6:10pm last night. Police Chief Bill Sullivan said at a news conference Tuesday that there was no known motivation to Tran’s alleged shooting spree. ‘He was shooting the vehicles randomly.’ Scroll down for video .

The road passing under the bridge was closed off by quick thinking passers-by following the incident between junctions 41 and 42 at around 8.25am. The area was then cordoned off properly by police, with two lanes of the motorway shut off. Officers are still trying to work out how the truck came to be stuck on the edge of the bridge and are appealing for witnesses.

The scene was reminiscent of the thrilling climax of Peter Collinson's much-loved 1969 film starring Sir Michael Caine and Benny Hill. The classic literally ends on a cliffhanger with the heist gang's getaway vehicle left hanging over the edge of a vast precipice. Members of the gang are all stuck at one end of the coach with the gold at the other.

"By . Mark Duell . UPDATED: . 17:18 EST, 24 November 2011 . The wife of ex-Penn State coach Joe Paterno faced an embarrassing situation earlier this week when she was reportedly turned away from a campus pool. Sue Paterno, 84, is an avid swimmer known for taking early-morning laps in the Pennsylvania pool and relatives were left upset after she was turned away, a source close to her family revealed. School trustees fired Mr Paterno earlier this month from the job he held for nearly a half-century in the aftermath of child sex abuse charges against former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky. No pool entry: Sue Paterno, wife of ex-Penn State coach Joe Paterno, is pictured left yelling to people who left food at the front door of the couple's home, and right accepting flowers from a well-wisher on the doorstep . A university spokesman said he was unaware of a directive ordering Mrs Paterno to be turned away from the pool, which was first reported by the Patriot News of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. But doubts still remained over the story's veracity, after NBC reported the indoor pool was in fact closed to all the public - despite sources confirming she was turned away to the Patriot News and AP. Mrs Paterno was a longtime fixture at the school and helped raise money for the library and organized Special Olympics on campus. Mr Paterno was also recently diagnosed with a treatable form of lung cancer - but he is focused on beating the illness ‘and seeing the full truth’ emerge, the source told the Associated Press. The school had said last week that Mr Paterno still held tenure. Thankful: Sue Paterno reacts at the front door when students and well-wishers bring gifts to their home in State College, Pennsylvania, shortly after Mr Paterno was fired . Mr Paterno testified before a grand jury looking into the abuse allegations that a graduate assistant told him in 2002 that he witnessed an incident in the shower in the team locker room. Prosecutors have said Mr Paterno had . passed on the information to his superior. But Mr Paterno has said . specific actions alleged to have occurred in the grand jury report were . not relayed to him. 'With the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more' Joe Paterno . Mr Paterno is not a target of the investigation, authorities say. But the state's top cop criticised the way school leaders handled allegations and said Mr Paterno and others should have done more. Mr Paterno announced his retirement effective at the end of the season, saying that the scandal was ‘one of the great sorrows of my life. With the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more.’ But the trustees fired the 84-year-old anyway about 12 hours later. Out: School trustees fired Joe Paterno earlier this month from the job he held for nearly a half-century in the aftermath of child sex abuse charges against former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky . His son, Scott, said last week in a statement that his father’s cancer was diagnosed during a follow-up visit for a bronchial illness. He requested privacy for the family. 'We're focusing on Wisconsin. (But) definitely we've been thinking about him, and we're hoping he's doing all right, and just praying for him' Linebacker Nate Stupar .

Britain is planning to leave military equipment worth more than £2billion in Afghanistan when it withdraws from the war. Around 40 per cent of hardware - including up to 1,200 protected trucks and personnel carriers - will be scrapped, sold or given away by the Ministry of Defence. Military chiefs are preparing to bring home 6,500 containers of kit from the frontline. But some 4,500 loads will remain in the warzone. Mastiff armoured vehicle on a test run at Kandahar Air base, Afghanistan. This is one of the vehicles that may be left behind . Some equipment will be gifted to the Afghan National Army and Police so they can maintain security when the UK leaves in December 2014. Other pieces of kit deemed surplus to requirement will be destroyed so it does not fall into the hands of insurgents. But the planning assumptions, revealed by the MoD, have fuelled concern that sensitive equipment could inadvertently fall into the Taliban's clutches. Dr John Louth, of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) defence think-tank, said: 'What is benevolent today could be quite nasty tomorrow. The typical danger is that people who aren't your friend could somehow end up with it and use it. 'There could also be technical issues. There could be some very interesting technology in the kit that, if you thought about it, you wouldn't want a third party to get.' Taliban guerrilla fighters hold their weapons at a secret base in eastern Afghanistan. There are fears that the weapons to end up in the hands of terrorists . David Livingstone, a security strategist at foreign affairs think-tank Chatham House, said: 'There will always be a risk that something with a UK Army serial number will get passed across [to the enemy].' Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said: 'In an uncertain world it is essential that the UK retains much of the equipment deployed in Afghanistan. 'The UK's military needs must be the priority but we must consider how we can best support Afghan forces who have a long-term challenge to secure lasting peace.' Defence chiefs have not disclosed the type or value of equipment it will bring home. The Mail, however, has been told the overall cost of kit left on the battlefield is expected to be at least £2billion. The decision is likely to prove controversial as the Armed Forces are being forced to make drastic cuts to save money and tackle a £38billion black hole in the equipment budget. The cost of transporting 'low-grade' equipment and supplies back to the UK will be up to £12,000 per 20ft-long container, say the MoD. For vehicles and sensitive material it will rise to £30,000 per load. Of the 1,900 protected vehicles being used by the Army in southern Afghanistan, the Mail understands only 700 vehicles have been listed for 'recovery'. They are mainly the latest and most heavily armoured, such as Mastiffs, Ridgebacks and Foxhounds. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond insists that it bringing some equipment back to the UK will not be good 'value for money'. Among the most prized vehicles that will be left behind are Wolfhound personnel carriers, some Jackals, a weapons-mounted armoured patrol vehicle, and a small number of heavily-protected Warthog all-terrain vehicles. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'We will only bring back equipment that we need as part of our equipment plan. 'There will be a value for money case on each individual line of equipment . 'Where equipment does not represent value for money, after taking into account the cost of getting it back from theatre and then refurbishing it into the core equipment plan, it will not be brought back; it will either be sold, gifted or destroyed. 'We will look at all the options for equipment that is not required. 'Is it useful to the Afghans? Is it sustainable by the Afghans? Can we afford to gift it to the Afghans? Is there a sale route for it? Is it something that we can sensibly attempt to sell? We will make a case-by-case judgment.' An MoD spokesman said: 'Before gifting any equipment we must determine that the ANSF can sustain this equipment in terms of cost of ownership, support and enduring training. 'We want to ensure that our Afghan partner forces receive the equipment they need without duplication or unnecessary complexity.'","4,500 containers of equipment will remain in Afghanistan after the British army leaves .

Yesterday, it filed a notice with the . state that it was eliminating 275 staffers at its Manhattan offices at . 200 Park Ave., 745 Seventh Ave. and 1301 Avenue of the Americas. Barclays Capital is the investment banking division of Barclays PLC. In October, Barclays PLC reported a net loss of £200 million (322 million dollars) for the third quarter. The changes came as new CEO Anthony Jenkins prepares to unveil an overhaul of the British banking giant next Tuesday. He is expected to provide more details on his revamp when the firm reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 12. Grim: Barclays Capital says it plans to lay off 275 employees at three offices in New York . Last week Jenkins has told staff to sign up to its new caring, sharing values – or quit. Jenkins, who is on a crusade to clean up the bank’s sullied reputation, warned there is ‘no place’ at Barclays for those who do not ‘fully buy in’ to its ‘new purpose and values’. In an impassioned memo to his 140,000 employees, he admitted that banking had ‘lost its way’ and become ‘too aggressive’. He laid out plans to link bonuses to ethical behaviour rather than short term profits, promising: ‘We must never again be in a position of rewarding people for making the bank money in a way which is unethical or inconsistent with our values’. Critics complained about delays in introducing the new system and described it as ‘shocking’  that Barclays does not already subscribe to these basic standards and has to tell staff how to behave. He told staff the bank’s core values will be ‘respect, integrity, service, excellence and stewardship’. Some 1,000 managers will be trained over the next few weeks so they can instil these values in their staff. In the summer, a new ‘performance assessment approach’ will be introduced for senior employees, and will be used to measure 2013 bonuses. The system will be rolled out for all employees over the following 12 months. Criteria are likely to include feedback from customers. Jenkins warned staff who fail to ‘fully buy in to’ the new approach: ‘My message to those people is simple: Barclays is not the place for you.’","Barclays says the layoffs will take place beginning May .

Some locals assumed the man was Mr Bradley - which is when the evil hate campaign began. Rumours circulated that Mr Bradley was under protection from the Home Office because he was Robert Thompson, who murdered James Bulger, two, along with Jon Venables, now both 30, in 1993. Scott Bradley was accused of being Robert . Thompson, left, who murdered James Bulger in February 1993 along . with Jon Venables, right. The pair were given new identities on release . The rumours started spreading to other villages and Mr Bradley, who had a teenage daughter and a young son, could not find work. Then they intensified after after a local playwright wrote a . fictional play last year about Robert Thompson moving to a remote . coastal village in Galloway. The play, Village of the Damned, proved so controversial that playwright . Des Dillon was interviewed by police. Jamie Bulger, who was abducted and murdered in 1993 at the age of two . In June this year it was revealed . Dillon was negotiating the rights to turn it into a Hollywood film. Mr Bradley, who moved to Scotland seven . years ago, left a heartbreaking suicide note which read: 'They called me . all sorts - a paedophile, a follower of young girls, walking around . bullying old people. 'The list is endless. And I’m supposed to be a child killer.' Mrs Bradley said Scott had turned into a nervous wreck after a campaign of hate in which he was branded a killer and a paedophile. She said at the time of his death: 'My son was tormented by the allegations. He had a good heart and didn’t deserve this. It’s been heartbreaking. 'He kept saying ‘I’ve had enough, I’m going to kill myself’, but I didn’t believe him.' James Bulger's mother Denise Fergus said . earlier this month that she was 'shocked and upset' to hear of Mr Bradley's death and claimed . he would still be alive if the identities of Thompson and Jon Venables . were not a secret. Mrs Fergus said: 'What happened to Scott makes my blood run cold. 'I’m shocked and upset that he has apparently taken his own life. 'Whatever . the rights and wrongs of this case, this is one that shows how . dangerous it is to spread false rumours and gossip about something as . serious as the identity of child killers.' She . said: 'Sadly Scott’s death goes to show it is other people who are left . to suffer as a result of the official conspiracy, lies and deceit that . the authorities have used in this case.' Robert Thompson and Jon Venables were just 10 years old when they abducted James Bulger from a shopping centre in Bootle in February 1993. Denise Fergus, James Bulger's mother, said she was 'shocked and upset' to hear of Mr Bradley's death . The pair walked the toddler several miles to a railway line in Walton, where they tortured and killed him, leaving his body on a train line where it was hit by a train. Thompson and Venables were convicted of murder and served eight years in prison before being freed in 2001 and issued with secret new identities to protect them from vigilantes. Venables was recalled to prison in 2010 after downloading child pornography. He is set to remain in prison indefinitely for his own safety after revealing his true identity.","Scott Bradley, 36, was found hanging after months of being hounded by mob who circulated false rumours he was child-killer Robert Thompson .

However, pictures from the state's news channel have taken the focus away from the former leader, whose embalmed body went on display in his trademark khaki jumpsuit, to his son's wife. Walking alongside Kim Jong Un, Ri Sol-Ju looked as though she may be pregnant. Video footage appears to show her - the only woman in a parade past Jong Il's body in the Kumsusan mausoleum - wearing some kind of black maternity dress. If there is any doubt, a second clip on a square outside the former presidential palace in Pyongyang offers a side profile that confirms what many now believe. A new dictator is on its way. A man answering the phone at the Embassy of North Korea today said: 'I have no idea, I have no comment.'

In October, Ri Sol-ju appeared in public for the first time in two months after what was believed to be 'home detention'. However, after it was revealed that she might be pregnant, there was speculation that she was in the early stages of maternity. Kim Jong Il's embalmed body is . currently lying in state a few floors below his father, national founder . Kim Il Sung. Kim Jong Il has been laid out beneath a red blanket, with a . spotlight shining on his face. Wails echoed through the cold hall as a group of North Korean women sobbed as they bowed before his body.

Opera singer Eliana Pretorian outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London where she escaped the threat of jail over a contractual dispute . A young opera star has escaped the threat of jail after she was pursued through the courts by a businessman claiming a cut of her earnings. UK-based Eliana Pretorian appeared at the Royal Courts of Justice after Romanian businessman Ion Vasile applied for her committal to prison for alleged contempt of court. The case, which the soprano claims ‘nearly destroyed her life’,  has its origins in a deal said to have been struck between Miss Pretorian’s father and Mr Vasile in 1999, which the businessman claimed entitled him to a share of her future earnings as a singer in return for financing her music studies. But Miss Pretorian, a soprano who regularly performs at Glyndebourne and Sadler’s Wells, said any such ‘contract’ is worthless because she was only 17 at the time. Her barrister, Paul Stadden, attacked the deal as ‘usurious’. Miss Pretorian’s father is said to have agreed on her behalf to pay Mr Vasile 35 per cent of her professional income – ‘earned in such ten years as he might choose’ – in return for a $6,900 (£4,400) contribution to the cost of her musical training. Now aged 31 and pregnant, Miss Pretorian tried to have the agreement overturned but the Romanian courts rejected her case in February 2009 and ordered her to pay Mr Vasile his legal costs. The judgment was later formally recognised by the English courts. Lawyers representing Mr Vasile . applied for her committal to jail, accusing her of failing to disclose . comprehensive details of her professional income. Soprano: Eliana Pretorian (pictured singing at an Amnesty International ceremony at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London last year) said any 'contract' is worthless because she was only 17 at the time . But Judge Richard Seymour QC threw out the case on Wednesday, ruling that it was ‘doomed to failure’. He said Miss Pretorian had not . breached any undertaking to fully disclose her earnings and that she . could not be punished ‘for failing to do something she was not obliged . to do’. By mid-December last year, Miss Pretorian had done all that was required of her, he said. Judge Seymour added: ‘What was . unexplained was why, that having happened, the decision was taken – by . or on behalf of Mr Vasile – to pursue the application for committal. ‘It is manifest that the application to commit is wholly without merit.’ He ordered Mr Vasile, who was not in . court, to pay £6,525 in legal costs. Outside court, mother-of-one Miss . Pretorian said she felt the deal was ‘immoral to the root’. She claimed she had gained little from it and achieved success through her own efforts. It had overshadowed her ever since, . even after she won a prestigious scholarship to study at the Royal . College of Music, she said. She added: ‘It nearly destroyed my life. It was never a question of him discovering me or his money being vital to my career.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Eliana Pretorian, 31, was accused of contempt of court by a businessman .

Mr Cawley, a postman from Bromley, South East London, said: ‘There were teeth marks in his head. I think the fox tried to bite his head first but it didn’t fit so he bit Denny’s hand. Injured: Denny with teeth wounds on his face after the fox attack . ‘His mother Hayley heard his screams and then a thud as the fox pulled Denny off the sofa. She said that when she ran towards the fox, it hissed at her through its teeth. ‘If it hadn’t been for her quick actions, who knows what would have happened. We think the fox must have smelled Denny as I don’t think he’d have seen him from the garden.’ Denny was attacked by a male fox while he was on the sofa in the living room and tried to drag him out of the house by the hand, severing his left ring finger. Luckily, his mother Hayley Cawley, 28, heard his screams and the thud as the fox pulled the baby to the door and ran downstairs. She wrestled the fox off her son, but not before it hissed at her. Recovering: Denny Dolan who was attacked by a fox in Bromley. His hand is heavily bandaged where the fox severed a finger . He added: ‘I went to see him in hospital and he managed a little smile for me. ‘He’s recovering well, though there’s not much chance he’ll get the feeling back in his ring finger on his left hand where the fox bit him. ‘Hayley has been by his side since it happened.

A coach driver who caused the deaths of two people while over the drink-drive limit has been jailed for six years. Jasminder Singh Dhesi had been drinking high-strength lager hours before his unroadworthy coach broke down three times in heavy fog. He parked it in the slow lane of the southbound carriageway on the M5 where it was eventually struck by a Volvo HGV. Jasminder Dhesi, 50 leaves Birmingham Crown Court after pleading guilty to charges of dangerous driving . Birmingham Crown Court heard that Dhesi, 50, failed a roadside breath test after the crash, which claimed the lives of coach passenger and father-of-three Liaquat Ali, 35, and lorry driver William Mapstone, 65. Mr Mapstone, from Wells in Somerset, died in hospital after the collision on the M5 near Birmingham on March 24 last year, while Mr Ali, from Smethwick, West Midlands, was pronounced dead at the scene. The crash also injured 39 other passengers who were travelling to work at a food packaging plant in Evesham. During today’s sentencing hearing, it emerged that Dhesi was fined for drink-driving 12 years ago after falling asleep and crashing a bus into another vehicle. Passing sentence, Judge Michael Chambers QC expressed concern as to whether Dhesi, of Nether Hall Avenue, Great Barr, West Midlands, was remorseful for his actions. William Mapstone (left) and Liaquat Ali (right) who were both killed when Mr Mapstone's lorry collided with Dhesi's coach . An HGV crashed into the coach as it was parked in the slow lane . The accident cost the lives of a passenger and the driver of the lorry . Judge Chambers told the father-of-two, who pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, that the fatal accident near Frankley Services on the southbound M5 had been entirely foreseeable and avoidable. The judge told Dhesi: 'Travelling on the motorway as you did clearly caused a substantial risk to other road users and also the passengers on your bus. 'The aggravating features are the degree of risk that you created, having regard to the road conditions and the size of your vehicle, and that two deaths have been caused. 'There is also an aggravating feature in that you were driving under the influence of alcohol.' The court heard that Dhesi, who was driving a party of more than 30 fruit-packers from Birmingham to Evesham, was initially found to have 46 micrograms of alcohol in 100ml of breath, well above the legal limit of 35 micrograms. Dhesi has been sentenced to six years in jail and a four year driving ban following the crash . But a test carried out at a police station two hours after the crash gave a reading just below the legal limit and Dhesi was not charged with drink-driving. The judge, who imposed a four-year driving ban, told the coach driver: 'In my judgment it can be safely inferred that two hours previously it would have been over the legal limit for driving. 'At the root of the present case is a serious loss of judgment - alcohol impairs judgment.' Prosecutor Neil Bannister told the . court the single-decker coach had twice pulled over onto the hard . shoulder of the M5 due to a fuel supply problem. Despite . travelling for less than a mile after joining the M5 near Halesowen, . the 19-year-old coach broke down for a third time near a footbridge on a . stretch of carriageway with no hard shoulder at 6.07am. Several . vehicles, including a crane and another lorry, were forced to take . avoiding action before Mr Mapstone’s lorry struck, travelling at 54mph, . struck the stranded coach at 6.17am. Dozens . of workers travelling on the coach were injured, including a . 29-year-old man who remains in hospital with severe neurological . injuries. Defence counsel . Raglan Ashton submitted that Dhesi was a hard-working family man who was . attempting to drive his vehicle to the nearby service station. The collision was a direct consequence result of a mechanical break-down, the lawyer added. Commenting after the case, Rukshsana Mohammed, Senior Crown Prosecutor from West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, said: . 'Jasminder . Dhesi was an experienced driver who was employed to ferry workers to a . food packaging plant in Evesham, Worcestershire. “It was his duty to . ensure that the vehicle he was using was roadworthy and in a suitable . condition to be used on the public road network. Dhesi, who was an experienced driver had a previous conviction for drink driving . Dhesi is described as having made a 'grave decision' to coninue the journey with a faulty vehicle . 'Any prudent driver would have been aware that to continue driving a faulty vehicle onto the motorway was dangerous and instead they should have stopped and sought assistance. 'However, Dhesi made a grave decision to continue the journey.' Relatives of Mr Mapstone, 65, and Mr Ali, a married father-of-three, attended court to see Dhesi jailed. Speaking to the media outside the . court, Mr Mapstone’s son-in-law, Kai Markall, read a statement on behalf . of the family. Mr Markall said: 'The family would like to express their . thanks to all of the emergency services and those that were involved on . the day of this tragedy, who all worked tirelessly to minimise . everyone’s loss. 'Special . thanks go to the family liaison officers who have helped provide the . answers to all the painful questions we all wish to know when going . through this unimaginable pain. 'William, . dad, grandad, Bill Mapstone, leaves behind a loving wife, four . beautiful children who in turn provided him with 14 heartbroken . grandchildren. Dhesi's coach had broken down three times in under a mile . 'The loss of life and pain felt by the Mapstone family can never be measured in the sentence passed today. The family can only hope that from this tragedy others will learn that your actions and choices in life can seriously affect others.' Giving a message to other drivers, Mr Markall added: “If in trouble, call for help. Better to be late than to never arrive. 'Hopefully today is closure for the family but please feel our pain. Please share our loss. Drive safely, arrive late.' A statement was also read to the media by solicitor Katijah Ahmed on behalf of Mr Ali’s wife, Fozia Shaheen, and his brother, Ashfaq Ahmed. In their statement, Mr Ali’s family said: “We have been through a tragic ordeal over the last 11 months. 'Liaquat was a wonderful husband, father and brother who doted over his three young children. 'Whilst we are relieved that justice has been served today. We will never be able to overcome our loss.'","Jasminder Singh Dhesi's 19-year-old coach broke down three times in less than a mile .

Mrs Beesley, 37, a management consultant, wept as she told how the ambitious Lib Dem politician ‘went on and on’ about the points until her mother gave in. ‘I remember speaking to my mother and she told me that Chris had been caught speeding and he was trying to get her to take the speeding points,’ she said. ‘If he took the points he would have lost his licence. He was very insistent. 'He didn’t want to lose the election. 'He was standing for election and had to travel regularly to Eastleigh. ‘He said to her if she didn’t take them he would not be able to drive, he would lose his licence and it would be her fault if he didn’t get elected. She was upset, angry and felt bullied and didn’t want to take the points.’ Huhne was elected as the Lib Dem MP for Eastleigh in 2005. Mrs Beesley, Pryce’s elder daughter from her first marriage, was called to give evidence on her behalf on the fourth day of her trial for perverting the course of justice. Standing a few yards from Pryce, 59, at Southwark Crown Court, Mrs Beesley said she had moved out of the Clapham family home when the points saga took place. But she said she still spoke to her mother at least once or twice a week as Pryce struggled to look after two troubled teenage children. Hearing: Pryce (left) arriving at Southwark Crown Court , where she is standing trial accused of perverting the course of justice. Chris Huhne (pictured right outside court last week) has admitted the same charge . Evidence: Mrs Beesley said she could not remember if her mother asked for advice but said she 'definitely told her that she should not take the points' She added: ‘Chris was insisting she take the points. ‘He just went on and on and said it . was not a big deal. He couldn’t understand why she wouldn’t do it. I . don’t remember if she asked for advice. I definitely told her she should . not take the points. ‘I knew she did sign the form. She . told me the form came back and it had already been filled in that she . was the driver. She felt pressurised into signing the form.’ Mrs Beesley . said the decision to sign the form provoked further rows in the family. She said: ‘It was spoken about after Chris lost his licence anyway. Mum had to drive him whenever he needed driving. ‘A lot of comments were made around . that time – “I have got to drive you anyway even though I took the . points”. There was quite a lot of resentment... that she had to do . something she really did not want to do and the outcome was exactly the . same.’ Affair: Huhne left Pryce for his aide Carina Trimingham, right; they are pictured outside court this week . Greek-born Pryce admits taking the points for her then husband but claims she is not guilty on the grounds of marital coercion. Huhne, 58, is preparing for prison . after he admitted perverting the course of justice on the morning of his . trial. He then stood down as MP. The trial continues today. The jury have been told they are likely to be sent out to consider their verdict tomorrow. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Vicky Pryce told daughter in 2003 that Huhne bullied her into taking points .

"By . Ben Spencer . PUBLISHED: . 06:43 EST, 11 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:03 EST, 11 February 2013 . Message: Vince Cable, pictured yesterday in Eastleigh, said 'unfriendly and inflexible' visa rules are putting off rich immigrants from coming to Britain . Britain needs to attract rich immigrants who are being put off by ‘unfriendly and inﬂexible’ visa rules, Vince Cable warned last night. The future of the British economy depends on attracting trade and visitors from powerful economies such as China - who are being deterred by red tape, the Business Secretary said. Citing figures that suggest the UK is being shunned by tourists and business visitors in favour of Italy, France and Germany, Mr Cable said the country ‘can’t afford to miss out’ on lucrative opportunities. His belief in more open borders puts him at odds with some of his Coalition colleagues. The Liberal Democrat’s views are shared by some in the Conservative front benches, including Chancellor George Osborne, but Home Secretary Theresa May and others think relaxing rules could undermine national security. Mr Cable, writing in an article for the Telegraph, said: ‘China is the new  economic superpower and we must treat its re-emergence with respect: as an opportunity rather than a threat... our future prosperity will depend on it. ‘But if we are serious about trading more with countries such as China, then we must make sure our borders are as open as possible to genuine tourism, business visitors, investment and trade. ‘Chinese spending on tourism alone has increased 400 per cent in the last decade. ‘Britain simply can’t afford to miss out on that. He added: ‘If we are serious about trading more with countries such as China, then we must make sure our borders are as open as possible to genuine tourism, business visitors, investment and trade. ‘Of course, it is necessary to prevent abuse of the immigration rules. But equally we cannot allow red tape to deter the very people that we want to come to the UK and help make the economy stronger. ‘We want to create and promote an image of Britain which means and delivers what it says on the tin: open for global business.’ Britain’s share of Chinese visitors has fallen over the last ﬁve years, he said. Uncompetitive: The Business Secretary says Chinese nationals are going to Europe instead of Britain because of red tape . Business groups have warned that Chinese tourists, who spend an average of £1,600 per visit, are shunning Britain in favour of European countries. Mr Cable said: ‘With anecdotal evidence of people saying our visa system is unfriendly and inﬂexible, it’s no wonder that there were only 180,000 Chinese visitors to the UK in 2011, a small fraction of those going to continental Europe. ‘Britain can compete and win its share of global markets. But when the French and Germans have already rolled out the red carpet and are reaping the beneﬁts, we cannot afford to lose out.’ Home Secretary Theresa May has recently hit out at criticism of the way the visa system is run, insisting it was something ‘we can be proud of’. She said last week: ‘The continued use of spurious ﬁgures and skewed perceptions of the way we run our visa system is damaging its reputation. And it is the very people who claim to be pro-growth who are guilty of spreading this harmful message.’","Tourists and business visitors are going elsewhere in Europe, he says .

President Barack Obama used the State of the Union address as the time to announce that 34,000 of the 66,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan will be home in America within one year. 'Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan. This drawdown will continue. And by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over,' he said boldly during his speech. An aide close to the president released the information anonymously a few hours before the speech, but he confirmed it in front of a crowd of cheering politicians later in the evening. Scroll down for video . Eying the next step: President Obama announced on Tuesday that 34,000 troops will return home from Afghanistan over the course of the next year as the military winds down it's presence in the country . Addressing the crowd: Though it was leaked earlier in the day, the news was formally announced during the State of the Union address in the House Chamber . The U.S. is still finalizing plans for . the size and scope of its military presence after the war ends. The . White House has said it would be open to leaving no troops in . Afghanistan, though it's likely that a small presence will remain, in . keeping with the Pentagon's preferences. The skilful plan allows the military commanders in Afghanistan the flexibility they require in controling the speed of the troop reductions. Aware that the majority of fighting intensifies against the Taliban from now until October, the military were keen to retain a significant force to allow them to mange their withdrawal. Speaking to the New York Times, White House officials would not be pressed into revealing the exact timetable for the troop reductions - but said that numbers will fall to around 60,000 in spring. That number would remain through the fighting season and then would encounter the drop to 32,000 by this exact time next year. Military backing: Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Martin Dempsey (left) points out someone in the crowd while speaking with outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Army Staff Raymond Odierno (right) at the State of the Union . Passing the baton: President Obama gives his new Secretary of State John Kerry a hug before the speech. Kerry will be the top diplomat who deals with Afghanistan government officials as the withdrawal begins . A Washington Post poll out Tuesday morning shows that 80 per cent of registered . voters support the president's policy to end the war in Afghanistan. Obama discussed the next phases of the troop reduction with Afghan President Hamid Karzai during a day-long meeting in Washington last month, the first meeting between the two leaders since Obama's re-election. The two leaders agreed to accelerate their timetable for putting Afghan forces in the lead combat role nationwide, moving that transition up from the summer to the spring. The White House has a range of options to reduce troop levels in Afghanistan and has been considering whether to leave no troops in country following the end of operations in 2014. The plans were drawn up by General John Allen, who was until recently the U.S. commander in the war-torn country and whose final days were smeared by his links to the scandal which caused the resignation of David Petraeus as CIA Director. Allen was cleared of any allegations of inappropriate behavior in the scandal and was replaced in Afghanistan by Marine General Joseph Dunford.

'Today is not about change, it's about continuity,' said Dunford at a change-of-command ceremony in Kabul, . Progress: Once the 34,000 troops are removed, the American force in the country will be cut in half . 'I'll endeavor to continue the momentum of the campaign and support the people of Afghanistan as they seize the opportunity for a brighter future.' Speaking earlier this year in January, President Obama confirmed that most U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan would end in spring. 'Our troops will continue to fight alongside Afghans when needed, but let me say it as plainly as I can: Starting this spring, our troops will have a different mission - training, advising, assisting Afghan forces,' said Mr. Obama on January 11th in an East Room news conference. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said today in a farewell speech at the Pentagon that he thought the U.S. was pursuing the right strategy. 'We are on the right track in Afghanistan,' he said. Some private security analysts, as well as some Pentagon officials, worry that pulling out of Afghanistan too quickly will leave the battle-scarred country vulnerable to collapse. In a worst-case scenario, that could allow the Taliban to regain power and revert to the role they played in the years before 9/11 as protectors of al-Qaeda terrorists bent on striking the U.S. Many Americans, however, are weary of the war, according to public opinion polls, and are skeptical of any claim that Afghanistan is worth more U.S. blood.

A Kansas man convicted of murdering his girlfriend's young son has escaped from jail the day before he was expected to be sentenced to life in prison. Antonio M.

Police were hunting for the 29-year-old killer who they described as 'extremely dangerous' late into the night using trained dogs and a Kansas Highway Patrol airplane but have failed to locate him. Brown pleaded no contest in January to first-degree murder and child abuse in the November 2011 death of 14-month-old Clayden Urbanek. The toddler died in hospital of tears to his intestines after Brown punched him two or three times in the stomach over a two-week period while he was in his care. Clayden's mother, Brittney N.

A 102-year-old woman has been chosen to sit next to Michelle Obama at the annual State of the Union address in Washington. Desaline Victor, a naturalized U.S citizen from Miami, Florida, waited for more than three hours to cast her ballot for the President on November 6. Ms Victor will sit in the First Lady’s box with military families, people who are championing immigration reform and victims of gun violence. Desaline Victor, 102, waited for three hours to vote for President Obama . Ms Victor will sit with Michelle Obama, pictured here on her husband's inauguration day . Haitian born Ms Victor, who is known as ‘Granny’ in her local community, expressed her surprise at the opportunity. She said: ‘I know I’m going to sit with the president’s wife. I did not think I would get here. I am proud.’ White House Officials say that Ms Victor represents the minorities and immigrants who stand to benefit from the policies President Obama will discuss in his speech. She is also a symbol of the thousands of Americans who struggled to vote in November. Former farm worker, Ms Victor, came to the government’s attention after she waited hours to vote at her local library where people were waiting up to six hours. She stood in line for three hours before a voting rights activist reported that an elderly woman was struggling on her feet. After being asked to return later in the evening, she emerged from the polls wearing an ‘I voted’ sticker causing the crowd to erupt into applause. The White House said that the ‘spirited and independent centenarian’ had encouraged many to continue waiting rather than giving up on voting. Ms Victor said that all she wanted to do was vote in the election: ‘The line was shorter at night. I wanted to vote for my guy, my son President Obama.’ Lyn McDonnell with her daughter Grace. The mother will attend the State of the Union to represent victims of gun crime . Philippe Derose, a North Miami Beach councilman said: ‘She said even if she got dizzy or collapsed on the line, ’This is something I have to do.’ President Obama said in ‘we have to fix that’ in reference to the voting wait issue in his election night speech and is expected to address the voting time issue in the State of the Union address. The State of the Union is a notable point in the political calendar of the United States. Given by the President, it reports on the condition of the nation and outlines the agenda for the year. The Constitution forces the President to do this as it serves as a reminder that he reports to Congress and the American people. The Constitution says: 'He shall from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.' Traditionally the President makes this speech in January or February each year of his term. He also raised the subject in his . inauguration speech when he said: ‘Our journey is not complete until no . citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote.’ Ms Victor, who arrived in the U.S in 1989, said that she enjoys attending church services and cooking her own meals. Victims of gun violence have also been invited to the address, including the mother of a victim of the Newtown, Connecticut school massacre. Lyn McDonnell, mother of Grace, 7, has been asked to attend by Representative Lois Frankel of West Palm Beach. Grace’s father gave the President one of his daughter’s drawings which he now keeps in his private study. Obama has described the painting as a reminder of what he has to do to prevent future attacks. The shooting took the lives of 26 people including 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary school when Adam Lanza opened fire. Frankel said that gun gun reform is the most important issue of the moment. She said: ‘The reality is that it’s going to be pressure from the public that’s going to move some of our colleagues, and that’s the reason so many of us are bringing guests from Newtown. ‘I want my colleagues to look these parents in the eye, and tell them that we can get this done, that we can do something. You cannot look these parents in the eye and say “I’m sorry, there’s nothing we can do.” That’s why these folks are going to be there.’ Frankel sits on the Democratic Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, proposing several gun control measures including a ban on high capacity magazines.","Desaline Victor from Miami, Florida, has been selected to sit in the First Lady's box .

Reading a self-help book really can alleviate depression, new research suggests. Patients offered books had significantly lower levels of depression four months later than those offered routine GP care such as antidepressants. The findings are good news in an era where non-drug forms of treatment, such as talking therapies, are hard to come by. More than 200 patients who had been . diagnosed with depression by their GP took part in the University of Glasgow study. Half of them were on antidepressant drugs and some were provided with a self-help . guide dealing with different aspects of depression, such as sleep problems. These people read the book and had support sessions. The self-help book was based on the . principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) which is a . well-established ‘talking therapy’ for depression. It is based on the principle that problems can be managed by changing thought process and actions. But accessing a therapist can be difficult. CBT is already recommended by NICE (the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) for the treatment . of depression, either as a first-line treatment for mild to moderate . depression, or in combination with antidepressants for more severe . depression. However, as it is usually provided by specialist therapists, people in some areas may have limited access to treatment. In the study, patients who read the books also had three meetings with a support worker who went through the literature and helped the volunteers plan what changes to make. After four months those who had been . prescribed the self-help books had significantly lower levels of . depression than those who received usual GP care. After four months, those who had been prescribed the self-help books had significantly lower levels of depression than those who got usual GP care . Participants in the guided self-help CBT group also had better . knowledge of depression,  the researchers reported in the journal Plos One. Study leader Prof Christopher Williams, who also wrote the books called Overcoming Depression and Low Mood, said the guided . sessions were crucial in the success of the books. He told the BBC that the sessions could be delivered by GPs, rather than therapists, thereby reducing the waiting lists for talking therapies. The sessions can be delivered in general practice without referral to a specialist, taking pressure off waiting lists. 'We found this had a really significant clinical impact and the findings are very encouraging,' he told the BBC. 'Depression saps people's motivation and makes it hard to believe change is possible.' The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Public Library of Science (PLoS) One.","Patients offered books had significantly lower levels of depression four months and a year later .

They were found to have some of the widest achievement gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged pupils in research covering more than 60 countries. Researchers for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development who compared the reading skills of teenagers with their social backgrounds found that disadvantaged students were twice as likely to be among the poorest performers. Poor performance: The UK is ranked below average in the international comparison of social mobility, with advantaged pupils scoring around 92 points higher on their 2009 reading tests than disadvantaged teenagers . On average, an advantaged teenager . scored 88 points more than a disadvantaged one on reading tests, the . equivalent of more than two years of schooling. At the top end of the spectrum, . Shanghai in China, Hong Kong, Finland, South Korea, Canada and Japan . combined high results and high levels of fairness. The UK was ranked below average, with . advantaged pupils scoring around 92 points more on their 2009 reading . tests than disadvantaged teenagers. In September, the OECD said UK . schools were among the most socially segregated in the world, with . children from immigrant backgrounds crammed into disadvantaged schools. The UK belongs to a group of countries, including Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, France, Hungary, Belgium and the United States, that are successful in terms of above average results, but have lower levels of equity. Meanwhile, Russia, Spain, Croatia and the Czech Republic are relatively strong on equal opportunities but have low levels of performance. Bulgaria, Turkey and Kyrgyzstan perform badly in both equity and results. The report, Are Countries Moving Towards More Equitable Education Systems? says that students from socio-economically advantaged and disadvantaged families ‘should be equally likely to succeed in school’. Standard: The UK is ranked below average in the international comparison of social mobility, with advantaged pupils scoring around 92 points higher on their 2009 reading tests than disadvantaged teenagers . It says: ‘The fact that school systems vary in the degree to which they allow socio-economic differences to become differences in performance is an indication that any obstacles posed by disadvantaged social background can be overcome. ‘While some of those differences may be attributable to culture, the fact that the relationship has changed significantly in some countries suggests that policy and practice can make a difference. ‘Many countries and economies have made notable progress in narrowing the performance gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students while simultaneously improving overall performance.’ ‘We must find new ways for the entire . education system to work together to narrow these attainment gaps. A . child’s education achievements must not be determined by their postcode . or the wealth of their parents' - Sophie Livingstone, chief executive of youth and education charity City Year . Andreas Schleicher, the OECD’s special adviser on education, told the BBC’s education website that a long-term characteristic of the UK’s education system has been the polarisation between the results of rich and poor pupils. This is also a major problem for other Western economies, such as France and Germany. However, the big challenge is to develop education systems that do not accept widespread underachievement among poorer pupils. He said: ‘In the past, economies and school systems could tolerate these inequalities. But the life chances are deteriorating rapidly for those without qualifications. There are more severe penalties.’ Last September, a report from the OECD warned that the UK’s schools were among the most socially segregated in the world. The vast majority of children from immigrant backgrounds are crammed into disadvantaged schools with high proportions of fellow migrants. Sophie Livingstone, CEO of City Year, a youth and education charity in London, said yesterday: ‘The latest findings from the OECD on social mobility in UK schools paints an all too familiar picture. ‘We must find new ways for the entire education system to work together to narrow these attainment gaps.

"By . Tim Shipman and Hugo Duncan . PUBLISHED: . 12:24 EST, 6 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:32 EST, 6 December 2012 . Ministers must find £27billion of fresh spending cuts or tax rises to plug the black hole in the nation’s finances, Britain’s leading economic think-tank revealed yesterday. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said Britain is on course for £7billion of tax rises and another £20billion in welfare cuts and spending reductions after the next election. IFS director Paul Johnson also predicted that pensioner benefits such as free bus passes and television licences, and the winter fuel allowance – which David Cameron has pledged to protect until 2015 – are almost certain to be slashed after the election. Tory Chancellor George Osborne and Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander will have to set out spending cuts and tax rises until 2018 at the next election . The cuts are needed because the . Chancellor has pledged to get the national debt as a share of national . income falling by 2017 in order to convince the markets that Britain’s . recovery plan is on track. Leading ratings agency Fitch has already . threatened to strip the UK of its coveted AAA status in the wake of the . Autumn Statement. It said George Osborne’s admission . that he will miss a crucial target to cut the country’s debt burden by . 2015-16 ‘weakens the credibility’ of the public finances. But getting . debt back on track by 2017 will be painful, the IFS warned. If the next government continues to . protect spending on the NHS, schools and aid, it will have to make . real-terms cuts totalling 16 per cent in 2017 in the other departments. That would take cuts in those . departments to 31 per cent since the downturn began. Mr Johnson said no . government would dare do this, making further tax rises and welfare cuts . ‘almost inevitable’. Plans already announced by Mr Osborne . mean cuts account for 85 per cent of debt reductions in 2017, with just . 15 per cent from tax rises. Up to 2015, the Chancellor has pledged to achieve an 80-20 split between tax rises and spending cuts. If he were to achieve the same . balance in 2017, it would mean tax rises of £7billion, with the rest of . the £27billion saved from cuts to defence, councils, transport and other . departments. So far just £4.5billion of the . £10billion of welfare cuts the Chancellor has said will be necessary . have been announced, suggesting the Conservatives will seek to make at . least another £5.5billion of benefits savings after the election. But Mr Johnson said money for the NHS . and pensioners accounts for 40 per cent of public spending, and . ministers will have to take from both if they are to balance the books. Mr Osborne insisted yesterday that Britain remained a safe bet for international investors despite fears over the credit rating. A downgrade – which could drive up . borrowing costs for the Government, businesses and households – would be . a crushing humiliation for the Chancellor but economists warned that it . was only a matter of time before Britain was stripped of its AAA . rating. Labour Treasury spokesman Rachel . Reeves said: ‘The reason why there is a big hole in George Osborne’s . plan is that his reckless policies choked off the recovery and have . pushed up long-term unemployment.’ Debt mountain: The UK's public sector net debt is set to get worse than previously thought . Tax-free office perks such as subsidised food in the staff canteen could be axed under a Treasury review of workplace expenses. Other areas under threat include Christmas gifts from managers and a right for staff to take home products made by their employers at a reduced price. Chancellor George Osborne has asked officials to look at the complex area of workplace expenses to see if more tax should be paid. Documents released alongside the Autumn Statement show that the independent Office of Tax Simplification (OTS) will look at office benefits. This could also include cheap petrol and £30,000 tax-free redundancy payments. The Treasury said: ‘The Government will ask the OTS to carry out a review of ways to simplify the taxation of employee benefits and expenses and employee termination payments.’ It did not give further details but accountants said one proposal could be for HM Revenue and Customs to bring in a flat rate allowance per employee for expenses incurred off-site.","Institute for Fiscal Studies reveals extent of spending reductions needed to meet George Osborne's deficit targets .

A fizzy drink addict who sank a staggering eight litres of cola a day has lost all his teeth - and he's only in his twenties. Australian hotel hospitality worker William Kennewell ignored repeated warnings from dentists that his fondness for soft drinks would rot his teeth and has now been left with a full set of dentures at the age of 25. Mr Kennewell's addiction to the sugary drink even left him with blood poisoning. Addict: William Kennewell has lost all his teeth at the age of 25 because of an addiction to drinking cola . He said: ‘I drank between six and eight litres of soft drink, mostly cola, every day. ‘I’m told a normal person has about 23 teeth, but I only had 13 left and they had to be removed,’ he told The Advertiser newspaper in Adelaide. In fact, most adults will have 28 or 32 teeth, depending on whether they have their wisdom teeth, making Mr Kennewell’s initial teeth loss even worse. Mr Kennewell, who lives in Salisbury, 15 miles north of Adelaide, added: ‘It started because I wasn’t a huge water fan and working in the hotel industry, I had easy access to Coke. Replacement teeth: Mr Kennewell has had a full set of dentures fitted to replace his teeth which have rotted because of the amount of cola he consumed each day . ‘Because my teeth were decaying so badly, it caused blood poisoning which just made me sick – but my health improved with the dentures.’ Australian health experts are now using Mr Kennewell's addiction as a case study to show why youngsters should avoid fizzy drinks. Dr Jason Armfield, senior research fellow with the Australian Research Centre for Population Oral Health has called for health warnings on soft drink labels to include the risks of tooth decay. He has already conducted research among 16,800 Australian children that found 56 per cent of those aged between five and 16 consumed at least one sweet drink – a soft drink or juice – every day. Mr Kennewell agreed that health warnings on soft drinks was a good idea – but he wondered how effective they would be. It is little wonder that Mr Kennewell's teeth rotted, as the average 335ml can of cola contains an astonishing 39g of sugar.","William Kennewell has had a full set of dentures fitted to replace his teeth .

Among the audience yesterday was Hollywood actor in front of an audience that included Hollywood actor, Stephen Dorff. Given that this is not the first controversial use of weaponry in a fashion week show, critics have suggested this is the start of a worrying new trend. As designers fight to get heard among the noise, they are coming up with increasingly more shocking ways to grab headlines. But as a growing number of street violence incidents, military abuse and mass shootings continue to shock the world, come critics have suggested it is inappropriate for fashion brands to appropriate this violent imagery so literally and to glamourise it for financial gain.

Others sported paramilitary-style balaclavas, while others carried rubber gas masks and had faces streaked with camouflage paint. The German designer's show also included models daubed with slogan tattoos offering messages such as 'ONLY KILL FOR LOVE' and 'LIFE'S A GAME AND IT'S NOT FAIR'. Like his models, Plein also opted for a military look, appearing at the end of the show dressed in a khaki T-shirt and fatigues.

The recent round of men's fashion collections is rapidly drawing to a close with just the French capital left to show off its style nous. But while there have been triumphs (step forward Christopher Raeburn and Tom Ford), it's the deluge of sartorial disasters that have made headlines. From MAN's ludicrous plank headwear to Katie Eary's ghastly florals, there has been lots to laugh about but very little to actually wear.

But British Fashion Council member and model David Gandy's plans to turn London into the 'menswear capital of the world' took a blow as designs swiftly descended from sublime to silly. In the wake of MAN's bizarre plank hats and unfinished-looking tunics came Sibling's super-sized take on knitwear, which saw models appear on the catwalk in what looked like knitted woolly scuba hoods.

Frilled shorts and leather minidresses completed the gender-bending collection, all accessorised with ruffled leather knee-high boots. Then there was Katie Eary. Not content with getting models to wear prosthetic fangs, the designer created a collection that combined print and PVC to disastrous effect. Big splashy florals, lashings of pink, cropped trousers and even court shoes were mixed and matched to create a wardrobe straight out of most men's nightmares.

Shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong's 'drugs' confession to Oprah will not end in criminal charges but could cost him tens of millions of dollars in civil lawsuits, experts warned today. Armstrong, whose fortune is estimated to be around $100milllion, was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles last year and banned for life after the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) ruled he had been at the heart of 'the most sophisticated, professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen'. But now a string of sporting bodies are lining up to demand he pay back millions of dollars he has won in prize and bonus money over his career in the wake of his sensational 'doping' admission to be aired this week. 'At the end of the day, I would be . surprised if the damages - total amount - aren’t in the tens of millions . of dollars,' Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago lawyer who has represented . professional athletes in civil cases, told NBC News. SCROLL DOWN FOR FIRST LOOK AT THE INTERVIEW. Mesmerised: Oprah revealed this morning she was surprised and mesmerized by some of Lance Armstrong's answers during her grueling two-hour interview with the shamed cyclist, in which he finally confessed . Lawyers even warned that defamation actions by critics he viciously attacked when denying the claims are also possible. Already the organisation that runs the Tour de . France has demanded that Armstrong pay back almost $4million it . awarded him for his wins, while insurance firm SCA Promotions wants back $12million in bonus payouts it covered in 2002, 2003 and 2005. The London-based Sunday Times also is suing Armstrong to recover about $500,000 it paid him to settle a libel lawsuit. Even the . Australian government has asked Armstrong to return millions in . appearance fees paid when he raced in the Tour Down Under.

Federal authorities have closed their 20-month probe for possible criminal charges over the doping allegations after investigators unearthed no illegal practice. While taking performance-enhancing drugs is not a criminal offence, they may have been looking for evidence of trafficking, fraud and perjury, NBC News reported. But experts suggest that that investigation could be re-opened in the wake of Armstrong's explosive interview on Oprah. Wayne Lamprey, a former federal . prosecutor now in private practice in San Francisco, told NBC: 'Mr. Armstrong is very well-advised by capable lawyers and I don’t think . he would be admitting on the Oprah Winfrey show something that would . give rise to a criminal charge.' The USADA deposed 11 . former teammates and accused Armstrong of masterminding a complex and . brazen drug program that included steroids, blood boosters and a range . of other performance-enhancers. A Justice Department official told NBC News that some lawyers in the civil . division want the government to join a whistleblower lawsuit . filed in 2010, which is currently under seal. Demands: Already the organisation that runs the Tour de France has demanded back $4 million it awarded him for his wins, while an insurance firm wants back $12 million in bonus payouts it covered in 2002, 2003 and 2005 . Former . teammate Floyd Landis, who was stripped of the 2006 Tour de France . title for doping, has filed a federal whistle-blower lawsuit that . accused Armstrong of defrauding the U.S. Postal Service, which sponsored the team and paid out $30million . in fees. If successful, the suit could force Armstrong, and others, to repay that money plus $60 million in damages, 30 per cent of which would go to Landis. It comes after the World Anti-Doping Agency yesterday said that Armstrong must confess under oath to seek a reduction in his lifetime ban from sports for taking performance enhancing drugs during seven Tour de France victories. WADA says it 'read with interest media reports suggesting a television 'confession' made by Lance Armstrong' to talk show host Oprah Winfrey on Monday. Armstrong reportedly hopes to return to competition in recognised triathlon events. However, WADA says 'only when Mr Armstrong makes a full confession under oath — and tells the anti-doping authorities all he knows about doping activities — can any legal and proper process for him to seek any reopening or reconsideration of his lifetime ban commence'. Sneak preview: 'I think he answered my questions . satisfactorily. He was thoughtful and serious and had prepared himself . for this moment and at the end of it we were both pretty exhausted' The agency says athletes must pass on details of performance-enhancing drug use 'to the relevant anti-doping authorities'. The announcement came after Oprah revealed . she was surprised and mesmerised by some of Lance Armstrong's answers . during her grueling two-hour interview with the shamed cyclist, in which . he finally confessed. Speaking to CBS yesterday morning about the 'intense and emotional' interview that took place in Austin yesterday, she said: 'He did not come clean in the manner I expected, I was surprised. Myself and the . whole team were mesmerised and riveted by some of his answers. July 23, 2001: 'I've lived by the rules. You think someone with my health history would take something like that? There's no way.' July 26, 2002: 'Immediately [the doping probe] knew the evidence was clean, but they kept the case open...there's nothing there.' August 25, 2005: 'I have never doped. I can say that again but Ive said it for seven years.' 'Unfortunately, the witch hunt continues. This article is nothing short of tabloid journalism. [I have] never taken performance-enhancing drugs.' November 30, 2005: 'Having never taken performance-enhancing drugs, when I pissed in the bottle, there was no drugs in that piss.'

July 2010: 'As long as I live, I will deny it. There was absolutely no way I forced people, encouraged people, told people, helped people, facilitated. Absolutely not. One hundred percent…I mean, I can’t control what other riders do.' June 2012: 'I have never doped, and, unlike many of my accusers, I have competed as an endurance athlete for 25 years with no spike in performance, passed more than 500 drug tests and never failed one. These charges are baseless [and] motivated by spite.' 'I . think he answered my questions satisfactorily. He was thoughtful and . serious and had prepared himself for this moment and at the end of it we . were both pretty exhausted.

More than 8,000 New York City school bus drivers and matrons went on strike over job protection this morning, leaving some 152,000 students, many disabled, trying to find other ways to get to school. Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott said the strike started at 6 a.m. Wednesday. About 200 bus drivers and bus matrons were assembled on picket lines in the Queens section of the city. 'The first days will be extremely chaotic,' Walcott told 1010 WINS radio. 'It hasn't happened in New York City in over 33 years.' On strike: School bus drivers in New York City are taking industrial action today, no talks are planned . Taxi! Various methods of transport were employed by parents trying to get their children to school this morning as bus drivers went on strike. An unidentified woman, pictured, drops her children by taxi . The union did not immediately return calls and emails seeking comment. Most of the city's roughly 1.1 million public school students take public transportation or walk to school. Those who rely on the buses include 54,000 special education students and others who live far from schools or transportation. Parents have made plans to use subways, carpools and other alternatives, hitting slippery roads as sleet turned to rain around the city and temperatures were at or above freezing. The city has put its contracts with private bus companies up for bid, aiming to cut costs. The Local 1181 of the Amalgamated Transit Union says drivers could suddenly lose their jobs when contracts expire in June. School run: Alex Ndoka, left, accompanies Henry Ndoka, who usually rides school bus to his New York school. City officials have warned the strike could last for weeks but they will not negotiate with the union . The city plans to distribute transit cards to students who could take buses and subways and to reimburse parents who would have to drive or take taxis. 'We will get our children to school,' Walcott said. To do that, some parents had pieced together a patchwork of plans, such as a driving one child to one school and arranging a carpool to take a sibling to another school. The union announced Monday it would strike amid a complicated dispute. The city doesn't directly hire the bus drivers and matrons, who work for private companies that have city contracts. The workers make an average of about $35,000 a year, with a driver starting at $14 an hour and potentially making as much as $29 an hour over time, according to union President Michael Cordiello. Out of action: School buses were held in the depot this morning as bus drivers went on strike. Around 8,000 children have been affected . Negotiations: The City says it won't talk to union members as there is nothing they can do to placate their fears over putting the service out for private tender. The bus drivers want job protection which the City claims is impossible . Mayor Michael Bloomberg has said the city must seek competitive bids to save money. The union sought job protections for current drivers in the new contracts. The city said that the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, has barred it from including such provisions because of competitive bidding laws; the union said that's not so. Asked if the city is prepared to go as long as the last school bus strike in 1979 which lasted 14 weeks, Walcott said on WINS Radio, 'This will go however long it goes. We have systems in place to support our parents and students.' Deadlock: Mayor Bloomberg says City will push ahead with plans to put school bus service contract out to a new competitive tender. The Schools Chancellor says there will be talks with the union on strike over the move . Walcott, who was making the rounds of radio and television news shows Wednesday morning, told WNBC-TV there were no talks scheduled. 'We're not negotiating. They want us to do something illegal. We can't do that at all. We're always open for communication ... It's not our responsibility and job to negotiate. They work for private companies.' 'How is it illegal to provide the most experienced drivers and matrons in the school buses?' Cordiello asked Tuesday.The contracts expire June 30.","Bus drivers begin their strike today leaving thousands, including disabled children, without transport to school .

(File picture) Common infections – not life-threatening illnesses – were to blame for much of the rise, which suggests a ‘systematic failure in the NHS’ according to the study involving seven million admissions. It found a ‘persistent’ increase year-on-year of around 3 per cent among under-fives. The study says there is a ‘reluctance’ to  treat children at surgeries, driven by changes to the GP contract in 2004 which led to  90 per cent of family doctors opting out  of caring for patients during evenings  and weekends. 'Systematic failures': A reluctance to treat children at surgeries is a cause for the rise in A&E admission rates. (File photo) Study leader Peter Gill, a researcher in the department of primary care health services at Oxford University, said emergency admissions put children at risk of hospital-acquired infections, medical errors, drug reactions and emotional trauma. The study, published online in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, looked at hospital admission rates among the under-15s in England and national population estimates for the years 1999 to 2010 inclusive. The emergency admissions rate among children rose by 28 per cent from 63 per 1,000 of the population in 1999 to 81 per 1,000 in 2010. But the increase in admissions does not reflect an increase in the number of very sick children – on the contrary, the risk of serious illness is low and falling, the study says. The number of deaths of children aged one to 14 fell by 36 per cent during the study. Mr Gill said parents and doctors were more likely to ‘play safe’ when a  child is ill. Targets for A&E might also have  contributed to the rise, he suggested, with children being admitted for observation before the four-hour maximum wait  was breached. He said that and ‘the change to general practitioners’ out-of-hours care may have played an important role’. The British Medical Association said a key factor for the increase ‘is likely to be the more cautious approach being taken to the treatment of children’.","Study finds 52% increase in emergency admissions of babies since 2003 .

A four-year-old's death is being linked to this year's flu epidemic, which would make him the 21st under-18 to have died from the illness this flu season. The death of Hunter Ewert, 4, of Boardman, Ohio, comes as flu vaccine stocks are put under increasing pressure by people now rushing to . protect themselves from the illness. The Ohio Health Department is investigating whether influenza caused the death of Hunter, who was discovered dead on Saturday, it was announced today. He was found unresponsive in his parents bed after joining them on Friday night complaining of a sore throat and fever. 'The doctors at the hospital said his lungs filling up would have happened very quickly and the only way they would have been able to catch it was by doing an x-ray every hour,"" Shannon Ewert told wytv.com. 'At some point during the night, he made his way from his bedroom to ours. It appears he crawled into our bed and collapsed face down,' Mrs Ewert, who is a nurse, told the broadcaster. Victims: 20 children have been killed in the flu epidemic this year. More than 3,500 people have now been hospitalized in the epidemic since October 2012 . Sore throat: Hunter Ewert was discovered unresponsive in his parents bed on Saturday morning. Doctors are investigating whether he is a victim of the flu epidemic . She attempted to perform CPR but couldn't save her son. 'I am glad he came into our bed and did not die in his bed alone,' Ewert said. Further tests will be carried out to determine whether he died from the flu. If they are positive, he will be the 21st child fatality - one of the highest death tolls on record. The child victims of the epidemic also . include a 6-year-old girl from Maine, a 15-year Michigan school-band . star, and a six-foot-four Texas high school senior Max Schwolert, who . grew sick in Wisconsin while visiting his grandparents for the holidays. It is one of the worst pediatric death tolls since the government began keeping track of flu among children in 2004. The . youngest victim is believed to be a 2 month-old baby from Delaware. Loving: Avery Lane, 6, is one of the 20 children killed in this year's flu epidemic. She was described as 'very kind and very loving' by her grandmother . Tributes have been paid to the victims . by families, friends and school teachers shocked and saddened by how . the ferocious nature of this year's outbreak has claimed the lives of so many . young and healthy children. Avery Lane, a healthy first-grader at Benton Elementary School, Maine, was just six years old when . she died from the illness last month. She was described as a 'little angel' by . relatives on Facebook and her grandmother Pam Souzer said she was 'very . kind and very loving' Principal Suanne Giorgetti sent a letter to parents that said the school had 'experienced the unthinkable' last month. Her family have now set up a fund . supporting the Somerset Animal Shelter called 'Avery's Kitties' in her honor. Avery loved the animals and had a collection of stuffed cat . toys.

The club has advised members 'touch elbows' before and after games rather than touching hands . Catholic Churches are also reportedly taking precautions. Congregations have been told to verbally exchange words of peace rather than shaking hands . 'He was always caring and polite and always thinking about others,” Dave Polehna, Josh’s father told Michigan Live. 'Like any kid, he liked video games. He was in track (a hurdler) and did baseball. He was in the percussion . section in the marching band. He worked hard and was very proud of . that.' 'Every teacher that had him…they said he was a joy to have in class, absolute joy to be around and always made you smile.' According to The Center for Disease . Control and Prevention, many states may have seen the peak of the flu . epidemic for this year but others are yet to suffer the worst. In its latest briefing, which covers the week up until January 5, it found 24 states were reporting high levels of flu. That number was down from the 29 . states reporting a high level of outbreak over Christmas but seven . unaffected states were dragged into the epidemic for the first time. Within states, the illness is also becoming more widespread. Tragic: Tahila Johnson, six, died last week after visiting hospital with flu-like symptoms while, in Michigan, 15-year-old Joshua Polehna died two weeks ago after suffering flu-like symptoms . Tragedy: Little Avery Page was one of the victims of this year's flu epidemic. The healthy little girl from Maine has been mourned by family and friends . Loss: A Facebook page called ""Gone but Never Forgotten R.I.P Carly Christenson"" was created last week. The school basketball star had received a flu vaccine . Six more states said they were dealing . with widespread flu compared to the week ending December 27 and a . startling 1,443 extra people were hospitalized with it. The flu vaccine is the main means of preventing against flu but is only effective in about 60 per cent of cases. Dr. Margaret Hamburg, . commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration today reported . 'spot shortages' in the vaccine which they were ' monitoring'. She added they were 'working with manufacturers to increase supply' with 130million vaccines already distributed. Ohio doctors urged parents not to panic following the death of Hunter Ewert . 'When to worry really is your child is coughing, high fever, temp not dropping. They're not drinking. Not peeing is something for children. They are fluid monsters. If they're not drinking, something is wrong,' said Dr. John Cox, a pediatrician told wkbn.com. Other groups are taking radical measures to try and halt the spread of the flu. According to Yahoo Sports a Manhattan Sports Club is banning its players from high-fiving and Catholic Churches are advising against shaking hands, according to NBC. Michigan has one of the highest pediatric rates for any state in the country. There have been four child flu deaths . there this winter including that of Polehna, a 6-year-old child, a . 13-year-old and a 5-month old baby have also died. Shortage: Health officials today admitted they had been told of 'spot shortages' of the vaccine but are monitoring the situation and liasing with manufacturers . Necessary pain: Roughly 130 million doses have been distributed this season, compared to 83 million in 2008 . State health officials said yesterday that though they have had 'unusually high demand' there were still plenty of flu vaccines available. One of this year's young victims, popular athlete Carly Christenson, 14 is known to have received the shot but died January 8. The popular basketball star has been remembered by thousands in her town with two tribute sites established on Facebook. Others have accused health workers of not acting on flu cases. Earl Johnson took his daughter, Tahlia . Johnson, 6, to Dallas Regional Medical Center in Mesquite. He said they . waited for four hours and doctors told him she didn't need a flu test. She later died of the illness. Medics still urge . people to get the vaccine and seek medical assistance if concerned at . their children's symptoms. 3710 people have been hospitalized with flu since October - 46 per cent are aged 65 and over.

Suffered: Incoming Governor of the Bank of England admitted efforts to revive Britain's ailing economy have made life hard for pensioners and savers . The incoming Governor of the Bank of England yesterday admitted efforts to revive Britain’s ailing economy have made life ‘extremely difficult’ for pensioners and savers. Mark Carney, who takes up the post in July, acknowledged millions of prudent households have been hammered by record low interest rates, with the elderly among the hardest hit. But the Canadian insisted that failure to take such drastic action to prop up the economy ‘would have harmed almost everybody – young and old, savers and borrowers, rich and poor’. He spoke in his first public outing in Britain since his surprise appointment in November last year when George Osborne labelled him ‘the outstanding central banker of his generation’. Addressing MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Carney was also forced to defend his £874,000-a-year package, including an annual £250,000 housing allowance – a perk which he said made up for moving to London, one of the most expensive cities in the world. The 47-year-old banker, who will spend five years in the capital with his family, signalled a possible shift of emphasis away from controlling inflation towards promoting growth, revealing he has had ‘high-level’ talks with the Chancellor about a shake-up. The Bank has slashed rates to 0.5 per cent and pumped £375billion into the economy through quantitative easing, a policy which has been hugely controversial because it has driven down annuity rates which dictate how much a newly retired person receives from their pension. Mr Carney, the governor of the Bank of Canada, said: ‘I absolutely recognise there are consequences from QE. Pensioners in this country are in difficult circumstances. But the responsibility of the Bank is the broad economy.’ The UK economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final three months of last year – rounding off the worst four-year period outside the aftermath of war since the 1830s and leaving Britain on the brink of a  triple-dip recession. First public outing: Mr Carney addressed MPs on the Treasury Select Committee and was forced to defend his £874,000-a-year package, including an annual £250,000 housing allowance . Speaks highly: Mr Carney was appointed in November last year after George Osborne labelled him 'the outstanding central banker of his generation' Mr Carney, a former Goldman Sachs banker, called for a review of the Bank’s remit but said he favoured sticking to an inflation target of 2 per cent – at least for now. It is thought he will pursue a more flexible approach, allowing inflation to stay above target for longer in order to bolster the economy. He also warned the Bank could only do so much to revive the economy: ‘While the Bank’s actions  provide the cornerstones of British prosperity – price and financial  stability – these are necessary but not sufficient conditions for growth.’ Savers will continue to be punished by the worst interest rates in history as the Bank of England yesterday voted to keep the base rate at 0.5 per cent, where it has been for nearly four years. It is the longest period of unchanged rates since the aftermath of the Second World War. 'Extremely difficult' life: Mr Carney acknowledged millions of prudent households have been hammered by record low interest rates, with the elderly among the hardest hit . Hopes for economic recovery were boosted yesterday as figures revealed a sharp rise in factory output and exports. Manufacturing rose 1.6 per cent in December, after a 0.3 per cent slump in November, according to Office for National Statistics figures. Exports also jumped 3 per cent in December, narrowing Britain’s trade deficit by £400million to £8.9billion. Chris Williamson, of financial research group Markit, said: ‘Manufacturing and trade showed signs of renewed life in December, adding to indications that the UK economy gathered momentum.’","Mark Carney, 47, will take up the post of Governor of the BoE in July .

She has already told a court how Chris Huhne forced her to have an abortion for the sake of his career. But yesterday Vicky Pryce revealed to a trial that the disgraced former Lib Dem MP tried to make her terminate another pregnancy two years later. Mrs Pryce, 60, said she was booked in to have an abortion but now had the strength to resist her husband and refused to go at the very last moment. Loving mother: Vicky Pryce revealed that Chris Huhen tried tried to make her terminate a second pregnancy in 1992. She went on to tell Southwark Crown Court that she later gave birth to 'wonderful' son, Peter (pictured together) Trial: Vicky Pryce, left, is accused of perverting the course of justice alongside her ex-husband Chris Huhne . Giving . evidence at her trial for perverting the course of justice, she told . Southwark Crown Court that she later gave birth to a ‘wonderful’ son, . Peter. Former top Government economic adviser Pryce already had four other children, two with Huhne and two from her first marriage. Earlier in the week, she said Huhne told her to end a pregnancy in 1990 because it was ‘bad timing’ for his professional future. Yesterday, . Pryce said Huhne demanded she have another abortion in 1992, but she . said she abandoned the plan at the ‘very last minute’. She . said: ‘The same argument ensued, it was all booked and I was meant to . go that morning. I woke up and knew how I had felt about the previous . one and knew I couldn’t do it. ‘It was the experience of the previous one that actually allowed me to do that but it was only on the day itself.’ Bad timing: Mrs Pryce earlier told the court that Huhne told her to end a pregnancy in 1990 because it was ¿bad timing¿ for his professional future . Couple: Huhne and Pryce at the time of his re-election as MP for Eastleigh in 2010, months before their split . She . added: ‘I just could not bring myself to it and I knew from the . previous one how unhappy I would be. I was nonetheless pushed to the . brink.’ Pryce took the stand for a second day in her trial for taking . speeding points on behalf of her ex-husband in 2003. Huhne faces prison and his political career is over after he pleaded guilty on Monday. The story of the speeding points emerged in the Press after Huhne left Pryce for his aide and lover Carina Trimingham in 2010. Earlier . this week it emerged that son Peter, who was born in 1992, was involved . in an angry exchange of text messages with his father after the . break-up. In the emails shown to the court, Peter describes his father . as a ‘fat piece of ****’ and tells him: ‘I hate you, so **** off’. In cross-examination on the abandoned abortion, prosecutor Andrew Edis asked: ‘However, he [Huhne] loved that child didn’t he?’ Referring to Peter, Pryce replied: ‘Of course. He’s wonderful. It is difficult not to.’ Mr Edis said: ‘You got your way.’ Trapped: Huhne's BMW is pictured speeding as he returned home from Stansted Airport in 2003 . Flashy: The politician's car had a personalised number plate reading 'H11 HNE' Pryce . replied: ‘Got your way is going too far. I managed to resist it because . I would not get into a car and be taken to a place and get it done.’ Pryce . admits her involvement in taking speeding points but claims she is not . guilty under the defence of marital coercion, meaning Huhne forced her . to act. Mr Edis questioned whether she was really coerced by her husband, saying ‘very clever people sometimes do silly things’. He accused Pryce of lying over her dealings with the Press as she tried to make the story of his deception public. In . an often testy exchange, he said that far from putting her ‘family . first’, the whole ‘catastrophe’ they faced was due to her actions. Mr Edis highlighted how helping Huhne keep his licence in 2003 actually benefited them both. It . meant Huhne was more likely to win a seat as an MP and return to . Britain from his job as an MEP, which she opposed from the start. It . also meant she did not have to spend six months driving him around . during his inevitable ban. Mr . Edis said: ‘The reality is Mrs Pryce, of all the women who are . pressured by their husband you were in the best possible position to . resist and do the right thing.’ Affair: Huhne left Pryce for his aide Carina Trimingham, right; they are pictured outside court this week . Pryce replied that it was ‘terrible times’ and she had to ‘keep the show on the road’ with a husband ‘who was never there’. Pryce admitted briefing a journalist about two damaging stories after her husband left her in 2010 for Miss Trimingham. One was about how Huhne introduced Miss Trimingham to the Queen. The second involved her throwing his clothes from the house. Pryce . insisted she did not realise the speeding points story would ‘bring . down’ her husband and said she thought he would tough it out. Asked . if she wanted to ruin him, she said she could have done it ‘quite . easily’ and it is possible she said ‘worse things’ about him. She said: ‘If I really wanted to inflict fatal damage on him I could have done something very, very different.’ Pryce added: ‘You know what goes on in politics, integrity was not necessarily a very valued quality.’ The . jury was told Pryce has been given references by former head of MI6 Sir . John Scarlett and former senior civil servant Sir John Gieve. A . colleague from Good Corporation, the company Pryce set up to encourage . ethical behaviour in industry, said he had ‘no reservations’ about her . integrity. When told she . earned £110,000 while working for the Department for Trade and Industry, . Pryce replied: ‘I was actually earning a bit more than that.’ She . said a newspaper interview quoting her as wanting to be Chancellor of . the Exchequer was a joke. The case continues on Monday.

Jermain Defoe was arrested by police investigating claims two women were threatened after items went missing from the footballer's home . Jermain Defoe was arrested by police investigating alleged threats to kill two women following the disappearance of jewels and clothing worth £200,000 from his home. The footballer's belongings went missing when two of his cousins invited the women to a party at his mansion in Hertfordshire in Defoe's absence. When the 30-year-old Tottenham Hotspur player returned home to find his possession missing, he allegedly told his cousins to get them back. The women later claimed they were threatened, although not by Defoe or his two cousins. Defoe . - who earns an estimated £60,000 a week at the Premier League club - . was released without charge after being questioned by detectives. An 18-year-old is facing trial later this year after being accused of threats to kill. Tottenham did not comment on the incident. Defoe has previously won a compensation payout after being wrongly held in a police cell for five hours. The footballer was pulled over while driving his £75,000 Land Rover at 2.40am in Loughton, Essex, on July 27, 2009, because officers believed he was serving a drive ban. He was taken to Harlow police station where he was held for several hours despite telling officers the disqualification had been lifted pending appeal. Issue: Jewels and clothes went missing from Defoe's house after his two cousins invited two women into his home in his absence . Former home: The two women invited to Defoe's house in Hertfordshire, pictured, by his cousins later claimed they were threatened but not by the footballer or his relatives . But the player was only released after 9am when court officials in Chelmsford confirmed he wasn't banned from driving. Police agreed to a four-figure payout and apologised to Defoe last year after a three-year legal fight. Essex Deputy Chief Constable Derek Benson confirmed an inputting error meant Defoe’s records were wrong. His solicitor Nick Freeman said: 'This was always about principle and never about money. The damages will be donated to charity. 'This was a needless error which should not have occurred, but once it did the police should have accepted our assurances in the early hours of the morning that they had got it wrong.' Days after the wrongful arrest, Defoe also accused Essex Police of harassment when he was stopped in a black Ferrari in Chigwell as part of an operation to tackle the theft of luxury motors.

Community spirit: Gordon and Betty Fowle will be able to move back into their Cornwall home after a good Samaritan gave them £24,000 . A mystery good Samaritan has given an 88-year-old D-Day veteran and his wife £24,000 to rebuild a collapsed wall of their cottage after an insurance firm refused to pay up. Former Royal Navy serviceman Gordon Fowle and his wife Betty, both 88, were left homeless after the cold and wet weather brought down a wall of their house in Polgooth, St Austell, last month. The couple were forced to move out and stay with friends and didn't know if they could afford to get their Cornwall home fixed after insurance chiefs at Prudential refused to pay for repairs. But a mystery donor from their village has given the couple £24,000 to get the wall fixed in an incredible act of generosity so they can return to their home of 40 years. With work on the site due to begin today, the great-grandparents, who have lived at the cottage for 40 years, said they were 'absolutely delighted'. Mr Fowle, who was only a teenager when he took part in the D-Day Landings of 1944, said: 'It's tremendous - it really is. 'This man's unbelievable generosity has taken a huge, huge weight off our minds and we can't thank him enough.' Mrs Fowle said the couple couldn't thank the man enough. She added: 'It's wonderful - really wonderful that somebody would do this for us. 'We are very, very grateful to him. It's quite overwhelming really. We'd like to say a big thank-you to him.' The couple were forced to stay with friends in the village and faced an uncertain future after Prudential refused to pay for the damage at their home. Struggling: The couple couldn't afford to fix a collapsed wall at their home after insurance company Prudential refused to cover the cost . They had believed their £500-a-year home insurance policy would meet repairs, but the insurance giant said frost had caused the damage, which they were not covered for. Mr Fowle had been standing near the wall on January 26 just moments before it crumbled, narrowly missing him. Locksmith James Flynn, 43, who is married to the couple's grand-daughter, said the stranger's act of generosity was a sharp contrast to the actions of the insurance company. He said: 'His incredible act has shamed the Prudential. He has stepped forward to help Gordon and Betty on pure humanitarian grounds, which is what the insurance company should have done.'

Mr Flynn said: 'It's really touched us how the local community have really pulled out all the stops for them - they're all absolutely brilliant.' Prudential bosses insisted the damage happened over a long period of time and was down to water getting in to the wall and then expanding and contracting with the changes in temperature. They maintained that home insurance policies do not generally provide cover for damage caused by property age or maintenance-related issues.

Parents desperate to get children  as young as three into top prep schools are paying for professional coaching to drill them in interview techniques, it was reported today. The Good Schools Guide says pushy parents are going to extreme lengths to ensure their children impress staff during the admissions process. In the latest edition, it said more and more fee-paying schools are using interviews to  ask children academic questions, talk around their favourite subject, discuss hobbies or even get them to sing or dance. The Good Schools Guide says parents are going to extreme lengths to get their children into the top schools . But the guide also told how one parent videoed his daughter to give her positive feedback on her strengths and weaknesses while others relied on family friends to conduct mock interviews as preparation. Some parents even attempted to coach three-year-olds in preparation for entry to pre-prep schools at the age of four, the Daily Telegraph reported today. Teachers at the most oversubscribed schools will often assess young children's speaking and listening skills one-to-one or in small groups and observe how well they interact with peers. Some of the best schools receive hundreds of applications and interview as many as five children for every place, it emerged. The £13,000-a-year North London Collegiate junior school in Edgware is one of the schools that hold interviews for children . But Janette Wallis, the guide's senior editor, said some overly-honest infants have let slip about their preparation, telling interviewers, 'My parents told me you were going to ask that'. 'We see parents zealously coaching children as young as three for school admission interviews,' she said. It doesn't do any good and it's a big black mark if the child blurts it out to the interviewer.' 'School heads want to see the ‘natural child', not an over-tutored zombie.' Jo Newman, the head of the £13,000-a-year North London Collegiate junior school in Edgware, told the guide: 'I always tell parents if they're paying to coach three-year-olds, they might as well burn £20 notes. The only useful preparation is to talk to them, play with them and read them stories.'","The Good Schools Guide says parents are going to extreme lengths .

Bravely speaking out: Lydia Cuomo, 26, has revealed her identity to campaign for a change in New York rape law . A schoolteacher who was sexually assaulted in broad daylight by a gun-wielding NYPD officer has broken her silence after a hung jury failed to convict him of rape. Lydia Cuomo, 26, was attacked by Michael Pena  in August 2011 as she walked to school in the Bronx, New York. Pena pleaded guilty and was convicted in March last year of the predatory sexual assault of the young woman - but not of her rape. New York state defines rape as only vaginal penetration and not forced oral and anal sex. Miss Cuomo then had to watch three months later in June 2012 as Pena again admitted to raping her in order to take a plea deal and avoid a retrial. He was given another ten years for the deal on top of his 75-years to life sentence for sexual assault. The schoolteacher has now bravely chosen to reveal her identity in order to highlight how rape legislation is failing victims of brutal assaults. Miss Cuomo told the New York Daily News this week: 'I feel like essentially I had a silver platter of a rape . case. I had witnesses, I had DNA, I had my own testimony, I had two . cops. 'I had them saying, ''We admit he . sexually assaulted you,'' and I didn’t get the verdict I needed the . first time, and that just highlights to me the problem in the system.' She added that she was stunned to find that the legal system would not look upon what had happened to her as a rape. Miss Cuomo had been on her way to work for the first day of her 'dream job' teaching second-graders at a Bronx charter school when she was abducted and assaulted at gunpoint in an . alley by Pena, a cop of three years, who screamed to her that he was going to 'blow your . f****** face off'. Sexual predator: Michael Pena, pictured in court in 2011, was given 75 years to life in prison for brutally sexually assaulting the schoolteacher walking to her first day of work in the Bronx . Despite the jury convicting Pena of . oral and anal sodomy, two jurors would not find him guilty of two counts . of rape or two counts of predatory sexual assault. This came after a doctor gave evidence in court . that the victim was raped and semen was found on her . underwear. The jurors' reasoning was if Miss Cuomo couldn't recall the color of a car directly . opposite the alley where she was attacked, then how could she be sure . she was penetrated. Miss Cuomo has this week joined forces . with Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas (D-Queens) who last year introduced a . bill that would make forced oral and anal sex part of New York's rape . statutes. 'Lydia and others who have endured such . trauma deserve justice... to . ensure that rape is always called by its name.' Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas . The move would bring New York rape legislation in line with states like Tennessee and South Dakota. Miss Cuomo will hold a news conference on Tuesday in Albany surrounded by her family and share her story with legislators as the bill is reintroduced. Assembly member Simotas said in a statement to MailOnline today: 'I applaud Lydia Cuomo for speaking out and lending her support for the Rape is Rape bill. Her courage in coming forward to shed light on this important issue is truly inspiring. 'Lydia’s story illustrates the heart of what we are trying to accomplish by passing this legislation - it is truly about the victims; more than anything, the law must be responsive to them. 'Lydia and others who have endured such trauma deserve justice, and it is the goal of this common-sense bill to ensure that rape is always called by its name.' Haunting: The alleyway in which Miss Cuomo was brutally attacked by an NYPD cop as she made her way to school in broad daylight . Legal battle: Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas (D-Queens) ast year introduced a bill that would make forced oral and anal sex part of New York's rape statutes . At the time of Pena's sentencing last year, Miss Cuomo told the court: 'My life has been shattered - my sense of security, my sense of safety, any and all independence. 'He used his weapon and basically destructed my life.' However Miss Cuomo, who is originally from New Hampshire, has refused to let the attack take away what she has worked so hard for. She has returned to her dream job of teaching elementary schoolchildren in the Bronx.","Lydia Cuomo, 26, has revealed her identity to support a change in NY state law's definition of rape .

Fashion chain Republic is expected to become the latest high street store to call in administrators today - putting 1,000 jobs at risk. The group, which has 120 stores across the UK is reported to have already lined up accounting firm Ernst & Young to handle the administration. Republic would be the fourth big name retailer to have hit serious financial trouble already this year, with thousands of jobs lost as music giant HMV, camera equipment specialist Jessops and DVD and games rental group Blockbuster all called in administrators last month. Casualty: Fashion chain Republic is expected to call in administrators . Republic, owed by private equity firm TPG, has a target market of 16 to 25 year olds. It sells a range of brands including Bench, American Apparel and Henleys. It is understood that the chain has suffered in recent months thanks partly to its large presence in the north of England, in areas that have been hit particularly badly by the recession. The company's chairman, Andy Bond, is said to have stood down last week. Mr Bond, a former Asda boss, had been with the chain for less than two years. The chain was snapped up by TPG for £300million in June 2010 from previous majority shareholders Change Capital who acquired the group for £105million in 2005. Under pressure: A Republic store in Westfield shopping centre in Stratford City, East London . Private equity house TPG previously part owned Debenhams, but its purchase of Republic represented its first foray into European retail for several years. It was reported in October 2011 that the firm were looking to inject funds into the Republic group in a bid to acquire new stores and improve the chain's online presence. Former TK Maxx boss Paul Sweetenham was recently hired as chief executive. The store was founded in 1986 in Leeds, West Yorkshire, as Best Company, a store specialising in denim and mens' jeans. But its owners gradually transformed it into a staple of high street fashion for trendy teenagers and early twenty-somethings. The Republic brand was launched in 1998 and by 2011 the business was turning over £27.3million profit pre-tax. It had stepped up its expansion in 2005 and was said to be opening between five and ten stores a year. Both Ernst & Young and Republic declined to comment yesterday. In trouble: DVD and game rental chain Blockbuster was one of three high street casualties to call in administrators last month . Struggling: HMV came under fire last month after refusing to accept customers' gift vouchers bought as late as a day before the chain entered administration . Republic's expected collapse into administration makes it the latest in a long line of high-profile high street firms to fail - the most visible legacy of the financial crisis and subsequent double-dip recession. Going: Electrical giant Comet closed its doors for the last time shortly before Christmas . December 2008: MFI, the furniture retailer, was one of the first major firms to go out of business at the start of the downturn, as retail sales began to fall following a sharp rise in unemploymentWoolworths . January 2009: Woolworths shuttered its 800 stores, bringing home to many the scale of the UK's economic collapse as the country entered recession for the first time . February 2009: Zavvi stopped trading around Christmas - and refused to honour its gift cards, leading to widespread customer anger . December 2009: Borders was another entertainment behemoth to go under as sale of CDs and DVDs were squeezed by digital downloads and online retailers . October 2012: JJB Sports closed all but 20 of its stores, which were taken over and re-branded by Sports Direct - leading to the death of the JJB brand and 550 employees losing their jobs . Casualty: Jessops called in administrators in January and was closed . December 2012: Comet shut down just before Christmas, leaving nearly 7,000 staff out of work and forcing the taxpayer to pick up a £50million tab related to its bankruptcy, which was blamed on soaring energy prices and a reduction in the number of home buyers .

Phil Schiller's comments to the Shanghai Evening News follow reports this week from The Wall Street . Journal and Bloomberg that plans for a cheaper iPhone were in development. Both regular organisations independently confirmed with their sources that Apple was working on a cheaper iPhone built from lower quality parts - in the past both have reported genuine leaks about forthcoming Apple products. Apple rarely addresses rumours about upcoming products, which often invite intense speculation. 'Every product that Apple creates, we consider using only the best technology available,' said Mr Schiller who is Apple’s second most powerful executive, after chief executive Tim Cook. 'This includes the production pipeline, the Retina display, the unibody design, to provide the best product to the market.' The newspaper reported that Mr Schiller spoke about the trend of smartphones in the region saying 'At . first, non-smartphones were popular in the Chinese market, now cheap . smartphones are more popular and non-smartphones are out.'

Donald Trump is suing Bill Maher after the comedian offered to pay out if the celebrity real estate mogul could prove his father was a homosapien and not an ape. In January, Mr Maher appeared on Jay Leno's show and announced that he would donate $5 million to charity if Mr Trump provided evidence that he was not the 'spawn of his mother having sex with orangutan.' Trump produced his birth certificate to show both his parents were indeed human and now he is taking the comedian to court to force Maher to pay up. Scroll Down for Video . Bring it: Bill Maher (left) joked on the 'Tonight Show' in January that he would pay $5 million to charity if Donald Trump released his birth certificate . Demands: Donald Trump has called on Bill Maher to quickly pay up on the $5 million he offered as a challenge on Jay Leno's show, after Maher claimed he was the child of an orangutan (right) 'I . don’t know whether I will win or lose the Bill Maher lawsuit but had an . obligation to sue for charity,' Mr Trump said in a statement on Monday. 'He promised me $5 million for . charity if I provided certain information. Well, I provided the . information. He didn’t pay. So today I sue Bill Maher for $5 million for . charity,' he said, calling into 'Fox and Friends.' 'I don't think he was joking. He said . it with venom. That was venom. That wasn't a joke. In fact, he was . nervous when he said it; it was a pathetic delivery. But he said, ""I . will give,"" and said, ""I will accept,""' he added. Maher made his bet on 'The Tonight Show . with Jay Leno' on January 8, to mock Trump's maligned YouTube . announcement last October in which Trump said he would donate $5 . million of his own money to charity if President Obama would release his . college records. Evidence: Lawyers for Donald Trump were swift to issue the property billionaire's birth certificate - releasing it the day after Maher's challenge . Appearing on the NBC late night show, Mr Maher joked about Trump, the host of NBC's Celebrity Apprentice. He suggested the multimillion dollar prize could be directed to the charity of Trump's choice, naming the 'Hair Club for Men' or 'The . Institute for Incorrigible Douchebaggery' as potential recipients. Comparing . Trump to an orangutan, Maher was drawing a comparison between the . famously sandy hair of the New York billionaire and the great ape that . roams the jungles of South East Asia. In . addition to calling Trump the son of an orangutan, Maher labeled Trump a . 'liar' and a 'racist' and a 'douche bag' as he reacted to some . derogatory tweets that Trump had posted online about him. The comedian accused Trump of not even writing the tweets himself, but palming them off as a job to a 'syphilitic monkey.' Monkey claim: Speaking to Leno in January, Maher openly mocked Trump's failed attempt in October (right) to persuade President Obama to release his college and passport records . But Trump accepted the challenge. Shortly thereafter, Scott S. Balber, . a lawyer for Trump, 66, sent the host of HBO's Real Time with Bill . Maher a letter with the property magnate's birth certificate attached . and asked the comedian, who is estimated to be worth $40 million, to come . up with the cash and honor his ultimatum. The letter came with a birth . certificate attached 'demonstrating that he is the son of Fred Trump, . not an orangutan. Please remit the $5 million to Mr Trump immediately.' Trump . indicated he wants to give $1 million each to charities for the . Hurricane Sandy Victims, The Police Athletic League, The American Cancer . Society, The March of Dimes and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Proof: Mr Obama released his birth certificate in April of 2012, to show he was indeed born in the U.s. Trump had brought publicity to the . 'birther' movement, that openly questioned the legitimacy of Mr Obama's . American citizenship, during the 2012 presidential election. He called for the president to release his birth certificate, which Mr Obama did in April 2012. Even after viewing the birth certificate, showing the president was indeed born in the U.S. - a requirement detailed in Section 1 of Article Two of the United States Constitution - Trump still expressed his doubt. So he announced in October that he . was calling on Mr Obama to release his college records, in addition to . his passport information. Members of the birther movement had . suggested that Obama had attended California's Occidental College as a foreign . exchange student, under the name Barry Soetoro. Others have claimed that his Harvard . Law School degree was funded by a foreign sponsor, Saudi adviser Khalid . Al-Mansour, and not financed by student loans, as Mr Obama has oft . stated. LOL: Following Donald Trump's offer to pay $5 million to a charity of his choice, President Obama laughed off any suggestion that he reveal his college or passport records . 'Barack Obama . is the least transparent president in the history of this country,' said . Trump in his YouTube video released in October. 'I'm very honored to have gotten him to release his long-form birth certificate or whatever it may be.' 'If . Barack Obama opens up and gives his college records and application and . if he gives his passport applications and records, I will give to a . charity of his choice - inner-city children in Chicago, American Cancer . Society, AIDS research, anything he wants - a check immediately for $5 . million.' The president did not respond to Trump's challenge.

A major cyber-attack that has been stealing information from high level government computers around the world since 2007 has been discovered. Kaspersky Labs, which made the discovery, said in addition to diplomatic and governmental agencies of various countries . across the world, Red October also targeted research institutions, . energy and nuclear groups, and trade and aerospace targets. The firm even said the malware was used to infiltrate smartphones of government workers to electronically steal information. The full extent of the Red October operation is revealed in this infographic, showing how it has hit countries across the globe . The main objective of the attackers was . to gather sensitive documents from the compromised organisations. This included geopolitical intelligence, credentials to access classified . computer systems, and data from personal mobile devices and network . equipment. Overall, Kaspersky said over 7 terabytes, or 7,000GB data has been stolen. The primary focus of the campaign was targeting countries in eastern Europe. 'Former USSR Republics and countries in Central Asia were targeted, although victims can be found everywhere, including Western Europe and North America', said Kaspersky Lab, an antivirus software firm which made the discovery. 'The main objective of the attackers was . to gather sensitive documents from the compromised organisations, which . included geopolitical intelligence, credentials to access classified . computer systems, and data from personal mobile devices and network . equipment,' Red . October, which has been active since at least 2007, appears to collect . files encrypted with software used by several entities from the European . Union to Nato. Kaspersky said Red October also infected smartphones, including iPhones, Windows Mobile and Nokia handsets. It . is believed to be still operating, although since the research was . published, the attackers are believed to have started dismantling the . system to protect their identities. 'The project started in October 2012, we received a suspicious executable from a partner,' Vitaly Kamluk, Chief Malware Expert at Kaspersky Lab told MailOnline. 'We checked and began to understand what we had was quite massive - we found 1,000 different files in a few weeks, each of them a personalised email.' Mr Kamluk said the attacks were highly customised. 'There are a very limited number of machines, around 1,000 around the world, but every target is carefully selected.' 'We extracted language used and found Broken English was used, with Russian words thrown in, such as Proga, commonly used among Russian programmers. 'However, we are not pointing fingers at Russia - just that Russian language has been spotted. 'It could be any organisation or country behind this, it could be nation states or a private business or criminal group. One of the fake emails used to infect computers . Red October is a malware attack. Initially the malicious code was delivered via e-mail . as attachments (Microsoft Excel, Word and, probably PDF documents) which . were rigged with exploit code for known security vulnerabilities in the various applications. Intended targets received personalised correspondence based on gathered intelligence on individual people (an example is on the right). These attacks comprised of two major stages: . Initial infection: Right after the victim opens the malicious document on a vulnerable system, the embedded malicious code initiates the setup of the main Red October software on the machine. This handles further communication with the master servers run by the hackers, and can survive the computer being restarted. Spying: Next, the system receives a number of additional spy modules from the hacker's server, including modules to handle infection of smartphones - the team said iPhones, Windows phones and Nokia handsets were seen on the network. The specific modules are customised for each mobile depending on the infomration the hackers wanted. The main purpose of the spying modules is to steal information. All gathered information is packed, encrypted and only then transferred to the Red October command servers. Other modules were designed to target files encrypted using a system known as Cryptofiler - an encryption standard that used to be in widespread use by intelligence agencies but is now less common . The campaign, identified as 'Rocra', short for 'Red October', is currently still active with data being sent to multiple command-and-control servers, through a configuration which rivals in complexity the infrastructure of the Flame malware. Kaspersky's research indicated there were 55,000 connection targets within 250 different IP addresses. Most infection connections were found coming from Switzerland, followed by Kazakhstan and Greece. 'There is senstitive geopolitical information being stolen, which is very valuable,' said Mr Kamluk. Kaspersky estimate there were 20-30 developers working full time on this, and all were 'very experienced programmers'. 'Over the course of the last five years, we believe several terabytes of data was stolen - it's massive. 'Since we published the report, we have seen some of the servers are no longer responding.' The firm is now working with law enforcement agencies to shut down the remaining servers. Red October, which is named after the . Russian submarine featured in the Tom Clancy novel The Hunt For Red . October, also has what Kaspersky Lab called a unique 'resurrection' module that hid in Adobe Reader and Microsoft Office programmes that . allowed the attackers to regain access if the virus was discovered and . removed.","Researchers say the cyber attack has been in operation since 2007 - and is still running .

Heath Secretary Jeremy Hunt addressing the House of Commons where he announced that that elderly care bills are to be capped at £75,000 . More than 120,000 pensioners will miss out on state assistance with their long-term care every year thanks to the Government’s decision to ignore the findings of an independent commission, a think-tank said yesterday. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt confirmed he will set a cap of £75,000 on the amount people have to contribute to their personal care needs, with the State paying the rest. But this is far higher than the £35,000 cap recommended two years ago by a commission headed by economist Andrew Dilnot, who yesterday expressed ‘regret’ the cap had been set so high. Think-tank Demos said the £75,000 cap would help no more than one in six pensioners over their lifetime, while a £35,000 cap would have helped one in three. The higher cap means more than 120,000 pensioners will miss out on state help each year. Claudia Wood, deputy director of Demos, said: ‘For the Coalition to consider putting the cap at £75,000 is unambitious, miserly, and will do little to solve one of the most vital social problems facing our generation. ‘A cap of £75,000 means that the majority of people will still be paying just as much on their social care as they would have before the cap.’ Mr Dilnot told the BBC’s Today Programme that it was a shame the cap had been set so high, but insisted it would mean that pensioners no longer had to be ‘terrified’ of the consequences of needing care. ‘We said it should be between £25,000 and £50,000 in 2010/11 prices,’ he said. ‘The cap that is being proposed is £75,000, we think in 2017 prices.

Michelle Mitchell from charity Age UK said: ‘The Government has taken a brave step towards bringing older people and their families peace of mind in contemplating future care costs. While the £75,000 level will temper rather than dispel anxiety for most around care costs, it is an important principle that no-one should be left to face spiralling care needs alone.’ Mr Hunt told MPs that the cap would protect families from the ‘limitless and often ruinous cost’ of care.

A  German tourist found the bag from the plane on the small island country Curacao in the southern Caribbean Sea on January 10. Missing: The private plane carrying fashion boss Vittorio Missoni, his wife, two friends, and two pilots disappeared on January 4 off the coast of Venezuela . ‘They are not drawing any conclusion. This is simply another piece of an already complex puzzle,’ U.S. Missoni spokeswoman Angela Mariani told Women's Wear Daily. Mariani said the bag belonged to an Italian tourist whose plane had taken off around the same time as the Missoni plane, which was believed to be heading south from Los Roques, an archipelago and resort, south to Caracas. Because there was no room on the tourist's plane for him to put his bag, it was stowed away on the Missoni plane. ‘The Missoni family is aware of this news. However, no conclusions can be drawn from this information. The search is continuing in full force,’ the family said in an official statement. Where is Missoni? Vittorio Missoni's whereabouts remain unknown. Angela Missoni, center, and Margherita Missoni, right, were not on the plane . Inside the bag was kite-surfing gear, which belonged to Giorgio Neri, who was heading to Los Roques on a flight that took off right after the Missoni plane departed. Neri reportedly asked one of the passengers on the fashion mogul's plane to carry his bag because there was not enough space on his own plane. Venezuelan officials have been searched the waters around Curacao, and say they will continue their effort to uncover clues.

The debate over Scotland's future within the UK entered a new phase today, with the publication of two major reports about the impact of independence. Economic experts at the Fiscal Commission Working Group - set up by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond - argued that keeping the pound in the event of a yes vote in 2014 would be both 'sensible' and an attractive choice for the rest of the UK. The group was established to provide advice on the economic challenges and opportunities the country would face after independence. Its first report, published by the . Scottish Government, stated: 'On day one of independence, the members of . the Working Group agree that retaining sterling would be a sensible . currency choice that would be attractive both to Scotland and the UK.' Economic experts at the Fiscal Commission Working Group argued that keeping the pound in the event of a yes vote in 2014 would be an attractive choice for the rest of the UK. Above, David Cameron and Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, sign a referendum agreement during a meeting in Edinburgh last October . But Crawford Beveridge, the chair of the Fiscal Commission, said more talks were needed, as 'nobody has agreed to anything yet'. Meanwhile, a report by legal experts at Westminster - made public at the same time as FCWG's - warned Scotland would not continue to hold the same rights and powers in the event of independence. The UK Government published work by James Crawford, Whewell Professor of International Law at the University of Cambridge, and Alan Boyle, Professor of Public International Law at the University of Edinburgh. They argued the most likely outcome of a vote for independence would be the rest of the UK would retain its current international status, while a new state of Scotland would also be created. The Scottish Government's claim that Scotland would remain a member of existing international organisations such as the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and, crucially, the European Union 'can be dismissed as, at best, inconclusive', according to the expert analysis. Scottish Secretary Michael Moore also said that, while an independent Scotland would not inherit the UK's existing rights under international treaties, it would inherit a share of the UK national debt. 'We would need to have an equitable distribution of the liabilities,' the UK Government minister stated. FCWG was established by Alex Salmond (above) to provide advice on the economic challenges and opportunities the country would face after independence . Mr Moore stressed: 'Personally, I think the best deal for Scotland is that we stay in the UK, and therefore I will be arguing very strongly for that in the next 18 months.' Scottish Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon declared the UK Government's position was 'hugely arrogant'. She added: 'A legal opinion is just that - there are opinions from other legal experts that say the opposite that Scotland would be a co-equal successor state. International law is not settled - the reality is these matters would be settled by negotiations.' In its report the FCWG - which includes Nobel prize-winning economists Professor Joseph Stiglitz and Professor Sir James Mirrlees - concluded independence would 'provide Scotland with the opportunity to capture and deliver faster sustainable economic growth'. Mr Beveridge also insisted: 'Scotland has the clear potential to be a successful independent nation.' Scottish Labour deputy leader Anas Sarwar welcomed 'this new phase in the debate about Scotland's future as we move from assertion and spin to evidence and fact'. He added: 'The analysis produced by the UK Government highlights the strong ties that bind Scotland to the United Kingdom and the positive ways in which we work together in the interests of all the people of these islands. It makes it clear that severing these links and going it alone would be a bad deal for Scotland. 'The publication of both these reports brings a real focus to the stark choice that face the people of Scotland.' Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said the UK Government report 'shatters the myth peddled by Alex Salmond that independence would be a smooth process without any major upheaval for the people of Scotland'. She claimed: 'The onus is now on the SNP and others wanting to take Scotland out of the UK to set out the evidence and facts to support their position.' Meanwhile Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the export economists 'couldn't make the Nationalists sums add up'. He hit out: 'Between John Swinney's promise that there would be no increases in personal tax and the SNP's suggestion that they will spend billions of pounds more on public services, it doesn't take a Nobel prize winning economist to note there is a substantial black hole in the SNP's independence economic plans.'","Report by Fiscal Commission Working Group, set up by Scottish First Minister .

The narrator continues: 'Mr. Obama demands the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, but he’s just another elitist hypocrite when it comes to a fair share of security. 'Protection for their kids - and gun-free zones for ours.' The White House condemned the message as 'repugnant and cowardly.'

'But to go so far as to . make the safety of the president's children the subject of an attack ad . is repugnant and cowardly.' President Obama is set to announce his plans for curbing gun control violence on Wednesday with an event at the White House alongside Biden and a number of children who wrote him letters in the aftermath of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn.

The ad asks, 'Are the president's kids more important than yours?' Within a week after the shooting, the NRA held a press conference calling for armed guards in schools and improvement in the nation's mental health system. President Obama addressed the call for armed guards on NBC's 'Meet the Press' last month. 'I am skeptical that the only answer is putting more guns in schools, and I think the vast majority of the American people are skeptical that that somehow is going to solve our problem,' Obama said. 'And, look, here's the bottom line. We're not going to get this done unless the American people decide it's important.' More than half of Americans in the latest Washington Post-ABC poll said they would support adding armed guards at schools, but fewer people - roughly four in 10 respondents - said armed guards would do more to curb violence on campuses than stricter gun laws.

The news of his death quickly spread across the Internet where his videos had grown in popularity. His YouTube channel, FPSRussia, became the site’s ninth largest, with nearly 3.5 million subscribers and more than 500 million views as of January 2013. The online channel features dozens of videos of Mr Ratliff’s friend Kyle Myers acting zany as he fires rifles, machine guns and rocket launchers, rides choppers and tanks and blows things up. Familiar foe? 'For him not to pull out that gun and try to defend himself, he had to feel comfortable around somebody,' his brother Kelly Ratliff said. 'Either that or he was ambushed' Quiet shooter: Neighbors in Carnesville said the Kentucky-bred gun enthusiast kept to himself . Following Mr Ratliff’s unexpected death, fans on Facebook and Twitter said they were surprised that such a well-armed expert had not been able to defend himself. The online video producer had recently moved from Kentucky to Carnesville, a city of 540 people, where he opened his business, FPS Industries, which made and repaired firearms. He was licensed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, authorities said. Mr Ratliff was a vocal advocate for all Americans having access to firearms, including assault weaponry. Neighbors in Carnesville said the Kentucky-bred gun enthusiast kept to himself. Prior to his death, a local sheriff said he was called to his property only once, after neighbors reportedly heard gunfire.

Describing Vicky Pryce as a ‘quivering jelly’ bullied into taking speeding points for her Cabinet minister husband Chris Huhne was ‘to stop living in the real world’, it was claimed yesterday. She was in fact a ‘powerful, intelligent woman’ and her claims that she was coerced by Huhne into perverting the course of justice were ‘bare-faced lies’, Southwark Crown Court heard. As her trial drew to its close, . prosecutor Andrew Edis QC accused the economist of being a ‘manipulative . and deceitful’ woman who conjured up a ‘stage-managed performance’ for . the court. 'Utterly humiliated': Vicky Pryce, the former wife of ex-MP Chris Huhne arrived at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday, where the court heard details of Huhne's affair . By contrast, Pryce’s defence counsel . Julian Knowles QC presented her as a loyal wife who had been humiliated . by her husband’s affair with his assistant, Carina Trimingham, and then . effectively given no choice but to accept his speeding points. He said Huhne used the lesbian public . profile of his assistant – who had previously been in a civil . partnership with a woman – to ‘allay the suspicions’ of his wife that . she was his mistress, it was claimed yesterday. Jurors were told Pryce . was left ‘utterly humiliated’ when the Lib Dem MP left her for his PR . adviser and manager of his campaign to lead his party, . Former Energy Secretary Chris Huhne, right, allegedly used his the lesbian past of his mistress Carina Trimingham, left, to lull his wife into a false sense of security about their relationship . Julian Knowles, QC, defending Pryce, . said the affair attracted ‘salacious’ attention and urged jurors to . consider how they would feel if their marriage was ‘put under the . microscope’ and ‘laughed at’. Pryce, 60, admits accepting Huhne’s . speeding points in 2003 but pleads not guilty to perverting the course . of justice on the grounds of marital coercion – meaning that her husband . left her with ‘no real choice’ but to commit the crime. Summing up the case against her, . however, Mr Edis said: ‘You are not talking about a woman who is under . the thumb of anybody. You are talking about someone who has had a . brilliant career because throughout she has made good decisions. ‘To describe such a person as being deprived of real choice is to stop living in the real world.’ Disgraced Lib Dem Chris Huhne, with his new partner Carina Trimingham, faced the media outside Southwark Crown Court this month . Career in tatters: Philandering ex-MP Chris Huhne leaving Southwark Crown Court over allegations that he coerced his ex-wife into taking his penalty points on her driving licence . She claims Huhne bullied her into . action because it was crucial to him winning his party’s nomination for . the relatively safe Lib Dem seat of Eastleigh. Mr Edis told the jury of eight women . and four men: ‘In a sense she is trying to pervert the course of justice . again, but this time by fooling you.’ He added: ‘These are bare-faced lies . designed to give a false impression about her. She is not a vulnerable, . weak person, she is very clever.’ Mr Edis said she was driven by revenge . after Huhne left her for Miss Trimingham. He said she had supported him . in his bid to become an MP and through two attempts to claim leadership . of his party. He added: ‘If what has happened to him . had not happened he would probably be deputy prime minister now.’ The . court was told Pryce wanted to strike at Huhne ‘from a very safe . distance’ by planting the stories of his deception in the newspapers . without identifying herself. But when that failed she turned to . ‘Plan B’, which was to claim she was coerced into helping him and . therefore not guilty of a crime. The court heard that swapping the speeding points was a ‘useful family arrangement’ and benefited both Huhne and Pryce. Huhne was working as an MEP and was . often away from home and Pryce wanted him to win a seat in Parliament. She was struggling to juggle her family and work roles and if he lost . his licence she would have to ‘chauffeur’ him around. Mr Edis accused Pryce of making up her . claim that Huhne forced her to sign the speeding summons by confronting . her with a pen in his hand. He said: ‘Do you think there is any . prospect of this woman having been reduced to such a quivering jelly . when she sent the form – that she had no real choice?’ Mr Knowles said that if the jury considered the evidence properly they would find her ‘obviously not guilty’. He said she was put in an ‘impossible . situation’ by her husband and had ‘no realistic choice’ but to sign the . form and take the points. The trial continues.

A plane enthusiast restored the cockpit of a Cold War fighter jet and proudly parked it on his driveway. Neil McCarthy, 37, renovated the nose of the battered Vampire T11 jet for display in front of his family home in Seaton Burn, North Tyneside. He says his wife Amanda and children Ryan, two,  and Nathan, 18 months, have now grown 'attached' to the piece of history sitting in their driveway. Scroll down for video . Handyman: Neil McCarthy in his driveway with the Vampire T11 jet cockpit that he has restored to its former glory . Walking on air: Mr McCarthy says his wife Amanda and sons Ryan, two, and Nathan, 18 months, have become attached to the aircraft . The Vampire was designed in 1941, but never saw service in World War II because it was still being developed. It was the first single jet engine fighter produced in the UK and some 3,200 were made. Mr McCarthy bought the wrecked cockpit for £1,500 at an auction at RAF Millom Aviation and Military Museum in Cumbria. His plan was met with scepticism from his friends, family and neighbours - but the impressive restoration has made his driveway a popular attraction. Magnificent machine: A De Havilland Vampire T11 from the UK Vampire Preservation Group soars through the sky . 'It's . just a complete transformation,' said Mr McCarthy, an electronics engineer at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary hospital. 'I've got loads of compliments and because we live right next to the A1 you can see people looking down on it. The Vampire T11 was the first single jet engine fighter produced in the UK. It was designed in 1941 and the first prototype was taken on its maiden flight by Geoffrey de Havilland on September 20, 1943, but its on-going development meant it did not see active service in WW2. The first production Mk 1 Vampire first flew in April 1945. It was small and light because of the low power of early jet engines - its 'Goblin' engine giving just 2100lbs of thrust. Around 3,200 Vampires were made and the T11, a two seat side-by-side trainer version, was the final version produced. 'The neighbours love it - the ones next . door have have been showing a lot of interest, saying, ""wow, what a . difference"" and that they didn't think it would happen. 'I've become best buddies with a guy across the road because of it. It's strange but I think it has made everyone a lot closer.' The cockpit was used as a gateway display at the museum in Scotland before it was moved to Millom museum 14 years ago. Mr McCarthy, who already owned a Jet Provost Group, said: 'There was a lot more involved than I first thought. 'Luckily a firm called North Eastern Composites offered to do all the donkey work. 'That was a great help so a big thank you is needed for them.' He took the cockpit to Cleethorpes Airshow, where it was a huge hit. 'The response was unbelievable,' he said. 'There were people in and out all day long.' He now intends to add to his collection of . aircraft with a full-size mock-up of a Spitfire . cockpit, which will be made into a flight simulator. But with his driveway now full, he is running out of places to put the simulator, and is appealing to anyone with available space in the area to . come forward.

First time buyers are now forced to save for an average of eight years before they can build a deposit large enough to get on the property ladder, a new survey has revealed. The latest figures show aspiring home owners now wait eight times longer to purchase their first home than those in the 1990s who only needed one year on average to save a deposit. This has led to 60 per cent of Britons now asking their parents for financial help so they can get a mortgage, the research by Barclays found. The saving trend: First time buyers in 1995 needed to save for just one year for a deposit. The figure peaked in 2009 at 10 years and now stands at eight years . And in London, first time buyers wait even longer to get on the property ladder, with most having to save for ten years before they have a deposit large enough to get a mortgage. This compares to just 11 months for the average Londoner in 1995. After London, the buyers with the second longest wait to get on the property ladder are in the South West with an average nine years and 11 months of saving. Residents in the West Midlands are third on the list, with the average first time buyer saving for nine years and 10 months. Those in the North West and Wales have the lowest average saving period of four years and 11 months. Analysts believe the lengthy wait is often the result of miscalculated budgeting as most first-time buyers underestimate how much they have to save, especially in London. A long wait: The average first time buyer now has to save for eight years before they have a deposit large enough to get on the property ladder . The average deposit required to buy a home is now 20 per cent of the property price compared with five per cent in 1995, setting savers back eight years, whereas most first-time buyers wrongly think a 16 per cent deposit is required which would take them just over six years to save. This means the average first-time buyer in London underestimates how much they need to save by £22,272, believing they need seven years to raise £47,728, when in fact they will need nearly 11 years to raise £70,000. In contrast, the average househunter in the North West and the North East overestimates the amount they need to save by £2,000. Although 60 per cent of Britons need help getting on the ladder, the report says only 30 per cent will get family support, of which two in five see this as a gift that they will not pay back. The figures are more optimistic than during the 2009 crash when househunters faced a 10-year average wait, with the lowest wait in the North West at six years, five months and the highest in the West Midlands lasting up to 13 years and two months.

Fans angered by the increasingly racy storylines in The Archers say their views are being censored by the BBC. From next week, critics of the Radio 4 soap will be prevented from posting their views online when the show’s messageboard is shut down. BBC bosses claim not enough people are using it, but fans have accused them of trying to censor their comments. Critics of The Archers, who celebrate the 50th anniversary in 2001, pictured, say that the BBC is censoring their views . Heather Bell, who is pictured second on the right with the staff of the show in 1971, was the subject of criticism. The actress returned to the role of Clarrie Grundy, which she hasn't played since 1979 . One angry listener said the BBC could not take‘constructive criticism’ while another said they were ‘insulting their most loyal customers’. The online forum currently has 10,000 users and attracts posts from listeners all over the UK. But the comments posted have become increasingly critical as fans complained about ‘sexed-up’ storylines. One compared the cost of the messageboard with one of BBC1’s Saturday night shows, saying: ‘£22million on The Voice but they can’t keep our little community going.’ Others vented their anger on Twitter. One wrote: ‘BBC is closing down the Archers Message Board. Terribly sad, an insult to their most loyal customers.’ Explaining the decision in a blog, . Radio 4 interactive editor Nigel Smith wrote: ‘Traffic to the . messageboard has reduced greatly. While there are around 10,000 regular . visitors the number of people who contribute actively has dropped below a . thousand.’ One particular Archers episode has . been singled out for criticism. Based on the wartime film Brief . Encounter, it was described by one listener as a ‘lame, utterly . humourless parody’. Titles of discussion threads on the site include . ‘That really was a new low...’ and ‘Worst Episode Ever’. There . has also been criticism of this week’s return of Heather Bell to the . role of Clarrie Grundy, whom she last played in 1979. Miss Bell replaced . Rosalind Adams, who had played Clarrie for 25 years. Other . fans have complained about continuity errors in the script and . criticised scriptwriters. On Monday users of the service were informed . that web discussion pages would be closed in two weeks because use of . the site had ‘reduced greatly’. They . were also told that the number of ‘active’ contributors had dropped and . that they should use Facebook or Twitter to talk about the programme. Many . believe the decision to axe the service is due to the increasingly . vocal criticisms on the messageboards about poor storylines and . unhappiness at the general direction of the farming soap. Following the announcement, hundreds used the messageboard to attack the BBC over the decision. Fans are raising a petition which they hope to send to Culture Secretary Maria Miller in a bid to get the move reversed. Underneath a posting directing fans to Mr Smith’s blog, there were more than 380 comments, most of them negative. One read: ‘I can only conclude that the BBC does not like the way certain storylines have been received here.’","The BBC has decided to shut down the Radio 4 show's online forum due to lack of traffic .

A terminally ill woman who was granted . the right to die after a court battle with her own parents before having a . last-minute change of heart, has died. Grace Sung Eun Lee, a former Manhattan bank . manager, was stricken with a brain tumor and fought her extremely religious family for the right to die back in October. After winning the legal battle, she apparently had a change of heart and signed a . document allowing her father to make decisions about . her healthcare, and was kept alive. Family's loss: Grace Sung Eun Lee, center, died on Sunday, months after a legal battle with her own parents over whether to remove her breathing tubes . Smiling: Ms Lee had worked as a manager at Bank of America and lived in Manhattan before she was stricken by the brain tumor . But on Sunday, Grace was pronounced dead shortly after her ventilator reportedly malfunctioned. A statement on the 'Save Grace SungEun Lee' Facebook page on Monday read simply: 'Grace is now with the Lord. Thank you for all your prayers and sticking with us until now.' Her brother Danny Lee told the New York Daily News: 'We believe that God took her. We don’t blame anyone.' Miss Lee was paralyzed from the neck down due to the tumor on her brain stem. She could not talk because of the tumor, but communicated by spelling out words by blinking. Danny Lee told the paper that his sister's last words included 'God,' 'heaven' and 'love mom and dad.' Devastated: Miss Lee's parents are pictured at the hospital after hearing the news that she had won the right to die . Her parents, who belong to a Korean . Christian church in Queens, believed that allowing her daughter to . choose death over life was a sin, after she told  them: 'I want to die.' A judge at the state appeals court sided with Miss Lee after the rift with her parents led to an agonizing legal battle for the family. But 24 hours later, she signed over her decision-making abilities to her father, Rev Manho Lee, of the Antioch Missionary Church in Flushing. He believed that if she removes her . breathing tube she will have committed suicide, which he regarded as a . sin. His congregation flocked behind him to pray for Ms Lee and tell her of God's plans for her life. The sin of suicide, they said, would condemn their daughter's soul to hell. Happier times: Grace, center, pictured with her parents Manho Lee, left, and Jin-ah Lee, right; her father is a pastor at a Flushing, Queens church . The . difference in beliefs led to an emergency end-of-life hearing at the . hospital, with the two sides bitterly reaffirming their respective . stances. Speaking on behalf of Ms Lee, Dr Dana . Lustbader testified that the patient ‘consistently asks that her . breathing tube be removed.’ However, . Rev Lee and his wife argued that their daughter is heavily medicated, . and is not lucid enough to make the life-or-death decision. Doctors said that her medications, . including morphine and an anti-anxiety medication, are not strong enough . to cloud her judgment.

In a dramatic twist to the ongoing saga, Scotland Yard detectives from the Operation Weeting inquiry said they are looking into a suspected conspiracy that took place between around 2005 and 2006. Three men and three women were arrested this morning and are being interviewed at police stations in London and Cheshire. Five of the six were released on bail last night. The Metropolitan Police say the arrests relate to a new phone hacking conspiracy which has emerged as part of the Operation Weeting investigation . They are understood to be Jules Stenson, Matt Nixson, Rav Singh, Jane Atkinson, Polly Graham and Rachel Richardson. Ms Richardson and Ms Atkinson both work for The Sun. The Met said the arrests were made as part of a fresh line of inquiry that is separate from allegations under the existing Operation Weeting investigation. Two men aged 45 and 46 were held in Wandsworth, south London, and a 39-year-old man was arrested in Greenwich, south east London. The three women arrested were a 39-year-old who was detained in Cheshire, a 33-year-old in Islington, north London, and a 40-year-old in Lambeth, south London. They were all arrested on 'suspicion of conspiracy to intercept telephone communications'. Detectives say they plan to speak to people they believe have been victims of the suspected phone hacking and searches are being carried out at a number of addresses. It brings the total number of arrests in Operation Weeting to 32. There are currently three Met inquiries into the scandal: Weeting into phone hacking, Elveden into corrupt payments and Tuleta into computer hacking. The Met said none of the six journalists have been arrested before in connection with any of the inquiries. The total number of individuals arrested in relation to all three inquiries is now 106. An internal message has been sent to News International employees confirming that two of those arrested are journalists currently working for The Sun. The pair have been provided with lawyers.

The survivor of a horrific military rape has bravely spoken out about her ordeal and about the daily battle to overcome her trauma. Kori Cioca, who was in the U.S. Coast Guard, was savagely raped by her commanding officer in the barracks. Her attacker dislocated her jaw but he went unpunished for the crime. Ms Cioca said she lived in fear when the officer was around. ‘I was always waiting to have my face spit in or to have him touch me and make a derogatory remark,’ she said. Scroll down for video . Traumatic: Kori Cioca spoke on Katie Couric about her horrific rape as a new recruit for the U.S. Coast Guard seven years ago . Invisible war: Cioca, pictured with her husband Rob McDonald, was one of several women appearing in the documentary 'The Invisible War,' which examines sexual assault within the military . The former servicewoman appeared with her husband, Rob McDonald, on Katie Couric’s talk show. Stationed: Cioca was stationed at the Saginaw Hills, Michigan branch of the U.S. Coast Guard . She said that she had high hopes of her time at the Coast Guard base in Saginaw, Michigan, saying that her commanding officer seemed ‘very nice’ when she first reported for duty. But things soon turned sour for Ms Cioca, who was the only female recruit on the entire base. She told Couric that the officer would invite her to movie nights with other recruits, but would find upon arrival that she was the only one who received an invitation. ‘I’d walk in from training and he’d be sleeping in my bed,’ Ms Cioca said in the documentary, ‘The Invisible War.’ She said that though she tried to report the officer to those in charge, they were all of his drinking buddies. They told her that it was weak to complain just because she did not like him. The officer was also extremely jealous of other men on the base. ‘It got to the place that if other men were helping me with qualifications, he would yell at me and say only I sign off on your qualifications. That’s how it started,’ the young woman said. The officer raped her in the barracks one night. When she tried to call out for help, he brutally hit her on the left side of her jaw, dislocating it. The full horrors of her rape are chronicled in the Oscar-nominated documentary ‘The Invisible War.’ The doctor treating her injury initially asked if she was in a car accident because it was so severe. It took seven years for her medical claim to the office of Veteran’s Affairs to come through to pay for her medical bills. Assailant: The Coast Guard training officer who eventually raped her would also sleep in her bed and call her at all hours of the night . Injuries: The military woman's jaw was dislocated in the attack . Dark days: The rape survivor, pictured with her husband Rob, said that she contemplated suicide following the attack . When she reported the rape, Ms Cioca said that her Senior Chief was nonchalant about her ordeal, saying that they needed the officer for training duty and that she’d be fine. ‘I still did what I was told and I really thought they were going to do something,’ a tearful Ms Cioca told the talk show host. Ms Cioca was prescribed a host of pills to treat her physical pain, as well as her PTSD. In the film, she explained that other young servicemen had died from taking the physician-prescribed drugs. Since the rape several years ago, the survivor has been on a soft diet of mashed potatoes, Jell-O and other foods that don’t require heavy chewing. As a last resort, the distraught Ms Cioca was planning to take her own life to ease the pain. But when she went to the doctor to get the necessary narcotics and sleeping pills to commit suicide, she discovered that she was pregnant. ‘It was really hard, because when you want to take your own life and you find out there’s a life inside you, how selfish would I be to kill myself with her too?’ Arsenal: Cioca was prescribed dozens of medications for her emotional and physical pain; she said some people who had taken all of the medications at once have died . Divine sign? Cioca said she needed to live once she found out she was pregnant with a baby girl . She tearfully said that God must have given Ms Cioca her daughter as a positive sign. Her husband, Rob, said in the documentary that ‘she loved the Coast Guard more than I did,’ but said that he left as soon as he could once he figured out what happened to her. The Department of Defense estimates that more than 19,000 military men and women were sexually assaulted by fellow troops in 2010 alone while serving in the U.S. armed forces. At least 20 per cent of servicewomen and one per cent of men - an estimated 500,000 troops - have experienced sexual trauma while serving. In most cases, a rape victim’s only judicial recourse is to report the attack to his or her commander, even if it was the officer who attacked them, and it is the officer’s decision whether or not to investigate and prosecute. She now carries a knife and a crucifix with her at all times – the cross for her prayers and the blade for protection.  ‘You always have protection with Jesus, but sometimes you just need a little more,’ she said in ‘The Invisible War.’ And despite the hardships, Ms Cioca’s husband said that he’s sticking with her. ‘There’s nothing that could tear me away from Kori that could ever make me leave, I’m not going anywhere,’ her husband told Katie Couric. Despite the daily struggles, Ms Cioca remains optimistic. ‘We can take down Osama bin Laden, we sure can take down military sexual trauma,' she told Couric to voracious applause. Sexual assault in the military has reached epidemic proportions, with one in three women in the armed forces being sexually assaulted, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Defence Secretary Leon Panetta said in 2012 that more than 19,000 sexual assaults occur in the ranks, and called the military’s struggle to prosecute rapes an ‘outrage.’ In addition, men and women who report such crimes are often belittled, bullied, and mocked. The pandemic inspired filmmaker Kirby Dick to make his documentary. In the film, Mr Dick interviews military rape and sexual assault victims who did not experience justice. It also chronicles their maddening fight for recognition from the Department of Veteran’s Affairs and the Pentagon.

Loney Garrett was arrested and charged with ill treatment of animals after the remains of more than 200 dogs were found at his home . Police discovered the remains of more than 200 dogs in a hunter's back garden after neighbours complained of a 'persistent stench'. Officials said it was one of the largest case of animal cruelty they had seen. About 45 'emaciated' dogs were rescued from the home and taken away from treatment. Loney L Garrett, of Goose Creek, South Carolina, was arrested and charged with ill treatment of animals on Monday. Deputies from Berkeley County Sheriff's Office said there had been little attempt made to bury the animals and many of the bones were found on the surface or discarded in a ditch. Officials said that some of the dead dogs did not die of natural causes and some were found with bullet wounds to the head. Dan Moon, from the sheriff's office, told ABC News4 said he had not heard of an animal cruelty case on this scale before. Deputies spent hours combing the yard and placed pink flags in the ground to mark where each body or bone was found. Mr Moon told the news station: 'There are thousands of dog bones back in there.' Some of the remains had been left at the property for a long time, he said. Police sealed off the perimeter with tape while they searched the grounds. Mr Moon said the rescued dogs were seriously emaciated and may not survive. He said: 'I don't know how many of them will make it. They were skin and bones.' Deputies recovered hundreds of dog bones from the property in Goose Creek, South Carolina . Pink flags were placed to mark where the remains were found and deputies said some dogs had bullet wounds . A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she had seen the skeletal remains of more than ten dogs discarded in a ditch. She said it was 'really heartbreaking' that they had not been buried properly. However, Mr Garrett's daughter-in-law said he had been painted as a monster and that he cared for animals. Diane Luckie claimed she had fed the animals with Garrett and they were thin because they were used to hunt deer and rabbits. Police were called after neighbours complained about the smell but Garrett's relatives said he loved the dogs . She said: 'He's not done anything wrong but love those animals. He has no intentions to hurt those animals.' She said the animals needed to be thin to chase the deer and that the exercise made them lose weight. Garrett was expected to go before a bond court judge yesterday.","Deputies said it was one of largest cases of animal cruelty they had seen .

The lover of a serial con artist who posed as a playboy Italian aristocrat has admitted how she helped him by collecting cash from one of his victims. Gail Heyworth, 51, lived a life of luxury thanks to the lies of Scott Travis despite claiming she was also one of his victims. However, she was found to be the person collecting cash from one of his victims when another woman came forward after being duped out of nearly £12,000 by Travis. Travis is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for blackmail and fraud. However, his latest conviction revealed that he conned a Muslim woman looking for a religious marriage after meeting her on a dating website. Con artists: Scott Travis, left, and Gail Heyworth, right, plotted to fool a Muslim woman looking for love into handing over almost £12,000 in cash . Fraud: Travis posed as a 'well-heeled bachelor' on the Single Muslim dating website to reel in his victim . The 45-year-old fraudster, who lived . with Heyworth in a council flat in Heywood, Rochdale, posed as a . 'well-heeled bachelor' on SingleMuslim.com called Mohammed Kashif Rai who was looking for a bride. He met a 25-year-old woman online and reeled her in with lies about extensive financial interests and property portfolio before concocting a sob story to ask for cash. His partner Gail Heyworth, 51, then met the victim several times, posing as a family friend to collect the money. Travis wooed the the woman via text and email - but made sure he never physically met her or his cover would be blown. The couple would travel to locations in Manchester such as the Trafford Centre and Cheetham Hill where Heyworth would accept wads of cash in an envelope on behalf of her man. Form: The court heard how conman Scott Travis has a history of fraudulent activity . Heyworth, of Baguley Crescent, Middleton, admitted fraud by false representation at Manchester Crown Court yesterday on the day her trial was due to begin. Travis is currently serving . eight years in jail for a separate fraud after posing as an Italian aristocrat to dupe an . 82-year-old man out of £100,000. He women and the . elderly out of cash by falsely claiming he was Viscount Franco Dibella . III and that he stood to inherit a £1.7m fortune. His charades had led to a huge . spending spree in which he acquired a £50,000 Lexus car, had cosmetic . surgery and he stayed for six weeks in a four star £200-a-night hotel and enjoyed weekends away in Monte Carlo . He also employed his own chauffeur, . drank bottles of £80 Bollinger champagne and splashed on suits and . shirts from designer boutiques and dined out at exclusive restaurants. Manchester Crown Court was told that when he was younger, Travis was told his mother was actually his sister because she was only 15 when he was born. He was brought up in a humble council house to a working class family in Rochdale. Formerly known as Paul Marsden he . changed his name by deed poll to Scott Travis and embarked on a series . of frauds by assuming up to four fake identities and made up tall tales . of how he used to play drums with rock band Whitesnake. He falsely alleged the US rock band owed him huge sums in royalties for songs he had written. He showed friends a big box of songs . he claimed to have written sold to the supergroup and sent his family . tickets whenever they played gigs - although he never appeared on stage. In one scam Travis befriended an . 82-year old man then duped him out of his £100,000 life savings over a . period of seven years by falsely claiming he needed money for cancer . treatment at a specialist centre in Lucca, Italy plus cash to pay off . gangsters who had been terrorising him into paying off loans. Reality: Scott Ravis and Gail Heyworth were actually living together in this council flat in Heywood, Rochdale . Police discovered he had a long history of identity fraud during which he obtain credit cards, loans and mobile phones in other people's names to rip off a string of victims. His long-term lover Heyworth had claimed at the . time she was 'sickened' by his offences but has now admitted she was . actually helping him commit the lonely-hearts crime. Travis admitted fraud by false representation at an earlier hearing, and the pair will be sentenced together at a later date. Accomplice: Gail Heyworth had previously claimed she was sickened by Travis' fraud but police discovered she had helped him dupe a Muslim woman out of nearly £12,000 . Lisa Boocock, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Travis has a very long history of fraud and fraudulent behaviour.' 'Gail Heyworth, knowing his background . and knowing he had been arrested for fraud matters in January, then . became aware that he was contacting, through the ‘Single Muslim’ website, single young women looking for a religious match, and was posing as Mohammed Kashif Rai, who was very well-heeled and had a lot of financial interests and many properties. 'Gail Heyworth, knowing that, then travelled in a vehicle with Mr Travis in order to screen him from the lady in question because his appearance was not that which he described, adopting a ruse of being a family friend. 'She met the woman on two occasions and took envelopes of cash from her, knowing it was part of the fraud. It’s these two journeys that go essentially beyond mere knowledge.' In 2005 Travis was first exposed as a . liar and jailed for 16 months when he applied for a £7,500 loan and . secured it against Heyworth's flat - using her details and even imitated . a woman's voice when he spoke to brokers from the company. He also stole a winter heating cheque . from the 67-year old father of hospital administrator Heyworth and used . the details to obtain three credit cards and several mobile phones in . his name. In another scam he pretended to be . the manager of a computer firm earning £35,000 per year whilst claiming . state benefits under another false name. He also made an application for a . time-share at a country club in Lancaster under the name Giofranco . Dibella and claiming to be a writer. A taxi driver who fell victim to . Travis after he hired him as a chauffeur only to owe him £1,265 said: 'I . fell hook, line and sinker for the lies told by him. His stories were . so good, anybody would have believed them. I felt used, abused and . foolish.'

Britain faces a 'living standards crisis' as it was revealed that millions of families will never regain the losses they sustained during the financial crisis and recession. Average earnings have sunk to the level they were at 10 years ago as workers are squeezed by a toxic combination of pay freezes and hikes in the cost of living. Ed Miliband today accused David Cameron of presiding over 'falling living standards' and abandoning the less well-off in favour of the rich. Long road to recovery: Living standards could take years to return to pre-crash levels, the Resolution Foundation has predicted . Real earnings peaked in 2009, with . the average wage at £12.25 per hour, but since then pay increases have . been outstripped by inflation, knocking the average back down to where . it was in 2003 at £11.21 per hour, the Office for National Statistics said. And . millions of families may never see their finances recover from the . impact of the economic downturn, a leading think tank added. 'We have a flatlining economy and - this will be the question of the next two years - declining living standards as a result,' Mr Miliband said to David Cameron at Prime Minister's Questions today. 'Can you just remind us what the thinking was when you decided to provide an average tax cut of £100,000 for everyone earning over £1million in this country?' The Labour leader said the Government had 'cut tax credits, raised VAT and people are worse, not better off'. He concluded: 'There is a living standards crisis for the many and all he does is stand up for a few at the top. 'We have got a failing Prime Minister, he is out of touch and he stands up for the wrong people.' But Mr Cameron insisted he was 'helping working people by taking 24million people and giving them a tax cut this year', adding: 'People will be a lot better off than they were under Labour, with a record deficit, with unreformed welfare, with a busted banking system.' Clash: Ed Miliband challenged David Cameron about the unpromising data at Prime Minister's Questions today . The Prime Minister also pointed to comments made today by Sir Mervyn King, outgoing Governor of the Bank of England, claiming that a 'recovery is in sight' for the British economy. The economist continued: 'That is not to say that the road ahead will be smooth. This hasn’t been a normal recession and it won’t be a normal recovery.' He warned that inflation would stay high for the foreseeable future as the economy is too weak for measures which would drive it down. The Resolution Foundation said it is likely to take as long as 15 . years just for living standards to recover to pre-crash levels, meaning . that someone who earned £22,000 a year in 2008 will have to wait until . 2023 to get back to a similar standard of living. However, had the downturn not hit, a £22,000 income would have reached around £27,500 by 2023. To reach this level, incomes would have to grow by an almost impossible rate of 3.3 per cent a year, it warned. The last time this growth level was seen was in the 1960s. Far from growing, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that average real earnings will in fact continue to fall into 2014 at the same time as support from tax credits and benefits is due to decline. The ONS earnings report said male workers in private firms have suffered the biggest decline in earnings since the recession in 2008. Their average earnings last year were worth less in real terms than in 2002, the research showed. A similar trend was found in the public sector, although the decline was less marked.Male . workers in the public sector saw their real earnings decline by an . average of 2.1 per cent a year between 2010 and 2012, compared with 3.1 per cent in . private firms, said the ONS. Disposable incomes have shrank for those with low to middle incomes, leaving families with less to spend on non-essentials (Source: Resolution Foundation) Chances . of a quick recovery looked even more remote today, as a leading . business body warned the economy will not grow as quickly this year as . previously forecast. The . Confederation of British Industry now expects 1 per cent growth in . 2013, less than its previous estimate of 1.4 per cent, warning the . potential for a new 'flare-up' in eurozone tensions was likely to keep . confidence and growth in check. But . at least the economy is likely to avoid another recession, it added, . with 0.3 per cent growth predicted in the first quarter. A rise in job . vacancies and an improvement in business sentiment hint at marginal . growth, it said. The Resolution report Squeezed Britain 2013 laid bare the ongoing plight of families with low to middle incomes. It defined these households as being of . working age and relying primarily on their own earned resources but with . incomes below the median for the UK. In practice, it means couples . without children living on a joint income of between £12,000 and £30,000 . or between £17,000 and £41,000 for a couple with two children. It revealed the ten million adults in this pay bracket have seen spending power plunge by an average of £280 a year since the start of the financial crisis. The fall in earnings is blamed on a cut in benefits and tax credits and workers having to cut their hours. Six out of ten in the middle to low income group are struggling to keep up with bills, with seven per cent behind on at least one bill. Just over half have no savings at all and two-thirds have less than a month’s income in savings. Squeezed incomes mean households with middle to low incomes would now take an average of 22 years to save for a deposit on a first-time buyer property, the report calculated. The number of years it would take for a low or middle income family to save for a down payment on their first home has risen to 22 years (Source: Resolution Foundation) Matthew Whittaker, senior economist . at the Resolution Foundation, said: ‘There is a long road to travel just . to get back to where living standards stood before the crisis - and the . prospects of actually recovering the ground lost over recent years . appear vanishingly thin. ‘Every extra month of falling household incomes is harder to take than the last as household budgets get closer to the edge.’ Gavin Kelly, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: ‘Without steady growth in earnings living standards will continue to stagnate. We can’t just return to the skewed growth of the past when too many on low and middle incomes failed to keep up with overall rises in prosperity.’ The think tank’s findings were echoed by another report released today, which showed 54 per cent of consumers expect their household budget to be tighter this year. As many as 42 per cent expect the economy to get worse in the next 12 months, the latest Which? Quarterly Consumer Report found. Financial resilience has also taken a hit, with 41 per cent already finding it tough to cope with an unexpected expense. The survey also found that more than a third (35 per cent) have increased their total level of debt in the past month, while the figures suggested that almost six million households dipped into their savings to cover monthly household spending on items like food and utility bills, seven million cut spending on everyday essentials and four million used credit to pay for food. The CBI also warned household spending power is set to grow at a more muted pace this year, but as confidence improved the impulse to save would wane. Director-general John Cridland said: 'We are beginning to see the return of organic growth, with clear signs that firms offering the right products into the right markets are growing sales and expanding. Recent business surveys also give grounds for cautious optimism about our forward prospects.' He added: 'After the uncertainties of 2012, the fear of external storm clouds lingers.'","Average earnings have sunk to level of a decade ago, official data reveal .

When most of us think of dog photography, it's likely images of cute puppies play fighting or snoozing in funny positions come to mind. But one photographer set himself the challenge of capturing canines at their loneliest and most vulnerable - resulting in this series of strangely poignant images. Photographer Martin Usborne spent two years creating a unique collection of images of dogs left alone in cars entitled The Silence Of Dogs In Cars. Poignant: Photographer Martin Usborne has captured a poignant collection of images entitled The Silence Of Dogs In Cars - including this one of Alfie stuck in the boot of a car . Eerie: A dog called Baxter peers out of a misted car glass window in this soulful image . Here's looking at you: Hector waits expectantly in the passenger seat of a car for his owner to return . The series shows the animals peering out of the misted windows of their owners cars, looking sad, lonely and dejected or sometimes alert and expectant. Usborne, who lives in East London with his fiancé and their two dogs, came up with the idea for the series after remembering how he once felt being left alone in a car as a small child. While the experience may have only lasted a few minutes, Usborne recalls how, as a child, it felt as though he may be left there alone forever. He said: 'I was once left in a car at a young age. 'I don’t know when or where or for how long. Possibly it was at the age of four. Perhaps it was outside Tesco’s. Probably for fifteen minutes only. The details don’t matter. 'The point is that I wondered if anyone would come back: in a child’s mind it is possible to be alone forever.' Crossing the Atlantic: The collection of images - including this one of dog Prince - has been released as a book in the UK and will shortly be published in America . Moody: Dog Prospero pushes his nose up against a car window as it pours with rain outside . Eagle-eyed: Race dog Maus appears to have his attention well and truly set on an object outside the range of this picture . This brief experience stuck in Usborne's mind and gave him a 'deep affinity' to animal suffering. But the photographer makes it clear that none of the dogs captured in his series were harmed in any way. All of the scenarios captured were merticulously planned and set up in a studio. He recruited subjects by approaching dog owners while walking his own dogs. The cars used were then picked to 'match' the dogs. He said: 'Although bewildered at first, it was incredible to see how many strangers were so eager to help out and let their dog be photographed. 'After the dog was found, I tried to match the dog to the car. People aren't as bothered about seeing their car in a book as they are their dog.' Angry: This canine called Bolt looks far from happy at being left alone in a car . Having a rough time: Bear and Kessie keep each other company after being left together in a car . Humorous: Some of the images, such as this one of Boris, are more light-hearted . Home sweet home: Chara appears more than happy in her camper van - viewers can even imagine her sitting back to watch the television . Each session took him hundred of images and up to four hours to capture a soulful moment. Usborne, who studied psychology at Edinburgh University and then animation at Glasgow School of Art, said: 'The camera is the perfect tool for capturing a sense of silence and longing. 'Two layers of glass are placed between the viewer and the viewed - the glass of the lens, the glass of the picture frame and, in this instance, the glass of the car window further isolates the animal. The dog is truly trapped. 'When I finally took the first picture, I began to understand where it all came from - fears of being alone, unheard, fears of being like an animal with no human voice. 'The images in this series explore that feeling, both in relation to myself and to animals in general.' Usborne revealed he has suffered from depression in the past and the fear of loneliness is something he is familiar with. Bond: Martin Usborne came up with the idea of photographing dogs, such as Winnie, pictured, left in cars from his own childhood memory of being left in a vehicle alone . Cute ride: Dog Milo takes up the entire front seat of this tiny yellow car . Driving Miss Daisy: Dalmatian Margaux waits expectantly for her owner to return so they can get going . He said: 'I’ve suffered from depression on and and off for much of my life and I’ll place a fair bet that these fears are at the heart of my struggles. 'But strangely enough I found peering into those cars and seeing the dogs inside somewhat beautiful – as if I was looking into the darkest places inside myself and seeing a face there. 'When I started this project I knew the photos would be dark. What I didn’t expect was to see so many subtle reactions by the dogs - some sad, some expectant, some angry, some dejected.' Usborne started his photographic career after a number of years working as a creative director in children’s TV. Dirty drive: Dog Burt can be seen through the part of a back windscreen that has been cleaned by a windscreen wiper . Beautiful: Usborne said he found taking the pictures of the animals, including Dasher pictured, strangely beautiful . Beautiful setting: Shep enjoys a whole camper to himself on an isolated beach . He was also the recipient of the 2009 Taylor Wessing Award in the National Portrait Gallery for his photograph 'Tiger, Rag, Johnny and Emma'. Usborne’s new book of the picture series entitled The Silence Of Dogs In Cars, published by Kehrer Verlag, has already been released in Europe and rewarded ‘Best in Show’ in the Creative Review Photography Annual 2012. The first edition of the book sold out in six weeks and is now going to be released in America in early April. The collection will also be going on show at the Little Black Gallery in London this spring from 19 March to 27 April.

A morbidly obese dog that snacked on pastries, roast dinners and cups of tea has lost almost half her body weight after embarking on a diet. Amber, a beagle, ballooned to a whopping five stones after she refused to eat dog food and left her owner with no choice but to feed her human snacks. The spoilt pet was fed salmon, chicken, roast dinners, toast, and sugary treats by her well-meaning family and grew so large she couldn't be taken out for walks. Morbidly obese: Amber ate a rich diet of salmon, chicken, roast dinners and Danish pastries until her weight ballooned to five stones . Stubborn: Amber, pictured here as a three-year-old with Mrs Lowrie and her daughter Anna in 2004, refused to eat normal dog food . Her owner Sharon Lowrie, from Bishop Auckland, County Durham, didn't realise her beloved pooch's health was in danger until she was deemed too unhealthy for an operation on her rear right leg. Since then, Amber has undergone a special dog diet to save her life and has lost a staggering 2st 7lbs and is now a normal size for her age and breed. Mrs Lowrie, a 49-year-old solicitor, bought Amber as a puppy and she grew at a healthy rate until she was spayed at 18 months when she started getting fussy over her food. She said: 'She wouldn't eat any dog food and would act like a spoilt child, barking until she was fed what she wanted, which was human food. 'After a while of trying to get her to eat dog food I thought I had to feed her something, so she would have salmon, chicken, and ham. 'Because I work full-time, when she was a puppy I would take her to my aunt's house but as people came in for tea and a cake throughout the day, Amber would get some too. Trim: Amber is now a healthy size again after losing almost half her body weight by going on a special dog diet . Diet: Mrs Lowrie, pictured left with a slimmed-down Amber and vet Gabrielle Taylor, put the dog on the diet after she was deemed too unhealthy for an operation . 'She would have a Danish pastry and a cup of tea in her bowl there, and when she got home she would bark and grizzle until you gave her tidbits of our tea.' A year ago Amber was sedated so she could have her claws clipped but seemed to struggle with waking up and couldn't support her own weight. Vets told Mrs Lowrie that Amber had snapped a crucial ligament in her leg and needed an operation, which could only be done if she lost weight. The vets started feeding the huge dog Royal Canin Obesity Management food, and instructed Mrs Lowrie to continue until Amber reached a healthy weight of 2st 9lbs. Hungry: Amber as a puppy, when she clearly already had a healthy appetite . Mrs Lowrie, a married mother-of-two, said: 'I didn't believe she was as overweight as she was and I wouldn't accept she was morbidly obese, even though my husband said we needed to do something about it. 'She was lame in one of her legs and vets said because her quality of life was so low the best thing to do would be to put her to sleep, but I was in pieces. 'We found out she had torn a ligament in her leg and needed an operation, but they wouldn't operate until she had lost weight. 'Over the next year we did a Royal Canin diet which is just dry dog food, and she initially turned her nose up at it but then realised that was all she was going to get.' Normal weight: Mrs Lowrie with a healthy Amber as a young puppy. Amber grew at a healthy rate until she was spayed at 18 months when she started getting fussy over her food . Amber reached her target last month by eating a bowl of the dry dog food mixture twice a day. She no longer needs to have an operation as the damaged ligament has healed, although she does take pain relief medication. Gabrielle Taylor, head veterinary nurse at Wilson Veterinary Group, said: 'Amber was one of the largest dogs I had ever seen. 'She had a ruptured cruciate ligament and wasn't able to walk unassisted or able to support herself and it was too unsafe to operate. But she has now lost a lot of weight by diet and exercise. 'The message here is for people to speak to their vet, they are not there to judge you and if it has got out of hand they shouldn't be embarrassed.'","Beagle has lost almost half her body weight after going on life-saving diet .

A 35-year-old married woman from Arizona allegedly posed as a 16-year-old girl on Facebook to con young boys into having sex with her. Jennifer Dempsey is accused of engaging in sex acts with a 14-year-old and 16-year-old in her car at a Phoenix park and at her home between November and January, and police believe she may have many more victims. Phoenix police Sgt Trent Crump said the Dempsey also lied about being pregnant and for the past five years has convinced her family she is dying of cancer when she is perfectly healthy. He said she even attempted to use the fake illness to avoid arrest last week. 'Con artist': Jennifer Dempsey, 35, allegedly posed as a 16-year-old girl on Facebook to con young boys into having sex with her . 'She used her cancer ploy to our detectives to try and stay out of trouble,' Crump told CBS5 News. 'She said this is the reason why she didn't engage in the sexual conduct because she was constantly ill from chemotherapy, all of which we learned in the following days, was not true.' According to Azcentral.com, Dempsey used various names to lure the boys on Facebook. When they came to her home that she shares with her husband, she told the victims the property belonged to her aunt. Crump said Dempsey lied to both teens about being pregnant and even met with one of the boy's parents to discuss the fake pregnancy, which is how her plan was foiled. Cancer hoax: The married woman, pictured left and right in her mug shot, also lied about being pregnant with the teens' children and convinced her family she had cancer for five years . After the meeting, the parents raised concerns about her age with police and also said they'd discovered nude photos of Dempsey on their son's cell phone. Crump said incriminating text messages led to her arrest and a search of her home uncovered further evidence. Dempsey has admitted having sex with the older boy but denies sleeping with the 14-year-old though police said statements she made when questioned corroborated claims she did engage in sex acts with him. To keep the intricate five-year-long cancer hoax alive, Dempsey shaved her head, bought wigs and had a fake chemotherapy port taped to her chest to fool her relatives, Crump said. It is not clear what the motive for the fake illness was. Home: Dempsey had sex with the boys at her Phoenix home, pictured, though she told them it belonged to her aunt . Neighbors told CBS5 they regularly saw the woman with a tube in her chest as she came and went from her condominium complex. 'It was my belief that she was very, very ill,' Carolyn Chavez, the office manager at Dempsey's apartment, told the news channel. 'She wore a tube all the time. We've had other residents with cancer and I thought she fit the profile.' Another neighbor Elizabeth Slipek said: 'It really is shocking.' 'I can't believe somebody would go to great lengths to go to something like that. It's ridiculous, especially as an adult.' Dempsey was arrested on February 7 at her home and booked into jail where she is being held on several counts of sexual conduct with a minor.","Jennifer Dempsey of Phoenix, Arizona, has been accused of engaging in sex acts with a 14-year-old and 16-year-old between November and January .

Gabrielle Giffords looked visibly recovered as she listened to President Obama’s State of the Union address yesterday - just two years after she was shot in the head at point blank range. The former Congresswoman, who retired in 2012, was singled out during a powerful plea from President Barack Obama for stronger gun control laws. Giffords attended the address with her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly. Scroll down for video . Gabby Giffords, pictured with her husband Mark Kelly, wore green ribbons in memory of the victims of Sandy Hook as they listened to President Obama's State of the Union speech . They were both guests of fellow Arizonans Senator John McCain and Representative Ron Barber. Barber was also injured in the 2011 Tucson shooting, in which six people were killed. Her appearance came a day after her PAC Americans for Responsible Solutions, which she founded with husband Kelly, released its first advert urging Congress to support tight gun laws.

'But there are solutions we can agree on, even gun owners like us. Take it from me, Congress must act. Let’s get this done.’ Giffords was named in a list of gun crime victims by President Obama, who he said deserved the introduction of tighter controls. The Sandy Hook massacre was also . mentioned as was majorette Hadiya Pendleton, who was shot dead three . weeks after performing at the President’s inauguration. President Obama said: ‘Hadiya’s . parents Nate and Cleo are in the chamber tonight, along with more than . two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence. ‘They deserve a vote. Gabby Giffords deserves a vote. The families of Newtown deserve a vote.’ The former Congresswoman, pictured at hospital in May 2011, continues to make a remarkable recovery from her injuries after being shot at point blank range by gunman Jared Lee Loughner . President Barack Obama named Gabby Giffords as he listed victims of gun crime who deserved stronger laws . Giffords and her husband both wore green ribbons in memory of the Sandy Hook victims. It was her first major public appeared since she made a passionate speech to a Senate Judiciary Committee last month. The Arizona Democrat spoke in short and composed but occasionally stilted sentences. She said: ‘Speaking is difficult but I need to say something. Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying. ‘We must do something. It will be hard but the time is now. You must act. Be bold, be courageous. Americans are counting on you.’ Giffords has made a remarkable recovery since being critically injured by gunman Jared Lee Loughner. She was shot during the Congress On Your Corner gathering outside a Safeway store in Casas Adobes, Arizona. Giffords was given emergency first aid by her intern Daniel Hernandez Jr, who is credited with saving her life, before being taken to hospital. She has regained her speech and can write with her left hand and can walk but does not have the use of her right arm and is partially blind.

NHS hospitals are demanding an end to national pay bargaining agreements so they can pay staff to reflect the local cost of living. The Foundation Trust Network – which represents more than 200 trusts across England – said introducing new ways of negotiating pay would allow money to be diverted to patient care. The organisation’s chief executive, Chris Hopson, said it was time to consider setting pay regionally or trust-by-trust, as national agreements would not deliver the necessary cutbacks. Change: The Foundation Trust Network - which represents more than 200 trusts across England - said introducing new ways of negotiating pay would allow money to be diverted to patient care . A new deal on pay, terms and conditions for most NHS staff in England is due to be announced soon. One of its main changes is a clearer link between pay rises and performance. Mr Hopson said NHS trusts completely supported the deal on the table. However, he argued that the challenges of the next five years – a flat budget, rising costs, and the need to improve care at nights and weekends – mean more savings will be required. He explained that pay takes up between 60 and 70 per cent of an average trust’s costs, but safety concerns mean it is impossible to cut staff numbers in the same way as other public services. Mr Hopson said he estimated the current deal would secure an average hospital annual savings of about £250,000, out of the £11million needed, which some people might call ‘a drop in the ocean’. He added: ‘Trusts now have a pressing need for the NHS to start discussing the different ways we could set pay, terms and conditions including looking at whether we should set pay nationally, regionally or trust by trust – exactly the same debate as the education service is now having. ‘Can the NHS, for example, continue to afford a system that gives 60 per cent of staff a 2 per cent pay increase every year, irrespective of performance, on top of any cost-of living-increase?’ Unfair: Chancellor George Osborne believes it is unfair that people earn just as money in areas where the cost of living is low than those in more expensive parts of the country . So far there are moves towards allowing schools to set their own wage rates, but no progress has been made in health. The unions – supported by both Labour and the Liberal Democrats – are vociferously opposed to proposed changes to the national pay bargaining system. At the moment, public sector pay review bodies negotiate with the unions to agree on a flat-rate pay deal for the entire country. The Tories would like to allow the pay review bodies to put forward regional pay deals to reflect the cost of living in different parts of the country. Chancellor George Osborne believes it is unfair that people earn just as money in areas where the cost of living is low than those in more expensive parts of the country. And he says many private businesses cannot compete with high public sector wages – meaning they stop creating jobs in depressed areas of the country. Janet Davies, from the Royal College of Nursing, said: 'Our experience shows that the cost of moving to individual negotiation can outweigh any potential benefit' The Chancellor would like to see public sector workers in the South East earning more than those in the North, where housing is cheaper. A consortium of trusts are already trying to establish their own system of wage negotiations. They want to be able to set their own pay levels to reflect the higher cost of living in the South East. Health minister Dr Dan Poulter said he thought the proposed changes to NHS employee contracts were long overdue. He said: ‘Patient care lies at the heart of this. This is why discussions have been about making a much stronger link between providing high-quality patient care and annual pay progression with a much stronger emphasis on behaviours referenced in the NHS Constitution around compassion, dignity and respect.’ Janet Davies, from the Royal College of Nursing, said abandoning the national pay negotiations would not resolve the severe financial pressures the NHS now faces. She said: ‘Our experience shows that the cost of moving to individual negotiation can outweigh any potential benefit. ‘Nor will the NHS be able to raise the standard of care by moving to a system of pay cartels. ‘The present Agenda for Change system is a transparent and fair system that allows employers to plan ahead with certainty and to reward experience.’ Christina McAnea, from the public service union Unison, warned the proposed system could even undermine the new pay deal. She said: ‘If the Foundation Trust Network is saying the current proposals are not enough it puts the whole thing at risk.’","Foundation Trust Network said new ways of negotiating pay are needed .

"By . Lee Moran . UPDATED: . 11:24 EST, 25 October 2011 . Marijuana is almost twice as cheap to buy in the west of America than on the East Coast, a new study has revealed. Whether used for recreational or medicinal purposes, the drug appears subject to the same market pressures as any other product. U.S. geography experts have revealed the cost of the drug - which sells nationwide for an average of $377.02 per ounce - can vary widely from state to state. Customers in the western state of Oregon . can pick up an ounce for just $256 - whereas those in Delaware, in the . east, are paying almost twice as much - $450 - for the same quantity. High and lows: The marijuana price map was created by charting the cost of sales in cities were more than 30 transactions have been recorded, with the cheapest in green and the more expensive in yellow . The fact the majority of plants are grown in California means that simple distribution costs make it more cheaper to buy there, and more expensive to buy on the East Coast. The higher percentage of young people, the ability to buy the substance for medicinal use and the subsequent difficulty police have in confiscating the drug in the west of the U.S. also contribute to its relative affordability. The research by the Floating Sheep collective comes in the same month that a poll revealed 50 per cent of Americans would like marijuana to be legalised - despite its possession, sale, distribution and transportation remaining completely illegal under federal law. And the evidence of widespread . consumption also comes despite recent studies that show smoking the . substance can trigger psychotic illness such as schizophrenia. Research: The study comes in the same month that a poll revealed 50 per cent of Americans would like marijuana to be legalised . Ups and downs: Marijuana in Portland, Oregon (left) is almost half the price in Wilmington, Delaware (right) Researchers analysed the price of 16,502 marijuana transactions in 2,397 U.S. cities - submitted by customers to the website priceofweed.com. Marijuana purchasers were also encouraged to say the quality of their purchase. Research shows smoking marijuana can trigger psychotic illness such as schizophrenia almost three years earlier. Eighty three studies involving 22,000 people were analysed. It found people vulnerable to mental health problems were likely to suffer symptoms at a much younger age by using the drug. The findings confirmed that it accelerates the onset of full-blown mental illness, which makes it harder to treat successfully. Dr Matthew Large and colleagues at the Prince of Wales Hospital, New South Wales, claimed 'overwhelming evidence' showed it triggered schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. This was perhaps through an interaction between genetic and environmental disorders or by disrupting brain development. They found that marijuana is cheapest in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest, the Four Corners region and a swath of the Great Plains, Illinois, Indiana, Northern Kentucky, and South Florida. It is most expensive in the north-east, much of the Old Confederacy, and especially in Minnesota, Wisconsin, northern Michigan and Illinois. Other factors influencing the price were the number of arrests for marijuana possession in an area and the general attitudes toward marijuana use in the population. Richard Florida, Director of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, said: 'Their main finding is that marijuana prices rise the further a location is from the major centre of production. 'Decreased supply leads to a rise in transportation costs and risk. 'Clearly prices are as low as they are in the Pacific Northwest and Florida for the same reasons that potatoes are cheap in Idaho and corn is cheap in Iowa - because they're close to the source, the places where the product is either grown, imported, processed, or all three. 'Marijuana prices are lower in states with medical marijuana programs because the supply is higher and also because some of the demand is being met legally. The effect of enforcement is harder to ascertain.' Mr Florida, alongside institute colleage Charlotta Mellander, also analysed other socio-economic and demographic factors that could affect the prices. They found that the price is also higher where the majority share of voters say they are Republicans, where there are high levels of illegal drug use and where there is a higher percentage of African-Americans. Earlier this month a Gallup poll revealed 50 per cent of Americans wanted marijuana to be legalised. Supply and demand: The fact the majority of plants are grown in California means that simple distribution costs make it more cheaper to buy there, and more expensive to buy on the East Coast . Gaining steady support, the number was up from 46 per cent last year and had climbed from 12 per cent since 1969, when the research firm first asked the question. The findings come months after the Obama administration toughened its stand on medical marijuana in the 16 states where it is legal for people with doctors' recommendations. The cheapest ounce of marijuana is on sale in Oregon - for $256 . Delaware is the most expensive source of marijuana - at $450 per ounce . Nationwide the average price per ounce is: . High quality - $377.02 . Mid-quality - $245.14 . Low-quality - $138.12 . The data was based on telephone interviews conducted over three days on a random sample of 1,005 U.S. adults, aged 18 and older. The results showed more young people support legalising the drug than their elders, with those 18 to 29 showing a 62 per cent approval rating, compared to only 31 per cent for those 65 and older. More men than women support reform, at 55 to 46 per cent, relatively. Those in the West (55 per cent) and Midwest (54 per cent) were more likely to favour it than those in the South (44 per cent). Liberals were twice as likely as conservatives to favour legalizing marijuana, with relative 69 and 34 per cent approval ratings. And Democrats and independents, both at 57 per cent, are more likely to be in favour than are Republicans, 35 per cent of which support the legalisation of marijuana. Possession, sale, distribution and transportation of marijuana, medical or otherwise, remain completely illegal under federal law. Under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act (CSA), marijuana is currently classified as a Schedule I drug, meaning that it has no accepted medical use. The advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws previously claimed that marijuana is the third-most-popular recreational drug in America, behind only alcohol and tobacco. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health in 2009 found that '16.7 million Americans aged 12 or older used marijuana at least once in the month prior to being surveyed, an increase over the rates reported in all years between 2002 and 2008.' Gallup previously issued a survey last year which found that 70 per cent favoured making it legal for doctors to prescribe marijuana in order to reduce pain and suffering. Reforming views: A graph shows a steady rise in support for the legalisation of marijuana, and steady decline in opposition over recent years, according to Gallup .","Price varies from $256 an ounce in Oregon to $450 in Delaware .

His first burial was an undignified one - dumped in a shallow grave with no coffin or shroud following the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. But after its discovery under a Leicester car park, the body of Richard III will finally be laid to rest in surroundings fit for a king, as the first pictures of his potential tomb are revealed. Computer-generated images show the 7ft (2.1 metre) long, magnesian limestone tomb that the Richard III Society hopes he well be buried in. Fit for a king: The Richard III Society unveiled computer-generated images of the tomb which it hopes will be the final resting place of the king . Optimistic Philippa Langley, who led the society's eventual discovery of the last Plantagenet monarch's remains, commissioned the designs in 2010 before the remains had even been discovered. The designs, which have only now been released, incorporate the white rose of York and several inscriptions wrought in . stone and on a metal plaque. It also features the Cross of St. Cuthbert, symbolic of his devotion to the Christian faith  and Richard’s personal emblem, the white boar. Leicester Cathedral, where the remains are expected to be re-interred next year, have yet to make a final decision on the tomb's appearance and its exact location. Some were left disappointed when a decision was taken not to bury the notorious King's body at a state funeral in Westminster Abbey. The cathedral is to commission architects on March 12 and is expecting to receive draft designs in the summer. Foresight: Optimistic Philippa Langley, who led the society's eventual discovery of the last Plantagenet monarch's remains, commissioned the designs in 2010 . A spokesman for the Richard III Society said: 'The tomb design was commissioned by Philippa Langley in September 2010 at the very beginning of the Looking For Richard project. 'It is based on Richard's life, and what was important and meaningful to him, and the design was undertaken by a team of specialists with over 40 years of research into Richard III. 'The society is looking forward to working with the cathedral and Leicester City Council to honour the return of the king.' The designs would cost around £30,000 to implement, which the society hopes will met through donations. It said 65 per cent of the costs had already been met for the tomb, which would take four months to construct. The centuries-old . mystery of what happened to the body of Richard III was answered earlier this months when scientists from Leicester university confirmed the remains were those of the king. Their tests revealed how appallingly he was treated in death after defeat at the hands of . Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. New resting place: It is expected that Richard III's remains will now be re-interred at Leicester cathedral . The hunchback king: The skeleton, unearthed in a . dig last September, showed evidence of the same curvature of the spine . and battle injuries thought to have been suffered by the last . Plantagenet king . The face of a king: There were cheers from media who had gathered from around the world as the announcement was made at the University of Leicester this morning . Clues: Richard III's skeleton showed signs of horrific injuries and the curved spine also matched accounts of the humpback king . Stripped naked with his hands tied, and scarred by multiple ‘humiliation . wounds’ inflicted as his body was paraded through Leicester, Richard . III was dumped in a shallow grave with no coffin or shroud. Using historical maps, archaeologists had traced a friary where . the king was rumoured to have been buried, which now lies beneath a . social services department car park in Leicester. Screenwriter Miss Langley described the chill she felt when walking . through the car park in August 2009: ‘It was a hot summer and I had . goosebumps so badly and I was freezing cold. 'I walked past a particular . spot and absolutely knew I was walking on his grave.’ The cut mark on the right rib of King Richard III: It is thought this and a number of other injuries found on the skeleton are evidence of 'humiliation injuries' inflicted after his death . Two vertebrae of king Richard III, showing some abnormal features relating to the scoliosis: The find corroborates historical accounts of Richard which described him as a hunchback . Only three weeks . into the dig in September 2011, her instincts appeared to be confirmed . when researchers found the skeleton of an adult male in a badly-dug . grave who had a severely curved spine: Richard was famously nicknamed . Crookback. The bones were subjected to ‘rigorous academic study’ by a team from the . University of Leicester, and those involved were all sworn to secrecy. The remains had lain almost completely undisturbed less than three feet . below ground, but were almost destroyed when a 19th century outhouse was . built just inches away. DNA from the skeleton was matched with two of Richard’s living . descendants – Canadian-born furniture maker Michael Ibsen, whose mother . was a direct descendant of the king’s sister Anne of York, and a second . anonymous individual. The curved spine of the skeleton and its numerous wounds also helped . confirm the ‘astonishing’ discovery, even if Richard’s so-called . withered arm appears to be a myth. As they were found: The remains of King Richard . III were found in a hastily dug grave beneath a council car park in . Leicester last September, in what were once the precincts of Grey Friars . church . The skull of the king as it was found by . archaeologists: Trauma to the skeleton showed the king died after one of . two significant wounds to the back of the skull - possibly caused by a . sword and a halberd . Hunched in death as he was in life: The skeleton was found in good condition with its feet missing . The Battle of Bosworth: Richard, pictured on the . white horse, was killed in battle more than 500 years ago at Bosworth . field, in a battle which marked the end of his line and the rise of the . Tudors . Studies revealed the remains dated back to the era of the War of the . Roses, while the individual was found to be in his late 20s to 30s. Richard III was 32 when he died. His skeleton was found to have suffered ten injuries at the time of . death, but only two skull wounds were potentially fatal and were most . likely inflicted by a sword or a halberd – a spiked axe on a pole. The corpse was subjected to ‘humiliation injuries’ – including a sword . through the right buttock – likely to have been inflicted after death. The pronounced curvature of the spine, caused by severe scoliosis, . supports the Shakespearean description of the monarch as ‘rudely . stamp’d, deformed, unfinish’d’. But the findings suggest the Bard used dramatic licence when describing Richard as having a withered arm. Richard III ruled for only two years following the death of his brother, . Edward IV.

Litter police have been told to issue £80 on-the-spot fines for the ‘disgusting and inappropriate’ practice of spitting in the street. Last month the Daily Mail told how councils had deployed private litter police to hand out fines for dropping items such as cigarette butts, bank cards, nut shells and even pens. Now Waltham Forest council, in north-east London, will extend the penalties to anyone caught spitting. Cleaning up its act: Waltham Forest has gone one better than the litter police and will fine anyone caught spitting as well as dumping rubbish on streets . The measure is part of their ‘Wipe It Out’ campaign against environmental crime. Council bosses say they want to make spitting in public taboo by sending an ‘unequivocal message’ that the streets should be treated with respect. Last year, neighbouring borough Enfield announced plans to introduce a bylaw to ban spitting. It is still waiting for clearance from the Government to enforce the new rules. Waltham Forest claims it has been able to get around the bureaucracy of introducing a bylaw by deciding to class spit and urine as ‘waste’. That means litter police who have previously targeted people dropping cigarette butts, crisp packets and takeaway boxes can issue fines to those caught spitting. Fines: Bosses at Waltham Forest Council were able to get round the bureaucracy of introducing a bylaw by classing spit and urine as waste . The civil enforcement officers can also hand out tickets to people found urinating in the street.Clyde Loakes, deputy leader of Waltham Forest council, said: ‘It’s horrible to witness and leaves an unsanitary mess on our paths and pavements. ‘Why people think it is acceptable to indulge in what must be the most anti-social of all behaviours is a mystery, but they do. ‘In the past people would not have thought twice about throwing a cigarette butt on the pavement, or letting their dog leave a mess on a pathway. ‘In the same way, I think we need to make spitting and urinating taboo. ‘I don’t believe the vast majority of people need telling that it is disgusting and inappropriate. Waltham Forest Council wants to make spitting taboo by introducing the new penalties . ‘But this move sends out an unequivocal message to those people who spit or treat our streets like a toilet. You will be issued with a fine and you find it the most expensive penny you have ever spent.’ Councils raise an estimated £5.5million from handing out more than 73,500 litter fines a year. This means around 200 fines are issued every day. One company, called Xfor, is run by former soldiers. It has been accused of being overzealous in issuing the fines, each one of which can earn the firm up to £45. The company has made around £1.6million from the contracts it holds with 15 local authorities. Council bosses insist that they are simply trying to keep their streets clean. However, complaints have flooded in from people who feel they do not deserve the harsh penalties. One woman in Blaenau Gwent, South Wales, says she was fined for accidentally dropping a thread from her glove. Another was given a £75 ticket for walking her dog in a field she had used for 30 years. She had no idea the park had been turned into a no-dog zone because the warning signs had been stolen. Other people have been fined up to £80 for dropping bits of orange peel, a banana skin and even a single matchstick.","Councils are deploying litter police to fine people who drop rubbish .

Brian Fraser, 63, was today found not guilty of the attempted murder of Louise Leggatt, 55, and also of causing her grievous bodily harm with intent. The master of the Ashford Valley Hunt in Kent was alleged to have been enraged at the end of his five-year romance with Miss Leggatt – who the court heard was known as ‘Leg-Over Leggatt’. Brian Fraser (left), 63, was today found not guilty of the attempted murder of his former lover Louise Leggatt (right), 55. Both are pictured outside Maidstone Crown Court yesterday . The verdicts came after a jury spent five and a half hours deliberating, following a two-week trial at Maidstone Crown Court. Fraser had admitted possessing a firearm without a licence and was warned by the judge he could still be sent to prison. Judge Charles Byers said: ‘I have never come across such a lackadaisical . and irresponsible attitude towards firearms, particularly for someone . who is described as a countryman.’ He bailed him to return to court on March 18 to be sentenced. The judge also told Fraser not to have any contact with Miss Leggatt or . her two grown-up sons, Ben and William, saying: ‘I am considering a . restraining order which even in the face of an acquittal I can make.’ Mrs Leggatt was shot as she went to tend to her horses at her farmhouse home in Benenden, Kent, in March last year . Mr Fraser showed no emotion as the verdicts were delivered but there were cheers and cries of 'Yes' from his family and friends in the public gallery, including his forgiving wife Nanette who looked tearful. Leaving the court after the verdict, Mrs Fraser said: 'There's a lot I could say. I'm just relieved it's all over and we can get back to living together.' Mrs Leggatt, who was in court, held her head in her hands and looked shattered. She was shot outside her secluded rented farmhouse home in Benenden, Kent, in March last year, as she went to tend her horses. She suffered shotgun injuries to her pelvis and leg, and underwent surgery to remove some of the pellets. Two months earlier, Mrs Leggatt's home, The Pippins, was destroyed in an arson attack, forcing her to rent the next door property Bramleys, where she was shot. Nobody was ever convicted for the arson. Mr Fraser and Mrs Leggatt met through the Ashford Valley Hunt in Kent in 2000 and became lovers in 2001. Brian Fraser moved into the home of Louise Leggatt (above) and they had a five-year affair before he returned to his wife of 26 years in October 2011, at their farm in Shadoxhurst near Ashford, Kent . He moved into her home and they had a five-year affair before Fraser returned to his wife of 26 years in October 2011, at their farm in Shadoxhurst near Ashford, Kent. Mr Fraser denied he tried to rekindle their romance and was angry when she rejected him. Giving evidence during the trial, twice-divorced Mrs Leggatt sobbed as she relived the 'terrifying' moment she was shot in her front garden by a hidden gunman. She said: 'First of all, I heard a sound and then I just had the most horrendous pain in my leg and hip. 'I couldn't use my right leg at all but I managed to get inside and drag myself across the floor to where the phone was to dial 999. 'I was absolutely terrified, I had never been so terrified in all my life. I was really, really scared that whoever had done this was going to come back in and I couldn't get back to the door to lock the door.' During the trial, one of Louise's ex-husbands, Philip Gorringe, admitted he had heard of her being referred to as 'Leg-Over Leggatt' in hunting circles. Mr Fraser declined to comment following the case. His solicitor Toby Burrough said outside court: 'Mr Fraser has always maintained his innocence in respect of the charges he faced, and is thankful to the jury for reaching the verdict they did, and is obviously tremendously relieved at the outcome today. 'He would like to thank all those who stood by him and supported him throughout this case. It has been a tremendously stressful occasion for both him and his family. 'It has been a difficult time for him and his family and those who have supported him because of the serious nature of the allegations he faced. 'And that has been something that has taken its toll on him.... it is a great weight off his shoulders.'","Brian Fraser was also found not guilty of causing Louise Leggatt grievous bodily harm with intent .

While many brides fall victim to the cliche that they must have the most expensive and outlandish gown, one woman was determined not to stick with tradition. Snubbing a big white frilly dress, Kelly Scott decided to go with something a little more modern - she wore a onesie. She and new husband Stuart decided to shun the traditional big white dress and morning suit when they married at Gretna Green. And the bride wore... a onesie! The newlyweds decided to make their special day more personal by marrying in their favourite fleece outfits . The couple, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, believe they may be the only couple to have ever wed in onesies - the fleecy all-in-one loved by celebrities and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg. Kelly, a 30-year-old account manager for an energy company, said: 'Our favourite time of the day is when we are snuggled up watching TV in our onesies after the kids have gone to bed. 'Nowadays getting married costs thousands and we couldn't afford a traditional wedding. 'We felt sad about the thought of having a cheap wedding so we said ""why not have a me and you wedding instead""?' Keeping the chill out! The wedding party all sported the rompers to celebrate the couple's nuptials in Gretna Green . The bride cut down costs by wearing comfy slipper boots with her onesie and the groom wore trainers. Ten members of the wedding party also wore the babygrow-style suits for the ceremony, including their one-year-old son Frankie and Kelly's seven-year-daughter Tiegan, their witnesses Helen Bottomley and Adam Mills, Kelly's aunt and uncle Karen and Andy Tweedale, her nephews Louis and Harrison Tweedale and niece Chloe Ellison. Others chose to dress more traditionally, including the bride's younger brother Brad-Lee Mullins who wore a smart grey suit. Wearing one has been likened to 'being inside a teddy bear's womb' and, despite its unflattering look, the onesie has become a global phenomenon. Pre-Christmas sales were up 600 per cent, they were profiled on BBC 2's Newsnight - and even London Mayor Boris Johnson has confessed to owning one in a Union Jack pattern. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has admitted to owning a green onesie, the adult babygro beloved of Justin Bieber, Brad Pitt, Cheryl Cole, One Direction’s Harry Styles, Rihanna and Tom Daley. The popularity of adult romper suits, known as ‘onesies’, helped drive a 25 per cent increase in total sales at Primark over the 16 weeks to 5 January. The bride was given away by her step-dad Wayne Mullins and her father Roy Ellison was best man - but they decided to wear smart suits too. Kelly and Stuart, a 39-year-old electrical engineer, had the last laugh in their snowboarding onesies when it started to snow. Kelly added: 'We tried to get the minister to wear a onesie but he politely declined and told us he didn't have one. He told us he had never married a couple in onesies before.' She added: 'At first we said in a couple of years we would renew our vows but now I wouldn't change anything about our wedding day. Everyone had big smiles on their faces. 'I did imagine getting married in a big white dress as a kid but as you get older you realise that there are things more important than . spending thousands on a dress. 'And the best thing is that we can snuggle up on the sofa in our wedding outfits.' The couple, from Oakland Terrace, Castleton, are now saving up to go on honeymoon with their children to Disneyland and Las Vegas next year. Stuart said: 'Our wedding day was so much fun. At first our friends and family thought we were mad but wearing onesies is the only time we get o be relaxed. 'It was perfect and we wouldn't change a thing.'","Kelly and Stuart Scott decided to get married in rompers as their favourite part of the day is curling up on the sofa in them .

'Superhead' on trial: Sir Alan Davies . outside Southwark Crown Court where he pleaded not guilty to involvement in a £2.7million fraud . A knighted superhead and five of his former colleagues have today appeared in court charged with swindling their old school out of £2.7 million. Sir Alan Davies, the 65-year-old former head of Copland Community School in Wembley, north west London is accused of conspiring to defraud the cash-strapped local authority. He is to stand trial alongside Dr Richard Evans, 55, a former deputy head and education adviser to David Cameron, and the then chairman of governors Indravadan Patel, 73. Former school bursar Columbus Udokoro, 62, HR manager Michele McKenzie, 53, and ex-vice chair of governors Martin Day, 58, are also said to be part of the alleged fraud. All six appeared at Southwark Crown Court today where they pleaded not guilty to the charge, which centres on inappropriate payments said to have been paid out between April 2003 and June 2009. Davies, who was decorated for his services to education, is said to have received more than £900,000 in ‘inappropriate payments’ while Dr Evans allegedly obtained £600,000. Davies is also accused of one count of laundering £270,490 by transferring the sum from a NatWest bank account in England to a Spanish bank account in March 2008. He is further charged with six counts of false accounting, said to have taken place between April 2007 and June 2009 - part of his alleged efforts to ‘cover up his activities’. At a previous court hearing prosecutor David Levy told Westminster Magistrates Court that the total value of the fraud 'was in the region of £2.7m.' Davies, who wore a grey suit, grey . shirt and silver tie for today’s plea and case management hearing, spoke . only to confirm his name and deny the charges against him in a clear . voice, which also include six counts of false accounting. Co-accused: Former school bursar Columbus Udokoro (left) and former chairman of governors Indravadan Patel (right) HR manager Michele McKenzie Former and former deputy head Dr Richard Evans also pleaded not guilty to the charges . Accused: Ex-vice chair of governors Martin Day . The . former superhead, who was decorated for his services to education, also . stands accused of transferring over £270,000 in criminal property . between January and April 2008. Former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown both visited Coplands, while ex-deputy head Evans even acted as an educational advisor to current Prime Minister David Cameron, who also visited the school. John Black QC, prosecuting, today told Southwark Crown Court that the charges of false accounting levelled against Sir Alan are 'outside the conspiracy' that his colleagues stand accused of. He added: 'They were part of what the Crown say is a cover-up. We have already taken the view that they took place after the event [and were] intended to cover up his activities.' Mr Black also revealed that the accusation of transferring criminal property - which sees Davies accused of switching £270,490 between a British and Spanish bank account - relate to the “proceeds of the conspiracy.” Judge Anthony Leonard QC remanded all six on bail. They are due to stand trial at Southwark Crown Court on September 16th. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Sir Alan Davies 65, was headmaster at Copland School in Wembley .

The money had been lost more than a decade ago and forgotten about by its wealthy owner. Emmaus manager Tony Ferrier, 60, said: 'The man told us he used to buy and sell vegetables from abroad in London and always dealt in cash.

Tony added: 'He came to see us and told us the story and gave us £500 as a thank you which was rather nice.' The money was found by volunteer Andy Browne as he opened up the bed.

Tycoon: Vasileios Omarov, seen outside Blackfriars Crown Court today, tried to 'buy off' the hotel worker he groped, the trial heard . A Russian business tycoon drunkenly groped a hotel worker's bottom then offered her thousands of pounds to drop her case against him, a court heard today.Vasileios Omarov, 44, tried to 'buy off' the woman after the incident a four star hotel in  central London, in December 2010, a jury was told. Instead of approaching her himself, the 'very rich' company director got Kiril Angelov, then head concierge at the hotel, to 'do his dirty work for him,' the court heard. The woman, who was at the time a senior guest relations manager tasked with looking after the hotel's elite clients, claims she was initially offered £2,000 not to give evidence, then £4,000, and eventually £5,000 plus a 'favour for the future' when she refused.The pair were arrested when the 'terrified' woman went to police in May 2011 - days before Omarov's sexual assault trial was due to begin, Blackfriars Crown Court heard. Chronic alcoholic Omarov, who is currently staying in The Priory, later admitted a reduced charge of unlawful assault, the court was told.Omarov, who arrived at today's hearing in a chauffeur-driven Bentley, is now in the dock again alongside Angelov accused of perverting the course of justice. Benjamin Temple, prosecuting, said: 'The first defendant, Vasileios Omarov, is, on the Crown's understanding, a Russian-born Greek national residing in London. 'He is a very successful businessman who, by anyone's standards, is very rich. 'The second, Kiril Angelov, is a Bulgarian national who was, at the time, head concierge in the hotel.' Mr Temple said an incident took place at the London hotel where Omarov was a paying guest.'Just before Christmas on December 18th Mr Omarov was by anyone's standards intoxicated in the hotel,' he said. 'He was very drunk, was on medication and was in a very bad way. 'At about 4.45pm a member of staff saw him at a computer terminal at the concierge counter. He was urinating on the desk and on himself. 'He was asked to leave and he assaulted one of the staff, the lady in the indictment. 'She told him his behaviour was unacceptable and wanted to escort him to his room on the first floor so he could pack his things. 'Initially he said ""okay"" and followed her to the lift, but he decided he wanted to check out first,' Mr Temple said. 'At the desk she stood just to the right of him within touching distance of him, and that's precisely what he did. He touched her with an open palm over her clothes on her buttocks. 'She told him not to touch her and he replied: ""F*** off"". 'He then walked to the lobby bar where he was ultimately escorted to his room, the police were called and he was arrested.' 'Very successful': The court heard the businessman, who arrived at his trial in a chauffeur-driven Bentley, was so drunk on the night in question he could barely stand . 'Intoxicated': Blackfriars Crown Court (pictured) heard Omarov told police he had little memory of the incident at the hotel as he was 'worse for wear' The court heard Omarov was so drunk at the time he could barely stand up, kept bumping into guests and at one point hugged a staff member and made him walk around the restaurant with him. When he was interviewed by police he denied there was any sexual element to the touching and claimed he had little memory of it as he was 'worse for wear on drink and medication'.Mr Temple added: 'What happened in the run up to the trial was that this rich businessman tried to buy her off. He offered her money to drop the case. 'As a rich businessman he is no doubt used to having people run errands for him so he enlisted a ""fixer"" - the concierge - to do his dirty work for him, and they were in it together.' Trial: The Russian-born company director, seen right outside court, is accused of perverting the course of justice . Giving evidence the woman said she was approached by Angelov on three occasions in 2011. The first time, on April 27th, was in the hotel canteen while the second and third on May 1st and May 2nd were in the hotel's basement car park. She told jurors: 'Kiril said he had been approached by Mr Omarov and that he wanted to offer me money not to go to court. 'I said: ""Is this for real? It seems like a movie. Does he take me for a fool?""'He said Mr Omarov was a respectable gentleman and going to court would embarrass him in his society.'She said she continued to refuse the offer, but on the third occasion she claims Angelov became 'upset and aggressive' with her. 'He said ""Listen, Mr Omarov is offering a maximum of £5,000 and a favour in the future. He is a very important gentleman. If he goes to jail for three months, what benefit is it to you?""'He said he couldn't sleep as Mr Omarov was calling him all the time. I said I couldn't sleep myself. 'I was genuinely frightened. It's something that I still think about.'Afterwards the woman, who still works for the chain as a sales executive at a different hotel, said she went to police because she was 'really terrified'.She broke down as she added: 'I was really scared that day. I was scared to go home.'Omarov and Angelov, of Edgware, north west London, deny the charge against them. The trial continues.

As she details a miscarriage and a fallout with her father, the 31-year-old singer said: 'I hope that she will see all of the beautiful times and all the tough times that led up to her being here. I’m hoping that … it can comfort her and inspire her in her life when she needs it.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO...

And Blue makes a starring appearance in the documentary, which will air on Sunday at 9pm, as her mother cuddles her and shows her off to the camera. Beyoncé dismisses the rumors that she used a surrogate to have her daughter - who she reveals was unplanned - as 'the most ridiculous rumor I’ve ever had about me.' She adds that although she realises there are 'crazy celebrities' who do outlandish things for attention -  she would never make light of having a child, adding: 'I respect mothers and women so much and to be able to experience bringing a child into the world – if you’re lucky and fortunate enough to experience that – I would never take that for granted.' She continues that having a miscarriage makes the topic even touchier, 'Especially after losing a child, the pain and trauma from that just makes it mean so much more to get an opportunity to bring a life into the world. 'It’s something you have to respect. There’s certain things you just shouldn’t play around with and a child, you don’t play around with that.' For the star, music was her salvation after suffering a miscarriage two years ago.

Stopping a chemical attack by the Syrian government would be nearly impossible so opposing forces will need to rely on deterrence, a top U.S. general has said. The United States has largely ruled out sending in ground troops to secure Syrian chemical weapons under hostile circumstances, but the Pentagon could provide some forces if the Assad regime ever agrees to a peaceful transition. General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. must instead continue to warn Syria that using such weapons would be unacceptable. Ruled out ground invasion: U.S. General Martin Dempsey (pictured, right, with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta) explains why it would be nearly impossible to prevent a chemical attack by President Assad's forces . Hoping for peaceful transition: Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta (left) says his biggest concern is how the U.S. and allies would secure the chemical and biological weapons sites scattered across Syria . 'The act of preventing the use of chemical weapons would be almost unachievable,' Dempsey said during a Pentagon press conference. 'You would have to have such clarity of intelligence, you know, persistent surveillance, you'd have to actually see it before it happened, and that's - that's unlikely, to be sure.' Speaking to Pentagon reporters, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says his biggest concern is how the U.S. and allies would secure the chemical and biological weapons sites scattered across Syria and ensure the components don't end up in the wrong hands if the regime falls, particularly under violent conditions. He said the U.S. is preparing no options for having U.S. ground troops in that country if the regime falls while under attack. Obstacle to peace: There are worries that if Syrian President Bashar Assad (pictured) is toppled, Islamic extremists could gain control of Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons . Could get worse: Smoke billows over destroyed buildings in Aleppo in October. There are fears that Assad might use his chemical weapons, perhaps on his own people, in a last-ditch effort to save his regime . But he added: 'You always have to keep the possibility that, if there is a peaceful transition and international organizations get involved, that they might ask for assistance in that situation.' There are widespread worries among allies and countries in the region that if Syrian President Bashar Assad is toppled, Islamic extremists could gain control of Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons, which includes sarin and mustard gas. And there are lingering worries that Assad might use his chemical weapons, perhaps on his own people, in a last-ditch effort to save his regime. President Barack Obama has said the regime's use of chemical weapons against the rebels would be a 'red line' and change his 'calculus' about possible military intervention there. Fears escalated early last month when U.S. officials said there was evidence that Syrian forces had begun preparing sarin, a nerve agent, for possible use in bombs. Displaced: A Syrian refugee carries a new tent at the Al-Zaatari refugee camp in the Jordanian city of Mafraq on Thursday. At least 60,000 people have died during Assad's two-year crackdown, according to the U.N. But Panetta later said that it appeared the Syrian government had slowed its preparations for the possible use of the weapons. The Pentagon has put together a variety of options for securing the weapons under a range of circumstances, Dempsey said. And he acknowledged the U.S. has been in contact with NATO allies, such as the Czech Republic, who have developed capabilities for handling chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. But Dempsey said not specific request has been made of the Czech Republic. At least 60,000 people have died during Assad's two-year crackdown on rebels, according to a recent U.N. estimate. Opposition fighters have seized large swaths of territory in northern Syria, and on Thursday activists said they now control parts of a strategic air base. But despite significant rebel advances on the battlefield, the opposition remains outgunned by government forces and has been unable to break a stalemate on the ground. Panetta on Thursday said he believes there is a strong likelihood that Assad will ultimately leave power.","General Martin Dempsey says the U.S. must instead rely on deterrence .

There was a public outcry when it was revealed that the next iPhone would get a new docking port connector. The newer, slimline port means that thousands of current Apple accessories will need a potentially clunky adapter to work with the 'iPhone 5' - or become unusable. Now, latest leaks from the website iMore, which has strong sources 'close to Apple', suggest that the entire next generation of iDevices, including the iPod Nano, iPod Touch, iPad Mini and future versions of the iPad, will use the new port. Apple is expected to refresh its iPod and iPhone product line this Autumn, and if the company sticks to its usual policy of annual upgrades, a new iPad can be expected next Spring. Change: This picture is believed to show a prototype case for the new iPhone, with its new connector design which is set to make every existing accessory completely obsolete . Old and new: The current iPhone is shown with the prototype of the iPhone 5's outer casing . iMore . is consistently accurate with predictions about Apple's next moves, and . suggest the announcement will be made at a launch event in San . Francisco on Wednesday, September 12. The . site believes a special connector will be released to connect older . accessories - such as docking stations and speakers - to newer versions . of the range. Many fans were . left angry after images allegedly showing the iPhone 5's new design . leaked out, showing the traditional 30-pin dock connector - used for . charging, syncing files and pumping audio to hi-fis - had been . re-designed into a smaller shape. Popular: But iPhone users could found themselves seriously out of pocket if they want to upgrade their device . Useless: The $850 Bang & Olufsen BeoSound 8 is designed to work with the current iPhone's design . The new port looks similar to micro . USB, the standard supported by all other phone manufacturers - however . it is very unlikely that Apple will support this standard, despite moves . by the EU to get all phone companies to rally around one type of cable. Apple's version has a triangle-shaped wedge at one end, which should stop users plugging in the cable the wrong way round. Mac . fans may spot a superficial similarity to a Firewire port, which is . used to transfer raw video footage and larger files at high speed. Obsolete: The B&W Zeppelin speaker, left, and the Bose Sounddock 10, right, are other pricey gadgets which will have to be upgraded before they will work with the iPhone 5 . The new port means older accessories will be rendered redundant unless adapters . are released to make them compatible again - which is likely to be an . ungainly solution, and may be impossible for some docks. The . 'nano-SIM' slot, containing the SIM card which connects a phone to the . carrier network, has also been redesigned to be thinner, although this . will be unlikely to cause much disruption to users as networks will . provide replacements SIMs if necessary.

It turns out there is one very big thing design and marketing guru Steve Jobs wanted to do before he died: design an Apple car. The Apple co-founder and CEO reportedly told associates he wanted to create an iCar, reports Business Insider. And Jobs reportedly told the Times' John Markoff, during a meeting prior to his death, that he wanted to 'take on Detroit.' iDream: The late Apple guru Steve Jobs hoped to one day see the creation of the iCar . iLegacy: Tim Cook (pictured) replaced Jobs as Apple's CEO and has continued Jobs' legacy of innovation. But will he one day fulfill the dream of an iCar? Longtime Apple board member Mickey Drexler, who is also the CEO of J. Crew, confirmed as much in May. Gcar: Apple's biggest rival, Google, has put considerable sums behind their driverless car . 'It's a tragedy in America. Who is designing the cars?' Drexler said. 'Steve's dream before he died was to design an iCar.' Drexler believes the never-realized Apple car could have made a serious impact in the American car market. 'It would've been probably 50% of the market. He never did design it,' he said. The New York Times revisited the late genius's unfulfilled dream Sunday in a piece about Apple's foray into another market, that of wearable technology. The tech giant is apparently poised to soon bring a watch-like wearable computer to the market with the help of a new, flexible glass developed by Corning. Though the iCar may still be a fantasy, Apple's largest rival Google has already famously put weight behind a self-driving car. The Google driverless car, as it's most often known, has been the subject of countless videos and news articles detailing the likelihood (or unlikelihood) of its success or even feasibility. Whether Google will succeed or not remains to be seen, but the search giant is currently the only name in tech pumping untold research dollars into automobile research and development. Car loving Apple devotees need not lose all hope, though. Some big names in Apple leadership, Eddy Cue and Phil Schiller, are both big time car fans. In fact, Cue is even on the board of Ferrari.

When Emma Mynors regained consciousness she did not even remember being pregnant let alone any details of the labour. The 23-year-old fell into a coma and suffered two stokes after developing pneumonia, but managed to give birth naturally a fortnight later to daughter Amy whilst still unconscious. Proud mother Emma Mynors clutches her baby daughter Amy, who she gave birth to while in a coma . Emma Mynors sees her newborn daughter for the first time after regaining consciousness from a deep coma . Nurses at Colchester General Hospital only realised she had gone into labour, prematurely at 29 weeks, when they saw the baby's head emerge. Mrs . Mynors has described the birth of Amy, who weighed a tiny 3lb 5zo, as a 'miracle'. She said: ‘When I woke from my coma, the nurses kept showing me . photographs of this baby girl, and I had no idea who she was. ‘They . told me she was my daughter and I didn’t believe them. I had no . recollection of being pregnant. I knew I had a husband and a son, but I . had no idea about being pregnant again. ‘Yet here were the nurses showing me all these photographs of a baby that they were telling me was my daughter. She added: ‘It seemed incredible to think that I had . given birth naturally whilst I was still in a coma. 'I hadn’t . consciously pushed or experienced a single contraction, yet my little . girl was here and she was healthy. It just seemed like a miracle.’ Mrs Mynors, who lives in Clacton on Sea, Essex, with husband Dean, 27,  was told at her 20 week scan that she was having a baby girl and the couple were delighted. Emma Mynors woke up from the coma with no memory of giving birth or even that she had been pregnant . Her pregnancy had progressed smoothly to this point, but a few weeks after the scan she developed a cold and a cough. The following morning she started complaining of feeling light headed and was struggling to catch her breath. She . said: ‘I thought it must have been an infection I had picked up from my . son Conrad, who is three. I thought I couldn’t breathe because the baby . must have pushing on my diaphragm. ‘But . as the day progressed I started feeling worse and my breathing was . getting more and more shallow, so my husband called an ambulance to take . me to hospital for a check up. ‘I was only 29 weeks pregnant, so I wanted to check that everything was ok with myself and the baby.’ Doctors quickly diagnosed pneumonia and rushed her to hospital where she fell into a coma. During this time she suffered two strokes and her body swelled so much that doctors had to cut her wedding ring from her finger. She . said: ‘I was terrified, as I didn’t know what it would mean for the . baby. They showed me the x-ray pictures and I could see all this white . fluid covering my lungs. My vision kept blurring and I was feeling . terrible.’ Shortly afterwards, Mrs Mynors fell into a coma, and she remained unconscious for four weeks. Little Amy Mynors was born prematurely at 29 weeks weighing just 3lb 5oz while her mother was in a coma . When the nurses showed her photographs of her tiny daughter lying in her incubator, she had no idea that the baby was hers. She . said: ‘I had remembered that I was married and I had a son, but I had . no idea that I’d been pregnant. The nurses were congratulating me, and I . didn’t know what they were talking about it. ‘They . showed me photographs that they had taken and told me that the baby was . mine. I told them they were mistaken, that I didn’t have a daughter. ‘Then they showed me a scrap book that they had put together during the two weeks since her birth. I just couldn’t believe it.’ The . nurses explained to Mrs Mynors that her daughter had been born . prematurely. They had only realised she was in labour when they examined . her and saw the baby’s head had already started to emerge. Mrs Mynors was allowed to hold her daughter a few days later when she had regained some of her strength. Proud mother Emma Mynors, pictured with Amy and son Conrad, said the birth seemed like a miracle . She said: ‘I really wanted to see my daughter, but it took a while before I bonded with her, as I hadn’t even remembered giving birth to her. At first, it seemed like she belonged to someone else. ‘It took two months before I really felt as though she was mine.’ Mrs Mynors was finally allowed home a month after giving birth. She can now recall some moments of her pregnancy, but she still has no recollection of the birth. She said: ‘I can remember having a bump and I can remember choosing the baby’s name and buying some pink babygros. But I can’t remember giving birth to Amy at all. ‘I did enjoy cuddling her and doing things for her, but it did feel strange for a while. It took me a few months to get used to being a new mum again. ‘It’s amazing to think how Amy came into the world. Even when I was unconscious, my body knew what to do. I’d love to be able to remember giving birth to her, but I’m just grateful that we are both alive and healthy now.’ A spokesman for Colchester General Hospital said: ‘It is extremely unusual for a woman in Emma’s circumstances to deliver normally and without the need for a Caesarean section. ‘We are pleased that she has made a full recovery and send her and her daughter our best wishes for a happy and healthy future.’","Emma Mynors, 23, was rushed to hospital and fell into a coma and suffered two strokes after contracting pneumonia .

"By . James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 15:57 EST, 9 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:57 EST, 9 October 2012 . A Danish man has come forward and claimed he worked with the CIA to infiltrate al-Qaeda as a double agent and provided vital information on radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki that led to the wanted terrorist being killed in an American drone strike. The man, Morten Storm, who has come forward to Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten has said that he was a former Islamic supremacist before the Danish intelligence service PET convinced him to change sides and work for them and eventually the American CIA. Storm has claimed that he became so deeply trusted by Anwar al-Awlaki, that U.S. president Barack Obama knew his name and that it was him who delivered a USB stick the American's used to track al-Awlaki to a convoy which they destroyed in Yemen in September 2011. Morten Storm has come forward to claim that he was an al-Qaeda double agent and helped the CIA track down and kill Anwar al-Awlaki, a top figure in the terror group . In evidence presented to Jyllands-Posten, Storm handed over alleged letters between himself al-Awlaki, collected during the six-years he worked with the Danish and U.S. intelligence services. In addition, Storm played the Danish newspaper, itself the subject of a major controversy concerning cartoons that depicted the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 2005-06, an alleged conversation between himself, PET agents and a lone CIA officer in an upmarket Danish hotel. During the audio recording the CIA agent, identified only as Michael, confirms that Storm worked for the PET and CIA and adds that President Obama is aware of the operation. However, contrary to his assertion, the alleged CIA officer tells Storm during the recorded conversation that al-Awlaki was killed thanks to another mission and not because of the Danes work. Anwar al-Awlaki (left and right) was killed in a drone attack in Yemen in September 2011 - Morten Storm claims it was directly helped by him . Storm told the newspaper that he suffered a troubled childhood, drifting through drugs and into crime. In 1997, the Dane said that he converted in prison to Islam and upon leaving moved to Yemen to study the Koran. He added that in 2000 he married a Yemeni with whom he had a son named Osama with. According to the newspaper report, in 2006, he had a dramatic and unexplained change of heart and was turned double agent by the Danish intelligence service, PET. After five years, Storm claimed to have worked his way to the top of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's inner circle and gained direct access to al-Awlaki. In a statement issued in response to the story, the Danish spy organisation said that as a matter of policy it does not publicly confirm sensitive information about its past, current or future operations, not does it deny incorrect information. 'It should be noted, however, that in no way does PET engage in or support operations aimed at taking civilian lives,' said the statement. 'Consequently, PET has not contributed in connection to the military operation that led to the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen.' US President Barack Obama and Defense Secretary and former head of the CIA| Leon Panetta were allegedly aware of Morten Storm existence claims the Danish man . The CIA did not offer a comment on the story to ABC News, and the White House did not issue a statement either. Coming forward only now, Storm told Jyllands-Posten that he was doing so because he was proud of what he had acheived and wanted recognition for turning his life around. Anwar al-Awlaki died on September 30th, 2011 in a drone attack in Yemen. The New-Mexico born terrorist had become the lead figure for al-Qaeda and the offshoot al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in the years after Osama bin Laden went into enforced hiding. With is fluent command of English, al-Awlaki was responsible for the terrorist groups 'Inspire' online magazine which famously taught readers how 'to make a bomb in your mother's kitchen.' Before his death he was considered responsible for persuading Nigerian terrorist Omar Farouk Abdulmuttalab to hide explosives in his underwear which he tried to use to blow up a Detroit bound plane on December 25th, 2009. Jyllands-Posten was the subject of a major controversy regarding cartoons that depicted the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 2005-06 which sparked violent protests around the world . Anwar al-Awlaki was also responsible for sending to two parcel bombs in October 2010 to addresses in Chicago, intended to incite the United State into launching an attack on Yemen and so involving them in a third expensive and divisive regional conflict. Bruce Riedel, a former CIA officer and contributor to The Daily Beast, said that for the most part, Storm's account seems plausible. 'This story is consistent with how you would infiltrate a terrorist group like al-Qaeda,' Riedel told ABC News. 'You need someone who's a plausible recruit... He's the perfect kind of infiltrator, perfect kind of plant inside of al-Qaeda.' While all of America's technological lead was important to fight terror, Riedel said that there was no substitute for a man on the ground. 'The drones themselves are amazing technical phenomena, but the information that leads the drones to the target is what really matters,' said Riedel. 'In the end it's human beings and the little technical means they can put on somebody to track them down.'","Morten Storm has claimed in an interview with a Danish newspaper that he was recruited by intelligence services to infiltrate al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula as a double agent .

But a farmer's son from Kent has done just that after he started developing unique fruit crisps in his university digs and is now exporting them around the world. Charlie Fermor has now sold more than one million packets of his healthy snack made from apples and pears. Real McCoy: Farmer Charlie Fermor (pictured) dreamt up and tested making apple crisps in his student digs and is now exporting them around the world . Big apple: Recent orders of Charlie's crisps include 100,000 packs to Australia and 40,000 to China . The 25-year-old has taken orders for 100,000 packs from Australia, 40,000 from China and 10,000 from the UAE, with the business set to net him over a million pounds in 2013. Charlie began experimenting with making the fruit crisps - the only ones of their kind in the UK - while studying agricultural business management at university in Reading. He turned his student accommodation into a makeshift lab and bought a dehydrator device to dry out slices of the fruit as he experimented with apples in between lectures. He has so far refused to supply British supermarkets because of . issues with pricing, preferring to build up relationships with smaller . retailers. Simple: The product contains one simple ingredient - the great British apple . Foreign exports: This load of apples is destined for the Chinese market, which has already ordered tens of thousands of packets . 'There was a spare in my university house in my last year . there so thought experimenting in making the crisps would be a good way . of making some use of it.' he said. 'I had some mixed results to begin with but it turned out quite well. 'We have had a lot of interest in the fruit crisps. 'We are making the product ourselves, which is increasingly rare, and that’s something we pride ourselves on. 'There has been a great response to what we have done and we can’t really keep up with demand at the moment. 'We’ll continue to target new markets, that’s what we are doing with . exporting the crisps to other countries as well as getting them into the . schools. Home: Charlie in the family orchard with the raw material and the farm is expecting the fruit crisp enterprise to make over a million pounds next year . From tree to machine: But it all started for Charlie when he started drying apples in his student house . 'But at this stage we are avoiding the supermarkets and looking out for smaller retailers.' After finishing his degree at the University of Reading in 2008, Charlie used his newfound knowledge to develop his brand of crisps at Perry Court Farm, near Ashford, Kent. He visited famous American fruit-growing states such as Oregon and California to learn about processing techniques. Returning to the UK Charlie used some savings to buy his own equipment and set up production in an on-site cold store on the farm using the apples from the orchards. Taking on the world: The crisps, made of apple and pears are proving very popular but will not be sold in supermarkets . That was when the business really started to take off and Charlie hasn’t looked back since. After a trade show six months ago more and more retailers from countries across the globe are now getting in touch with Perry Court Farm about the tasty crisps. The global chain Whole Foods Market snapped up the snacks for their five London shops as well as many other smaller retailers across the country. The tasty crisps, which sell for 50 pence a pack, have proved popular with school tuck shops, as one packet counts as one of your five-a-day.","Charlie Fermor has taken an order of 100,000 packs from Australia alone and hopes to make £1m next year .

'Appalling': Mazen Alotaibi, a 23-year-old Saudi air force sergeant, is accused of raping a boy, 13, in his Las Vegas hotel room on New Year's Eve . Mute: Mazen Alotaibi (right), seen here with his interpreter, said nothing in his court appearance on Friday . Defense attorney Don Chairez conceded . the testimony probably would have met what he termed the minimal . standard to show a felony had been committed, allowing the judge to move . the case to state court. ‘A preliminary hearing is basically a rubber stamp process,’ Chairez said. Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Bill . Kephart asked Alotaibi if he understood what was happening. Standing . with an Arabic translator, Alotaibi responded ‘yes’ in English. Chairez and Saudi Arabia consulate . legal affairs official Abdulqader Mohammed Al Hazza said outside the . courtroom that evidence was still being collected. Negotiations were . under way to resolve the case, Chairez said. ‘Both governments are looking for the . truth,’ Al Hazza told The Associated Press. ‘We just need time to bring . the evidence together to show the truth.’ Chairez said he hopes tests on blood . samples drawn after Alotaibi's arrest will show the aircraft mechanic . was too drunk at the time to give up his constitutional right to have a . lawyer present during questioning. Chairez said police didn't provide . Alotaibi with a translator during questioning, even though Alotaibi told . detectives several times during his 70-minute interview that he didn't . understand what was happening. 'Predator': Mazen Alotaibi, a sergeant in the Saudi Arabian Air Force, was arrested on New Year's Eve for allegedly sexually assaulting a 13-year-old boy in a Las Vegas hotel . Meanwhile, prosecutors Mary Kay . Holthus and James Sweetin added two new child lewdness charges to the . seven charges already pending against Alotaibi. Those counts include kidnapping, sexual assault with a minor, coercion, lewdness with a minor and burglary. Alotaibi could face life in prison if he's convicted of the kidnapping and sex assault charges. Kephart increased bail from . $1.22million to $1.72million based on the new charges, which allege that . Alotaibi kissed the boy during a sex act. Chairez said Alotaibi will plead not guilty to all charges at his arraignment set for February 6 in Clark County District Court. Alotaibi is accused of forcing the . boy into a hotel room where as many as four other Saudi officers smoked . cigarettes or marijuana on the morning before a New Year's Eve fireworks . celebration on the Las Vegas Strip. Police said Alotaibi acknowledged . during questioning that he had sex with the boy, and investigators . collected DNA evidence, a used condom and soiled towel from the bathroom . where the boy said the attack took place. Chairez said the boy splits time . living with divorced parents in California and had been staying at the . Circus-Circus hotel with his father. He told police he was accosted . while on his way to a hotel doughnut shop about 7.30am. Chairez has said the boy wanted marijuana and refused repeated attempts by the Saudi men to get him to leave their hotel room. Crime scene: Police said Alotaibi was staying at Circus Circus hotel on the Strip while on holiday when he sexually assaulted the teenager inside his sixth-floor room . The defense lawyer said that if sex took place, it was consensual. Prosecutors say that even if the boy wanted to have sex, Nevada state law says a child under age 16 cannot give consent. Alotaibi told police he was drinking . Hennessy all night and was drunk when he met the boy. He first denied . allegations, but later admitted to raping the teen after he refused to . have sex with him for money. The . report stated that the 23-year-old Saudi national told investigators . that he had the boy perform oral sex on him 'for just a couple of . seconds,' and then 'accidentally' raped him. McGrath . said Alotaibi produced a Saudi Arabian military identification and said . he was stationed at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland near San Antonio, . Texas. U.S. federal authorities and Saudi military officials were notified, the police lieutenant said. Joint . Base San Antonio-Lackland spokesman Brent Boller told The Associated . Press that records showed Alotaibi is currently stationed at Keesler Air . Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi. Boller said he could not immediately verify if Alotaibi had been at . Lackland, but noted that international military students attend a . Defense Language Institute English Language Center on the base to . improve their English-language skills. The alleged attack took place on the sixth floor of a 15-story hotel tower. Circus Circus has a total of 3,767 guest rooms in three towers and five three-story motor lodge-style buildings dubbed Circus Circus Manor. Far from home: Alotaibi is currently stationed at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi . Saudi Arabia operates under Sharia, or Islamic law, and punishes homosexuality, or sodomy, with sentences of corporal and capital punishment. Saudi law also bans the consumption of alcohol. Those found guilty of drinking liquor could face anything from several weeks to several months in jail.","Las Vegas judge describes December 31 rape allegations as 'appalling'

A passing doctor who overheard grief-stricken parents preparing to say goodbye to their dying son saved the baby's life with a scalpel and a pair of disposable rubber gloves. Devastated Jodi Baker and Brian Willett were told their month-old son Jake was about to die from an infection after his small intestine burst. But a doctor attending another baby on the ward came over and offered to carry out an impromput stomach operation - before warning them: 'I've never done this before'. Do you know the identity of the mystery doctor who saved Jake's life?  If so, please call Mail Online 020 3615 1877 . So grateful: Brian Willett, Jodi Baker, and their son Jake, who is now 16 months old and thriving . He told Jake's distraught father: 'I'm going to try something on your son - it will either save his life or end things.' Carpenter Mr Willett, 30, had no time to hesitate and agreed the doctor should try. The surgeon calmly reached into Jake's incubator, made two tiny cuts in his stomach with a scalpel, and drained the infection, using a glove in each incision to keep the wounds open. Miss Baker, 28, who had fled from her baby's bedside in tears, returned to the ward to see a 2p blue surgical glove in each incision, letting the infection drain out out of her son's body. Before the life-saving surgery Jake had been too ill to be transferred from Medway Hospital in Kent to London for specialist treatment. But the 'miracle' procedure saved him and left him well enough to move to King's College Hospital, London where he underwent a six-hour-long operation. Little fighter: Jake Willett has overcome a catalogue of health problems . Jake, who is now 16 months old, has made a full recovery and only has to return to hospital for check ups. And remarkably, his parents still have no idea who the man who saved their baby's life was. They believe the doctor is a heart surgeon at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital, and was visiting heart patients in Kent at the time. Miss Baker, a dental nurse, from Minster, Kent, said: 'The nurse called us into a room and she said ""Jake is not going to survive"". Tiny: Baby Jake weighed only 2lb 4oz when he was born in September 2011 . On the road to recovery: Jake's father is now planning to raise funds for the charity that helped the family . 'She said we should ask our family to come up to the hospital to say goodbye to Jake and she said she could call the priest for us. 'The nurses were crying too as they had been trying to save Jake. I was so upset I ran out of the room crying and threw up. 'Then Brian came and found me and told me what the doctor had said. 'The doctor had pulled Brian aside and said: ""I'm going to try something on your son, it will either save his life or end things there and then."" 'The doctor said he had never done the procedure before, but Brian told him to try. 'I did not know what to think when I returned to see Jake with two plastic gloves sticking out of his tummy. 'But I was amazed that it had worked. I am so grateful for that doctor for saving Jake's life. 'Jake is an absolute miracle. He's a really happy boy and now he eats everything and is putting on weight.' Jake's life was saved with rubber gloves after his father Brian Willett, left, agreed to let a mystery doctor try . Growing toddler: Jake was discharged from hospital last March and doctors say he will make a full recovery . Jake was born two months premature and weighing just 2lb 4oz after an emergency Caesarean in September 2011. He started gaining weight but at three weeks his stomach started to swell. Doctors at Medway Hospital told Jake's parents he had a condition affecting some premature infants called Necrotising Enterocolitis where the small intestine tissue becomes inflamed and dies. They watched helplessly as his stomach got larger and larger and turned a grey-black colour. On October 20 they were summoned to the hospital at 5am and told by a consultant that Jake had got 95 per cent worse in 24 hours. His small intestine had burst inside him and they were told to call in other relatives to say goodbye as he was unlikely to survive. Jake's only hope was to be transferred to King's College Hospital in London for an emergency operation but doctors said he was too weak to survive the journey. The good Samaritan doctor was treating a baby girl with a heart condition on the same ward when he overheard the grief-stricken parents. At King's College Hospital surgeons removed 70cm of Jake's intestine. He stayed in intensive care for next seven months and battled through a catalogue of complications including 17 blood transfusions and several resuscitations. The baby also contracted MRSA, developed liver failure, enlarged ventricles on the brain, a small hole in his heart, and an infection next to his heart, but still pulled through. He was finally discharged from hospital in March last year and doctors believe he will make a full recovery. Jake's father is now planning to do an endurance test to raise money for the Ronald McDonald House Charity which housed him and Miss Baker in London while their son was in intensive care.

Knut, the 'celebrity polar bear' who became a household name before his tragic death at Berlin Zoo two years ago, is poised to make his comeback from beyond the grave. Photos released this week show the former polar bear in the process of getting stuffed before becoming a resident at Berlin's Natural History Museum next week. Knut was just four year old when he suffered a brain aneurism in his enclosure at Berlin Zoo in March 2011, toppled into the water of his enclosure, and drowned. It was a tragic end for a creature who once captivated the world. Famous forever: A taxidermist is preparing the mold for Knut's remains to be stuffed before it goes on display at Berlin's Natural History Museum. Popular polar-oid: Knut, posing for a photograph in 2009, will be stuffed and shown at the museum until March before getting a permanent display next year . Knut was rejected by his mother at birth and raised by his keeper Thomas Doerflein. Resembling a real-life teddy, the polar cub quickly shot to world wide fame and his fluffy white face even grazed the cover of Vanity Fair. The daily shows of Thomas feeding Knut attracted visitors from as far away as Siberia and he quickly became addicted to the lime light, playing it up for the cameras. However Knut became increasingly dependent on the spotlight and the visitors' attention as he began the weaning off from Mr Doerflein. When Mr Doerflein suddenly died from a heart attack in 2008, Knut became withdrawn and depressed. Celebrity bear: Knut shot to worldwide fame when he greeted the crowds at the Berlin Zoo in 2007 having been hand-reared by his keeper after his mother abandoned him . Papa bear: Knut was 'adopted' by keeper Thomas Doerflein, and struggled when staff tried to wean him off his human 'father' and sunk into depression when Doerflein died in 2008 . Fame fix: Knut loved the public as much as they loved him, something which became an addiction and led to him being branded 'psycho bear' by experts . He would only become animated when cameras were clicking and adoring crowds were waiting at the railings of his enclosure. Even Knut's final moment were captured by visitors. Suffering a brain aneurysm in his enclosure, the adoring crowds saw him stand, stagger and finally topple into the water to meet his watery end. Now, two years after his death, he is ready to make a comeback as taxidermists finish six months of preparations of his cadaver. He will go on display from February 16 until March 15 when he will be archived until a permanent Knut exhibition opens in 2014.","'Celebrity polar bear' Knut, who died in 2011, is to return to fame .

Jackie Powell,49, pictured coming out of her house in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, in August a few days before her arrest . The confidante of Moors murderer Ian Brady is to avoid charges over claims that she failed to tell police about a letter which may have revealed the whereabouts of his only undiscovered victim. Jackie Powell, Brady's mental health advocate for 13 years, had been arrested on suspicion of preventing the lawful burial of Keith Bennett after she told a television documentary that the killer had given her a sealed envelope to pass on to Keith's mother Winnie Johnson when he died. The letter was never found and Winnie Johnson died last August with her heartbreaking search for the body of her 12-year-old son still unresolved. John Dilworth, head of the CPS North West Complex Case Unit, said: 'After careful consideration, we have decided that Ms Powell should not be charged, as it cannot be established that she knew the contents of the letter referred to, that the letter in question existed or what information it might have contained. 'The only evidence of the letter’s existence was in comments given by Ms Powell to an interviewer and she stated only that she believed it may contain information about Keith Bennett.' Mr Dilworth added: 'The only offence that might have been committed by Ms Powell was preventing a lawful and decent burial. 'It is possible to prosecute a person for preventing a lawful burial through a failure to act, but there must be sufficient evidence to prove that the suspect either prevented the burial or intended to do so when they chose not to act.' He said: 'Even if it could be proved that this letter existed, there is no evidence to suggest that Ms Powell ever knew the nature of its contents and there is insufficient evidence to prove that she genuinely believed it contained the information in question. 'As such, it could not be established in court that Ms Powell either prevented Keith Bennett’s burial or intended to do so. 'We understand that this is still a very sensitive matter for the relatives of Keith Bennett. 'We have written to Keith Bennett’s brother to explain our decision and have offered a meeting to discuss this matter.' Allegations: Miss Powell had said in a television documentary that killer Ian Brady, left, had written a letter to Winnie Johnson, mother of one of Brady's victims Keith Bennett, right, whose body has never been found . Keith Bennett is the only one of the five victims of child killers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley whose body was never found. He was snatched by the pair as he walked to his grandmother's house in Longsight, Manchester on June 16 1964. His mother Winnie dedicated the rest of her life to trying to find her son's remains, but died of cancer aged 78 last summer. She had visited Saddleworth Moor, which overlooks Oldham, Greater Manchester, thousands of times and had written numerous letters to Brady pleading for information as to Keith's whereabouts. Jackie Powell had become in embroiled in controversy when she spoke about the existence of a letter that Brady had said might help Mrs Johnson 'find peace' when she took part in Channel 4 documentary Endgames of a Psychopath last year. Tragic: Keith Bennett's mother Winnie Johnson, pictured, never gave up the search for her son's missing body, but died last August without knowing his whereabouts . Police raided her South Wales home but were unable to find the letter. She was arrested last August. Martin Bottomley, head of investigative review in Greater Manchester Police’s major and cold case crime unit, said: 'As soon as we were made aware of the existence of this alleged letter, we made exhaustive attempts to obtain it to establish whether or not its contents would assist us in finding Keith’s body. 'That resulted in the warrants we carried out in the South Wales area and at Ashworth Hospital in August 2012. 'However, despite seizing numerous documents and a search of Brady’s cell, no such letter has been recovered. 'That in itself does not prove or disprove the letter’s existence. It might have been destroyed, it might be hidden elsewhere, it may be in someone else’s possession, or it may simply never have existed in the first place and this has been yet more mind games by Brady. No clues: Police dogs digging during the search for victims' bodies on Saddleworth Moor in 1985 . Continued hunt: Forensics officers from Greater Manchester Police searching for the body of Keith Bennett, whose body was never found after he was killed by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley . 'What I can say for certain is that we have not recovered the letter itself nor any credible information that would help us find Keith.' Mr Bottomley added: 'As a result, we have liaised with the Crown Prosecution Service who have concluded there is no realistic prospect of any criminal conviction and therefore no further action will be taken against the woman we arrested. 'I do want to make this point however: this whole episode about the letter came at a time when Winnie was sadly in her final days. 'Winnie and the rest of her family have suffered unimaginable torment. Jailed: Brady's accomplice Myra Hindley died while still in prison in 2002 aged 60. She confessed that the pair had killed Keith Bennett in 1987 . 'Keith still has surviving relatives who deserve to know the truth and Greater Manchester Police will continue to act on any credible evidence to bring this torment to an end.' The other victims of Brady and Hindley were Pauline Reade, 16, who disappeared on her way to a disco on July 12 1963; John Kilbride, 12, who was snatched in November the same year; Lesley Ann Downey, 10, who was lured away from a funfair on Boxing Day 1964, and Edward Evans, 17, who was axed to death in October 1965. Brady was jailed for life at Chester Assizes in 1966 for the murders of John Kilbride, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans. Hindley was convicted of killing Lesley Ann and Edward and shielding Brady after John’s murder, and jailed for life. In 1987 the pair finally admitted killing Keith and Pauline. Both were taken back to Saddleworth Moor to help police find the remains of their victims but only Pauline’s body was found. Brady claimed he could not remember where he had buried the boy. In 2009, police said a covert search operation on the moor which used a wealth of scientific experts had also failed to discover any trace of Keith. Brady was due to go before a mental health tribunal last year, but it was delayed after he suffered a seizure. The tribunal was to consider his application to be transferred to a prison and be allowed to die. He has been tube-fed since refusing food 12 years ago. The re-listed hearing is due to take place in Manchester in June.","Jackie Powell was Brady's mental health advocate for 13 years .

Wounded: John Wood shows off his battle wounds after he fought off four would-be muggers who stabbed him with a screwdriver in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire . A pub landlord managed to fight off four would-be muggers who attacked him as he left a fish and chip shop - while holding his dinner in one hand. John Wood, 37, was even stabbed in the stomach with a sharpened screwdriver as he bravely fought off the gang, but amazingly his fish supper still made it home in one piece. Mr Wood, a pub landlord from Cambridgeshire, put martial arts training from when he was a teenager into good use to fend off his attackers. He said: 'I only did aikido for a couple of years but it all comes back to you very quickly when you need it most. 'The men stopped me and demanded my phone and wallet. I told them that if they wanted it they'd have to come and get it. 'They all came at me at once, I kicked two of them in the leg. 'I used to do a little bit of aikido and I remembered to go for the knees. They fell to the floor and couldn't get up. 'As I did that another clipped me in the face. 'I turned around and hit him and he fell. I turned around again and the other one came at me with what I thought was a knife. 'He just lunged and I felt a sharp twang in my side. I grabbed his hands so he couldn't bring it out and stab again. 'I pulled it out myself, disarmed him and then hit him. I think he was knocked out. 'Then I just got in my car and left, I didn't even drop the chips.' Mr Wood, who owns the Marshland Arms, in Marshland St James close to Wisbech where the attack happened, coolly drove back to fiance Claire Upton's house with their food. Brave: Pub landlord Mr Wood, pictured with his fiancee Claire Upton, still managed to keep hold of his fish supper despite being attacked by four men . Scene: The incident happened shortly after Mr Wood left Frank's Fish & Chip shop in Wisbech . When his wound wouldn't stop bleeding, Mr Wood went to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn several hours later where he needed 15 internal and three external stitches. Medics believe that his injuries were inflicted with a sharpened screwdriver. Tough: Mr Wood shows his bruised knuckles outside his pub, The Marshland Arms . Mr Wood said: 'The screwdriver deflected off my ribs apparently, it was a millimetre away from going into my lung. If it had gone through that it would have hit my liver, I was very lucky. 'If it had been a couple of inches over it could have been me lying in the alleyway. 'I dread to think what would have happened if it was somebody else in that situation. 'My fiancee was going to go for the fish and chips but I said it was too dangerous. 'I would never have forgiven myself if I had let her go and she'd been attacked.' According to fiancee Claire, Mr Wood looked as though nothing had happened when he returned to the house. She said: 'It was a crazy moment when he walked in. 'His face was a bit red where he had been hit and so we were looking for a plaster, then we served the chips. 'John had lost his appetite but the pie he got is still in the fridge. 'We haven't had the heart to throw it out seeing as he worked so hard for it!'

In a question open to whoever pressed their buzzer first, he asked: “The liberties of England and the Protestant religion I will maintain.” Which royal figure made that claim when he landed at Brixham, in Devon, in 1688?” A rival contestant buzzed before Paxman had finished speaking and wrongly answered: ‘Elizabeth I’.

'Bully': Jeremy Paxman raised an eyebrow and declared 'It's only about 600 years out' when a UCL student got a history question wrong . But the presenter reserved his derision for Mr Tyszczuk Smith, who came in quickly afterwards and suggested William I instead. Looking incredulous, Paxman exclaimed: ‘No! William I? No I’m sorry that’s the wrong answer and you know it’s very wrong.’ Raising his eyebrows, he added: ‘It’s only out by about 600 years or so. Anyway no, it’s William of Orange of course, William III.’ Mr Tyszczuk Smith seemed shaken by the presenter’s reaction, putting his hand nervously to his face and shaking his head. He said: ‘Sorry, sorry, no I’m sorry,’ and kept his head lowered for much of the remainder of the game. Writing on Twitter, one viewer said: ‘Tyszczuk Smith looks like he’s on the verge of crying. Paxman you meany!’ Jeremy Paxman faced a Twitter tirade following the savaging of the shy student . The episode prompted a storm of other online comments, and 44 complaints to the BBC. But at the family home in Cambridge yesterday, the student’s mother Renata Tyszczuk, 45, defended Paxman and said viewers had overreacted. She said: ‘I think Paxman is always a little tough with the contestants. But I think it is all in good spirit.  'It is a challenge after all. ‘I don’t think he’s a bully. Tom wanted to do well and perhaps that showed more when he got things wrong rather than right. 'I met Mr Paxman and found him very pleasant. Tom’s very clever and we are very proud. Embarrassed: Tom kept his head down for most of the game after he experienced Jeremy Paxman's abrasive manner . 'He is a shy boy so I think at times he was a little uncomfortable, but that is just his way. He was very excited to take part and we think he did very well.’ Despite Mr Tyszczuk Smith’s mistake, the UCL team eventually beat Bangor by 190 points to 125 in the episode, watched by 2.89million. A BBC spokesman said:  ‘University Challenge is a tense and fast-paced competition, and Jeremy Paxman’s acerbic remarks have long been part of the appeal. 'Viewers and contestants alike know what to expect from the host.’","Student Tom Tyszczuk Smith got the brunt of Paxman's abrasive tone .

It is a dream for any golf fanatic: your own nine-hole course, laid out over almost 25 acres, with a clubhouse and apartment thrown in. Now the dream could come true at The Waterbridge Golf Course, near Crediton in Devon, which is on the market. Strangely, the couple who bought the complex 12 years ago were not golf nuts. Gary Wren, 56, played only when the sun came out and his wife Angela, 52, had only ever tried pitch and putt. Done to a tee: The Waterbridge Golf Course clubhouse with the two flats above is going on sale for £975,000 . They bought the club as another adventure in their property-owning career. At the time, the couple owned four houses and four flats, which they managed as rentals but were looking for something less stressful. Running a small country golf club, they felt, would suit them to a tee – despite their complete lack of experience. Angela recalls: ‘Gary said to me, “We could afford to buy that”. We’d been wondering what to do next and it sounded a good idea.’ In 2001, the couple bought the club for £195,000 and started learning all about golf course management. They quickly found that keeping the course in pristine condition was tougher than it looked. Gary, used to trimming a suburban lawn, found himself mowing the greens almost daily and the rest of the course weekly during the spring and summer. Loving and leaving: Gary and Angela, right, with son Chris, left, are ready to hand over their precious golf club to the next enthusiast . ‘It was much more like hard work than I was expecting,’ he says. With just a mobile home on site, the family continued living in their Thirties bungalow in Exeter, and the long working days – starting at 7am and lasting until nightfall, seven days a week – soon took their toll. Once planning permission was granted for a proper clubhouse with a three-bedroom apartment above, they decided to sell up in Exeter and move on to the course. In January 2003, they started building their new home. It took four months to complete the New England-style property, rendered in white and surrounded by a veranda. The mansard windows on the first floor offer marvellous views across the course and farmland beyond. In 2006, they extended, adding a double garage and self-contained one-bedroom flat for their son Chris, 32, who helps run the business. The work cost about £200,000, and today the property measures 3,862  sq ft. The couple’s other son, Nicholas, 29, who is in the building industry, also lives with them. Although they love their home, Gary and Angela have long harboured an ambition to renovate a farmhouse in France and they have decided to sell the course for £975,000 so they can head off on another adventure. The golf club was first put on the market last May at £1.45 million – but the couple realised this was unrealistic in such a stagnant property market. The annual turnover is about £100,000 and running costs, excluding staff, are about £38,000. A new owner could either continue running the complex as a business or opt to keep it to themselves to work on their handicap in privacy.

A mother who left her six-month-old child at home while she was so drunk she fell over and tipped her 18-month-old toddler out of his pram has been spared jail. Samantha Snow, 33, toppled over in St Austell, Cornwall, as she went to buy more alcohol on New Year's Eve. People went to help her and realising she was drunk contacted police. She admitted to officers that her daughter was home alone, a court heard. Police went to Snow's home and found the . child lying on her back in the sitting room in a soaking wet nappy. They also found empty bottles of alcohol and medication in the house. A witness said Snow was ‘clearly heavily in drink’ when she fell and said her son was wet, crying and distressed when he was found face down on the ground. Snow shouted ‘my baby, my baby’ as the witness stepped in to help and police were called. Snow admitted assaulting, ill treating or neglecting two children in a manner likely to cause them unnecessary suffering or injury to their health at Bodmin Magistrates' Court yesterday. In a statement read to the court, Snow’s aunt said she had suffered with depression since the death of her mother and had even hidden bottles of alcohol under her baby’s cot mattress. Defence Snow, Paul Burley said: 'This was not a case of cruelty - it was a one off. This was an isolated incident, the very low point of what was going on. It is not something the children were open to constantly.' Snow was handed a 26-week suspended jail sentence and ordered to pay £165 in costs. Magistrate Geoff Cole said: 'This is obviously an extremely serious offence against two young children who were dependent on their mother looking after them.' Snow was given a suspended 26-week jail sentence and ordered to pay £165 costs at Bodmin Magistrates' Court after admitting assault and ill-treating her children .","Samantha Snow, 33, was so drunk she fell over in street .

The City of Mayfield is now moving to get the animals evicted from the property after a barrage of complaints. Richard Travis moved to the area in 2006 and has for years been fighting for the cats to be removed, saying his friends won't visit him because they're so frightened.

David Cameron, pictured today at Prime Minister's Questions, has given interviews to Asian media ahead of leading a business trip to India next week . David Cameron has pledged there will be  ‘no limit’ to the number of students from India who can study in the UK and then stay on to find work. The Prime Minister wants to develop a new ‘special relationship’ with the emerging superpower and said potential students simply needed ‘a basic English qualification and a place at a British university’. Mr Cameron’s change of heart comes as he begins a campaign to win over voters of Indian origin. He was stung by evidence from Tory pollsters showing that being non-white is the single biggest reason why people don’t vote Tory – far outweighing income and social class – even though many Asians share Conservative values. He will reinforce his message with a trip to India next week billed as the biggest trade trip ever organised by Downing Street. In interviews with Asian television stations in the UK yesterday, Mr Cameron revealed his love of cricket and hot curries and sought to convince Asian voters that the Tories share their values of family and hard work. But he also went out of his way to encourage Indians to come to the UK – an offer that contrasts with years of Tory rhetoric about restricting immigration. He said: ‘There is no limit on the number of  students who can come from India to study at British universities, no limit at all. All you need is a basic English qualification and a place at a  British university. ‘What’s more, after you’ve left a British university, if you can get a graduate-level job there is no limit to the amount of people who can stay and work, or the time that they can stay at work.’ Existing Home Office rules mean that any  student who obtains a graduate-level job, defined as a post with a salary of at least £20,000, can stay in the UK. But some Tories criticised Business Secretary Vince Cable after a previous trip to India in 2010 when he complained that restrictions on Indian immigrants were too tight. Mr Cameron admitted last night that he had failed to ‘properly communicate’ the policy to Indians. He added: ‘Now we need to take that . message out to talented young people in India and say if you want to . make that choice, Britain will be incredibly welcoming. Mr Cameron said there is no limit to the number of people who can stay and work after attending a British university if they get a graduate-level job . 'We have 40,000 Indian students in Britain, I’m really proud of that.’ The Prime Minister is set to make a speech on race relations in the next two months in which he will seek to overturn the view that the Tories are a racist party which has lingered since the days of Enoch Powell. Mr Cameron is also considering whether to make an apology for the worst aspects of the British Empire. On a trip to Pakistan in 2011, he conceded that Britain was ‘responsible’ for many of the world’s problems including the divisions over Kashmir. Yesterday he again referred to that ‘history’ but declined to intervene in talks between India and Pakistan. Others are encouraging him to visit Srebrenica, where 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were slaughtered in 1995, to help the Tories connect with Muslims in the UK.","David Cameron has given interviews to Asian media ahead of leading a business delegation to India next week .

Guilty: Frederick Goings, pictured, has been convicted in the slaying . A jury has convicted a Chicago attorney of murdering former NBA center Eddy Curry's ex-girlfriend and infant daughter four years ago. Frederick Goings showed no reaction when the jury's guilty verdict was read out on Tuesday in the January 2009 shooting deaths of Nova Henry, 24, and her and Curry's 10-month-old daughter, Ava. Goings represented Henry in a child custody case against the former Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks and Miami Heat center, and was also romantically involved with her. Prosecutors say Henry tried to end her relationship with Goings and moved out with her and Curry's two children. They say Goings shot Henry in her home while she was holding her baby daughter. Her son, Noah, who was then three years old, witnessed the shocking slaying but wasn't harmed. Curry, who now plays in China, didn't testify in Goings ' trial. Henry's mother, Yolan Henry, expressed relief after the hearing, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. 'I'm feeling elated. I can breathe,' she said. 'I feel justice has been served.' Yolan Henry testified that she found little Noah sitting among the bodies of his sister and mother, and that he told her, 'Fredrick did it.' Attorneys for Goings maintained that he was innocent and said there was no physical evidence linking him to the killings.

Pain: Nova Henry's father Keith Henry holds a family photo of his daughter with daughter Ava and son Noah . Goings had represented Henry in a 2006 paternity case involving Curry, and the two had later begun dating but Henry tried to end their relationship before the murder. Yolan Henry made the horrific discovery hours after the shooting while visiting Henry's home with her boyfriend, Reginald Carter. Carter testified on February 5 that Noah was sound asleep, and both his hands and his feet were covered in dried blood. Goings was arrested at a Comfort Inn in Indiana shortly after the bodies were found. In his car, police found a bullet that matched the gun used to kill Nova Henry and and Ava Curry-Henry, the Tribune reported.

A clifftop house that was bought at auction without being seen or surveyed by the buyer has started to collapse after the latest in a series of devastating landslides. Ridgemont House, which lies just yards from the edge of Oddicombe Cliffs in Torquay, Devon, has now begun to crumble and sag. It made the news three years ago when a landslide hit it just a week after the six-bedroom property had been sold at auction to retired police officer Sue Diamond for £154,000. Scroll down for video . On the edge of obliteration: Ridgemont House lies yards from the clifftop in Torquay and has started to sag and crumble . Property crash: Ridgemont House (circled) was sold at auction to a retired police officer who had neither viewed it nor arranged a survey of the property . Legal disputes are still thought to be ongoing and the house is fenced off.  Now, it is on the verge of total obliteration after the most recent landslide caused a large portion of it to collapse. Miss Diamond, who is disabled, made a telephone bid of £154,500 for the house in February 2010, without viewing it or having a survey done.  Eight days later, a landslide left the 1930s house just 50 yards from a drop into the sea, and a lengthy legal battle began between her and the builder who sold it to her, Matthew Taylor. At the time Miss Diamond, who suffers from dyslexia, impaired hearing and restricted mobility, said the house was uninhabitable and worth only £3,500. The auction particulars had warned buyers that the house was severely structurally damaged and might be beyond economic repair, and a judge in 2010 ordered Miss Diamond to pay Mr Taylor what she owed. Mr Taylor has a legal charge for the money, plus eight per cent interest annually, over Miss Diamond's home in Chiswick, West London, which she says is worth over £1million. Explaining her decision to buy the house in Torquay, she said her Chiswick home had been flooded by burst pipes and she thought the ground floor of the seaside property would be ideal for a disabled person. Just before the most recent landslide in Torquay, a man who lives near the clifftop house explained why he was selling up. Going, going: Ridgemont House looks like it won't last much longer following the latest incident in the three-year story of a collapsing dream home . Before the clifftop began crumbling into the sea, Ridgemont House was an attractive 1930s-built seaside residence of grand proportions . Les Watson, 68, whose neighbouring property is for sale, said: 'We're selling up because it is too big for us and we're going to downsize in Torquay. 'We have lived here nine years and love it here but it is too much for us to manage. 'So many people have come to view it.  Our neighbours moved here earlier this year so they weren't put off by the risk of a landslide. I don't think it will go for years.' Another neighbour, a 40-year-old woman who didn't want to be named, said she has been renting her house since March. She said: 'We came here because of the location and the house: it's got a great sea view. 'We didn't know anything about the landslide, we found out from neighbours.  There are concerns about Ridgemont House being derelict because it encourages people. 'It's a bit of a tourist attraction at weekends: lots of kids come and nose around the house. 'We are all concerned about potential increased burglary, and we've had to call the police a couple of times because of kids hanging around acting suspiciously. 'The possibility of a major landslide worries me slightly.  I wouldn't buy this place because of the risk. It's quite a way from the edge, but if there's another one or two landslides these houses will be next to go.' Doomed: The property (seen here in 2010) was sold to Miss Diamond by a builder, Matthew Taylor, who has been engaged in a legal battle with her ever since the house's garden fell down the cliff a week after she bought it .","Ridgemont House was bought at auction by Sue Diamond without her viewing or having a survey done on the house .

The Professional Footballers' Association have slated the 'inadequate' fine imposed by UEFA on Serbia for racist abuse and violence towards England Under 21 players. UEFA's independent control and disciplinary panel fined the Serbian FA just £65,000 - a remarkable £15,000 less than Denmark striker Nicklas Bendtner was forced to pay for showing branded boxers as part of a goal celebration - for their part in the ugly post-match scenes. In a statement issued today, the PFA said they were looking to UEFA to send a strong message to the football community that racism would not be tolerated in the game, but were left disappointed by the sanctions. Abuse: Danny Rose claimed to have been subjected to monkey chants . Anger: Rose reacts to the racist taunts . The statement said: 'The PFA has . expressed its dismay at the totally inadequate fine levied by UEFA . against the Serbian FA after the disgraceful scenes of racism and . violence during the recent Under 21 match with England. 'Everybody has been looking to the . Confederation to send out a strong message as a deterrent to ensure that . behaviour such as this is eradicated from our game.  Unfortunately once . more a disappointing penalty has been imposed.' Chief executive Gordon Taylor was . outraged by the perceived leniency of the panel's decision, and expressed his disappointment that England . players Tom Ince and Steven Caulker were banned for their part. Caulker was banned for two games, and Ince is set to miss one match through suspension. He said: 'This is a totally inadequate fine which sends a very poor message out . to the football world.  I intend to write to Michel Platini expressing . our dissatisfaction and calling for stronger action.  In addition, we . will strongly support the FA in their appeal against the decision to . charge Steven Caulker and Thomas Ince. Platini is considering an appeal to increase the one-match spectator ban and 80,000 euro fine imposed on Serbia. Too lenient? Michel Platini could lodge an appeal . UEFA itself can appeal to increase . the severity of the punishment. UEFA sources said Platini has taken note . of the sanction and will make a final decision once he has read the . full file on his return from Japan next week. The European body’s prosecuting inspector had proposed more 'drastic' measures, the Serbian federation has admitted. The PFA are not alone in their incredulity after the relatively lax punishment. Liverpool manager Brandan Rodgers today said: 'I saw it yesterday and felt for all the England players and staff who were there. It is bitterly disappointing to say the least. 'The sanction is not too dissimilar to someone showing a sponsor on a pair of pants. I thought it was poor really. But it is up to them.' West Ham manager Sam Allardyce added: 'To see the English players punished as well is a little difficult to take. Everybody was looking to see what UEFA might do and I think what they have done is try to just get this one over with as quick as they can and not dealt with it severely enough. Saying his piece: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers expressed his disappointment at UEFA's decision . 'We should ask UEFA, what are your policies on racism? Let’s get those policies and see if they are good enough to deal with racism. If I was Nicklas Bendtner I’d ask for my fine back.' QPR defender Anton Ferdinand, the . target of racial abuse by John Terry last year, also contrasted the sanction . against Serbia with the 100,000 euro and one-match ban handed to former . Arsenal striker Bendtner for displaying a betting firm’s logo on . his underpants during Euro 2012. Ferdinand tweeted: 'Wow UEFA ain’t serious with their punishment... So showin a sponsor is worst than racism and fighting!' His brother Rio added: 'Uefa are not . serious at all on racism. Fines do not work at all. They have zero . impact on federations/clubs/fans/players #fact. 'Uefa need to talk to this . generation.....they don’t seem to be up to date on this issue?? Harsh . punishments needed as a deterrent #simple.' The Football Association also . criticised the sanction and will appeal against two-match and one-match . bans for Steven Caulker and Tom Ince respectively. Ugly: The end of England U21's win over Serbia was marred by clashes . Flashpoint: England striker Marvin Sordell in the tunnel . FA general secretary Alex Horne said: . “We are disappointed with the sanctions levied by UEFA with regards to . the racist behaviour displayed towards England’s players. 'Let’s be clear, racism is . unacceptable in any form, and should play no part in football. The . scenes were deplorable and we do not believe the sanction sends a strong . enough message.' The FA reported the racist abuse to UEFA plus a number of other incidents. Full-back Danny Rose, who was . dismissed after the final whistle for kicking the ball away in anger, . complained he had been subjected to monkey chants throughout the match . and as he left the pitch.

Digging a hole: Gert-Rudolph Flick and his wife Corinne drew up the plans for an underground extension at their £30m London home . A multi-millionaire German-born industrialist has seen off opposition from neighbours to win approval for a lavish two-storey underground extension at his £30 million London home. Daimler-Benz heir Gert-Rudolph 'Muck' Flick, 68, and his third wife, sweet heiress Corinne, 46, drew up the plans, which include a 50 ft swimming pool, a steam room, and two separate store rooms for their winter and summer clothes. Planning chiefs gave the proposals, which also feature a cinema, a beauty and treatment room and a gym, the go ahead despite an outcry from neighbours - led by cellist Julian Lloyd Webber. Development of the Georgian property, near Onslow Square in South Kensington, west London, will involve a 30ft hole being dug and partial demolition of the house. The proposals were approved last night by Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council's planning committee, which had been sent letters by 55 residents opposed to the plans. The area is also home to Queen Noor of Jordan, jeweller John Asprey and JCB chairman Sir Anthony Bamford. Opponents raised concern about the noise and disruption, with building work expected to last three years, and have vowed to continue their fight. Mr Lloyd Webber, who has lived in the district his whole life and is president of the Onslow Square neighbourhood association, told the Evening Standard: 'There will be massive disruption and havoc in the whole area for goodness knows how long. 'The council should protect its residents but if it can grant permission for this, one of the oldest houses in that area of London, it seems nothing is sacred.' Another neighbour, George Barbour, . labelled the plans 'tasteless' and 'environmentally hazardous', and . added: 'I'm appalled by the council's decision - but not surprised, as . it's always riding roughshod over residents' views.' Planning . officers concluded that the development would be 'visually discreet' and would 'preserve the character and appearance' of the Thurloe and . Smith's Conservation Area. Development: The plans for a two-storey basement extension include a 50 ft swimming pool . They added that the conditions . imposed by councillors would 'adequately control and mitigate the . impacts of the construction process'. Mr . Flick bought the property into 1986. It has seven bedrooms and six . bathrooms as well as a 55 ft gallery, known as the Red Room, which has . housed his impressive art collection, including A View Of Fireworks Over . Venice by Canaletto. The . house was originally two properties, one of which was owned by Grand Met . founder Sir Maxwell Joseph, and the other by Lady Annabel Goldsmith.

Sue Diamond, who is disabled, made a telephone bid of £154,500 for the house in Torquay in February 2010, without viewing it or having a survey done. But just eight days after the auction, a landslide left the 1930s house just 50 yards from a drop into the sea, and signalled the started of a lengthy legal battle.

A Chinese dog-owner is suing an animal clinic after his £90,000 Tibetan Mastiff died while undergoing a facelift to make it more attractive to breeders. The owner, identified only as Mr Yu, paid 1,000 yuan (£140) for his pet to have plastic surgery at a Beijing animal hospital last November. It died on the operating table 20 minutes into treatment. Mr Yu later discovered that the dog had died of a heart attack after complications with the anaesthetic. He is now suing the hospital for 880,000 yuan (£90,000), the amount he claims to have paid for the Tibetan Mastiff which is the world's most expensive breed of dog. World's most expensive breed: A red Tibetan Mastiff called Big Splash or Hong Dong was bought by a Chinese coal baron for £945,000 in 2011 . Breeding Tibetan Mastiffs has become a lucrative business in China after the animals became a sought-after status symbol. Mr Yu, who runs a breeding centre in Beijing, told the Global Times: 'If my dog looks better, female dog owners will pay a higher price when they want to mate their dog with mine.' The breed became the world's most expensive in 2011 after a Chinese coal baron spent nearly £1million - £945,000 - on a Tibetan Mastiff called Big Splash or Hong Dong in Chinese. Millionaire dog breeder Li Yongfu told . China's official news agency Xinhua: 'If you are rich, you can easily . buy a big house or a Lamborghini. They live for up to 14 years and have fewer genetic health problems than many breeds. The heaviest Tibetan Mastiff weighed in at more than 20 stone. They are fed an organic . diet of tripe, boiled fish heads, powdered egg shells, code liver oil . and raw bones to help them clean their teeth. Marco . Polo supposedly encountered Tibetan Mastiffs in the 13th century, . describing them as ‘tall as a donkey with a voice as powerful as that of . a lion’. There are only around 300 Tibetan Mastiffs in the UK. They can only have one litter a year. In the UK Tibetan Mastiffs cost between £850 and £1,000 for a puppy. An English Bulldog sells for around £2,000. It is thought the Tibetan Mastiff genetically diverged from the wolf 58,000 years ago. 'But owning a pure-bred mastiff is quite another thing. It's solid evidence of your wealth, power and taste, and makes a most presentable gift for your clients and partners. And the demand for Tibetan Mastiffs doesn't appear to be waning with a male called Emperor goign on the market for a staggering 10 million Yuan - £1million - last year. The average price being asked for one of the dogs last year was around 1 million Yuan (£100,000). The Tibetan Mastiff is an ancient breed of dog, originating from the nomadic cultures of Central Asia. It has become a status symbol in China because they are thought to be holy animals, blessing their owners' health and security. Tibetans believe the dogs have the souls of monks and nuns who were not good enough to be reincarnated as humans or into Shambhala, the heavenly realm. As well as costing a fortune to buy, Tibetan Mastiffs are also incredibly expensive to keep. Owners need a large house as the breed have been known to weigh as much as 286lb, or more than 20 stone – the same as a sizeable rugby player. However the typical weight for a fully grown Tibetan Mastiff is around 13 stone. Their diet consists of chicken and beef spiced up with Chinese delicacies such as sea cucumber and abalone. Owners of the breed have included Queen Victoria, King George IV and  Genghis Khan – who supposedly took 30,000 of the dogs with his army in his bid to conquer Western Europe. There are now only around 300 Tibetan mastiffs in the UK, and puppies sell for a more reasonable £1,000. Woman's best friend: a Tibetan mastiff with its owner.

Dilapidated, dirty, mouldy, strewn with rubble and with boarded-up windows, these frightening shacks are still selling for an amazing half a million dollars - or more. All of the properties are in the wealthy and exclusive San Francisco Bay area of California, which may go some way to explaining the astoundingly high price, despite a crash in property values in the region as a result of a real estate crash that began in 2009. They were collected on Pinterest by blogger Xin Lu, who writes for Wise Bread, a site that gives tips on finance and living frugally, who also lives in the area. Dilapidated and foreboding shacks like this are selling for half a million dollars or more in San Francisco . Although this is just the garage of the $600,000 property in Berkeley, the actual house is more than a bit run-down too . Many of the for-sale fixer-uppers are so foreboding they look like they would suit a (very rich) serial killer. Handily, they may already have the power tools necessary to refurbish the site. One shack, listed at $1.35million, is in Los Gatos and comes with more than three acres, which probably explains the price. Mrs Lu compared it to the hotel featured in cult horror The Shining, featuring Jack Nicholson as a writer sent murderously insane by the supernatural Overlook Hotel. 'The listing is full of creepy pictures at odd angles,' she wrote. 'And the address? 19366 Overlook Road. Welcome to The Overlook! All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.' This Albany shack was sold for $500,000. The listing describes it as 'frankly uninhabitable' This $1.35million Los Gatos shack (left) comes with more than three acres. A bargain, if buyers can bring themselves to approach the foreboding structure. The listing for the $505,000 Brisbane shack (right) recommends: 'Bring a contractor with you' Welcome home: The shack in Los Gatos is seen lined with tossed tree stumps with mulch paving the way to the front door . View: The shack in Los Gatos comes with more than three acres, seen here overlooking its backyard which earns its high value thanks to its view overlooking the ocean . Fixer upper: The yard could easily be cleared out and redesigned to accommodate visual access to its view said to overlook water .

And somewhere screams won't carry. It's yours for $1.8million. Why so much? Mrs Lu has the answer: 'There is an explanation: According to the listing, the lot is one mile from the planned new Apple headquarters.' The location of one shack, which boasts panoramic views of the picturesque San Francisco Bay, is so desirable the sellers were incredibly frank about its condition in their listing. It said: 'Frankly uninhabitable, with two bedrooms and a bath but no kitchen.' It was snapped up for a cool $500,000 earlier this year. Nearly $2million for a house like this?

After picking up the wallet and jewellery, he left via the same route - but dropped his mobile, as well as the tool he used to enter the house. When police arrived they found the phone ringing, with the name 'Babe' coming up on the screen, Grimsby Crown Court heard. Minutes later they were confronted by Barker's girlfriend, Jessica Hines, claiming her house was on fire and asking for help. 'She wanted the officers to come away from the house,' prosecutor Gordon Stables said. 'This was a clumsy attempt to distract the police so the defendant could retrieve his phone.'

A teenage career criminal who posed as a door-to-door charity fundraiser because he got a 'buzz' out of seeing the faces of the people he was about to con was jailed today. Wayne Kinvig, 18, from Burnley, went door-to-door pretending to collect sponsorship money for his 'sick little brother' only to spend the money on cannabis and items for his unborn son. He admitted eight counts of fraud by false representation and was jailed for eight months at Burnley Crown Court after being caught when he knocked on a policewoman's door. Victims - some as old as 77 - were so moved by his lies about his brother suffering from cerebral palsy they gave him money from their pensions. Kinvig would knock on doors armed with a clipboard and a sponsor sheet attached. He also carried information about Gift Aid which enables charities to reclaim tax on donations in an attempt to appear official. Such was his confidence that he even targeted a house on the way home from an appointment with probation officers at a Youth Offending Team who were trying to tackle his behaviour. The teenager told one victim that money was needed to pay for stem cell treatment, while telling a father of a disabled child that he was raising money for the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme. His luck ran out when he called at the home of a Police Community Support Officer who recognised him from a mugshot she had seen back at the station. The court heard how the thefts gave Kinvig a 'buzz' because it meant he could see the faces of the people he was about to con out of cash. The teenager started his criminal career in July 2009 and has 39 offences on his record - 25 of which are for theft. Last July Kinvig first struck at the home of a 68-year-old woman claiming he was collecting money for a friend’s brother who was suffering from stem cell disorder. She handed over £4 to Kinvig. The court heard how Kinvig, pictured here on Facebook, would pretend to be collecting . sponsorship money for his 'sick little brother' only to spend the money . on cannabis and items for his unborn son . Kinvig, pictured here on Facebook, started his fake charity work last July and he became so confident that  even targeted a house . on the way home from an appointment with his probation officers . He was arrested after a probation officer spotted Kinvig collecting money at the address. But while on bail Kinvig embarked on his fraud again by turning up at the home of a man saying he had raised £34,000 for a cerebral palsy charity on a Duke of Edinburgh Award and needed £5,000 more. The victim in his 20s handed over £2.50 and added his address to a form Kinvig was carrying on his clipboard. One female pensioner handed over £1 when Kinvig knocked at her door, another handed over £2 when he asked for donations for a sponsored walk. A man of 26 pledged £10 because he thought it was to help a local boy, but did not hand the money over up front. A woman aged 77 gave him £6 after he said he was doing a sponsored boxing event for cerebral palsy and a 45-year-old woman donated £5. Burnley Crown Court heard how Kinvig (pictured here on Facebook) got a 'buzz' out of seeing the faces of those he was about to con out of money and used a clipboard and official charity papers to legitimise his requests . The teenager then turned up at the home of Mark Lumsden in Burnley on the same day and told him money was needed for pay for stem cell treatment.

A . woman aged 77 gave him £6 after he said he was doing a sponsored boxing . event for cerebral palsy and a 45-year-old woman donated £5. Julian Goode, prosecuting said: 'Mr Lumsden has a disabled son, who at one stage was thought to be suffering from cerebral palsy, and wanted to help. 'He put his name and address down on the sponsor sheet and agreed to donate £5. He realised he didn’t have the correct money on him and asked if the defendant would come back the following day. 'Around the same time the following day, the defendant again knocked on the front door of Mr Lumsden, who had had every intention of donating money, but had not had the opportunity to withdraw cash. To avoid embarrassment, he did not open the door. The defendant was persistent and continued knocking. No money was provided.' Kinvig was found out when he arrived at the home of PCSO Tracy Parkes and she became suspicious when he unable to produce any official ID. Mr Goode said: 'She was off duty. Her son answered the door.

But passing sentence the judge Mr Recorder Robert Crawford told Kinvig: 'What you did was very spiteful, very mean and very well organised and such offences make people less likely to give to charity. 'What was particularly deceitful and spiteful about what you did was you pretended you were collecting for a child who suffered from cerebral palsy, and we all know what a horrendous affliction that is, in order to pull the heart strings of the people that were targeted.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:07 EST, 5 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:08 EST, 5 February 2013 . Former Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. resigned  in November following a multi-month medical leave to treat his bipolar disorder and remains at the center of a federal investigation into alleged misuse of campaign funds. Now his wife Sandi Jackson, who held a local government position in their hometown of Chicago, is also the focus of her own federal investigation. Mrs Jackson had always been a key focus of the investigation into her husbands funds- which were reportedly used to help furnish their homes in both Washington D.C. and Chicago as well as Mr Jackson's purchase of a $40,000 Rolex for a female friend. Partners: Jesse Jackson Jr is long-thought to be under federal investigation, but today it was revealed that his wife Sandi (left) is also the subject of her own investigation into misuse of his campaign funds . But now, the Chicago Sun Times reports that she is under her own degree of scrutiny as there is now an independent investigation into Sandi Jackson. According to news reports citing unnamed sources, Jesse Jackson Jr. was also being investigated by the FBI over possible misuse of campaign money and a Wall Street Journal report said the investigation had expanded to include Sandi Jackson. Today's report is the first to explicitly state that investigators have opened a separate case on she alone. Between 2001 and 2012, Sandi Jackson's consulting firm, J. Donatella & Associates, received about $472,000 from her husband's campaign. The biggest payments came in the 2011-12 campaign finance cycle, at $120,000 as of October 31, and the 2009-10 cycle, at $116,000, according to the website OpenSecrets.org, which compiles campaign financial data. The Federal Election Commission has declared the practice of lawmakers employing relatives as legal for campaign committees. Resigned: Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., seen in March, announced his registration in late November- after being re-elected to office- citing his health problems. Sandi, seen left, resigned from her local government post three weeks ago . Sandi Jackson's campaign, Friends of Sandi Jackson, received $242,012 from her husband's campaign, according to OpenSecrets. This news comes nearly three weeks after Mrs Jackson resigned from her position as an alderman- an member of the Chicago City Council- citing 'very painful family health issues'. In her letter of resignation, Sandi Jackson said she decided that her constituents and colleagues 'deserve a partner who can commit all of their energies to the business of the people.' She has been splitting her time between Washington, D.C., where the family has a residence, and her Chicago home, according to reports. Re-elected: Jackson Jr. easily won re-election this month despite his only contact with voters having been a robocall since he was being treated for bipolar disorder out-of-state . High emotions: Jackson, Jr, seen embracing his father the Reverend Jesse Jackson at the 2000 Democratic National Convention, was described as too emotional to complete a public appearance announcing his resignation announcing . She has faced criticism from some constituents about her absences from council business, according to local media reports. 'It's not easy being an alderman, especially when you have the problem with your husband,' said Paul Green, a political science professor at Chicago's Roosevelt University. 'The long knives have been sharpened for her. This had to be a tremendous mental pressure on her and that should relieve her of some of that.' Sandi Jackson was elected to her alderman seat on Chicago's South Side in February 2007.","Former Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr left office in June 2011 for health treatment but did not resign until AFTER he was re-elected .

"By . Roz Lewis . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 9 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:31 EST, 9 February 2013 . Her hair is still a garish lilac, or ‘wisteria hue’, as she prefers it to be described. And the bejewelled cat’s-eye ‘face furniture’ is as unmistakable as her trademark greeting: ‘Hello Possums!’ Dame Edna Everage has been a fixture on television screens and the stage for more than 40 years, but now there has been a rather surprising change: there is somewhat less of her. She’s been on a diet – or at least her creator Barry Humphries has – and the result is dramatic. Humphries, 78, who says he attributes his longevity to a ‘lifelong aversion to exercise’, has shed 2st 5lb over nine months on the dieting programme Jenny Craig. Before and after: Barry Humphries, left, before the Jenny Craig diet and a slimline Dame Edna after . ‘I loathe exercise,’ Barry says, from his Melbourne home which he shares with fourth wife of 22 years, Lizzie Spender. ‘However, the weight has been creeping on for a few years now. It got to the point where I really didn’t like what I saw in the mirror and my increasing girth was causing all sorts of headaches for my tailor. I was also having to give expensive suits away to the Salvation Army as I just couldn’t get into them any more.’ After years of excusing himself his indulgences, Barry finally took his weight problem seriously last year. ‘I really didn’t want to, but my wife helped me with the decision to tackle my food intake. It was fortunate I was also offered the chance to become Jenny Craig’s ambassador, as their approach appealed to me. ‘I do not like the word diet, I do not like hardship. I have been in some health farms at various points in my life and have always run away in the evenings to go to a five-star restaurant and eat some decent food.’ He adds: ‘I didn’t feel ill due to the excess weight, but uncomfortable, and I was getting very tired and needing to have a lie down during the day. I easily got out of breath when walking. My blood pressure was high and a few years ago, I developed a hiatus hernia [in which part of the stomach pushes through the muscle of the diaphragm causing indigestion], which I took tablets for. I think it was because of my eating habits.’ Back in the days: Dame Edna Everage, before she lost two stone through a £10-a-day ready meal diet . Jenny Craig is basically a spoon-fed diet plan: once a month, the company delivers low-calorie ready meals that cover breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. Dieters are allowed to supplement this with fruit and vegetables. This is the ‘weight loss’ part of the programme, which for someone like Barry, who wanted to lose 33lb, may last three to four months. Customers pay about £10 a day, and once the desired weight loss is achieved, they are weaned off ready meals and encouraged to cook their own food while remaining on a healthy eating plan. This maintenance regime costs much less – dieters can continue with some ready meals and with a weekly counselling phone call, or just opt for a phone-call service (£11 per call). People in this age range who are losing weight for the first time must do it with medical supervision, says Prof Haslam. ‘For those with certain problems – such as kidney disease – being overweight is actually protective, something we call the obesity paradox,’ he explains. ‘Each case needs to be individually assessed.’ Even those with little or no associated health risks need a carefully balanced programme of nutritional and activity advice. Another problem facing the  over-70s dieter is sarcopenia,  the gradual loss of muscle mass due to age. ‘It is vital to make an effort to improve muscle mass, through exercise and increased protein intake,’ says Haslam. Set up in the early Eighties by husband-and-wife team Jenny and Sydney Craig, it’s been an international success, with more than five million members worldwide over the past 25 years. Past celebrity patrons include Kirstie Alley and Cheryl Baker – though they are no longer on the programme and admit it didn’t work for them in the long term, having put the majority of the weight they lost back on. Spice Girl Mel B is a current patron. After Humphries decided to take action, a daily programme of food intake that varied between 1,200 and 1,500 calories was organised. A typical day’s diet consists of about 60 per cent carbs, 20 per cent protein and 20 per cent fat. He was perhaps a tougher challenge than the Jenny team first anticipated. After starting in late March, he was expected to hit his target by July. This was pushed back to September because he hadn’t lost the weight, then again to December, when he finally hit the target, almost five months behind schedule. The Jenny counsellor called him daily – a service not normally offered to members. Humphries said: ‘I needed that. I have a big weakness for cheese and desserts, so I had to train myself to have much smaller portions.’ So, does Jenny Craig work? A 2010 study showed that it did help dieters lose weight, but the research was criticised as participants were invited to take part and didn’t pay for the programme. Humphries wants to show people of his generation they are not too old to bother with dieting. Professor David Haslam, of the National Obesity Forum, says: ‘Weight peaks at 70 years on average. Anyone in this age range, if they are obese, has an increased risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, joint problems and a lower quality of life in general.’ Losing weight will lower those risks significantly. Humphries managed to get his BMI down from 29.5 to just under 25. He is now 13st 5lb – scraping into the healthy range for his 6ft height, with a BMI of 24.9. However, he still relies on the ready meals at times. ‘If I travel, I take Jenny Craig meals with me. Last year I started my farewell tour, Eat, Pray, Laugh, in Australia, which I am bringing to the UK this October, and as the weight dropped off my energy levels definitely improved. ‘This has been the easiest, most relaxed way of changing your lifestyle that I can imagine. Having your meals organised for you really does take the strain out of depriving yourself of certain pleasures.’ He adds: ‘I feel so much better in myself. I have gone down three dress sizes, and I feel like a new man.’ Or, in his case, a new Dame.","'Exercise hating' Barry Humphries dropped two stone and five pounds .

James Purnell, who served as both Culture and Work and Pensions Secretary in Gordon Brown's Cabinet, has been appointed as the BBC's strategy chief . The appointment of a former Labour cabinet minister to a senior BBC job on a salary of almost £300,000 a year last night re-ignited concerns over the corporation’s links with the Left. James Purnell, who served as both Culture and Work and Pensions Secretary under Gordon Brown, has been handed the job as the corporation’s strategy chief. MPs claimed it was ‘unprecedented’ to have someone with such a politically active past become a senior BBC executive, while others said having a ‘partisan political figure’ would do little to reassure people that the corporation is impartial. Even insiders admitted it did little to dispel the impression there was ‘a revolving door between the Left and the BBC’. Eyebrows were also raised over the fact that there was no open recruitment process for Mr Purnell’s job. Sources at the BBC claimed there was no point in such a costly exercise because he was viewed as the ideal candidate for the newly-created job. It is understood no fees were paid for recruitment consultants. Mr Purnell will receive £295,000 to be the corporation’s director of strategy and digital when he joins next month. He will be a key figure in the BBC’s charter renewal negotiations over the next few years, but has also been given a role which puts him in charge of communications, policy, public affairs, marketing and audiences. It will make him one of the corporation’s best paid and most powerful executives. Mr Purnell quit Parliament in 2010 and is currently a senior producer at production company Rare Day as well as an adviser to the Boston Consulting Group. MPs warned he would have to make it clear he had put his ‘Labour affiliations’ well behind him. Conor Burns, Tory MP for Bournemouth West, who sits on the culture, media and sport select committee, said he had an ‘intrinsic nervousness’ about the appointment. He said: ‘There is sometimes an agenda within the BBC that is Left-leaning. James Purnell is to return to the BBC under incoming director general Tony Hall, pictured . 'The BBC does not just need to be impartial, it needs to be seen to be impartial, and it is hard to see how it is impartial when it has just appointed a former Labour cabinet minister to head up its public affairs programme.’ John Whittingdale, chairman of the committee, added: ‘I recognise that James Purnell is a bright guy with a lot of experience. ‘But it is unprecedented to have someone in a management role that has been quite as politically active and he will have to make it clear he has left his Labour affiliations behind him.’ Another member of the committee, Tory Philip Davies, described the move as ‘provocative’ and ‘totally unacceptable’ in the light of previous accusations of Left-wing bias against the BBC. One senior BBC boss said: ‘He is probably very capable. But having a former secretary of state working on charter renewal is a bit weird.’ They added that his appointment would add to the impression that there was a ‘revolving door between the Left and the BBC’. Insiders admitted that Mr Purnell's appointment did little to dispel the impression there was 'a revolving door between the Left and the BBC' Yesterday the corporation said that Mr Purnell had stepped down from his membership of the Labour Party. He has resigned as chairman of a left-of-centre think tank. Others pointed out that the BBC Trust’s chairman, Lord Patten, is a former Tory Cabinet Minister and Conservative Party chairman. Mr Purnell previously worked at the BBC as head of corporate planning from 1995 to 1997 under former director general Lord Birt. He said: ‘I’m really excited to be coming back to the BBC. Over the last couple of years, producing and developing programmes has rekindled my passion for the career I had before politics.’ A member of the board of the British Film Institute and the Royal National Theatre, he also wrote on Twitter: ‘I feel very lucky to be going back. It’s a special and important place.’ The BBC said that his deal would not represent an increase to the senior management pay bill. Savings are likely to be made as other executives lose their jobs in the restructure which accompanies Mr Purnell’s appointment. A spokesman said: ‘It is perfectly possible for an individual to work at the BBC without allowing their personal views to impact on their job and the BBC has strong guidelines on potential conflicts of interest that may be caused by political activity.’","Ex-Culture and Work and Pensions Secretary resigns party membership .

Indian villagers beat a leopard and hanged it from a tree after the beast savaged three people in the state of Assam. These photos were taken yesterday in the village of Choriyakhola Bisiondoi in the Golokgunj area, which is rife with the ferocious animals. The leopard entered the house of Haren Roy and attacked him and two other family members. Villagers attacked and hanged a leopard from a tree after it attacked and seriously injured three people in their home . Leopard attacks on humans are on the rise in the tea-growing area, and villagers are starting to seek revenge . The villagers ran to Mr Roy's house as family members raised the alarm. The leopard escaped but was chased and later killed by the mob, according to the Business Standard of India. Mr Roy, Gopal Roy and Jatan Roy were . admitted to Dhubri Civil Hospital, where they are said to be in a . critical condition. One man, believed to be Mr Roy, suffered serious . facial injuries. The villagers claimed that they had informed the forest department but its personnel took too long to get to the site and they had no other choice but to kill the leopard to prevent further attacks by the animal. Assam has seen a rise in animal attacks on people over the past few years, and the people who once revered the animals have started to kill them out of anger and fear. There are no official statistics on the death of leopards at the hands of human beings, but unofficial reports put the figure at around 70 between 2005 and 2011, according to The Indian Express. The highest number of leopards killed was in 2008, with Aaranyak, a leading wildlife NGO putting the toll that year at 29. In 2011, seven leopards were killed in Dibrugarh alone. One of the victims of the leopard suffered serious facial injuries. He was in his home at the time of the attack . In March at least eight people were injured when two leopards in Kamrup attacked them in a field. Villagers killed one and the other escaped. 'Leopards are indeed under severe threat across the state. Increasing conflict between people and wild animals, more particularly leopards, has become a major problem, especially with a section of the people violently retaliating, causing injury and even death to the animals,' said SP Singh, state chief conservator of forests (wildlife). In 2012 the department mounted a media campaign to generate awareness against killing or causing harm to leopards. The authorities have asked people to immediately inform the forest department when they see a wild animal outside a sanctuary or national park instead of trying to attack it.","The animal had savaged three people in their home in Assam, India .

Mr Nolan, who worked in the catering industry, fell ill on January 2.  He complained of severe headaches, dehydration and aversion to light as his condition worsened. The next day, his joints had become swollen and painful, so much so that he was unable to get dressed or brush his teeth. Ms Streeter, 29, sent him to Glan .

Mr Cargill ripped up his Do Not Resuscitate Order after speaking to his family and lawyer . A cancer patient said he was left feeling terrified after a hospital doctor issued him with a Do Not Resuscitate order. Alan Cargill was being treated for cancer of the inner chest wall and a blood clot at the  University Hospital of North Durham. During his stay a doctor approached him and told him he wouldn't be revived if he took a turn for the worse. The 69-year-old said: 'I had reacted badly to chemotherapy and I also had a blood clot so they admitted me to hospital. 'This doctor came to see me and informed me that I wouldn't be brought around again if anything happened. I would just be left.' Mr Cargill from Durham, said the doctor gave him a form prominently marked Do Not Resuscitate and walked away. The former haulage boss said the experience had really frightened him. He said: 'He terrified me, to be truthful. It is bad craic for something like that to happen when you are that ill. 'It is stamped all over with Do Not Resuscitate. Apparently, you are supposed to carry it round with you.' Mr Cargill was also concerned that the matter was raised with him without any other member of his family being present. A few days later Mr Cargill was discharged and allowed home where he discussed the Do Not Resuscitate order with his family. He was so concerned that Mr Cargill decided to raise the matter with his solicitor. He said: 'I talked to my solicitor and asked him, could they do that? He told me they can't.' After taking legal advice Mr Cargill contacted the hospital, confirmed that he did not wish the order to apply to him and then tore up the document. Despite the shock of being issued with a Do Not Resuscitate order, Mr Cargill has nothing but praise for hospital staff. 'I have no complaints about the medical care. It couldn't have been better.' The widowed grandfather, who has two grown-up daughters, has decided not to have any more treatment for his cancer for the time being. But last night he joked: 'I have every intention of living as long as possible. I have just bought a new car!' The University Hospital of North Durham where the order was issued . Do Not Resuscitate, or DNR orders are . increasingly being used in the NHS when it is thought that the benefits . of resuscitation are outweighed by the negative effects. The presence of a DNR order on a patients file means that medical staff are not required to resuscitate a patient if their heart stops or if they stop breathing. Katherine Murphy, Chief Executive of The Patients Association, said: 'The use of DNR orders is understandably a sensitive and deeply distressing issue. 'Sadly, there have been far too many cases where healthcare professionals have failed to facilitate proper conversations with relatives and patients about how, when and why a DNR order may be used. 'Hospitals need to look carefully at their procedures to ensure there are open discussions around end of life care involving both patients and relatives.' Guidelines from the British Medical Association state that DNR orders should only be issued after discussion with patients or their family. A spokesman for County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We are sorry to hear about this complaint, and would welcome contact via the Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALs), and the opportunity to meet with the complainant to discuss their concerns. 'Resuscitation decision making is a complex process. County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust has a comprehensive policy that describes the process that we expect staff to follow when supporting patients and their families during this difficult time. This policy is based upon regional best practice.'","Alan Cargill, 69, was being treated for cancer and a blood clot at the University Hospital of North Durham .

When Deryn Blackwell was diagnosed with leukaemia, his parents thought things couldn't get any worse. But two years into his cancer battle, doctors discovered the brave boy had developed another deadly form of the disease - and he was the only person in the world to suffer from both conditions. The 13-year-old's mother Callie, 32, said: 'My son is fighting TWO cancers - leukaemia . and Langerhans Cell Sarcoma. 'He is truly just one in seven billion all over the world.' It has been a rollercoaster ride for the family from Watton, Norfolk. The youngster was first diagnosed with leukaemia in July 2010 after his glands swelled and he lost his appetite. Then three months into his treatment, he suffered appendicitis. He was . given just a 20 per cent chance of recovery from the operation because he had . so few white blood cells and his platelets were so low. Thankfully, surgery was a success and by May 2011 he was in remission. He returned to school that September and his parents started to hope that they were out of the woods. By August 2012, Deryn faced just one more year of treatment, when he started complaining about pain in his tonsils. He was seen by a specialist who decided to remove them straight away. 'The ENT surgeon told me that Deryn’s tonsils were very large, very hard, . almost rock-like and extremely difficult the remove. He was . so shocked by the condition of his tonsils that he immediately sent them . away for analysis,' Mrs Blackwell wrote on her blog. Tests revealed Deryn not only had leukaemia, he had now also developed a type of cancer called Langerhans Cell . Sarcoma. The cancer is so rare that there are thought to be just four other sufferers worldwide. Sarcomas are a deadly group of cancers which strike the connective tissues, including fat, muscle, cartilage and bone. The world's top oncology consultants have now got together to decide on the best course of treatment for Deryn as they bid to tackle a health case which is unique and unprecedented. As a result, Deryn will head to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children for a vital life-saving bone marrow transplant. While preparing for the make-or-break journey, Callie and her husband Simon, 33, praised their son's incredible bravery and inner strength as he faces months away from home. Our brave boy: Simon and Callie are taking Deryn to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children for a vital life-saving bone marrow transplant . Deryn will be totally isolated from the outside world for most of the time as he is stripped of his immune system and surgeons blast him with as much radiotherapy as his young body can take. 'We are prepared to stay at least three months in Bristol with Deryn,' said Mrs Blackwell, who also has a younger son, Dylan, eight. 'But that is if it is straightforward and nothing is ever straightforward with Deryn. 'The sarcoma cancer is so rare that they have never even treated it before but they have decided this is the best course of treatment. 'It is called an R3 protocol, which involves 12 days of conditioning, total body radiotherapy and targeted radiotherapy to his throat - which is where they found the tumours originally.' Deryn is set to have his crucial bone marrow transplant on March 1 and he will then be put in total isolation for between three and seven months. All being well, the teenager will then be transferred to Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, for at least a further month of intensive treatment and recovery care. The pupil will then need to have all his childhood jabs again as he confronts his biggest challenge to date. Courage: Deryn Blackwell enjoys a special day out with the Marines . Deryn with his mother Callie. He is top of his class at school and wants to be a doctor . His father said: 'He doesn't want to go because he has just been in hospital for three months having intensive chemotherapy and only been home for two weeks. 'He will have to go back into that routine again but he is so positive at the same time and wants to get it over with, to get fixed and get back to school. 'Deryn is so bright - he's top of the class in everything he does and he wants to be a doctor.' Friends and family have rallied around to help pay for travel costs and allow Deryn's parents to take time off work to care for him. The family's foundation, DoEveRYthiNg, has now raised more than £7,000. Mr and Mrs Blackwell hope to register it as a charity when Deryn is well again to help other children who have cancer relapses. Mr Blackwell said: 'Deryn is 100 per cent certain that he will come through this very tough time. 'But whatever happens he will have to have blood tests for the rest of his life and there are other risks such as cataracts and infertility. 'But the way Deryn deals with his own mortality is incredible and it helps everyone else deal with it, too. 'He believes that once this year is over he has the rest of his life to do what he wants and we are all totally behind him.'","Deryn Blackwell was diagnosed with leukaemia when he was 10 .

Teenagers with ADHD are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, with cannabis a particular problem . Teenagers with the hyperactivity disorder ADHD are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, new research has found. A study discovered contrary to previous findings current medications for the condition do not counter the risk for substance abuse among adolescents. Scientists believed that a side effect of taking the prescribed medicines lowered the chance of teenagers drinking or taking drugs. But new research claims there is a 'significantly higher prevalence' of alcoholism and cannabis smoking among young ADHD sufferers. They also claim that cigarette smoking was nine per cent higher in ADHD teens than youths did not have it. Professor Brooke Molina, from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, led the study of 600 children over an eight year period. The aim was to discover if children with ADHD have an increased risk of substance use and abuse or dependence in adolescence. The researchers found that when the subjects were an average of 15 years-old, 35 per cent admitted using one or more substances, compared with 20 per cent of non-ADHD teens. By the age of 17, cannabis use was 'particularly problematic', with 13 per cent hooked compared to three per cent of teenagers without the condition. Daily smoking was 'very high' at 17 per cent which, claims Professor Molina, is much higher than the U.S. national average. But alcohol abuse was high in both groups suggesting that underage drinking was a common occurrence for teenagers in general. But alcohol abuse was high among all teenagers in the study, suggesting underage drinking is a common occurrence for teenagers in general . Professor Molina said: 'This study underscores the significance of the substance abuse risk for both boys and girls with childhood ADHD. 'These findings also are the strongest test to date of the association between medication for ADHD and teenage substance abuse.' At least two per cent of children in the . UK are thought to have ADHD and diagnosis usually occurs between the . ages of three and seven. Symptoms include a short attention span, restlessness or constant fidgeting and being easily distracted. In contrast to current thinking, Professor Molina found that substance abuse rates were no different in children being treated with medication for ADHD than those who were not. That has prompted a call for a new approach to substance abuse prevention and treatment methods for boys and girls with ADHD. Professor Molina added: 'We are working hard to understand the reasons why children with ADHD have increased risk of drug abuse. 'Our hypotheses, partly supported by our research and that of others, is that impulsive decision making, poor school performance, and difficulty making healthy friendships all contribute. 'Some of this is biologically driven because we know that ADHD runs in families. However, similar to managing high blood pressure or obesity, there are non-medical things we can do to decrease the risk of a bad outcome.'","New study disproves previous theory that medication can prevent teenagers abusing drink and drugs .

All-inclusive: The Ministry of Defence spent a total of £111million in ¿Continuity of Education Allowance¿, some £89.4million of which was on boarding school fees for UK-based personnel . Thousands of military officers and civil servants have their children’s boarding school fees paid by the taxpayer even though they are based in the UK. Almost £100million of state money went last year towards educating children at private schools, including Fettes, Winchester, Roedean and Marlborough, even though their parents are not overseas. In total, the Government spends around £130million a year on school fees. But the latest figures show that only around a quarter of that is for parents based overseas. The Ministry of Defence spent a total of £111million in ‘Continuity of Education Allowance’ for 8,400 service children across 440 schools, 35 of which are state boarding schools. More than three-quarters of this – some £89.4million – was on boarding school fees for UK-based personnel. They receive the money to take into account the fact they may be moved around Britain at short notice – a serviceman could be in Somerset one year, and Scotland the next. At the Foreign Office, £15million is spent on boarding school fees for 456 staff at an average of £33,800. More than half is for UK-based staff. The fees are designed for civil servants posted overseas but continue to be paid on the official’s return if their child has started a GCSE or A-level course. It means the taxpayer can pay the school fees for up to two years after the end of a posting. Prestige: Fess were paid for children to attend some of the UK's most prestigious private schools including Fettes and Winchester College (pictured) The Department for International . Development, which funnels taxpayers money abroad in aid projects,  paid . £1million in school fees for 42 civil servants, including £141,000 to . parents who are in Britain. The figures were released following a parliamentary question by Labour Treasury spokesman Rachel Reeves. Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘This is an expensive perk that shouldn’t apply to those now based in the UK.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘Service personnel should not be disadvantaged because of their duty but we are determined CEA should go only to those who really need it. Expense: The Government spends around £130million a year on school fees, sending to children to top school, such as Roedean Independent School in Brighton (pictured) 'That is why we tightened the criteria last year which has resulted in a saving of £10million on the previous year.’ Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt said: ‘Members of the diplomatic service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world, sometimes at very short notice. We provide financial support to all diplomatic staff, irrespective of grade, who serve overseas.’ Aid minister Alan Duncan said: ‘The conditions of employment in DfID are set to recruit, motivate and retain staff who are skilled.’","MoD spent £111m on 'Continuity of Education Allowance' in the last year .

Samantha Reckis, who was only seven years old when she took the children’s ibuprofen to combat a fever, suffered a rare but potentially fatal side effect that caused her to go blind and 90 percent of her skin to fall off. In total, the Plymouth, Massachusetts Superior Court jury ruled that Ms Reckis and her parents should be awarded at total of $109million by Johnson & Johnson and its subsidy McNeil-PPC Inc, including interest. Horrific: Samantha Reckis was only seven years old when she took children's ibuprofen to combat a fever and suffered a rare side effect that caused her to go blind and 90 percent of her skin to fall off . Settlement: Samantha Reckis, pictured before her horrific health scare, lost 90 percent of her skin, as well as her vision; a jury today awarded her $50million . The jury found that Ms Reckis developed Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis after taking the Children’s Motrin when she was seven. Windfall: The jury awarded Richard Reckis, Samantha's father, $6.5million, and another $6.5million to her mother . The condition, while rare, is a severe allergic reaction to medications such as barbiturates, penicillins, and sulphonamides, and causes the top layer of skin – the epidermis- to detach from the lower layers. As many as 40 percent of people diagnosed with the illness die of complications from infection. According to news reports at the time, Ms Reckis had to undergo 19 surgeries at the time of the 2003 accident. Family attorney Bradley Henry told the Boston Globe that Ms Reckis’ condition was excruciating. ‘It’s like having your skin burned off of you,’ he told the paper. ‘Imagine your worst sunburn times 1,000. It’s an absolutely devastating condition.’ He also said that the bottle of Children’s Motrin only had a small technical warning on the bottle that didn’t warn consumers of potential adverse side-effects.

The company said in a statement: ‘Children’s Motrin (ibuprofen), when used as directed, is a safe and effective treatment option for minor aches and pains and fever and we believe the medicine is labelled appropriately.’ Elisabeth Gravel, who was married to Ms Reckis’ father, Richard, from the late 1970s until the mid-80s told MailOnline that the massive settlement announcement came as quite a shock for her. She had one daughter, Meaghan, with him; the girls are half-sisters. ‘I’m finding this to be a difficult situation,’ she said, speaking to MailOnline from her home in Plymouth. ‘My daughter was very involved with Samantha.’ Ms Gravel, 59, said that she worries about how Mr Reckis, who is listed on his Facebook profile as self-employed, will handle the landfall sum. Samantha Reckis was awarded $50million, while both parents were awarded $6.5million by the jury, the Globe reported. But the trial judge still must review the sums. If the judge rules in their favor, the family could get up to $109million, including interest. ‘I’m not so sure that Richard is going to allocate his portion of the funds for her,’ Ms Gravel told MailOnline. Politics aside, Ms Gravel said that Ms Reckis’ brush with death has deeply impacted the family. ‘She was a nice child, she was cute. When this occurred, it was devastating,’ she said. ‘We saw (Samantha) being brought into the hospital wrapped in plastic because all of her body was burned.

An ex-police officer who killed his former daughter-in-law and another woman at a Delaware courthouse before committing suicide had his wife and son help him in the murder plot, according to a newly released affidavit. Monday's killings were the culmination of a bitter, years-long custody battle involving the slain woman, Christine Belford, and the gunman's son. Texas authorities said in the affidavit that the shooter, Thomas Matusiewicz, his wife and his son were all suspected of ‘intentionally and knowingly participating in a murder.’ Gunman: Thomas Matusiewicz, who allegedly fatally shot his former daughter-in-law and her friend in Wilmington, Del., plays with his granddaughters . Matusiewicz had previously complained that his family wasn't getting justice in a lawsuit Miss Belford filed against them over the kidnapping of the pair's three daughters. Matusiewicz complained in an August 2011 letter to a Delaware judge that he and his family had no money to defend themselves in the lawsuit Christine Belford filed as her ex-husband, David Matusiewicz, awaited sentencing for taking the girls to Central America. Family plot: An affidavit has revealed that Matusiewicz allegedly carried out the courthouse slayings with the help of his wife and son . ‘We've lost or spent over a million dollars trying to get our grand-daughters to safety and now THERE IS NO MONEY LEFT AND THEY ARE STILL IN CUSTODY OF THEIR MOTHER (who has been in the care of someone in the mental health profession for over 20 years)!,’ Thomas and his wife, Lenore Matusiewicz, wrote in boldface letters. ‘Is it true as they say, you only get the amount of justice you can afford?’ they added. ‘Well, I guess we aren't going to be getting any.’ Delaware State Police said Mr Matusiewicz, 68, walked into the lobby of the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington on Monday and shot and killed Belford, 39, and her friend Laura Mulford, 47, before taking his own life. According to an affidavit filed by Texas authorities to search Thomas Matusiewicz's home in Edcouch, Texas, he was carrying handwritten death certificates for Belford and Timothy Hitchings, an attorney representing her in the divorce and custody battle, when he entered the Delaware courthouse. Law enforcement officials in Texas found eight guns found inside the Matusiewicz home and in a recreational vehicle on the property, and five more guns at a storage unit in Donna, Texas. Investigators said record checks on all the weapons came back clear. Thomas Matusiewicz once worked as a police officer in Vineland, New Jersey. Authorities also seized several boxes and jars of ammunition, letters, court documents, Veterans Affairs documents for Thomas Matusiewicz, who served in the Navy, and a book entitled ‘Kill All the Lawyers.’ Hitchings said in an email that he had no firsthand information about being targeted. ‘It's still being investigated,’ he said. ‘I will say that Thomas Matusiewicz likely resented my representing Christine.’ Murdered: Christine Belford, center, was killed when her ex-husband's father opened fire in a Wilmington, Delaware, courthouse. Her ex-husband abducted the couple's three daughters in 2007 . Tragedy: Matusiewicz opened fire in the lobby of the courthouse, before he had to pass through metal detectors. He shot four people, two of them fatally . Victims: Laura Elizabeth 'Beth' Mulford (right) had accompanied her friend Belford (left) to court for a child support hearing. Both women were shot dead by the father of Belford's ex-husband . Neither David Matusiewicz nor his . mother has been arrested in connection with the shooting, but David . Matusiewicz is being detained by federal authorities who say he has . violated the terms of his probation. Authorities . allege in court documents that he failed to disclose that he spent the . night before the shooting at a home in Elkton, Maryland, and that he has . not paid restitution and child support as ordered. The . Delaware shooting was the culmination of years of acrimony in a bitter . divorce and custody battle. At the heart of the dispute were the . daughters of Belford and David Matusiewicz, now ages 7, 9 and 10. David . Matusiewicz pleaded guilty in 2009 to federal fraud and kidnapping . charges after fleeing to Nicaragua in a motor home with his mother and . the three girls. David . Matusiewicz, who was released from prison last year, kidnapped the girls . after telling Belford they were going to Disney World for two weeks. The 2007 kidnapping of . Matusiewicz's daughters became national news and was featured on programs like . 'America's Most Wanted.' The . two were divorced and sharing custody at the time. Prosecutors say he . forged his wife's signature to obtain nearly $250,000 from a Delaware . bank, then sent the money to his parents' bank account and had his . father transfer the money to a Bank of New Zealand account. Hidalgo County sheriff's investigators enter the home of Thomas Matusiewicz while serving a warrant north of Edcouch-Elsa, Texas . Arsenal: Officials found eight guns found inside the Matusiewicz home and in this trailer on the property, and five more guns at a storage unit in Donna, Texas . Belford . sued her former husband, his parents and Gonzalez in 2009, claiming . they worked together to carry out the kidnapping. She sought . compensation for ‘medical, therapeutic, counseling, travel and other . expenses.’ Miss Belford dropped the lawsuit in December 2011 after Thomas and Lenore Matusiewicz filed for bankruptcy protection in Texas. ‘It . became obvious that it was not going to be collectable,’ said Belford's . attorney, James Woods. ‘I had no doubt she would win, and probably a . very significant amount of money, for that torture they put her . through.’ Woods said that . after Belford dropped the lawsuit, Thomas Matusiewicz sent him two thick . packages of documents containing ‘all kinds of scandalous and . ridiculous allegations’ that Christine was abusing the children and was . an unfit mother. The allegations were never substantiated, Belford was . never charged and she was given full custody of the girls. Released: The dead woman's husband was David T. Matusiewicz, who served four years in federal prison and was released in April . ‘It was obvious that there was so much venom they had directed toward Christine that it was almost palpable,’ Woods said. Lenore . Matusiewicz made similar allegations in a handwritten letter she . addressed to Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden in January 2011. She . was on probation at the time after serving more than a year in Delaware . state prison for endangering the welfare of her three granddaughters . related to the kidnapping. She said her son was ‘paying the price for trying to protect his children....’ A . federal judge who sentenced David Matusiewicz to prison noted that he . never expressed any concern that his ex-wife was abusing their children . until after he had been arrested. A . state judge who denied a motion by Lenore Matusiewicz to modify her . prison sentence in 2010 also expressed skepticism about the abuse . claims. ‘Sadly, even if all . the allegations of the defendant and her son are true, their decisions . only seemed to harm the children more,’ the judge wrote. The bitter family feud had come to ahead on Monday while Belford and her friend Laura Elizabeth 'Beth' Mulford were at the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware, for a child support hearing against Ms Belford's ex-husband, David Matusiewcz, a once promising optometrist. David Matusiewicz was in the lobby of the courthouse when his father opened fire with a .45-caliber pistol and shot dead Ms Belford and Ms Mulford. Thomas Matusiewicz also shot two Capitol police guards in the chest before he was killed in an exchange of fire with the officers. The officers were saved by their bulletproof vests and sustained only minor injuries. Ms Belford's neighbors say she was terrified of her ex-husband's family. They say she installed cameras and a security system at her house and took other steps to protect her children. Deployed: Heavily-armed SWAT officers fanned out around the courthouse to ensure there were no other shooters . Secured: The New Castle County Courthouse has rows of metal detectors and up to ten security guards. However, the gunmen opened fire in a lobby while people were waiting to pass through security . 'She had all the windows changed with . special locks. She had cameras around the house. She had two huge dogs. She didn’t know whether she should get a gun. Her house is like Fort . Knox, so I thought she was safe,' neighbor Lois Dawson told the . News-Journal. Witnesses said Thomas Matusiewicz's . rampage had deadly efficiency. He stepped off the elevated leading from . the parking garage to the lobby of the courthouse and immediately pulled . out a pistol and opened fire on Ms Belford and Ms Mulford.

Held: Violin teacher Wen Zhou Li who came to Britain on the invitation of Yehudi Menuhin has been arrested by detectives investigating sex abuse at Chetham¿s School of Music in the 1970s and 80s . A violin teacher who came to Britain on the invitation of Yehudi Menuhin has been arrested by detectives investigating sex abuse at Chetham’s School of Music in the 1970s and 80s. Professor Wen Zhou Li, who has tutored some of the country’s brightest musical talents over the past 25 years, was last night being held on suspicion of rape. The 57-year-old is the first teacher to be arrested following the conviction of Michael Brewer for indecently assaulting Frances Andrade, who committed suicide halfway through the trial. Police have now received more than 20 allegations of sexual abuse from former Chetham’s pupils. They are thought to relate to six teachers. One ex-student revealed she was shocked by the arrest. She said: ‘Violin teachers have to have physical contact, but there was never anything inappropriate.’ Li, originally from China, now a . professor at the Royal Northern College of Music but a former teacher at . Chetham's, was arrested yesterday morning on suspicion of rape. A spokesman for the RNCM said: 'We can confirm that Wen Zhou Li has been suspended. We are unable to comment further.' Greater Manchester Police Chief Supt . Russ Jackson said: ‘This investigation is looking into more than 20 . individual reports of sexual offences reported by former pupils at the . school. ‘In relation to . allegations made, we have today arrested a 57-year-old man from Cheshire . on suspicion of committing rape. This also relates to historic offences . and he will be interviewed later. Probe: A man was arrested by police today investigating historical sex abuse at Chetham's School of Music . ‘Various names have been mentioned in the press of people involved in offences. Clearly we will use this information, comparing it against allegations made. ‘If any of those publicly named wish to speak to police directly now, we will of course interview them to take their account. In the meantime we will continue to interview witnesses and victims. ‘These are historic offences which involved a relatively small number of teachers. We are working closely with victims and witnesses and will have specially trained officers to support them.’ Separately, an earlier version of this article included a report of allegations in The Times newspaper that the Chairman of the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain had allowed Brewer to carry on working with children - despite fears being raised by Child Protection Services. National Youth Choirs of Great Britain have since contacted us to say that, contrary to what was suggested by The Times it sought the advice of the police and child protection officers as soon as allegations were made about Brewer. A statement issued by the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain says it 'acted upon discussions putting in place measures to ensure the protection of children under its' care.  At no point during or prior to the trial [of Mr Brewer] were any questions raised of the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain by the police or anyone else with regard to Mr Brewer's activities while in his role as Artistic Director of National Youth Choirs of Great Britain.  As soon as Mr Brewer was charged, he was immediately suspended by the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain and a new Director was appointed. The National Youth Choirs of Great Britain is not, however, in any way complacent, and, in light of recent events, it is reviewing its past policies and procedures to ensure that further improvements are implemented.  To this end, the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain has opened a dialogue with the NSPCC, who are offering support and guidance going forward. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Wen Zhou Li, 57, arrested by police investigating Chetham abuse .

"By . Joshua Gardner . PUBLISHED: . 09:54 EST, 3 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:07 EST, 3 February 2013 . A Super Bowl ad that was banned from Sunday night’s game can now be viewed by anyone online and the company behind it is reaping the benefits. SodaStream, which makes home water carbonators used to whip up homemade soda, directly challenged Coca-Cola and Pepsi in its commercial that was set to air in the fourth quarter. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . No go: CBS banned a Super Bowl ad by SodaStream because it negatively portrayed big advertisers Coke and Pepsi . An aghast CBS saw the ad as a challenge to two behemoth advertisers and promptly banned it. 'Because SodaStream is a direct competitor of the Big Soda brands that tend to be ubiquitous during the Super Bowl,' SodaStream told The Huffington Post, 'the rejection of one of the company's proposed ads, which takes aim at Big Soda, is perhaps not surprising.' PR stir: Sodastream, which makes at-home soda makers, maintains they did not intend to stir up trouble with the ad . The ad pits a Coke and a Pepsi delivery driver against each other in a duelling banjos moment that culminates in both drivers’ merchandise exploding as a man opts for Soda Stream, instead. Uncola: The Isreali company has experienced this before, when a UK ad was banned, leading to record profits . It was reported banned on Friday. This is not an unusual occurrence. The biggest night in football draws a massive viewership and seconds-long ads can cost millions. But SodaStream claims they didn’t intend for their ad to be cancelled, as other advertisers have been doing for years to win some cheap PR. Forced to rework the commercial for air during Super Bowl XLVII, the original spot has now gone viral on the internet and Soda Stream has been rewarded with a mountain of publicity nonetheless. Despite their claims to innocence in the matter, this a path the company has gone down before. An ad intended for UK viewers was banned by the company Clearcast in November 2012 for the exact same issue when the broadcaster claimed the spot ""denigrated other soft drinks."" SodaStream subsequently posted its largest ever stock market gains. Prior to that, the company received a cease and desist demand from Coca-Cola after placing displays made out of used water bottles and soda cans that portrayed the company as wasteful in South Africa and elsewhere. It remains unclear if the Isreali company is intentionally culling publicity from its advertising misbehaviour. However, SodaStream will certainly win at least a few fans as the banned Super Bowl ad gains millions of free views on Youtube.","SodaStream ad took aim at Coke and Pepsi .
